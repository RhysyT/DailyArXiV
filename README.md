# DailyArXiV
Creates daily HTML files of astro-ph and other fun parts of arXiv in a handy format : titles as links to the arXiv pages, with click-to-reveal abstracts to cut down on scrolling. LaTeX maths formatting inlcuded, but only if the authors have entered it correctly (does not attempt to reformat anything).
