Rubin Observatory, around spiral galaxy M61 (NGC 4303) in Virgo First Look imaging. The stream is narrow, radially-oriented in projection, and  50 kpc long. It has g-band surface brightness (SB) mu_g   28 AB mag arcsec^-2, color g-z   1.0, and stellar mass M_*   2x10^8 M_Sun. This dwarf galaxy interaction may have provoked the M61 starburst, and foreshadows the bounty of accretion features expected in the ten-year Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The dwarf stellar mass function in different environments and the lack of a generic missing dwarfs problem in ΛCDM</a><span class="id">[2510.24838]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We combine deep photometric data in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields with high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to explore two key questions: (1) how does the galaxy stellar mass function, particularly in the dwarf (Mstar &lt; 10^9.5 MSun ) regime, vary with environment, defined as distance from the large-scale structure (LSS) traced by nodes and filaments in the cosmic web? (2) is there a generic 'missing dwarfs' problem in LambdaCDM predictions when all environments - and not just satellites around Milky Way like galaxies - are considered? The depth of the observational data used here enables us to construct complete, unbiased samples of galaxies, down to Mstar   10^7 MSun and out to z   0.4. Strong environmental differences are found for the galaxy stellar mass function when considering distance from LSS. As we move closer to LSS, the dwarf mass function becomes progressively flatter and the knee of the mass function shifts to larger stellar masses, both of which result in a higher ratio of massive to dwarf galaxies. While the stellar mass functions from the three simulations (NewHorizon, TNG50 and FIREbox) considered here do not completely agree across the dwarf regime, there is no evidence of a generic missing dwarfs problem in the context of LambdaCDM, akin to the results of recent work that demonstrates that there is no missing satellites problem around Galactic analogues.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Binary Ballet: Mapping Local Expansion Around M81 &amp; M82</a><span class="id">[2510.24840]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study of the M81 complex and its Hubble flow delivers new and improved Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)-based distances for nine member galaxies, yielding a total of 58 galaxies with high-precision TRGB distances. With those, we perform a systematic analysis of the group's dynamics in the core and its embedding in the local cosmic environment. Our analysis confirms that the satellite galaxies of the M81 complex exhibit a flattened, planar distribution almost perpendicular to the supergalactic pole and thus aligned with a larger-scale filamentary structure in the Local Universe. We demonstrate that the properties of the group's barycentre are robustly constrained by the two brightest members, M81 and M82, and that correcting heliocentric velocities for the solar motion in the Local Group decreases the velocity dispersion of the group. Then applying minor and major infall models, we fit the local Hubble flow to constrain the Hubble Constant and the total mass of the M81 complex. The joint best-fit parameters from both models yield $H_0 = \left(63 \pm 6 \right)$ km/s/Mpc and total mass of $(2.28\pm 0.49) \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. We thus arrive at an increased mass estimate compared to prior work but reach a higher consistency with virial, $(2.74 \pm 0.36)\times 10^{12}\,M_\odot$, and projected-mass estimates, $(3.11 \pm 0.69)\times 10^{12} M_\odot$. Moreover, our $H_0$ estimate shows an agreement with Planck, consistent with other TRGB-based Local-Universe inferences of $H_0$ and still within a 2-$\sigma$ agreement with Cepheid-based Local-Universe probes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24849" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Proper Motion of Draco II with HST using Multiple Reference Frames and Methodologies</a><span class="id">[2510.24849]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present proper motion (PM) measurements for Draco II, an ultra-faint dwarf satellite of the Milky Way. These PMs are measured using two epochs of Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS) imaging separated by a 7 year time baseline. Measuring PMs of low-luminosity systems is difficult due to the low number of member stars, requiring a precise inertial reference frame. We construct reference frames using three different sets of external sources: 1) stars with Gaia DR3 data, 2) stationary background galaxies, and 3) a combination of the two. We show that all three reference frames give consistent PM results. We find that for this sparse, low-luminosity regime including background galaxies into the reference frame improves our measurement by up to $\sim2\times$ versus using only Gaia astrometric data. Using 301 background galaxies as a reference frame, we find that Draco II's systemic PM is $(\mu_{\alpha}^*, \mu_{\delta}) = (1.043\pm0.029, 0.879\pm0.028)$ mas/yr, which is the most precise measurement of the three we present in this paper.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24858" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PEARLS: NuSTAR and XMM-Newton Extragalactic Survey of the JWST North Ecliptic Pole Time-domain Field III</a><span class="id">[2510.24858]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time-Domain Field (TDF) has been monitored by NuSTAR and XMM-Newton with a regular cadence for five years starting in 2019. The survey has accumulated 3.5Ms of NuSTAR exposure and 228 ks quasi-simultaneous XMM-Newton observations covering 0.31 deg^2. This paper presents the results from the most recent two-years' 2Ms NuSTAR and 166 ks XMM observations in NuSTAR cycles 8 and 9. These observations reached a 20%-area flux of 2.20 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 8-24 keV band. 75 NuSTAR sources and 274 XMM-Newton sources are detected at 99% reliability level. The logN-logS measured in cycles 8+9 are consistent with those measured in the previous cycle 5+6 NuSTAR NEP survey, but in a larger area (0.3 deg^2 compared with 0.19 deg^2). The slope of the cycles 8+9 8-24 keV logN-logS curve is flatter than other works ({\alpha}89 = 1.13 +/- 0.46), but is consistent with the Euclidean value of {\alpha} = 1.50. In addition, we found  36% of the NuSTAR sources to be heavily obscured (NH &gt;= 10^23 cm^-2). The Compton-thick (NH &gt;= 10^24 cm^-2) (CT-) AGN fraction is 9+18-8% in the NEP-TDF, which is consistent with the measurements in previous surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dissecting the mass quenching in TNG50: Galaxy size determines the quenching mode</a><span class="id">[2510.24886]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The diminishing of star formation is accompanied by size differentiating, as quiescent galaxies are more compact than star-forming galaxies at fixed stellar mass. In order to understand how galaxy quenching is related to galaxy sizes, we performed a demographic study of 46 massive quiescent central galaxies with stellar mass from $10^{10.5}\rm M_\odot$ to $10^{11}\rm M_\odot$ in the TNG50 simulation. We found that, in addition to the triggering active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, galaxy size is also a major determinant of the quenching process, as small and compact galaxies are immediately quenched by the kinetic AGN feedback, while galaxies with large sizes are still active until strangulated by the cutoff of new gas replenishment. Further spatially resolved inspection reveals that this short and intense kinetic AGN feedback can only suppress the star formation within 1-2 kpc, resulting in this size-dependent effect of quenching. We also identify a long-term effect of a few Gyr timescale that the gas inflow rate is progressively suppressed after triggering kinetic feedback, which appears to effectively quench large galaxies entirely. We conclude that kinetic AGN feedback has two key roles in quenching: a short-term, intense effect that quenches the central 2 kpc region, and a long-term effect that suppresses the gas inflow rate and further quenches the entire galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the structure of galactic disks with deep imaging</a><span class="id">[2510.24900]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thanks to new advances in astronomical imaging, we can now routinely explore disk galaxy profiles about two magnitudes deeper than the data available 20 years ago. In this regard, it is an opportune time to reevaluate the past classifications of different surface brightness Types. In this paper, we explore the stellar mass profiles of a sample of disk galaxies with similar stellar masses ($\sim$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) using IAC Stripe82 Legacy Project data. We find that Type I, II-CT, and III-d galaxies exhibit edges at surface brightnesses $\mu_g$(R$_{edge}$)$\sim$26.5 mag/arcsec$^2$ and surface mass densities $\Sigma$(R$_{edge}$)$\sim$0.5-1 M$_{\odot}$/pc$^2$. These surface brightnesses were outside the range of typical SDSS images and, therefore, unstudied. The present data suggest (although the statistics are inconclusive) that the main difference between the previous profile Types is the presence of either a more or a less intense bulge. Half of the Type II-CT galaxies are Sc, whereas half of the Type III-d galaxies are Sb. Finally, Type III-d galaxies have low mass surface density disks ($\Sigma$($\Delta$ $R_{\mathrm{exp}}$)$\sim$0.5 M$_{\odot}$/pc$^2$) and are bluer $(g-r)_0$=0.32$\pm$0.02 than the other Types ($(g-r)_0$=0.42$\pm$0.02 for Type I and II-CT), suggesting that their disks probably formed later in time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Where Galaxies Go to Die: The Environments of Massive Quiescent Galaxies at $3&lt;z&lt;5$</a><span class="id">[2510.25024]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>At low redshift, massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) are most frequently found in massive, rich galaxy clusters, but at high redshift the trend is less clear. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of the effects of environment on the formation and assembly of high-redshift MQGs. We identify 25 (5) $\log (M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}\geq10.5$ ($10.0\leq\log (M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}&lt;10.5$) spectroscopically-confirmed quiescent galaxies in the UDS and EGS fields at $3&lt;z&lt;5$ with NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from RUBIES and other public JWST NIRSpec programs. We measure the density contrast in these fields by applying a Monte Carlo Voronoi Tesselation density mapping technique to photometric and spectroscopic redshifts of $m_\mathrm{F444W}&lt;27.5$ sources. We robustly detect 12 massive overdense peaks with $\log (M_\mathrm{Peak}/\mathrm{M_\odot})\geq13$ and six extended massive protoclusters ($\log (M_\mathrm{Struct}/\mathrm{M_\odot})\geq13.85$). We observe that MQGs are preferentially found in these massive peaks and within these massive structures: $\approx50\%$ of MQGs are found in massive peaks, compared to $\approx20\%$ of massive star forming galaxies (MSFGs) and $\approx15\%$ of the overall spectroscopically-confirmed population. We also find an apparent dependence on both quiescent galaxy mass and environment, with $75\%$ of the most massive ($\log (M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}\geq10.75$) residing inside overdense peaks. We compare the star formation histories (SFHs) of the MQGs with the high-redshift galaxy stellar mass function from observations and simulated quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;5$, finding that the masses from the inferred MQG SFHs regularly exceed either observed or simulated high-redshift galaxies, which suggests indicates that mergers and ex-situ star formation play a key role in the mass assembly of MQGs in overdense environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical Studies on the Radio Afterglows in TDE: Bow Shock</a><span class="id">[2510.25033]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of radio afterglows or delayed radio flares in tidal disruption events (TDEs) is not fully understood. They could be generated either by a forward shock (FS) propagating into diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM), or a bow shock (BS) around a dense cloud, each of which is fundamentally different. To elucidate the distinctions between these two scenarios, we conducted two-fluid simulations incorporating relativistic electrons to investigate the spatial evolution of these electrons after being accelerated by shock. Based on their spatial distribution, we performed radiative transfer calculations to obtain the synchrotron spectra. In Paper I (Mou 2025), we reported the results for the FS scenario; in this article, we focus on the BS scenario. Compared to that from the FS, the radio emission from the BS exhibits a higher peak frequency, and its flux shows a much steeper rise and a more rapid decline. The radio flux from the BS also responds to fluctuations in the outflow. The combined effects of the BS and FS substantially alter radio spectra, causing significant deviations from the single-zone emission model, and in some cases producing double-peaked or flat-top features in spectra. This study highlights the importance of the BS, and inspires a novel approach for probing dense gas on sub-parsec scales in galactic nuclei by decomposing the BS radio spectrum to reveal the conditions of circumnuclear dense gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25035" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapid Brightening of 3I/ATLAS Ahead of Perihelion</a><span class="id">[2510.25035]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been approaching its 2025 October 29 perihelion while opposite the Sun from Earth, hindering ground-based optical observations over the preceding month. However, this geometry placed the comet within the fields of view of several space-based solar coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers, enabling its continued observation during its final approach toward perihelion. We report photometry from STEREO-A's SECCHI HI1 and COR2, SOHO's LASCO C3, and GOES-19's CCOR-1 instruments in 2025 September–October, which show a rapid rise in the comet's brightness scaling with heliocentric distance r as r^(-7.5+/-1.0). CCOR-1 also resolves the comet as an extended source with an apparent coma  4' in diameter. Furthermore, LASCO color photometry shows the comet to be distinctly bluer than the Sun, consistent with gas emission contributing a substantial fraction of the visible brightness near perihelion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25078" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming Regions (MagMaR). VI. Magnetic Field Dragging in the Filamentary High-mass Star-forming Region G35.20–0.74N due to Gravity</a><span class="id">[2510.25078]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the magnetic field orientation and strength in the massive star-forming region G35.20-0.74N (G35), using polarized dust emission data obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) as part of the Magnetic fields in Massive star-forming Regions (MagMaR) survey. The G35 region shows a filamentary structure (a length of $\sim$0.1 pc) with six bright cores located along the filament's long axis. Magnetic field strengths across the G35 region range from 0.2 to 4.4 mG with a mean value of 0.8 $\pm$ 0.4 mG. The mass-to-flux ratio ($\lambda$) varies from 0.1 to 6.0 the critical value. The highest values are found locally around cores, whereas the remains of the filament are subcritical. A H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (3–2) velocity gradient of 29 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ is evident along the filament's long axis, aligned with the magnetic field direction. At larger scales ($\sim$0.1 pc), the magnetic field lines appear roughly perpendicular to the filament's long axis, in contrast to the smaller-scale structure ($\sim$0.003 pc) traced by ALMA. The magnetic field lines could be dragged along the filament as a result of the gas motion induced by the gravitational potential of the filament. Six cores in the filament have similar spacings between 0.02–0.04 pc. The initial filament fragmentation could have produced a core spacing of 0.06 pc, following filament fragmentation theory, and the current core spacing is the result of cores comoving with the gas along the filament. This core migration could occur in a few 10$^4$ years, consistent with high-mass star formation time scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A century of change: new changing-look event in Mrk 1018's past</a><span class="id">[2510.25156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the long-term variability of the known Changing Look Active Galactic Nuclei (CL AGN) Mrk 1018, whose second change we discovered as part of the Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS). Collating over a hundred years worth of photometry from scanned photographic plates and five modern surveys we find a historic outburst between  1935-1960, with variation in Johnson B magnitude of  0.8 that is consistent with Mrk 1018's brightness before and after its latest changing look event in the early 2010s. Using the combined modern and historic data, a Generalised Lomb-Scargle suggests broad feature with P = 29-47 years. Its width and stability across tests, as well as the turn-on speed and bright phase duration of the historic event suggests a timescale associated with long-term modulation, such as via rapid flickering in the accretion rate caused by the Chaotic Cold Accretion model rather than a strictly periodic CL mechanism driving changes in Mrk 1018. We also use the modern photometry to constrain Mrk 1018's latest turn-off duration to less than  1.9 years, providing further support for a CL mechanism with rapid transition timescales, such as a changing mode of accretion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing Gas Kinematics and Interactions between H II Regions and Molecular Clouds using VLA Observations of Recombination Lines and Hydroxyl</a><span class="id">[2510.25198]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observational studies of HII region-molecular cloud interactions constrain models of feedback and quantify its impact on the surrounding environment. A recent hypothesis proposes that a characteristic spectral signature in ground state hyperfine lines of hydroxyl (OH) – the OH flip – may trace gas that is dynamically interacting with an expanding HII region, offering a new means of probing such interactions. We explore this hypothesis using dedicated Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of three Galactic HII regions, G049.205$-$0.343, G034.256+0.145 and G024.471+0.492, in 1–2 GHz continuum emission, all four 18-cm ground-state OH lines, and multiple hydrogen radio recombination lines. A Gaussian decomposition of the molecular gas data reveals complex OH emission and absorption across our targets. We detect the OH flip towards two of our sources, G049.205$-$0.343 and G034.256+0.145, finding agreement between key predictions of flip hypothesis and the observed multi-wavelength spectra, kinematics and morphology. Specifically, we demonstrate a strong spatial and kinematic association between the OH flip and the ionized gas of the HII regions – the first time this has been demonstrated for resolved sources – and evidence from $^{13}$CO(1–0) data that the expected OH component originates from the non-disturbed gas of the parent cloud. While we detect no flip in G024.471+0.492, we do find evidence of interacting molecular gas traced by OH, providing further support for OH's ability to trace HII region-molecular cloud interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the Origin of Rejuvenating Gas from MaNGA Nearby Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.25216]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study investigates the origin of gas fueling secondary star formation, i.e., rejuvenation in nearby galaxies. From the MaNGA IFU survey, we use stellar absorption features D$_n$4000 and H$\delta_A$ to identify regions that started the rejuvenation within the last $\sim$200 Myr. We compare the gas-phase metallicity, metallicity gradients, environments, and H\Romannum{1} gas fractions of the rejuvenating galaxies (RJGs) to controlled star-forming and quiescent galaxy samples. We demonstrate that, for the majority of RJGs, the rejuvenating gas is originally in the galaxy rather than accreted gas. The evidence includes: (1) gas metallicities consistent with the mass-metallicity relation of SF galaxies; (2) metallicity gradients that are not flattened, arguing against radial inflows; (3) gas velocities in rejuvenating regions consistent with their surroundings, and (4) high H\Romannum{1} gas fractions comparable to SF galaxies, indicating a pre-existing reservoir. Furthermore, we find no evidence that the rejuvenating events are triggered by tidal interactions with neighbors. While internal processes appear to dominate, we also present a clear example of rejuvenation triggered by gas accretion. The galaxy MaNGA 12080-12705 hosts a low-metallicity, kinematically distinct star-forming region in an overall old, massive galaxy, providing unambiguous evidence of an external origin, such as accretion or a minor merger. Our analysis demonstrates that using D$_n$4000 and EW(H$\delta_A$) provides a reliable way to identify current rejuvenation events in large spectroscopic surveys. The method will enable statistical studies to understand rejuvenation across cosmic time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapid bulge assembly in young galaxy disks at Cosmic Dawn</a><span class="id">[2510.25383]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have begun to reveal a surprising morphological diversity in galaxies within the first billion years after the Big Bang, including indications of structural maturity previously thought to arise much later. These findings raise fundamental questions about when and how well-known structural components of galaxy morphology, such as bulges and disks, first emerged. However, directly identifying and resolving such structures at z $&gt;$ 6 remains challenging due to limited spatial resolution and sensitivity. In this work, we present a clear and robust morphological analysis of a sample of 190 galaxies at z $&gt;=$ 6, demonstrating that distinct bulge and disk components were already beginning to emerge during this early epoch. Using multi-component light profile fitting, we model the radial brightness distributions of a subset (20) of galaxies with an inner spheroidal (Sersic) component and an underlying exponential disk. These systems exhibit high bulge-to-total (B/T) light ratios (  0.47) and central stellar mass surface densities (  2.82*10$^{8}$ M$_{sun}$ kpc$^{-2}$ ) - values close to those of nearby quiescent galaxies. Combined with their intense central star formation rate surface densities (  1.26*10$^{1}$ M$_{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ ), our results indicate a rapid building of inner stellar mass and bulge assembly within these young systems. We propose that these early bulge-disk galaxies represent progenitors of massive star-forming and quiescent systems observed at lower redshifts. Their subsequent evolution may proceed through physical processes such as disk growth, compaction, quenching, or bulge-disk co-evolution, driven by both internal dynamics and external interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accelerating star formation of dense clumps</a><span class="id">[2510.25436]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a statistical framework that establishes an accelerating star formation scenario for dense clumps using ATLASGAL and ALMAGAL samples. By employing the cumulative distribution function of dust temperature as a monotonic evolutionary indicator, we linearize clump evolution into a normalized timescale, enabling direct comparison across different samples. The virial mass of clumps increases exponentially with this normalized time, revealing an accelerating buildup of star-forming gas within protoclusters. The evolution of the maximum core mass further shows that the growth timescales of protoclusters and their embedded most massive protostars are comparable, implying a self-similar acceleration of star formation from the stellar to the protocluster scale. This unified framework naturally reproduces the observed evolution of luminosity, the core mass function, the mass growth of the most massive protostars, and the dense gas star formation law on clump scales, establishing a coherent picture of accelerating star formation across scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A constant pressure model for the warm absorber in Mrk 509</a><span class="id">[2510.25483]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the analysis of 900 ks high-resolution RGS XMM-Newton observations of the nearby Seyfert galaxy Mrk 509 with the use of a self-consistent warm absorber (WA) model. We perform a physically motivated approach to the modeling of WA as a stratified medium in constant total pressure (CTP) regime. Powerful outflows are fundamental ingredients of any active galactic nuclei (AGN) structure. They may significantly affect the cosmological environment of their host galaxy. High-resolution X-ray data are best suited for outflow's studies, and the observed absorption lines on heavy elements are evidence of the physical properties of an absorbing gas. Our models allow us to fit continuum shapes bounded together with the line profiles, which gives additional constraints on the gas structure of WA in this source. In this work, we benchmark and test the CTP model on the soft X-ray spectrum of Mrk 509. A grid of synthetic absorbed spectra was computed with the photoionization code Titan assuming that the system was under CTP. As an illuminating spectral energy distribution (SED), we used the most actual multiwavelength observations available for Mrk 509. We apply these models to the high-resolution spectrum of the WA in the Mrk 509, taking into account cold/warm/hot Galactic absorption on the way to the observer. CTP gas with $\log \xi_{0} \sim 1.9$, defined on the cloud surface, fits the data well. A higher ionization component is needed for Ne X absorption. The best-fit model is optically thin with $\log N_{\rm H }= 20.456 \pm 0.016$. The lines are non-saturated, and the CTP spectral fit aligns with previous analyses of Mrk 509 with a constant density WA. The model constrains the gas density, placing the WA cloud at 0.02 pc, consistent with the inner broad line region and the thickening region of the accretion disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25538" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filamentary accretion flows in high-mass star-forming clouds</a><span class="id">[2510.25538]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The scope of this paper is focused on the question if gas is transported to dense clumps inside high-mass star-forming regions through filamentary structures on a scale of several parsecs to the sub-parsec scale.

Blazars and Blazar Candidates in the First eROSITA Survey</a><span class="id">[2510.25589]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aims. eROSITA on board of the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) spacecraft performed its first X-ray all-sky survey (eRASS1) between December 2019 and June 2020. It detected about 930000 sources, providing us with an unprecedented opportunity for a detailed blazar census. We present the properties of blazars and blazar candidates in eRASS1 and the compilation of the eROSITA blazar catalog. Methods. We compile a list of blazar and blazar candidates from the literature and match it with the eRASS1 catalog, creating the Blazars in eRASS1 (BlazEr1) catalog. For sources with more than 50 counts we obtain their X-ray spectral properties. We compile multiwavelength data from the radio to the gamma-ray regimes for all sources, including multiwavelength spectral indices and redshifts. The full catalog is available online. Results. We present the BlazEr1 catalog, containing 5865 sources, of which 2106 are associated with confirmed blazars. For 3668 sources, eROSITA provides the first X-ray data. The contamination from non-blazar sources of the entire sample is less than 11%. Most candidates exhibit properties typical for blazars. We present properties of the entire X-ray detected blazar population, including the distributions of X-ray luminosities and photon indices, multiwavelength properties, and the blazar log N-log S distribution. Our catalog provides follow up targets, such as potential MeV and TeV blazars. Conclusions. The BlazEr1 catalog provides a compilation of X-ray detected blazars and blazar candidates. The catalog serves as a starting point for exploiting further eROSITA surveys using the same methodology, enabling us to study the X-ray variability and a large number of spectral energy distributions of blazars in the future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25642" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The mass-metallicity relation of bulges</a><span class="id">[2510.25642]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Bulges, located at the central regions of galaxies, are complex structures, expected to be shaped by the physical processes involved in the assembly history of their host galaxy, such as gravitational collapse, mergers, interactions, and bars. As a consequence a variety of bulges with distinct morphology and chemistry could be produced. Aim. We aim at exploring the existence of a stellar mass-metallicity relation of bulges, MZ*R, and analyze the possible imprint of characteristics features by accretion and migration of stars, which could store information on their assembly histories. Methods. We use 44 central galaxies from the CIELO cosmological simulations. Their stellar masses are within the range of [10^7.6, 10^10.6] Msun. We decomposed the galaxy into bulge and disk using the circularity and binding energies. We track the stellar populations in bulges back in time to their birth location, classifying them as bulge-born in-situ, and disk-born stars and accreted. Results. We find that most of the stars in our bulges are formed in-situ, but 33% of our bulges show a non-negligible contribution of stellar accretion from satellites, which could add to about 35% of the population. The accreted material is generally contribute by two or three satellites at most. In some bulges, we also find up to a 32% of stars that migrated from the disk due to secular evolution, with a median of 10%. Regardless of the formation histories, we found a clear MZ*R for bulges, which is more enriched by about 0.4 dex than the corresponding relation of the disk components, and about 0.15 dex more enriched than the galaxy MZ*R. We find evidence that the dispersion in the bulge MZ*R is influenced by both stellar accretion from satellites and migration from the disk, such that, at a fixed bulge mass, bulges with higher fraction of accreted and migrated stars tend to be less metal-rich...

Compact, low-mass galaxies with intense optical emission lines are linked to elevated specific star formation rates (sSFRs) and recent bursts of star formation. Feedback in these systems may enable the leakage of ionizing radiation into the intergalactic medium. Using JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CAPERS, CEERS, and RUBIES surveys, we compile 160 NIRCam-selected EELGs in the EGS field. These galaxies show extreme rest-frame equivalent widths (EWs), with a median EW([O III]+H${\beta}$)=1616Å and EW(H${\alpha}$)=763Å. They are low-mass (median log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)=8.26) with high sSFRs (median 43 Gyr$^{-1}$), above the $z\sim6$ main sequence. UV slopes are diverse, with a mean $\beta=-2.0$, and only 7% have extremely blue continua ($\beta&lt;-2.6$). Emission-line diagnostics suggest stellar populations as the primary ionizing source, although an AGN fraction of 14% is found. These galaxies are efficient ionizing photon producers, with mean log($\xi_{\rm ion}$ [Hz erg$^{-1}$])=25.34, exceeding typical values at similar redshifts. Escape fractions, however, are heterogeneous: 9% of EELGs show escape fractions $&gt;$10% for both Ly${\alpha}$ and LyC photons, while 82% lack detectable Ly${\alpha}$ emission. The median inferred LyC escape fraction is modest (4.4%) but enhanced in super-Eddington systems with sSFR &gt;25 Gyr$^{-1}$. The galaxies are extremely compact, with a median effective radius of 0.49 kpc, and exhibit a recent star-formation burst. Our analysis indicates that sSFR and star-formation rate surface density are the primary drivers of their extreme emission line strengths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identification of Large-Scale (&gt;100 kpc) Radio Jets in Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.25678]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Powerful, large-scale relativistic jets are usually associated with massive, old elliptical galaxies. This paradigm has recently been challenged by the identification of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies, thought to be young active galactic nuclei with low-mass black holes, harboring relativistic jets. Among them, sources hosting $&gt;$100 kpc radio jets are extremely rare. Here, we report the discovery of large-scale, double-lobed radio structures in 33 NLSy1s with the projected linear size of at least 100 kpc from a recently published catalog of 22656 NLSy1 galaxies. These 33 include 29 confirmed double-lobed sources and 4 candidates whose radio structure requires further study. We suggest that their low black hole masses are unlikely to be due to their small angles of inclination to the line of sight. These enigmatic sources were identified by examining the radio observations taken with the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters, Very Large Array Sky Survey, Low Frequency Array, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey. Among them, the NLSy1 source J1318+2626 ($z=0.62$) is found to host a radio jet with the projected linear size of 4.3 Mpc, making it the only NLSy1 galaxy hosting a Mpc-scale radio jet known as of today. We conclude that future observations of NLSy1 sources with the next generation of sensitive telescopes may reveal a much larger population harboring large-scale jets, thus providing crucial clues on their origin, propagation, and interaction with the ambient environment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RIOJA.

We derive the physical properties by conducting spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, revealing that our target is a young (age $\sim2$ Myr) starburst galaxy with intense radiation field. We detect multiple nebular emission lines from NIRSpec IFS data. We identify a robust broad component of [O III]$\lambda5008$ emission, indicating the presence of ionized gas outflows. The derived gas depletion time of a few hundred Myr implies that our target could be one of the progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies at $z\sim4-5$ identified by recent JWST observations. The spatial distribution of optical and far-infrared (FIR) [O III] emission lines differs in morphology, likely resulting from different critical densities and inhomogeneous density distributions within the galaxy. Potential old stellar populations may be necessary to account for the derived metallicity of $\sim0.2\,\rm{Z}_\odot$, and their presence can be confirmed by future MIRI observations. Including our target, star-forming galaxies at $z&gt;6$ detected by ALMA are generally very young but more massive and brighter in UV than galaxies identified by only JWST. The ALMA-detected galaxies may also have a steeper mass-metallicity relation. These findings suggest that the ALMA-detected galaxies may have experienced more efficient mass assembly processes in their evolutionary pathways.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24897" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observable signature of magnetic tidal coupling in hierarchical triple systems</a><span class="id">[2510.24897]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study hierarchical triple systems formed by a compact binary orbiting a supermassive black hole (SMBH), focusing on the role of relativistic magnetic tidal interactions.

Averaging the Hamiltonian over the inner orbit, we find that magnetic tides introduce new resonances absent at lower order, leading to additional eccentricity excitations and significantly modifying the binary's long-term evolution. Numerical solutions of the Lagrange Planetary Equations confirm these analytical predictions and reveal how resonance strength depends on orbital eccentricity and inclination. The resulting dynamics accelerates the binary merger and imprint distinctive signatures on gravitational waves, potentially observable by LISA.

Using the Synthesizer code we simulate the dust attenuated ultraviolet-near infrared stellar emission from galaxies in thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the CAMELS suite, including the Swift-EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, Simba &amp; Astrid galaxy formation models. For each galaxy we calculate the rest-frame luminosity in a number of photometric bands, including the SDSS $\textit{ugriz}$ and GALEX FUV &amp; NUV filters; this dataset represents the largest catalogue of synthetic photometry based on hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations produced to date, totalling &gt;200 million sources. From these we compile luminosity functions and colour distributions, and find clear dependencies on both cosmology and feedback. We then perform simulation based (likelihood-free) inference using these distributions to constrain $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and four parameters controlling the strength of stellar and AGN feedback. Both colour distributions and luminosity functions provide complementary information on certain parameters when performing inference. We achieve constraints on the stellar feedback parameters, as well as $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$. The latter is attributable to the fact that the photometry encodes the star formation-metal enrichment history of each galaxy; galaxies in a universe with a higher $\sigma_8$ tend to form earlier and have higher metallicities, which leads to redder colours. We find that a model trained on one galaxy formation simulation generalises poorly when applied to another, and attribute this to differences in the subgrid prescriptions, and lack of flexibility in our emission modelling.

WFI2033–4723, the First Quadruply-Imaged Quasar Modeled with JWST Imaging</a><span class="id">[2503.00099]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational time delays offer unique, independent measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$. Precise measurements of $H_0$ stand as one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology, and to do so with time delays requires precise lens models. While much work has focused on streamlining the modeling process to keep pace with the erumpent discovery of strongly-lensed systems, a critical step toward reducing uncertainty in $H_0$ comes from increasing the precision of individual lens models themselves. In this work, we demonstrate that the unprecedented imaging capabilities of JWST make this goal attainable. We present the first lens model for time-delay cosmography derived from JWST data, applied to the quadruply-imaged quasar WFI2033–4723. While the primary source of systematic uncertainty in time-delay cosmography is currently the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD), the sensitivity of models to this MSD varies on how the point spread function (PSF) errors are mitigated. As the PSF is also the primary source of uncertainty in lens modeling, we focus on a comparison of different PSF modeling methods. Within the context of power-law models, we recover results in agreement with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-based models, but with better precision of key lensing parameters through implementation of new PSF modeling techniques. Despite the record-holding precision of this system's HST modeling, we achieve an additional 22% increase in precision of the Fermat potential difference, directly reducing uncertainties of cosmological inference. These results would produce a 3% ($1\sigma$ of the modeling error) shift of $H_0$ towards a higher value for this lens, keeping all else constant. This work substantiates the groundbreaking potential of JWST for time-delay cosmography and lays the groundwork for modeling systems previously too faint to provide meaningful constraints on $H_0$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17428" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast inflowing ionized absorber tracing the gas dynamics at sub-parsec scale around Mrk 3</a><span class="id">[2505.17428]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accretion onto supermassive black hole (SMBH) can release energy via radiation, jets or winds, providing feedback effects on the circumnuclear gas environment. However, not all active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit clear signature of such feedback, and the dynamics of accreting gas on the inner sub-parsec scales remains poorly understood. Using high-resolution Chandra X-ray grating spectra of Mrk 3, we detect a fast inflowing ionized absorber characterized by redshifted Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption lines with confidence level in the $94-99.6\%$ range. Photoionization modeling reveals the inflowing absorber is located at $\lesssim0.04-0.74\rm~pc$, with red-shifted velocity decreasing from $6.1\pm0.5\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ to $3.4\pm0.3\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ over 11 years. Only $\sim0.6$\%–$3$\% of the inflowing material is estimated to reach the event horizon. This direct evidence of sub-parsec scale fueling inflow bridges the gap between the torus and the outer accretion disk. Additionally, a $0.86$-keV gas component with sub-solar metallicity ($Z\sim0.22$), outflowing at a velocity of $\sim330\rm~km~s^{-1}$, is detected in the soft X-ray band from XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer, probably corresponding to shocked interstellar medium in the narrow-line region (NLR). The simultaneous presence of the apparent decelerating sub-parsec inflow and the NLR outflow favors a coherent scenario where a putative disk wind or broad-line region clouds may impede or even eject the accretion material, although other possibilities cannot be fully excluded.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hybrid Morphology Radio Sources from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS): Radio, Mid-infrared and Environmental Characteristics</a><span class="id">[2506.20211]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hybrid morphology radio sources (HyMoRSs) are a rare subclass of radio galaxies that display a Fanaroff-Riley type I (FR I) morphology on one side of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a type II (FR II) morphology on the other. In this study, we report the discovery of thirty-six new HyMoRSs, marking the largest collection of such sources in the southern sky to date, using data obtained from the MeerKAT absorption line survey (MALS). The identified HyMoRSs exhibit moderate radio luminosities in the range 9.9 $\times 10^{23}$ to 5.7 $\times 10^{25}~\mathrm{ this http URL ^{-1}}$, with a median value of 4.4 $\times 10^{24}~\mathrm{ this http URL ^{-1}}$ at 1.4 GHz, and are located within the redshift range 0.04$&lt;z&lt;$1.34. In this work, we show for the first time that the two lobes of HyMoRSs exhibit no statistically significant difference in their spectral indices. We also investigate the mid-infrared properties and environments of their host galaxies. Notably, nine out of the thirty-six sources are situated near the centers of galaxy clusters, including one with giant radio jets that extend over 811 kpc. Our analysis reveals that the majority of HyMoRSs are hosted by actively star-forming galaxies that exhibit elevated star formation rates. Furthermore, our findings suggest that HyMoRSs may arise from FR II jets being deflected by a dense, cluster-like environment, along with orientation effects that make one jet appear FR I-like. As our candidates are selected through visual inspection of MALS radio maps, higher-resolution follow-up observations are still necessary to confirm the nature of their morphologies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The PARADIGM project II: The lifetimes and quenching of satellites in Milky Way-mass haloes</a><span class="id">[2507.05401]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The abundance and star-formation histories of satellites of Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies are linked to their hosts' assembly histories. To explore this connection, we use the PARADIGM suite of zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations of MW-mass haloes, evolving the same initial conditions spanning various halo assembly histories with the VINTERGATAN and IllustrisTNG models. Our VINTERGATAN simulations overpredict the number of satellites compared to observations (and to IllustrisTNG) due to a higher $M_{*}$ at fixed $M_{\rm tot}$. Despite this difference, the two models show good qualitative agreement for both satellite disruption fractions and timescales, and quenching. The number of satellites rises rapidly until $z=1$ and then remains nearly constant. The fraction of satellites from each epoch that are disrupted by $z=0$ decreases steadily from nearly 100% to 0% during $4&gt;z&gt;0.1$. These fractions are higher for VINTERGATAN than IllustrisTNG, except for massive satellites ($M_{*}&gt;10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$) at $z&gt;0.5$. This difference is largely due to varying distributions of pericentric distance, orbital period and number of orbits, in turn determined by which sub(haloes) are populated with galaxies by the two models. The time between accretion and disruption also remains approximately constant over $2&gt;z&gt;0.3$ at $6-8$ Gyr. For surviving satellites at $z=0$, both models recover the observed trend of massive satellites quenching more recently ($&lt;8$ Gyr ago) and within $1.5\,r_{\rm 200c}$ of the host, while low mass satellites quench earlier and often outside the host. Our results provide constraints on satellite accretion, quenching and disruption timescales, while highlighting the convergent trends from two very different galaxy formation models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The AstroSat UV Deep Field South-V: Constraints on the average escape of ionizing photons in the cosmic dusk</a><span class="id">[2508.20011]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the escape of ionizing (Lyman-continuum; LyC) photons from 49 star-forming galaxies at redshifts $\sim 1-1.5$, using far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. The sample spans a wide range of stellar masses and UV luminosities. LyC emission is undetected in most galaxies (42/49), and stacking these galaxies yields only an upper limit on the observed LyC-to-nonionizing UV flux density ratio ($({F}_{\lambda,\rm{LyC}}/{F}_{\lambda,\rm{UV}})_{\rm{obs}}&lt;0.12$). Including all galaxies (with 7 LyC-leaker candidates) produces a marginal $2.4\sigma$ detection, suggesting that the average LyC signal is driven by a small number of sources. To identify the conditions favorable for LyC escape, we perform stacking analyses in bins of stellar mass, UV slope, compactness, inclination, and star formation rate surface density. A stacked LyC signal is detected at a significance of $\sim3\sigma$ from a subset of galaxies that are characterized as being compact, have high star formation rate surface densities, and blue UV continuum slopes, despite each of these being individually undetected in LyC. This provides the first systematic evidence at $z\sim 1-1.5$ linking these properties to LyC escape, consistent with trends observed in the lower redshift universe. Additionally, LyC leakage appears more efficient in low-mass galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&lt;9.5$), with their average absolute escape fraction ranging from $\langle f_{\text{esc,abs}} \rangle\sim0.1-0.2$ depending on stellar population assumptions. These results support the scenario that compact, low-mass starbursts were key contributors to the ionizing photon budget during cosmic reionization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cascading from the winds to the disk: the universality of supernovae-driven turbulence in different galactic interstellar media</a><span class="id">[2509.01653]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Star-forming galaxies are in a state of turbulence, with one of the principle components of the turbulence sourced by the constant injection of momentum from supernovae (SNe) explosions. Utilizing high-resolution stratified, gravito-hydrodynamical models of SNe-driven turbulence with interstellar medium (ISM) cooling and heating, we explore how SNe-driven turbulence changes across different galactic conditions, parameterized by the galactic mass and potential, SNe-driving rate, and seeding functions. We show that even though the underlying ISM changes between starburst and Milky Way analogue models, the velocity fluctuations in the turbulence of both models, but not the kinetic energy fluctuations, can be normalized into a universal, single cascade, $u^2(k) \propto k^{-3/2}$, where $u$ is the velocity and $k$ is the wavemode, indicating that the structure of the turbulence is robust to significant changes in the ISM and SNe seeding. Moreover, the cascades connect smoothly from the winds into the galactic disk, pushing the outer-scale of the turbulence, $\ell_{\rm cor}$, to over $\ell_{\rm cor} \approx 6 \ell_0$, where $\ell_0$ is the gaseous scale-height. By providing an analytical model for the sound speed spectrum, $c_s^2(k)$, in the weak-cooling, adiabatic limit, we show that it is the compressible turbulent modes, $u_c$, that control the volume-filling phase structure of the galactic disks in our models, with $c_s^2(k) \propto k^{-2} \propto u_c^2(k)$. This may indicate that galactic turbulence does not only have highly-universal features across different galaxies, but also directly sets the volume-filling hot and warm phase structure of the underlying galactic ISM through turbulent compressible modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10612" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GLACE survey: OSIRIS/GTC multi-object spectroscopy of the rich galaxy cluster ZwCl 0024.0+1652 at z 0.4.

We study the quenching of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) in the rich cluster ZwCl 0024.0+1652 (Cl0024) at redshift $z\sim0.4$, aiming to determine if and how star formation is suppressed. Using multi-object spectroscopy from the GLACE survey, we extracted fluxes and redshifts of [O II]$\lambda\lambda3727,3729$, $\mathrm{H\beta}$, and [O III]$\lambda5007$ emission lines to derive star formation rates (SFRs) for 173 ELGs. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain key evolutionary parameters such as stellar masses ($M_\star$) and the 4000 Å break ($D4000$) index. We derived the $M_\star-\mathrm{SFR}$ relation for 98 star-forming galaxies (SFGs), finding 34.7% exhibit suppressed SFRs in the cluster, compared to 11.0% in the field. While the SFRs show no significant variation with local density, the fraction of SFGs is 1.55 times higher in the cluster outskirts than in intermediate-density regions. The specific SFR decreases strongly with $D4000$ for active SFGs but remains constant for suppressed galaxies. The fraction of suppressed galaxies in the infall region is 2.6 times higher than in the core, especially in the infalling structure B of the cluster. The cluster's total mass does not appear to be a key factor in SFG quenching. Star formation in Cl0024 galaxies is suppressed by the dense cluster environment. This suppression is evident in SFG fractions and parameters tracing long-term evolution, indicating prolonged quenching.

This high occurrence of massive satellite halos agrees with simulations. With sizes of $\simeq80\times160$ and $80\times100~\mathrm{pkpc}^2$, the two nebulae are both $\sim$300pkpc from the main LANs. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is only shifted by $\simeq100-300$ km s$^{-1}$ between each of the two pairs, suggesting connections via large-scale structure. RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat are estimated to have log$(M_\mathrm{h}/M_\odot)\simeq13.2\pm0.3$ and $12.8\pm0.3$, putting them potentially close to the regime of cold-mode accretion. The central brightest galaxies in the two halos are morphologically distinct despite having similar stellar mass $\sim10^{11}M_\odot$, one being an elliptical quiescent galaxy in RO-1001-Sat and the other being a dusty star-forming spiral in RO-0959-Sat. Intriguingly, the quiescent galaxy aligns well with the peak of the LAN as well as the potential well of the host halo, making it the first clear-cut case where the cold gas ought to be accreting onto the galaxy but with no observable star formation, either due to morphological quenching or, more likely, radio-mode feedback from an active galactic nucleus. Finally, we show a tentative detection of a Ly$\alpha$ filament connecting RO-1001 and RO-1001-Sat. This work shows how panoramic MUSE (and in the future, BlueMUSE) observations of massive halo seeds can be used to efficiently search for additional halos, unveiling their large-scale structure and enabling the study of Ly$\alpha$-selected galaxy groups.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azimuthal Misalignments in Stellar Warp Structure as Dynamical Tracers of Mergers in Milky Way-like Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.04194]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the origin of warps in stellar disks using high-resolution Milky Way analogs from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. Focusing on galaxies that experienced a major merger, we identify a characteristic azimuthal misalignment between the warp structures of stellar populations formed before and after the merger. This misalignment persists even after correcting for differential rotation, suggesting it is a dynamical imprint of the merger rather than a consequence of internal kinematics. In contrast, galaxies without significant merger events show no such offset between stellar populations of different ages. These findings support the scenario in which mergers can induce long-lived warps and leave detectable structural signatures in stellar disks. Applied to the Milky Way, this approach offers a potential way to test whether the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger contributed to the formation of the Galactic warp. It may also provide an independent means to constrain the timing of such merger events by examining the phase offsets in the stellar warp as a function of stellar age.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS).

The Morphological Classification of Virgo Cluster Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.20944]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a study of morphologies, based on deep $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}z^{\prime}$ imaging of the Virgo Cluster from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS), for 3689 Virgo cluster members spanning a mass range of $\sim$$10^{11}M_{\odot}$ to $\sim$$10^5~M_{\odot}$. Our analysis introduces a new, two-component visual classification scheme developed to capture the morphological diversity of galaxies over more than six orders of magnitude in stellar mass. Our morphological classifications use two parameters to describe the global structure and star formation activity of each galaxy. Structural sub-codes denote features such as spiral arms, bars, disks, shells, streams, while star formation sub-codes indicate the form and location of the current star formation activity (e.g., in cores, clumps, filaments, etc). These visual classifications rely on deep $g^\prime$-band images, supplemented by $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}$ color images, as well as unsharp-masked images for a subset of objects. We compare our classifications to previous results for bright member galaxies that used more established schemes, finding good agreement. We also measure quantitative classification statistics (e.g., CASGM$_{20}$) for a subset of the brighter galaxies, and present catalogs for some galaxy types of special interest, including structurally compact galaxies, ultra-diffuse galaxies, candidate ultra-compact dwarf transition objects, as well as candidate post-merger systems. These morphological classifications may be useful as a training set in the application of machine learning tools to the next generation of wide-field imaging surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong-gravity precession resonances for binary systems orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole</a><span class="id">[2505.15901]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binary systems of compact objects in close orbit around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) may form in galactic nuclei, providing a unique environment to probe strong-gravity tidal effects on the binary's dynamics. In this work, we investigate precession resonances arising between the periastron precession frequency of a binary system and its orbital frequencies around the SMBH. By modeling the SMBH as a Schwarzschild black hole, we find that relativistic effects in the tidal field give rise to a significantly richer resonance spectrum compared to the Newtonian case. This result is supported by both perturbative and numerical analyses of the quadrupolar tidal interaction in the strong-gravity regime. Our results reveal new signatures for strong-gravity effects in such triple systems, with potential implications for gravitational-wave astronomy.</p></div></details></article>

The timing residuals of each pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across all angular scales. However, due to the limited number of monitored pulsars, current analyses are only able to reconstruct the angular structure of the background at large scales. We show analytically that this mismatch between the integrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a previously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map reconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ”small-scale leakage”, is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at scales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into large-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred angular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of scales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry of the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of different regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise. As the quality of pulsar timing array experiments improves, a robust understanding of small-scale leakage will become paramount for reliable detection and characterization of the gravitational wave background. Thus, the theoretical formalism developed here will be essential to estimate the magnitude of this systematic uncertainty in anisotropy searches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astronomical Optical Interferometry from the Lunar Surface</a><span class="id">[2510.24901]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The lunar surface is a compelling location for large, distributed optical facilities, with significant advantages over orbital facilities for high spatial resolution astrophysics.

The method employs C-band continuous waveforms transmitted from NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) Canberra station, with reflected signals captured by distributed ground-based telescopes converted from astronomical to radar operations. From March 2021 to September 2025, we conducted systematic observations of 20 distinct rocket bodies at various orbital altitudes and object sizes. Micro-Doppler analysis of axial rotation signatures enabled extraction of rotation periods, object dimensions, surface characteristics, and mass distribution parameters with enhanced accuracy in orbital refinement. We implemented advanced imaging reconstruction techniques to generate morphology data of the targets. Results demonstrate successful determination of debris rotation periods with second-level precision, dimensional estimates within 10\% accuracy compared to known specifications, and improved orbital parameter determination reducing position uncertainties by up to 30\%. The technique provides a cost-effective approach for space situational awareness, leveraging existing astronomical infrastructure to enhance Australia's sovereign capabilities in tracking both near-Earth objects and space debris. This multi-static configuration offers significant advantages over traditional monostatic radar systems for geostationary and highly elliptical orbit debris monitoring.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25161" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephemeris and Almanac Design for Lunar Navigation Satellites</a><span class="id">[2510.25161]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents almanac and ephemeris message representation for lunar navigation satellites supporting the Lunar Augmented Navigation System (LANS). The proposed method combines osculating orbital elements, Chebyshev polynomials, and Fourier series to efficiently represent lunar satellite trajectories subject to complex perturbations from lunar gravity and third-body effects. For the ephemeris, a hybrid Chebyshev–Fourier formulation improves fitting accuracy over long arcs while maintaining message compactness under the data-size constraint of the LunaNet Interoperability Specification. For the almanac, a compact low-order polynomial and Fourier model is introduced to capture mid-term orbital variations over a 15-day fitting arc. The approach is validated for multiple orbit regimes, including 30-hour, 24-hour, and 12-hour elliptical lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs) and a 6-hour polar orbit. Results show that the proposed framework achieves sub-meter position and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity fitting errors within the 900-bit limit for 6-hour ephemeris arcs, and almanac fitting accuracy sufficient for reliable satellite-visibility identification in warm-start operations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pre-flight Background Estimates for COSI</a><span class="id">[2510.25304]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a Compton telescope designed to survey the 0.2 - 5 MeV sky, consisting of a compact array of cross-strip germanium detectors. It is planned to be launched in 2027 into an equatorial low-Earth (530 km) orbit with a prime mission duration of 2 years. The observation of MeV gamma rays is dominated by background, mostly from extragalactic and atmospheric photon but also from the activation of the detector materials induced by cosmic-ray interactions. Thus, background simulation and identification are crucial for the data analysis. In this work we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the background for the first 3 months in orbit, and we extrapolate the results to 2 years in orbit, in order to determine the build-up of the activation due to long-lived isotopes. We determine the rates of events induced by the background that are reconstructed as Compton events in the simulated COSI data. We find that the extragalactic background photons dominate at low energies (&lt;660 keV), while delayed activation from cosmic-ray primaries (proton/alpha) and albedo photons dominate at higher energies. As part of this work, a comparison at low latitude (&lt;1 deg) between recent measurement of the SAA by the High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-01) on board the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01) and the AP9/AE9 model has been made, showing an overestimation of the flux by a factor 9 by the model.

Current exoplanet surveys are focused on detecting small exoplanets orbiting in the liquid-water habitable zones of their host stars. Despite the recent significant advancements in instrumental developments, the current limitation in detecting these exoplanets is the intrinsic variability of the host star itself. Aims. Our aim is to use the full CARMENES guaranteed time observations (GTO) data set spanning more than 8 years of observations of over 350 stars to investigate the wavelength dependence of high-precision radial velocities (RV), as stellar activity features should exhibit a wavelength dependence while the RV variation due to an orbiting planet will be wavelength independent. Methods. We use the chromatic index (CRX) to quantify the slope of the measured RVs as a function of logarithmic wavelength. We investigate the dependence of the CRX in the full CARMENES GTO sample on 24 stellar activity indices in the visible and near-infrared channels of the CARMENES spectrograph and each star's stellar parameters. We also present an updated convective turnover time scaling for the calculation of the stellar Rossby number for M dwarfs. Results. Our results show that approximately 17\% of GTO stars show a strong or a moderate correlation between CRX and RV. We can improve the measured RVs by a factor of up to nearly 4 in rms by subtracting the RV predicted by the CRX-RV correlation from the measured RVs. Mid M dwarfs with moderate rotational velocities, moderate CRX-gradients and quasi-stable activity features have the best rms improvement factors. Conclusions. We conclude that the CRX is a powerful diagnostic in mitigation of stellar activity and the search for low mass rocky planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Torque cancellation effect of Intensity noise for Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</a><span class="id">[2510.24779]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detection of sub-Hz gravitational waves is of significant importance for astrophysics. It enables the observation of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, the issuance of early alerts for gravitational-wave events, and the exploration of the stochastic gravitational-wave background. The Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS) is a proposed gravitational-wave detector based on a Sagnac speed-meter topology that uses torsion bars as test masses. Its prototype design aims to achieve a strain sensitivity of $3 \times 10^{-18}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1 Hz and thus enable the detection of $\mathcal{O}(10^4),M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole mergers at 100 Mpc with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. We show that the torsion-bar-based speed meter can suppress noise originating from laser intensity fluctuations by canceling the net torque on the bar and by using a balanced homodyne readout. We further present, for the first time, an analytic intensity-noise model for a gravitational-wave detector employing a torsion-bar Sagnac speed-meter configuration. Using this model, we evaluate the expected performance of a 2.5 m arm-length CHRONOS prototype. The projected laser-intensity noise is $2.9 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1 Hz, which is sufficiently low to allow the detection of binary intermediate-mass black hole mergers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optical design and sensitivity optimization of Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</a><span class="id">[2510.24780]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the optical design and sensitivity modeling of the 2.5 m Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), a triangular Sagnac speed-meter interferometer incorporating power- and signal-recycling techniques.

The resulting configuration reaches a quantum-noise-limited strain sensitivity of $h \simeq 3\times10^{-18},\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$ at 1 Hz, with a ring-cavity finesse $\mathcal{F}\simeq3.1\times10^{4}$ and round-trip Gouy phase $\psi_{\mathrm{rt}}\approx153^{\circ}$. The power-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_p=-85^{\circ}$) dominates the low-frequency quantum noise, while the signal-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_s=0^{\circ}$) mainly introduces a uniform quadrature rotation. The optimal homodyne angle ($\zeta_{\mathrm{opt}}\simeq46^{\circ}$) balances shot-noise and radiation-pressure effects to give the best sensitivity near 1 Hz. Assuming end-mirror reflectivity $R_{\mathrm{ETM}}=99.9999\%$ under cryogenic operation at 10 K, CHRONOS can achieve quantum-noise-limited performance on a laboratory scale and serve as a testbed for future long-baseline, cryogenic interferometers probing sub-hertz gravitational waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illuminating the lantern: coherent, spectro-polarimetric characterisation of a multimode converter</a><span class="id">[2510.25330]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While photonic lanterns efficiently and uniquely map a set of input modes to single-mode outputs (or vice versa), the optical mode transfer matrix of any particular fabricated device cannot be constrained at the design stage due to manufacturing imperfections.

Future wide-field surveys capable of sub-milliarcsecond precision could make this approach a viable tool for detecting or constraining the SGWB.

The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study.

These instruments use a combination of a high-resolution and a low-resolution etalon together with an order-sorting prefilter to define the bandpass. The overall design is made robust and stable by tailoring the low-resolution etalon reflectivity to accommodate expected cavity errors from both etalons, and by using a compact optical design that eliminates the need for folding mirrors. By using a telecentric design based on lenses rather than mirrors, image degradation by the FPI system is negligible, as shown in a previous publication, and the throughput of the system is maximised. Initial alignment, and maintaining that alignment over time, is greatly simplified. The telecentric design allows full calibration and/or modelling of essential system parameters to be carried out without interfering with the optical setup. We also discuss briefly the polarimeters developed for CRISP and CHROMIS. The high performance of CRISP and CHROMIS has been demonstrated in an earlier publication through measurements of the granulation contrast and comparisons with similar measurements simultaneously made through broadband continuum filters. Here, we focus on the aspects of the design that are central to enabling high performance and robustness, but also discuss the calibration and processing of the data, and use a few examples of processed data to demonstrate the achievable image and data quality. We put forward a proposal for a similar conceptual design for the European Solar Telescope and conclude by discussing potential problems of the proposed approach to designs of this type.

Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types–LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP–followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18705" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Picometer Sensitive Prototype of the Optical Truss Interferometer for LISA</a><span class="id">[2406.18705]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The optical truss interferometer (OTI) is a contingent subsystem proposed for the LISA telescopes to aid in the verification of a $1 \frac{\mathrm{pm}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}$ optical path length stability. Each telescope would be equipped with three pairs of compact fiber-coupled units, each forming an optical cavity with a baseline proportional to the telescope length at different points around the aperture. Employing a Pound-Drever-Hall approach to maintain a modulated laser field on resonance with each cavity, the dimensional stability of the telescope can be measured and verified. We have designed and developed prototype OTI units to demonstrate the capability of measuring stable structures, such as the LISA telescope, with a $1 \frac{\mathrm{pm}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}$ sensitivity using a set of freely mountable fiber-injected cavities. Aside from its initial motivation for the telescope, the OTI can also be readily integrated with other systems to aid in ground testing experiments. In this paper, we outline our experimental setup, measurement results, and analyses of the noise limitations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Precision Lunar Corner-Cube Retroreflectors: A Wave-Optics Perspective</a><span class="id">[2504.06409]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-precision corner-cube retroreflectors (CCRs) are critical for advanced lunar laser ranging (LLR) because they enable sub-millimeter-scale measurements of the Earth-Moon distance – a level of precision essential for rigorous tests of relativistic gravitation and for advancing our understanding of lunar geophysics. In this work, we develop a comprehensive two-dimensional Fourier-optics model for single CCRs with apertures ranging from 80-110 mm. Our model incorporates realistic thermal-mechanical wavefront errors, detailed diffraction effects, and velocity aberration offsets. Our analysis reveals a strong coupling between aperture size and aberration angular offset: while larger CCRs deliver high on-axis flux under near-ideal conditions, their narrow diffraction lobes suffer significant flux loss at moderate aberration offsets, thereby favoring smaller apertures with broader main lobes. Furthermore, comparisons between solid fused-silica and hollow silicon-carbide (SiC) CCRs show that hollow designs not only achieve competitive or superior photon return – particularly at 1064 nm, where phase errors are relatively reduced – but also offer nearly an order-of-magnitude mass reduction for the same aperture sizes. These results establish a robust quantitative framework for optimizing CCR designs to perform at the sub-millimeter level under realistic lunar conditions and underscore the advantages of precision hollow SiC CCRs for next-generation LLR operations.</p></div></details></article></body>
