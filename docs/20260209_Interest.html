<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03085" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Stochastic-Quantum Theorem</a><span class="id">[2309.03085]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper introduces several new classes of mathematical structures that have close connections with physics and with the theory of dynamical systems. The most general of these structures, called indivisible stochastic processes, collectively encompass many important kinds of stochastic processes, including Markov chains and random dynamical systems. This paper then states and proves a new theorem that establishes a precise correspondence between any indivisible stochastic process and a unitarily evolving quantum system. This theorem therefore leads to a new formulation of quantum theory, alongside the Hilbert-space, path-integral, and quasi-probability formulations. The theorem also provides a first-principles explanation for why quantum systems are based on the complex numbers, Hilbert spaces, linear-unitary time evolution, and the Born rule. In addition, the theorem suggests that by selecting a suitable Hilbert space, together with an appropriate choice of unitary evolution, one can simulate any indivisible stochastic process on a quantum computer, thereby potentially opening up an extensive set of novel applications for quantum computing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06058" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Observations on the possible electromagnetic nature of nucleon interactions and pions&quot; – historical manuscript from 1969 by B. W. Ninham and C. Pask</a><span class="id">[2602.06058]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This manuscript presents an historical perspective prepared by Barry Ninham and Colin Pask in 1969 on the connection between quantum electrodynamics theory and nucleon interactions. A new theory of strong interactions based on electromagnetic considerations is proposed. Energy and force range magnitudes are correctly given. A new theory of the pion emerges and the pion mass and lifetime are calculated. No strong interaction coupling constant is required.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geometric View of One-Dimensional Quantum Mechanics</a><span class="id">[2512.23923]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We apply De Haro's Geometric View of Theories to one of the simplest quantum systems: a spinless particle on a line and on a circle. The classical phase space M = T*Q is taken as the base of a trivial Hilbert bundle E   M x H, and the familiar position and momentum representations are realised as different global trivialisations of this bundle. The Fourier transform appears as a fibrewise unitary transition function, so that the standard position-momentum duality is made precise as a change of coordinates on a single geometric object. For the circle, we also discuss twisted boundary conditions and show how a twist parameter can be incorporated either as a fixed boundary condition or as a base coordinate, in which case it gives rise to a flat U(H)-connection with nontrivial holonomy. These examples provide a concrete illustration of how the Geometric View organises quantum-mechanical representations and dualities in geometric terms.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cognitive Load and Situational Interest in Physics Laboratories: A Comparative Study Across Three Instructional Modalities</a><span class="id">[2602.06143]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding how an instructional approach shapes student's cognitive resources and engagement is central to improving undergraduate physics education especially for novice learners. This study examines how three instructional modalities (Inquiry-based, Design-based, and Game-based learning) affect cognitive load and situational interest in physics laboratories for non-STEM majors. Guided by the revised Cognitive Load Theory framework, two experiments were conducted across two physics domains: mechanics and electrical circuits. In each experiment, students completed three laboratory sessions, one in each instructional modality, followed by surveys measuring cognitive load and situational interest. One-way ANOVA analyses revealed significant differences across the three modalities in both experiments. Game-based laboratories consistently yielded the lowest cognitive load and the highest situational interest, while inquiry-based and design-based labs imposed higher cognitive demands, with their relative effects varying by domain. Overall, situational interest exhibited an inverse relationship with cognitive load, suggesting that reduced cognitive demands support greater engagement. These findings emphasize the value of strategically selecting and combining instructional modalities to balance cognitive load and foster meaningful engagement in physics laboratories for novice learners.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03085" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">When AI Evaluates Its Own Work: Validating Learner-Initiated, AI-Generated Physics Practice Problems</a><span class="id">[2508.03085]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large language models (LLMs) can now generate physics practice problems in real time, yet the educational value of these items hinges on rapid, reliable post-generation vetting. In this exploratory study, we investigated which automated checks are both technically feasible and pedagogically meaningful when exercises are produced on demand within a chatbot interface. A cohort of 34 introductory-physics students generated and attempted 543 practice problems during exam preparation. Each item was labeled by an expert on a wide range of quality attributes and presented to the learners in pairs to record their preference. We then (i) benchmarked three commodity LLMs as “judges” against the expert labels, (ii) quantified which attributes predict student choice via random-forest models, and (iii) triangulated these results with free-form exit surveys. Only a small subset of the original metric items proved necessary to reliably address student preferences either directly or by proxy. The study demonstrates that scalable formative assessment does not require exhaustive scoring: a carefully curated core of structural and learner-visible checks is sufficient to ensure both technical soundness and user appeal. The findings provide a practical blueprint for deploying real-time, AI-generated practice in physics and other quantitative disciplines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A portable LED-based diamond magnetometer for outreach and teaching labs</a><span class="id">[2512.03106]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a compact, low-cost version of an NV center diamond magnetometer which replaces the standard green laser with a high-power LED. This modification improves safety, reduces cost, and allows the green excitation and red photoluminescence to be viewed directly during demonstrations. The device is simple to assemble and suitable for outreach activities and undergraduate laboratories. We show that it can produce ODMR spectra and respond to nearby magnetic objects, with a sensitivity on the order of 1 $\mu$T/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. Supplementary material provides details of the construction and suggestions for student investigations to support use in teaching laboratories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The meaning of closeness to women and/or LGBTQ+ physicists: a social network analysis</a><span class="id">[2601.10884]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>'Closeness' is well-defined as a quantitative measure of centrality in social network analysis (SNA), but it is not as well defined qualitatively as a description of social relationships. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of 'closeness' as it is defined both implicitly and explicitly in interviews with 100 women and/or LGBTQ+ PhD physicists. The interviews include a social network construction component, and we define a quantitative network parameter that serves as a proxy for closeness, which we examine in relation to attributes of network members. We find that physicists in this sample see trust, relaxed boundaries, reliance, and support as concepts that most directly define closeness in their relationships. Consistent interaction, positive affect, and commonalities are also often present in (and in some cases, defining of) these relationships. From the quantitative analysis, we find that these physicists tend to view family and partners, friends, and professional friends as comprising their closest relationships. These results are consistent with other studies which have sought to define closeness qualitatively, but the prevalence of trust in this dataset in particular suggests that these physicists see the ability to confide as uniquely important in their relationships. We make recommendations to institutions supporting and employing physicists on how to better support gender and sexual minority (GSM) physicists going forward, and we believe these results help us gain a better understanding of how GSM physicists find success in physics despite the barriers they face due to their identities.</p></div></details></article></body>
