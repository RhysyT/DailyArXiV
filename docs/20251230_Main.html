These mechanisms can induce flux variations of similar magnitudes, shapes, and periods. We aim to determine mechanisms responsible for the sinusoidal variations in main-sequence stars hotter than 6500 K. We conducted our analysis using TESS long-cadence data complemented with high-resolution spectra from three spectrographs. From the initial sample of almost 46000 objects, we selected 35 targets for spectroscopic follow-up. Comparison of light curves and radial velocity curves allowed for robust classification of these targets. Among the 35 selected objects, 18 displayed variability, suggesting the presence of a companion (including the discovery of 7 new binary systems and 1 candidate for a triple-star system), 1 was identified as a new pulsator, 9 as new candidates for spotted stars, and 7 objects had uncertain classification. Our analysis shows that at least half of randomly selected stars with sinusoidal brightness variations are binaries. The presented results illustrate the need for an individual approach to stellar classification, especially in cases where the photometric data alone is insufficient for determining the underlying phenomena behind the observed variations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22375" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of the Moon and Binary Asteroids</a><span class="id">[2512.22375]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The proposed multi-impact model explains the formation of the Moon, Charon, and binary asteroids without invoking catastrophic cosmic events. The main elements of the new model are as follows: a. A primordial, low-mass proto-satellite disk with prograde rotation existed around the proto-Earth. b. Most of the lunar material was ejected from Earth mantle by numerous impacts of large asteroids. This naturally explains the lunar iron deficiency. c. Collisions between ejecta and particles of the prograde proto-satellite disk stabilize the fragments on satellite orbits. We demonstrate the high efficiency of the multi-impact mechanism: ejecta on prograde orbits readily merges with the prograde proto-satellite disk, whereas retrograde ejecta falls back onto Earth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22379" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulations of facular magnetic fields on cool stars I: Main sequence stars with solar metallicity</a><span class="id">[2512.22379]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar convection in the presence of magnetic field affects the emergent intensity, as well as the structure and evolution of cool main-sequence dwarfs. We aim to understand the effect of faculae-like field strengths on near-surface stellar convection using 3D radiative MHD simulations of near-surface magneto-convection. We compare simulations of F, G, K and M main-sequence stars with a small-scale dynamo (SSD) to faculae-like spatially averaged field strengths (from 100 to 500 G). We focus on the effect of imposed magnetic field on the thermodynamic stratification and velocities, along with the bolometric intensity and surface field strength. Imposed magnetic fields result in reduced average density and gas pressure near the surface compared to the SSD simulations. The temperature stratification also shows a dip at and just below the stellar surface. The changes in average bolometric intensity are within a percent, with different trends with field strength for different stellar types. In addition, the convective velocities are reduced. The magnitude of changes in thermodynamic quantities are related to field strength as well as the stellar $T_{\rm eff}$. Faculae-strength magnetic fields modify the near surface convection by reducing gas pressure and density as well as suppressing convection in regions with strong field concentrations. The strength of these effects depends on the stellar type.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chain Reactions in Space: Analyzing the Impact of Satellite Collisions and Debris Accumulation</a><span class="id">[2512.22429]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The exponential increase in artificial satellites, growing from 852 in 2004 to over 9,000 in 2023, has intensified the risk of the Kessler Syndrome: a cascading chain reaction of orbital collisions. This paper analyzes the dynamics of space debris accumulation to identify the primary orbital features contributing to this systemic risk. We compiled and analyzed Two-Line Element (TLE) datasets from this http URL and historical collision data using a Python-based data mining approach. Specifically, we derived satellite velocities using the Vis-Viva equation and evaluated the correlation of five key features, launch piece count, orbital period, apogee, perigee, and Radar Cross Section (RCS) size, with debris density. Our evaluation reveals that apogee and orbital period exhibit the strongest correlation with the risk of the Kessler Syndrome, indicating that satellites in higher orbits pose a disproportionately greater threat to long-term sustainability due to navigational constraints. Contrary to common assumptions, our data suggests that velocity and object size (RCS) show negligible direct correlation with collision incidence in the current dataset. Based on these findings, we propose mitigation strategies focusing on integrating AI-driven autonomous navigation systems and deploying advanced radiation-resistant shielding materials to enhance the resilience of high-orbit assets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22683" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Generative Reconstruction of Low-$\ell$ CMB B-Mode Signal using Reverse Diffusion in Deep Learning</a><span class="id">[2512.22683]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detecting primordial B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) provides a direct probe of inflationary gravitational waves. However, the signal is extremely faint and contaminated by gravitational lensing, instrumental noise, and astrophysical foregrounds. Here we present a score-based diffusion approach, formulated using variance-exploding stochastic differential equations (VE-SDEs), to reconstruct the primordial B-mode angular power spectrum from contaminated observations. The method employs a reverse SDE guided by a score model trained exclusively on random realizations of the primordial low $\ell$ B-mode angular power spectrum corresponding to a fixed tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.001$. During inference, the reverse SDE iteratively drives the observed angular power spectrum toward the learned primordial manifold, effectively denoising and delensing the input. The model is tested on simulated observational spectra that include gravitational lensing, complex polarized foreground combinations, and instrumental noise characteristics representative of the proposed ECHO mission. The trained score model learns the underlying statistical distribution of the primordial B-mode field for the given $r$, which acts as a physics-guided prior that can generate new, consistent realizations of the signal. This approach provides a robust framework for primordial signal recovery in future CMB polarization missions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hierarchical Test of Lorentz Invariance with Gamma-Ray Burst Spectral-Lag Measurements</a><span class="id">[2512.22875]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most potent probes of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), offering direct constraints on the quantum gravity energy scale ($E_{\rm QG}$) based on observations of energy-dependent time lags. Individual GRBs with well-defined positive-to-negative lag transitions have been used to set lower limits on $E_{\rm QG}$, but they suffer from uncertainties of spectral-lag measurements and systematics due to theoretical modeling of each burst. Here, we combine observations of 32 GRBs with positive-to-negative lag transitions to derive a statistically robust constraint on $E_{\rm QG}$ through hierarchical Bayesian inference. We find that the dominant systematic uncertainty in LIV constraints arises from the intrinsic lag modeling. Accounting for this uncertainty with cubic spline interpolation, we derive robust limits of $E_{\rm QG,1} \ge 4.37 \times 10^{16}$ GeV for linear LIV and $E_{\rm QG,2} \ge 3.02 \times 10^{8}$ GeV for quadratic LIV. We find that the probability for LIV, i.e., $E_{\rm QG,1}$ being below the Planck scale, is estimated to be around 90\%, which we conclude as no significant evidence for LIV signatures in current GRB spectral lag observations. Our hierarchical approach provides a rigorous statistical framework for future LIV searches and can be extended to incorporate multi-messenger observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22924" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial black holes within Higgs hybrid metric-Palatini approach</a><span class="id">[2512.22924]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we investigate the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) during the radiation-dominated era. The collapse of significant density perturbations originating from large primordial scalar fluctuations generated during inflation can lead to the formation of primordial black holes. In our study, we adopt the Higgs hybrid metric-Palatini model as our framework, in which the inflaton field and the Palatini curvature are non-minimally coupled. To achieve our objective, we analyze the behavior of the primordial curvature power spectrum, which exhibits a large enhancement at small scales corresponding to large wavenumbers $k$. Furthermore, we examine the probability of PBHs formation by studying the mass variance, $\sigma(M_{PBH})$, and the mass fraction of the total energy density collapsing into PBHs, $\beta(M_{PBH})$. The evolution of both functions is consistent with current observational constraints. Finally, we investigate the abundance of primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate. We found that they can account for the totality or a fraction of the current dark matter content, depending primarily on the values of the coupling constant and the e-folds number.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impacts of the $^{16}$O($^{16}$O, n)$^{31}$S reaction rate on the evolution and nucleosynthesis in Pop III massive stars</a><span class="id">[2512.22963]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We first present a systematic investigation into the effect of the $^{16}$O($^{16}$O, n)$^{31}$S reaction rate on the evolution and nucleosynthesis of Population III (Pop III) stars. We simulate the evolution of a 15 M$_\odot$ Pop III star from the zero-age main sequence through to core collapse, while varying the $^{16}$O($^{16}$O, n)$^{31}$S reaction rate by factors of 0.1, 1, and 10. Our results demonstrate that increasing this reaction rate prompts earlier onset and extended duration of core oxygen burning at lower temperatures and densities. A higher reaction rate also increases neutron excess in OSi-rich layers, thereby promoting the synthesis of neutron-rich isotopes, particularly $^{31}$P and $^{39}$K. Most notably, the K yield is enhanced by a factor of 6.4. For a tenfold enhancement of the $^{16}$O($^{16}$O, n)$^{31}$S rate, the predicted [K/Ca] and [K/Fe] values from presupernova models reach 0.29 and 0.22 dex, respectively-values that are consistent with the most recent observational data for extremely metal-poor stars. These findings hold promise as a potential new solution to the problem of potassium underproduction and offer a valuable theoretical reference and motivation for subsequent measurements of oxygen fusion reaction rate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new path to constrain the expansion history of the Universe in future spectroscopic galaxy surveys</a><span class="id">[2512.22964]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The current tension between early- and late-Universe measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), along with the still elusive nature of dark matter and dark energy, calls for model-independent probes of the Universe's expansion history. The cosmic chronometers (CC) method offers a unique opportunity to directly measure the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ without relying on any cosmological model assumptions or integrated distance measurements. Despite its potential, this technique remains statistics-limited: no current survey is optimized to detect large samples of CC, restricting the precision on $H(z)$ to $\sim$20% at intermediate redshifts. Here, we investigate the opportunities that a next-generation spectroscopic facility could offer to CC studies, providing an estimate of the accuracy achievable on the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter in redshift. We demonstrate that with such a facility, it will be possible to derive constraints on key cosmological parameters, assessing the impact that such improvements would have on our understanding of the expansion history of the Universe and on current cosmological tensions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22978" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsed, Polarized X-ray Emission from Neutron Star Surfaces: the Effects of Vacuum Birefringence in the Magnetosphere</a><span class="id">[2512.22978]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Intense magnetic fields in the atmospheres of neutron stars render non-trivial angular dependence of intensity and polarization of soft X-ray emission originating from their surfaces. By tracking the complex electric field vector for each photon during its atmospheric transport and propagation in general relativistic and birefringent magnetospheres, our Monte Carlo simulation, named MAGTHOMSCATT, allows for capturing the complete polarization properties, including the intricate interplay between linearity and circularity. The new inclusion in MAGTHOMSCATT of quantum electrodynamical influences on polarization in the magnetosphere is presented. We simulate the pulsed and polarized X-ray emission from the outer layers of optically thick, fully ionized atmospheres of neutron stars, with a focus on the radiation emitted from extended polar caps of magnetars, which are the most highly magnetized neutron stars. Using the recent intensity pulse profile data for the magnetar 1RXS J11708-4009, we constrain the geometric parameters, namely the angles between the magnetic axis and the observer's viewing direction relative to the spin axis, as well as the sizes of emission regions. The distributions of these parameters and the best-fit configuration are provided. In addition, we discuss the important impacts of vacuum birefringence in the magnetosphere on increasing the linear polarization degree. A comparison with the case of a weakly magnetized neutron star, RX J0822.0-4300, is also discussed. Our simulation still needs further development, particularly to incorporate the vacuum resonance effect. Nevertheless, the formalism presented here can be employed to constrain geometric parameters for various types of neutron stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling Multimessenger Emission from Hidden Cores of Microquasars</a><span class="id">[2512.23231]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Microquasars are radio-emitting X-ray binaries accompanied by relativistic jets. They are established sources of 100 TeV gamma rays and are considered promising candidates for cosmic-ray acceleration. Motivated by recent detections of $\sim 100~$TeV photons from Cygnus X-1 and $\sim~$PeV photons from Cygnus X-3 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we employ the Astrophysical Multimessenger Emission Simulator (AMES) to model their multimessenger emission considering compact outflow regions as cosmic-ray accelerators, spanning from radio to ultra-high-energy gamma rays. Our results show that the observed $&gt;$TeV gamma rays can originate from either $p\gamma$ or $pp$ interactions, depending on the location and physical conditions of the emission region, while also reproducing the lower-energy spectra. The different configurations yield unique, observationally testable predictions. In the $0.1-10$ TeV energy range, where current observations provide only upper limits, they predict either a deep dip, a mild suppression, or a power-law spectrum. Additionally, models involving AU-scale blob regions predict strong variability, while those invoking more extended and static external zones show more stable behavior. We also provide a possible qualitative explanation for the distinct modulation patterns across different energy bands, which relies primarily on changes in the Doppler factor and external $\gamma\gamma$ absorption. Finally, our neutrino predictions, which properly account for muon and pion cooling effects, reveal a significantly suppressed flux, indicating that detecting these sources may be more challenging than previously anticipated.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interpreting the diversity of afterglow emission from radio-detected tidal disruption events with instantaneous and delayed outflows</a><span class="id">[2512.23252]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is gravitationally disrupted by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole during a close encounter. Radio emission has recently been detected in TDEs and is commonly attributed to synchrotron radiation from both wind and jetted outflows. However, several TDEs exhibit bright radio flares at late times, which cannot be easily explained if the wind is launched promptly after the stellar disruption. In this study, we model the radio light curves of TDEs with delayed radio flares using three scenarios: an instantaneous wind, a delayed wind, and a delayed relativistic jet. We show that the instantaneous wind model struggles to reproduce delayed radio flare events, indicating the necessity of an additional delayed outflow component. In contrast, the delayed wind model provides a consistent explanation for the observed radio phenomenology, successfully reproducing events both with and without delayed radio flares. For some delayed radio flare events (e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT 2019dsg), both the delayed wind and delayed jet models can reproduce the observed radio light curves. The delayed jet model produces x-ray and optical emission that is detectable at typical TDE distances, in contrast to wind-driven scenarios. This highlights how multiwavelength observations offer an effective means of distinguishing among possible outflow mechanisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2022acko: a low-luminosity SNe IIP with signs of early circumstellar interaction</a><span class="id">[2512.23267]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present optical-ultraviolet photometry and optical spectra for the type II supernova (SN) 2022acko. The spectroscopic observations span phases from $\sim$ 1.5 to $\sim$ 60 days after the explosion, while the light curve was observed up to $\sim$ 300 days. The V-band peak is $-15.5 \pm 0.3$ mag, suggesting that SN 2022acko is a low-luminosity SN II (LLSN). The overall observed properties of SN 2022acko are consistent with those produced by a lower mass progenitor ($\rm M_{ZAMS} \sim $9-10M$_{\odot}$). The spectra at $t=1.5$d and $t=2.5$d exhibit a broad emission feature peaking near 4600 Å(the “ledge” feature), which we interpret as blueshifted He II 4686 Ålines arising from the ionized ejecta. Moreover, a possible flash-ionized (FI) emission line of H$\alpha$ (FWHM $\sim 1100\ \rm km \ s^{-1}$) was superposed on the broad emission component of H$\alpha$ P-Cgyni profile in the $t=1.5$d spectrum. Assuming an ejecta velocity of $\rm 12000\ km\ s^{-1}$, the rapid disappearance of this narrow H$\alpha$ emission line within two days suggests highly confined CSM within $\sim \rm 2\times10^{14}\, cm$. Assuming a spherically symmetric CSM, the mass loss rate within this radius is estimated to be $\rm \sim 5 \times 10^{-4} M_{\odot} \ year^{-1}$ based on our hybrid light curve model. The early “ledge” feature observed in SN 2022acko have also been observed in other SNe II, suggesting that early-phase circumstellar interaction (CSI) is more common than previously thought.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Constraints on Cosmic-ray boosted Sub-GeV Dark Matter via Light Mediators</a><span class="id">[2512.23282]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Traditional direct detection experiments lack the sensitivity to probe the sub-GeV dark matter (DM), primarily due to the low energy of the expected nuclear recoils. In this work, we investigate cosmic-ray (CR) upscattering as a mechanism to accelerate DM particles to detectable velocities in underground experiments. By analyzing four models of DM-nucleon interactions – namely scalar, vector, pseudoscalar, and axial-vector mediators – we derive constraints on the coupling parameters using data from the LZ, XENON, and Borexino experiments, covering mediator mass from $10^{-6}$ to $1$ GeV. As the mediator mass varies, the shift in dominance between momentum transfer and mediator mass leads to a turnover in the constraints around $10^{-2}$–$10^{-3}~\mathrm{GeV}$. Our results extend the reach of direct detection into the sub-GeV window and clarify the critical role of momentum dependence in light-mediator scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23354" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kilonova and progenitor properties of merger-driven gamma-ray bursts</a><span class="id">[2512.23354]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) prompt and afterglow emission, as well as a kilonova (KN), are the expected electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of Binary Neutron Star (BNS) and Neutron Star – Black Hole (NSBH) mergers. We aim to infer the KN ejecta parameters and the progenitor properties by modeling merger-driven GRBs with a claim of KN, good data and robust redshift measurement. We model the afterglow and KN, and perform a Bayesian analysis, within the Nuclear physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (NMMA) framework. The KN emission is modeled with the radiative transfer code POSSIS and for afterglow we use the afterglowpy library. In contrast to previous approaches, our methodology simultaneously models both afterglow and KN. We find that all GRBs in our sample have a KN, but we were unable to confirm or exclude its presence in GRB 150101B. A BNS progenitor is favored for GRB 160821B, GRB 170817A/AT2017gfo, GRB 211211A, and GRB 230307A. For GRB 150101B and GRB 191019A, we obtain a slight preference for NSBH scenario, while a BNS is also viable. For KN emission, we find that the median wind mass $\langle M_{\rm wind}\rangle=0.027^{+0.046}_{-0.019}$ $M_{\odot}$ is larger than the dynamical $\langle M_{\rm dyn}\rangle = 0.012^{+0.007}_{-0.006}$ $M_{\odot}$. We find that $M_{\rm wind}$ and the beaming corrected kinetic energy of the jet can be attributed as $log(M_{\rm wind})=-20.23+0.38\,log(E_{0,J})$. We confirm the results of numerical simulation that $\tilde\Lambda$ increases with decrease in $\mathcal{M}_{\rm \,Chirp}$. Our work shows that EM modeling can be effective for probing the progenitors, and for the first time presents the progenitor properties of a sizable sample of merger-driven GRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the Reported Period of FRB 20201124A Using MCMC Methods</a><span class="id">[2512.23392]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients whose phys- ical origin remains uncertain.

We identified four high-flux states and investigated the possibility of a QPO in the fourth high-flux state (MJD 59482-60832). Using the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) methods, we find tentative evidence for a month-scale QPO; however, its detection significance is limited by the small number of observed cycles. With a sufficiently long data set, the QPO may be detected with higher significance in the future. We further explored possible physical origins of this potential QPO and examined several models. We found that a curved-jet model can explain the observed behaviour.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three channel dissipative warm Higgs inflation with global inference via genetic algorithms</a><span class="id">[2512.23423]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper constructs and analyzes a three channel dissipative framework for Warm Higgs Inflation, wherein the total dissipation coefficient, $\Upsilon(h,T)$, is decomposed into low temperature, high temperature, and threshold activated contributions. A genetic algorithm is employed for the global numerical solution and statistical inference of the background field dynamics. To overcome the single channel dominance degeneracy in high dimensional parameter scans, two classes of structural priors are introduced into the objective function: a \texttt{mixing} prior to suppress extreme channel fractions and an \texttt{entropy} prior to favor multi channel coexistence. Furthermore, the adoption of a layered warmness criterion (e.g., $Q \equiv \Upsilon/3H$) decouples model selection from cosmological observables, thereby enhancing analytical transparency. The complete workflow is demonstrated on a $14$ dimensional phenomenological model. An ablation study of the priors (\texttt{noprior} vs. \texttt{mixing} vs. \texttt{mixing+entropy}) yields $18871$ viable parameter points, revealing that the priors significantly enhance the discovery probability of non-trivial multi channel solutions within a parameter space naturally biased towards single channel dominance. After imposing the observational constraint $r &lt; 0.036$, the number of retained solutions for each scenario is $14485$, $1889$, and $1971$, respectively.

The bolometric light curve indicates a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.120\pm0.003~\text{M}_{\odot}$, with an estimated ejecta mass of $0.79\pm0.09~\text{M}_{\odot}$ and kinetic energy of $0.19\times10^{51}$ erg. The spectral evolution from -8 to +110 days past maximum reveals features characteristic of bright Type Iax Supernovae, including a transition from Fe III to Fe II dominance, moderate expansion velocities, and a lack of strong C III absorption. TARDIS spectral modelling of the early-phase spectra indicates a well-mixed ejecta dominated by Fe-group elements. In addition, traces of unburnt carbon are detected, pointing to incomplete burning as expected in pure deflagration models. Late-time spectral evolution shows a blend of permitted and forbidden lines. Comparison with deflagration models suggests that SN 2022eyw originated from a partial deflagration of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, with explosion properties intermediate between the N3-def and N5-def models. These observations support pure deflagration of a CO white dwarf as a viable explosion mechanism for its luminous members.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observations of the Fermi bubbles and the Galactic center excess with the DArk Matter Particle Explorer</a><span class="id">[2512.23458]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a space-borne high-energy particle detector that surveys the $\gamma$-ray sky above$\sim 2~\rm GeV$ with a peak acceptance of $\sim 0.2~\rm m^2\,sr$.

The primary aim of this study is to investigate the orbital migration of the Galilean moons by incorporating self-consistent solid dynamics in circumjovian disk models. We perform two-fluid simulations using the FARGO3D code on a 2D polar grid. The simulations model a satellite with the mass of a proto-moon, Europa, or Ganymede interacting with a circumjovian disk. The dust component, coupled to the gas via a drag force, is characterized by the dust-to-gas mass ratio ($\epsilon$) and the Stokes number ($T_s$). The effect of solids fundamentally alter the satellites' evolution. We identify a vast parameter space where migration is slowed, halted, robustly reversed -leading to outward migration-, or significantly accelerated inward. The migration rate is dependent on satellite mass, providing a natural source of differential migration. Solid dynamics provides a robust and self-consistent mechanism that fundamentally alters the migration of the Galilean moons, potentially addressing the long-standing migration catastrophe. This mechanism critically affects the survival of satellites and could offer a viable physical process to explain the establishment of resonances through differential migration. These findings establish that solid torques are a critical, non-negligible factor in shaping the final architecture of satellite systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limits on dark matter existence in neutron stars from recent astrophysical observations and mass correlation analysis</a><span class="id">[2512.23577]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANSs) serve as a specific astrophysical laboratory for probing the features of dark matter (DM) and have emerged as a promising candidate for interpreting recent astrophysical observations (e.g., by NICER and LIGO/Virgo). Accurately constraining the internal DM content of DANSs is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we construct the equations of state (EoS) for DANS matter by employing twelve nuclear matter (NM) models within the covariant density functional (CDF) theory and a self-interacting fermionic model for DM. Using these EoSs as input, we solve the two-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations to systematically investigate the influence of DM on the global properties of neutron stars (NSs). By incorporating recent observational constraints on NS properties, the maximum DM mass fraction $f_\chi^{\mathrm{max}}$ in DANSs is determined for each NM EoS model. Our analysis reveals a strong linear correlation (Pearson coefficient $r=0.98$) between $f_\chi^{\mathrm{max}}$ and the maximum mass of a pure NS, $M_{\rm{NS}}^{\mathrm{max}}$, described by $f_{\chi}^{\mathrm{max}} = 0.22 M_{\mathrm{NS}}^{\mathrm{max}} - 0.44$. Leveraging this correlation and the observed NS maximum mass distribution, $P(M_{\text{NS}}^{\max} \mid \text{EM})$, we derive the probability distribution function (PDF) for the maximum DM mass, $P(M_{\chi}^{\max} \mid \text{EM})$, in DANSs. We find that at the 68\% confidence level, $M_{\chi}^{\mathrm{max}}=0.150^{+0.070}_{-0.051}\ M_{\odot}$. This quantitative constraint on the DM mass provides a critical prior for interpreting potential observational signatures of DANSs, such as anomalous tidal deformabilities and distinctive gravitational-wave signals.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23645" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 24 Aqr triple system: A closer look at its unique high-eccentricity hierarchical architecture</a><span class="id">[2512.23645]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As its periastron passage occurred during the third quarter of 2020, system 24 Aqr is of particular significance.

These events are characterized by a sufficiently long quiescent period during which the on-board trigger system can reset, resulting in the subsequent emission being recorded as a second independent event. Consistent sky localization confirms that both trigger events originated from the same astrophysical source. Here, we present a systematic classification and characteristics study of three such cases: GRB 091024A, GRB 110709B, and GRB 220627A. We investigate each trigger episode emission independently using standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), spectral lag ($\tau_{\rm lag}$), peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$), and energetics. We compare these properties with those of typical long GRBs (LGRBs) and with single-trigger LGRBs that exhibit extended quiescent periods. Our analysis reveals that all sub-bursts from the three double-trigger events consistently lie within the LGRB classification region. These results indicate that double-trigger GRBs are not a physically distinct subclass, but rather products of LGRB central engines that undergo extended dormancy and subsequent reactivation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational waves from seesaw assisted collapsing domain walls</a><span class="id">[2512.22339]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries like $Z_2$ leads to the formation of stable topological defects such as domain walls which, if allowed to dominate, can potentially be in conflict with cosmological observations.

The resulting rules closely resemble those familiar from flat-space scattering amplitudes, but with an additional subtlety: in order to express the discontinuity of a correlator as the product of lower-order correlators, one must introduce a specific combinations of diagrams which do not appear in the computation of observables themselves.

These microscopic structures modify both the kinetic and interaction contributions to the Equation of State (EOS) of dense matter and thereby influence a broad range of neutron-star (NS) properties. This short review provides a streamlined overview of how SRC-induced changes in $n(k)$ reshape the kinetic EOS, including its symmetry energy part and how these effects propagate into macroscopic NS observables, including mass-radius relations, tidal deformabilities, direct Urca thresholds and core-crust transition.

Nevertheless, we found that, to have a realistic mass-radius relation of neutron stars, the $\pi N$ sigma term $\sigma_{\pi N}$, which denotes the contribution of explicit symmetry breaking, should deviate from its empirical values at vacuum.

As the modification parameter $\alpha$ increases, neutron stars grow in both radius and mass. We find that, when the parameter $\alpha$ is sufficiently large, a frozen state emerges at the end of the neutron-star sequence. In this state, the metric functions approach zero extremely close to the stellar surface, forming a critical horizon, making it nearly indistinguishable from a black hole to an external observer. Such a frozen neutron star constitutes a universal endpoint of the neutron-star sequence in this theory, independent of the choice of the equation of state.

We further analyze perturbative reheating by solving the standard Boltzmann equation in both Jordan and Einstein frames, and compare the results with the non-perturbative ones. Finally, embedding this infrared reheating scenario into the well-known $\alpha-$attractor inflationary model, we examine possible constraints on the model parameters in light of the latest ACT, DESI results. To arrive at the constraints, we take into account the latest bounds on tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{0.05}\leq 0.038$, isocurvature power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{S}} \lesssim 8.3\times 10^{-11}$, and effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.17 $. Subject to these constraints, we find successful reheating to occur only for EoS $w_{\phi}\gtrsim 0.6$, which translates to a sub-class of $\alpha-$attractor models being favored and placing them within the 2$\sigma$ region in the $ n_s-r$ plane of the latest ACT, DESI data. In this range of EoS, we find that the coupling strength should lie within $2.11\lesssim\xi\lesssim 2.95$ for $w_{\phi}=0.6$. Finally, we compute secondary gravitational wave signals induced by the scalar infrared modes, which are found to be strong enough to be detected by future GW observatories, namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating FRB 20240114A with FAST: Morphological Classification and Drifting Rate Measurements in a Burst-Cluster Framework</a><span class="id">[2507.14711]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study investigates the morphological classification and drifting rate measurement of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20240114A using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). Detected on January 14, 2024, FRB 20240114A exhibited an exceptionally high burst rate, revealing unique properties. Through observational campaigns over several months, we selected a dataset comprising 3,203 bursts (2,109 burst-clusters) during a continuous monitoring session (15,780 seconds) on March 12, 2024. Improving upon previous work, we clarify the definitions of sub-bursts, bursts and burst-clusters. Using an average dispersion measures (DM) of 529.2 pc cm$^{-3}$, we classified the burst-clusters into Downward Drifting, Upward Drifting, No Drifting, No Evidence for Drifting, Not-Clear, and Complex burst-clusters. Among the 978 burst-clusters that exhibit drifting behavior, 233 (23.82%) show upward drifting. Additionally, if 142 upward drifting single-component burst-clusters are excluded, upward drifting double- and multi-component burst-clusters still account for 10.89% of the 836 burst-clusters exhibiting drifting behavior, equating to 91 burst-clusters. Furthermore, if only upward drifting burst-clusters with consecutive time intervals (or upward drifting bursts) are considered, only 9 bursts remain. Drifting rate comparisons with other physical quantities reveal that the drifting rate increases with peak frequency for single-component burst-clusters with drifting behavior. Moreover, in single-component burst-clusters, those with upward drifting exhibit smaller effective widths, bandwidths, and fluxes than their downward drifting counterparts. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test further indicates that upward drifting burst-clusters possess longer consecutive time intervals than downward drifting ones, suggesting distinct underlying physical mechanisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Lyman-$α$ Forest from LBGs: First 3D Correlation Measurement with DESI and Prospects for Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2507.21852]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest is a key tracer of large-scale structure at redshifts z &gt; 2, traditionally studied using spectra of quasars. Here, we explore the viability Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) as alternative background sources for Ly$\alpha$ forest studies. We analyze 4,151 Ly$\alpha$ forest skewers extracted from LBG spectra obtained in the DESI pilot surveys in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. We present the first measurement of the Ly$\alpha$ forest auto-correlation function derived exclusively from LBG spectra, probing comoving separations up to 48 $h^{-1}$Mpc at an effective redshift of $z_\mathrm{eff}$ = 2.70. The measured signal is consistent with that from DESI DR2 quasar Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra at a comparable redshift, validating LBGs as reliable background sources. We also measure the cross-correlation between the LBG Ly$\alpha$ forest and 13,362 galaxy positions, showing that this observable serves as a sensitive diagnostic for galaxy redshift uncertainties and systematic offsets. Finally, using synthetic LBG spectra and Fisher forecasts, we show that a future wide-area survey over 5000 deg$^2$, targeting 1000 LBGs per deg$^2$ at similar signal-to-noise than our dataset, could enable Ly$\alpha$ forest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements with 0.4% precision on the isotropic BAO scale and 1.3% on the anisotropic (Alcock-Paczynski) scale. Combining BAO with a Ly$\alpha$ forest full-shape analysis improves the AP constraint to 0.6%. These results open a new path for precision cosmology at high redshift using dense LBG samples.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09704" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cooling of dark neutron stars</a><span class="id">[2508.09704]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the cooling of isolated dark-matter-admixed neutron stars, employing a realistic nuclear equation of state and realistic nuclear pairing gaps, together with fermionic dark matter of variable particle mass and dark-matter fraction.

Using the unfocused stray light mode of the instrument, which provides a wide field-of-view and a stable instrumental background, we perform a sensitive search for photon signatures from dark matter annihilation in the Galactic halo. We model the resulting diffuse X-ray spectrum over the 3-20 keV energy range and search for line-like spectral features that may arise from the annihilation of dark matter particles into photons. No statistically significant excess over the expected astrophysical background is found. We therefore place upper limits on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ as a function of dark matter mass, assuming a velocity-independent s-wave annihilation and several Galactic dark matter profiles. Across most of the explored mass range our results provide the strongest X-ray constraints to date, reaching the level of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \lesssim 10^{-33}$ – $10^{-34}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, and they are complementary to the most recent bounds derived from SRG/ART-XC observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25083" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extended mass distribution of PBHs during QCD phase transition: SGWB and mini-EMRIs</a><span class="id">[2509.25083]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) are one of the most important tracers of cosmic history. In this work, we investigate the formation of PBHs around the time of the QCD phase transition from a broadly peaked inflationary scalar power spectrum, which naturally produces an extended PBH mass function. This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25915" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Formation of Electron-capture Supernovae: A Review</a><span class="id">[2509.25915]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is generally believed that the electron-capture reactions happen when the oxygen-neon (ONe) cores grow in masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit, leading to the formation of neutron stars (NSs) via electron-capture supernovae (EC-SNe). EC-SNe are predicted to be the most likely short-lived and faint optical transients, and a small ejecta mass is expected during the collapse. This kind of SNe provide an alternative channel for producing isolated NSs and NS systems, especially for the formation of X-ray binaries and double NSs. Although EC-SNe were proposed  45 yr ago, there are still some uncertainties for the origin of EC-SNe. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor channels of EC-SNe, i.e., the single star channel and the binary star channel. In the single star channel, EC-SNe can happen in super asymptotic giant branch stars or He stars, whereas in the binary star channel EC-SNe can occur in He stars in binaries (involving He star+MS systems and NS+He star systems) or accretion-induced collapse in white dwarf binaries (involving the single-degenerate scenario and the double-degenerate scenario). Recent progress on the two progenitor channels is discussed, including the initial parameter range for EC-SNe, the evolutionary paths to EC-SNe, related objects and some observational constraints, etc. We also make some discussions on the possible candidates for EC-SNe in this article, and the impacts of EC-SNe on some research fields, e.g., the properties of NSs, double NS population and chemical products, etc. We also discuss the differences between EC-SNe and ultra-stripped SNe in this article. Research on EC-SNe is at a pivotal stage, with key theoretical uncertainties and observational challenges requiring integrated modeling and multi-wavelength observations for robust identification.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25419" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Unified Photometric Redshift Calibration for Weak Lensing Surveys using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</a><span class="id">[2510.25419]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The effective redshift distribution $n(z)$ of galaxies is a critical component in the study of weak gravitational lensing. Here, we introduce a new method for determining $n(z)$ for weak lensing surveys based on high-quality redshifts and neural network-based importance weights. Additionally, we present the first unified photometric redshift calibration of the three leading stage-III weak lensing surveys, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey and the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), with state-of-the-art spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We verify our method using a new, data-driven approach and obtain $n(z)$ constraints with statistical uncertainties of order $\sigma_{\bar z} \sim 0.01$ and smaller. Our analysis is largely independent of previous photometric redshift calibrations and, thus, provides an important cross-check in light of recent cosmological tensions. Overall, we find excellent agreement with previously published results on the DES Y3 and HSC Y1 data sets while there are some differences on the mean redshift with respect to the previously published KiDS-1000 results. We attribute the latter to mismatches in photometric noise properties in the COSMOS field compared to the wider KiDS SOM-gold catalog. At the same time, the new $n(z)$ estimates for KiDS do not significantly change estimates of cosmic structure growth from cosmic shear. Finally, we discuss how our method can be applied to future weak lensing calibrations with DESI data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar – I.

The radiative transfer within the emitting region and the structure of the latter are calculated with the use of the self-consistent algorithm developed earlier. The magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on the photon energy and polarization have been incorporated. Second-order bulk Comptonization over entire emitting region, induced Compton scattering, the switching of the polarization modes, free-free processes, the cyclotron emission because of electron-proton collisions, and a realistic shape of the accretion channel have been taken into account. The case of a dipole magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect can play a notable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock zone. Within the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than in the post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons gaining the energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the thermal Doppler effect are responsible for the formation of high-energy regions in the emergent continuum of the polarization modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Study the nature of dynamical dark energy by measuring the CMB polarization rotation angle</a><span class="id">[2511.04459]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) support the dynamical dark energy. Intriguingly, the data favor a transition of the dark energy equation of state across $w=-1$, a hallmark of the Quintom scenario. In this paper, we consider a different approach to the dynamical nature of dark energy by investigating its interaction with ordinary matters, specifically the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction with photons. In cosmology, this interaction rotates the polarized plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, which induces non-zero polarized TB and EB power spectra. We forecast this measurement with the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) experiment. We take the best-fit value of the isotropic rotation angle from Planck data as our fiducial input. We project that 11 module-year (modyr) of observations will yield an improved detection sensitivity with a significance $\sim 5\sigma$, given a calibration precision of $0.1^\circ$ in the polarization angle. We also forecast AliCPT's sensitivity to the amplitude of a scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropic polarization rotation field. With $50$ modyr of observations, the large-aperture configuration is expected to reach $\sigma_{A_{\mathrm{CB}}}\sim10^{-2}$, offering a sixfold improvement over the small-aperture design and enabling competitive tests of spatial fluctuations in the dark energy field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starobinsky Inflation and the Latest CMB Data: A Subtle Tension?</a><span class="id">[2511.06640]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the Starobinsky inflation model and the impact of curvature corrections, particularly a cubic $R^3$ term, to assess their behavior in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).

In this paper, we implement the Starobinsky inflationary potential directly into the CLASS code, without relying on the slow-roll approximation, and we constrain the number of e-folds of inflation $N_k$ using a theoretically motivated range derived from reheating considerations and standard couplings between matter fields and gravity. We show that it is still possible to identify a significant region of parameter space where the Starobinsky model remains highly consistent with the latest observational data.

The model provides an excellent fit to the data, with a reduced chi-squared of $\chi^2_{\text{red}} = 0.989$, while successfully alleviating the Hubble constant tension. Our analysis yields a Hubble constant of $H_0 \approx 72.820$ km/s/Mpc, reducing the discrepancy between early and late-universe measurements. We find that the data favors a 'thawing' quintessence scenario, characterized by a potential slope parameter $\lambda \approx 0.056$. This small but non-zero slope drives a late-time deviation from $\Lambda$CDM ($w(z=0) \approx -0.85$) while preserving the standard expansion history at high redshifts. A model comparison using the Bayesian Information Criterion finds that the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is still slightly preferred ($\Delta\text{BIC} = 2.178$) due to its fewer parameters. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that this hybrid potential model is a compelling, physically motivated alternative to a cosmological constant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doppler imaging combined with high-cadence photometry.

In particular, we seek to assess how the inclusion of continuous high-precision TESS photometry in parallel with high-resolution spectroscopy improves latitude recovery of starspots, especially at low latitudes and in the southern hemisphere, which are poorly constrained by Doppler imaging (DI) alone. We explore the spatial origins of the observed white-light flares. We performed simultaneous Doppler imaging and light curve inversion (DI+LCI) using contemporaneous high-resolution GAOES-RV spectra from the 3.8 m Seimei telescope (R 65000) and high-precision TESS light curves. Surface reconstructions employ the SpotDIPy code to model both line profiles and continuum brightness variations. We compare DI+LCI maps with DI-only solutions, conduct artificial-spot simulations to evaluate the effects of latitude, phase coverage, and S/N on reconstruction reliability. We also investigate the spatial correlation between the DI+LCI reconstructed map and flares detected in the TESS data. The DI+LCI reconstruction reveals significant spot features at mid-to-low latitudes, equatorial regions, and even in the southern hemisphere. Simulations show that DI+LCI provides more accurate reconstructions than DI-only, especially under conditions of incomplete phase coverage and low S/N, by better recovering both spot latitudes and filling factors. A comparison between the DI+LCI map and the TESS flare timings also suggests potential association between flare occurrence and reconstructed spot longitudes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecting clustering and the cosmic web:Observational constraints on secondary halo bias</a><span class="id">[2511.19607]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmological simulations predict significant secondary dependencies of halo clustering on internal properties and environment. Detecting these subtle signals in observational data remains challenging, with important ramifications for galaxy evolution and cosmology. We probe secondary halo bias in observational survey data, using galaxy groups as dark matter halo proxies. We quantify secondary bias using central galaxy colour and environmental diagnostics. We use an extended, refined galaxy group catalogue from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Secondary bias is defined as any deviation in group clustering strength at fixed mass, quantified through the projected two-point correlation function. Our environmental analysis uses DisPerSE to compute distances to critical points of the density field, incorporating local group overdensity measurements on multiple scales. We robustly detect several forms of secondary bias in the clustering of galaxy groups. At fixed mass, groups hosting red central galaxies are more strongly clustered than those with blue centrals, with $b_{\rm relative}$ ranging from $\sim 1.2$ for the 15\% reddest centrals to $\sim 0.8$ for the bluest ones. Environmental dependencies based on cosmic-web distances are also present, though significantly weaker and largely mass-independent. The strongest signal arises from local overdensity: groups in the densest 15\% of environments reach $b_{\rm relative} \sim 1.4$, while those in the least dense regions fall to $b_{\rm relative} \sim 0.7$. These results establish a clear observational hierarchy for secondary halo bias. The colour of central galaxies correlates with the local group overdensity, which, in turn, correlates with the bias at fixed group mass. Assuming that central galaxy colour traces halo assembly history, this three-stage picture offers a conceptual link between our results and halo assembly bias.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Search for Hard X-ray/Soft $γ$-ray Emission from SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell 3667) Using INTEGRAL/ISGRI</a><span class="id">[2512.12616]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a search for hard X-ray/soft $\gamma$-ray emission from the merging galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell 3667) using archival INTEGRAL/ISGRI observations.

The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, with the $\chi^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3\sigma$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cygnus X-3: A variable petaelectronvolt gamma-ray source</a><span class="id">[2512.16638]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of variable $\gamma$-rays up to petaelectronvolt from Cygnus X-3, an iconic X-ray binary.

This test will be applicable for future detectors, which will achieve signal-to-noise ratios higher than 100 (and as high as 1000 for space-based detectors such as LISA). Such sensitivity will allow measurement of these modes with amplitude ratios as low as 0.02 for ground-based detectors (and as low as 0.003 for LISA), relative to the fundamental mode, enabling stringent agnostic constraints or detection of scalar/vector modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modified Models for Neutrino Masses and Mixings</a><span class="id">[2411.08517]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The neutrino sector of the seesaw-modified Standard Model is investigated under the anarchy principle.

This study presents a combined approach using Liouville mapping and the field-particle correlation technique to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the velocity-space signature of ion cyclotron damping. Liouville mapping offers a computationally efficient way to predict perturbations to the particle velocity distribution function using single-particle trajectories in prescribed electromagnetic fields. One may apply the field-particle correlation technique to these perturbed velocity distributions to reveal the unique velocity-space signatures of the secular energy transfer rate associated with specific wave-particle interactions. We validate this method by reproducing known Landau damping signatures for kinetic Alfvén waves, and then we apply this method to ion cyclotron waves where ion cyclotron damping dominates. The resulting velocity-space signature reveals distinct energization features of ion cyclotron damping : (i) a quadrupolar pattern in the perpendicular $(v_x, v_y)$ plane; and (ii) a localized energization near the $n = 1$ resonant velocity in gyrotropic $(v_\parallel, v_\perp)$ velocity-space. The quantitative patterns remain unchanged as the ion plasma beta $\beta_i$ is varied, ultimately showing minimal $v_\perp$ dependence on $\beta_i$ of the velocity-space signature at the $n = 1$ resonant velocity. This work provides a systematic study of how the ion cyclotron damping signature varies with $\beta_i$, offering a practical foundation to identify ion cyclotron damping using kinetic simulation data or spacecraft data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electron Inertia and Magnetic Reconnection</a><span class="id">[2509.14400]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of a magnetic field $\vec{B}$, the field lines of $\vec{B}$ reconnect, but the lines of a related field $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ do not. $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (c/\omega_{pe})^2\mu_0\vec{j} \right)$ with $\omega_{pe}$ the plasma frequency and $\vec{j}$ the current density.

Three results are given: (1) A relatively simple demonstration in three dimensional space that the lines of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ do not reconnect when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect. (2) The guiding center motion of charged particles is modified by a term that is proportional to $(c/\omega_{pe})^2$, which is smaller than the drifts proportional to the gyroradius unless the current density is extremely large. (3) In three dimensional space, the evolution velocity of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ is characteristically chaotic, which means neighboring streamlines separate exponentially on a timescale $\tau_u$. $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ undergoes large scale reconnection on a timescale that is only an order of magnitude or two longer than $\tau_u$ unless all diffusive non-ideal effects, such as resistivity, are absolutely zero.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light thermal dark matter models in the light of DAMIC-M 2025 constraints</a><span class="id">[2509.16319]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the viability of light thermal dark matter (DM) in sub-GeV mass range in view of the stringent new DAMIC-M limits on DM-electron scattering.

As an illustrative example of the first class of models, we consider a gauged $L_\mu-L_\tau$ extension of the SM having interesting detection prospects at several experiments. While both of these class of models lead to observed DM relic and consistency with DAMIC-M together with other experimental limits, the second class of models also lead to strong DM self-interactions, potentially solving the small-scale structure issues of cold dark matter. While a vast part of the parameter space in both the models is already ruled out, the current allowed region of parameter space can be further probed at ongoing or future experiments keeping the models testable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some Properties of Multi-Component Axion Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2510.22569]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a mechanism for multi-component dark matter (DM) that originates from axion mixing and present some of its defining properties. In this context, multi-component DM implies that the cold DM is composed of the QCD axion and many ultra-light axion-like particles (ALPs). This framework can be realized in the type IIB string axiverse with hierarchical axion masses and decay constants. Our investigation reveals that in the light QCD axion scenario, the energy density of the lightest ALP often dominates after mixing. On the other hand, in the heavy QCD axion scenario, both the QCD axion and non-lightest ALPs may dominate, depending on the ALP decay constants. Under certain conditions, the QCD axion can dominate the DM budget. Finally, we briefly discuss a theoretical framework featuring $\sim\mathcal{O}(100)$ axions, with hierarchical axion masses and decay constants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Higher Curvature Inflation and the Species Scale</a><span class="id">[2510.23715]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the scalar potentials that arise from higher curvature corrections in general $f(R)$ theories of gravity and their connection to a dynamical species scale.

GR was created by A. Einstein in 1915. In 1917 Einstein proposed the first (static) cosmological model. Soon after the A. Eddington proved that the model is unstable therefore it can not be realizable in nature. In 1922 and 1924 A. A. Friedmann found non-stationary solutions for cosmological equations written in the framework of GR. In 1927 G. Lemaitre obtained very similar results and, in addition, he derived the Hubble law (E. Hubble obtained this law from observations). Unfortunately, G. Lemaitre published his paper in not very popular Belgium journal. In 1931 Lemaitre proposed the first version of hot Universe model (he called it hypothesis of the primeval atom). In his book Lemaitre predicted even a background radiation as a signature of his model. One of the important property of the Lemaitre – Gamow model was a prediction of CMB radiation with a temperature around a few K. It was recalled that the discovery of CMB radiation was done by T. Shmaonov in 1956 and his paper was published in 1957 (several years before Penzias and Wilson). In 1965, 1970 E. B. Gliner proposed vacuum like equation of matter which could correspond to exponential explosion of the Universe which was later called inflation. For decades in USSR, Friedmann's cosmological non-stationary models were treated as purely mathematical results without cosmologocal applications. On September 16, 1925 passed away untimely and it would be reasonable to remind today his great contribution in physical cosmology since the authors of book on Friedmann wrote that &quot;similarly to Copernicus who forced the Earth to move Friedmann forced the Universe to expand&quot;.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15815" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streamlined Supergravity</a><span class="id">[2511.15815]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The textbook N=1 supergravity has an F-term potential depending on a superpotential $W(z_i)$ and a Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$, with the scalar potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})=e^K (|DW|^2 - 3 |W|^2)$. In this approach, it is not always easy to find the potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ with the required properties. We show that in supergravity with a nilpotent superfield and with any Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i} )$ one can obtain any desired potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ by a proper choice of the Kahler metric of the nilpotent superfield.

Currently, the values of the three masses only have upper limits from cosmology and experiments like KATRIN. This paper shows that the SN 1987A neutrino data can remarkably yield values for the three neutrino masses, and not merely upper limits. Although this seemingly preposterous idea was suggested a dozen years ago by the author, here it is demonstrated in a much more convincing manner with many new elements, including a stronger statistical treatment, and a thorough explanation of why the method used to find the three masses from supernova SN 1987A neutrino data really works. The key to finding the three neutrino masses is realizing why three normally accepted assumptions are unjustified, The three rejected assumptions are:(a) the 5-hr early LSD (Mont Blanc) neutrinos are unrelated to SN 1987A, (b) any neutrino masses $m_k&gt;1 eV/c^2$ cannot be reconciled with upper limits on the “effective mass&quot; from KATRIN and other data, and (c) the spread in neutrino emission times from SN 1987A data is too great for the method to work. A particularly crucial piece of evidence supporting the claim made in the paper's title involves a recent negative KATRIN result finding an absence of sterile neutrinos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A mini-review on combinatorial solutions to the Marcus-Lushnikov irreversible aggregation</a><span class="id">[2512.11459]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modified light-cylinder and centrifugal acceleration in Schwarzschild geometry</a><span class="id">[2512.16337]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine the motion of an electron constrained to follow a magnetic field line near a primordial sub-stellar mass black hole.

However, this picture changes significantly when gravity is included. By analyzing the electron's dynamics in the Schwarzschild metric, we obtain a modified light cylinder (MLC) whose geometry no longer resembles a cylinder.
