<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Historical Debates over the Physical Reality of the Wave Function</a><span class="id">[2602.09397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper provides a detailed historical account of early debates over wave-function realism, the modern term for the view that the wave function of quantum theory is physically real. As this paper will show, the idea of physical waves associated with particles had its roots in work by Einstein and de Broglie, who both originally thought of these waves as propagating in three-dimensional physical space. De Broglie quickly turned this wave-particle duality into an early pilot-wave theory, on which a particle's associated phase wave piloted or guided the particle along its trajectory. Schrödinger built on de Broglie's phase-wave hypothesis to provide a comprehensive account of the nascent quantum theory. However, Schrödinger's new undulatory mechanics came at the cost of replacing de Broglie's phase waves propagating in physical space with a wave function propagating in a system's abstract configuration space. The present work will argue that this move from three-dimensional physical space to a many-dimensional configuration space was a key reason why the founders of quantum theory uniformly abandoned the physical reality of the wave function. This paper will further clarify that de Broglie introduced two distinct pilot-wave theories, and will then argue that it was Bohm's rediscovery of the second of these two pilot-wave theories over two decades later, as well as Bohm's vociferous defense of wave-function realism, that were responsible for resurrecting the idea of an ontological wave function. This idea ended up playing a central role in Everett's development of the many-worlds interpretation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schrodinger Was Right!</a><span class="id">[2602.09033]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Now that we have reached the centennial of Erwin Schrodinger's seminal paper introducing the wavefunction theory of matter, it is right and proper to inquire as to its legacy. It is undeniable that today every paper in atomic physics cites his 1926 equation in the first paragraph. But the philosophy undergirding the wavefunction seems to have fallen into the shadows. And Schrodinger left his program incomplete. I will argue here that recent developments in nonlinear mathematics, including so-called &quot;chaos theory&quot;, permit finishing the task. It turns out that one nonlinear addition to his equation from 1926 can resolve both the Measurement Problem and the Randomness Problem. With this emendation, the wavefunction alone suffices to explain the outcomes of many experiments (and it is particles that can be relegated to the shadows).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Trouble with Weak Values</a><span class="id">[2602.09380]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In quantum theory, a weak value is a complex number with a somewhat technical definition: it is a ratio whose numerator is the matrix element of a self-adjoint operator and whose denominator is the inner product of a corresponding pair of state vectors. Weak values first appeared in the research literature in a pair of papers in 1987 and 1988, and were originally defined as the results of a special kind of experimental protocol involving non-disturbing measurements combined with an explicit form of post-selection. In the years since, subsequent papers on weak values have produced a number of important practical spin-offs, including new methods for signal amplification and quantum-state tomography. The present work is not concerned with those practical spin-offs, but with historical and ongoing attempts to assign weak values a transparent, single-system interpretation, as well as efforts that invoke weak values to make a number of exotic claims about the properties and behavior of individual quantum systems. This paper challenges these interpretational claims by arguing that they involve several forms of fallacious reasoning.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</a><span class="id">[2601.03567]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf 1^2[\mathcal C]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. All physical predictions are local scale invariant, even in the presence of mass terms. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schrödinger and Pauli equations, and for the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, each coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique. Our results provide a pivotal understanding of local scale invariance in quantum theory.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09550" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Search to GenAI Queries: Global Trends in Physics Information-Seeking Across Topics and Regions</a><span class="id">[2602.09550]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) marks a potential inflection point in the way academic information is accessed, raising fundamental questions about the evolving role of search in student learning. This study examines this shift by analyzing longitudinal trends in physics-related search and page-view activity, using declines in traditional search behavior as a quantitative proxy for changes in independent information-seeking practices. We analyze Google Trends data for core concepts in Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism across three academic years (2022-2025) in more than 20 countries, and complement this analysis with Wikipedia page-view data across seven major languages to establish platform independence. The results reveal a substantial, systematic, and persistent global decline in search and page-view activity across most examined physics topics. The magnitude of this decline is domain-dependent, with Mechanics-related content exhibiting sharper and more consistent reductions than Electromagnetism-related content. Pronounced geographic and linguistic heterogeneity is observed: while English-speaking regions show relative stability or only moderate declines, non-English-speaking regions exhibit substantially larger reductions in traditional, search-based information-seeking activity. Despite the overall decrease in volume, the seasonal structure characteristic of academic activity remains robust. Taken together, these findings indicate a redistribution of physics-related information-seeking behavior in academic contexts where generative tools are increasingly available.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World without Viscosity</a><span class="id">[2602.09062]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Viscosity – the internal friction of fluids – is among the most consequential yet underappreciated properties in physics. This paper explores what would happen if viscosity vanished from all fluids while other material properties remained unchanged. The consequences are catastrophic and universal. Aircraft cannot generate lift because circulation around wings requires viscous action. Rotating machinery seizes without lubricating fluid films. Cardiovascular systems lose the resistance necessary for pressure regulation. Rivers become violent torrents, aquifers drain in hours, and storms persist indefinitely without frictional dissipation. The pedagogical value lies in illuminating viscosity's role providing resistance, damping, and control across all scales - from cellular interiors to planetary atmospheres. Evolution, engineering, and climate have exploited viscous dissipation for billions of years; its absence would render complex life impossible and Earth uninhabitable. By imagining a world without viscosity, we better understand the viscous world we inhabit.</p></div></details></article></body>
