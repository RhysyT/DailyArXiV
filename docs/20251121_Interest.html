<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Quantum Formalism Revisited</a><span class="id">[2506.16480]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For the simple system of a point-like particle confined to a straight line, I compile, initially in a concise table, the structural elements of quantum mechanics and contrast them with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences, resulting from the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal structure. The latter was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify their quantifications by the variance and entropic indeterminacy inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and others.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Efficient and affordable thermoelectric measurement setup using Arduino and LabVIEW for education and research</a><span class="id">[2511.16491]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thermoelectric materials can convert thermal energy into electricity, making them promising candidates for harvesting waste heat, an increasingly important challenge in the energy-intensive modern world. The search for improved thermoelectric materials is therefore an active area of research in materials physics. Despite their fundamental and practical significance, thermoelectric properties - such as the Seebeck coefficient and power factor - are rarely explored in student labs due to the complexity in measurement schemes and requirement for sophisticated equipment. In this work, we present a user-friendly, low-cost and efficient thermoelectric measurement system built with Arduino and LabVIEW, which can simultaneously measure Seebeck coefficients and power factors as a function of temperature. This was made possible by improving the resolution of Arduino over  1000 times with amplifiers and noise reduction schemes. With a total cost of only  $100 and simple measurement protocols, this setup is well suited not only for student labs but also for efficient thermoelectric research.</p></div></details></article></body>
