However, a key challenge is to explain the origin of exceptional events such as GW190814, among the most asymmetric mass-ratio mergers to date ($q\approx 0.1$). We show that it shares an evolutionary pathway with the most unequal mass Galactic High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) 4U 1700-37/ HD 153919. We demonstrate this unique connection by utilizing a rich set of existing observational constraints for the HMXB and compute detailed binary evolution models to explain its formation history. We find that conservative mass transfer, along with a directed natal kick are essential to explain its current state. We show that this system is unlikely to form a GW source due to a failed Common Envelope (CE) phase in the future, in agreement with previous work. With additional models, we show that a similar pathway naturally forms GW190814-like events, provided the first phase of mass transfer remains conservative, and the first-born (lower mass) compact object receives a large natal kick ($\gtrsim 100\,\mathrm{km/s}$) for the subsequent CE phase to be successful and form a asymmetric mass-ratio GW source. Anchored by the number of analogous Galactic HMXBs, we estimate rates for such GW events, which broadly agree with their observed rate. Our work demonstrates a unified formation pathway for highly asymmetric mass-ratio HMXBs and GW events. Moreover, it highlights the critical role of finding and characterizing local analogs in different evolutionary phases, and using them as a bridge to understand the origin of GW sources, especially the outliers like GW190814.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A boost in the precision of cluster-mass models: Exploiting the extended surface brightness of the lensed supernova Refsdal host galaxy</a><span class="id">[2602.12329]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Combining deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and extensive data from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, we present new mass models of the cluster MACS J1149.5+2223, strongly lensing the supernova (SN) Refsdal, fully exploiting the source surface-brightness distribution of the SN host for the first time. In detail, we incorporated 77,000 HST pixels, in addition to the known 106 point-like multiple images, in our modeling. We considered four different models to explore the effect of the relative weighting of the point-like multiple image positions and flux distribution of the SN host on the model optimization. When the SN host's extended image is included, we find that the statistical uncertainties of all 34 free model parameters are reduced by factors ranging from one to two orders of magnitude compared to the statistical uncertainty of the point-like only model, irrespective of the adopted different image weights. We quantified the remarkably increased level of precision with which the cluster's total mass and the predicted time delays of the SN Refsdal multiple image positions can be reconstructed. We also show the delensed image of the SN host, a spiral galaxy at zSN = 1.49, in multiple HST bands. In all those applications, we obtain a significant reduction of the statistical uncertainty, which is now below the level of even the small systematic uncertainty on the mass model that could be assessed by the different approaches. These results demonstrate that with extended image models of lensing clusters it is possible to measure the cluster's total mass distribution, the values of the cosmological parameters, and the physical properties of high-redshift sources with an unparalleled precision, making the typically not-quantified systematic uncertainties now crucial.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An analytic approximation to the covariance between pre- and post-reconstruction galaxy two-point statistics</a><span class="id">[2602.12343]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a simple analytic approximation for the covariance between pre-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum measurements and post-reconstruction two-point correlation functions. This cross-covariance is essential for joint analyses that combine full-shape clustering information with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, as commonly performed in modern spectroscopic surveys. Our model builds on the disconnected contribution to the covariance and accounts for the damping of correlations due to the BAO reconstruction process. We validate our analytic prescription against numerical simulations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), testing both idealized cubic geometries and realistic survey configurations including complex footprints and fiber assignment effects. Despite neglecting survey window functions in the analytic calculation, we find excellent agreement with simulation-based covariances and demonstrate that cosmological parameter constraints are virtually unchanged when using our approximation. Our results show that the pre-post cross-covariance is sufficiently small that even approximate treatments are adequate for cosmological inference, opening a pathway toward fully analytic covariance matrices for next-generation galaxy surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sign-Switching Dark Energy: Smooth Transitions with Recent \textit{DESI DR2} Observations</a><span class="id">[2602.12347]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sign-switching dark energy provides a novel mechanism for modifying the late-time expansion history of the Universe without invoking additional fields or finely tuned initial conditions. In this work, we investigate a class of background–level cosmological models in which the dark energy contribution changes sign at a transition redshift $z_\dagger$, producing a sharp deviation from standard $\Lambda$CDM dynamics. We confront these models with a comprehensive set of cosmological observations, including \textit{Planck 18} cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements, \textit{\textit{DESI DR2}} Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data and the \textit{Pantheon+} $\&amp;$ \textit{SH0ES} Type Ia supernova sample (SN). Using a full Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, we find that the sign-switching scenario significantly alleviates the Hubble tension while obtaining better results when statistically comparing with $\Lambda$CDM, as quantified by the Akaike and Bayesian information Criteria. Although the model is explored only at the background level, the improvement in the inferred Hubble constant demonstrates that sign-switching dark energy offers a promising and physically economical pathway toward resolving late-universe discrepancies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Excitation and Damping of Oscillation Modes in Gaseous Planets</a><span class="id">[2602.12348]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The excitation and damping mechanisms for oscillation modes of gas giant planets are undetermined. We show that differential rotation may greatly enhance convective viscosity in giant planets, resulting in damping times of $t_{\rm damp} \sim 10^5-10^6 \, {\rm years}$ for f modes and low-order p modes. Radiative diffusion damps p modes on time scales of $t_{\rm damp} \sim 10^3-10^7 \, {\rm years}$. While the lethargic convective motions cannot effectively excite f mode or p modes, storms driven by condensation of water and/or silicates may play a role. High-order p modes are most effectively excited by cometary/asteroid impacts. Applying these calculations to solar system planets, water storms, rock storms, and impacts may all contribute to exciting the observed f modes amplitudes of Saturn via ring seismology. Similar f mode amplitudes with fractional gravitational perturbations of $\delta \Phi/\Phi \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ are expected for Jupiter and Uranus, apart from their lowest $\ell$ f modes which could have larger gravitational perturbations of $\delta \Phi/\Phi \sim 10^{-7}$. Rock storms may contribute to mode driving in Jupiter, while water storms are more important for Uranus. The highest-amplitude p modes are predicted to have periods of $\sim$10-30 minutes, with surface velocities of $\sim$10 cm/s for Jupiter and Saturn, and $\sim$1 cm/s for Uranus. These oscillation modes may be detectable with radial velocity measurements, ring seismology, or spacecraft Doppler tracking. However, both the damping and excitation physics are uncertain by orders of magnitude, so more careful examination of the relevant physics is required for robust estimates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayesian Analysis for Remote Biosignature Identification on exoEarths (BARBIE) IV: Analyzing CO2 Detections in the Near-IR to Determine the Long-Wavelength Cut-off for the Habitable Worlds Observatory Coronagraph</a><span class="id">[2602.12353]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present our analysis of how the detectability of carbon dioxide (CO2) on an Earth-like planet varies with respect to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), wavelength, and molecular abundance. Using the Bayesian Analysis for Remote Biosignature Identification on exoEarths (BARBIE) methodology, we can inform the optimal long-wavelength cut-off for the future Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) coronagraph. We test 25 evenly-spaced 20% bandpasses between 0.8-2.0{\mu}m, and simulate data spanning a range of SNRs and molecular abundance to analyze the relationship between wavelength and detectability for different planetary archetypes. We examine abundance levels from varying Earth epochs and a Venus-like archetype to investigate how detectability would change throughout the evolution of a rocky planet. Here, we present our results on the planetary conditions and technological requirements to strongly detect CO2. In addition, we analyze the degeneracy of CO2 with carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and water (H2O). We determine that any abundance of CO does not achieve strong detections and that CH4 and H2O play a pivotal role in the ability to detect CO2. We conclude that the optimal long-wavelength cut-off for the Habitable Worlds Observatory coronagraph should be 1.68{\mu}m.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembly bias and local Primordial non-Gaussianity from DESI DR1 Quasars</a><span class="id">[2602.12357]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The analysis of the large-scale clustering of quasars (QSO) observed by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) represents a promising avenue for constraining local Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), parameterized by $f_{\rm NL}$. The signal to be constrained is the scale-dependent bias induced in the 2-point clustering of the considered tracer sample. The resulting constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$, however, are fully degenerate with the local PNG bias parameter $b_{\phi}$, dependent on the assembly bias parameter $p$. Using IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we select a QSO sample reflecting the selection criteria and properties of DESI QSOs, and provide a robust prior for $p$, and thus for $b_{\phi}$, building on the findings of Fondi et al. 2024. We find a distribution with mean $\bar{p}\simeq1.4$ with weak redshift dependence, stable to selection noise and consistent with the expected recent merger history typical of quasar-hosting halos. By comparing with the CAMELS simulations we demonstrate that this prior is robust to astrophysical assumptions and cosmic variance. Finally, applying this prior to the DESI DR1 dataset, we derive updated constraints on local PNG, obtaining $f_{\rm NL}=-3.3\pm9.2$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First-Principles Polar-Cap Currents in Multipolar Pulsar Magnetospheres</a><span class="id">[2602.12376]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray pulse-profile modeling of millisecond pulsars offers a direct route to measuring neutron star masses and radii, thereby constraining the dense-matter equation of state. However, standard analyses typically rely on \emph{ad hoc} hotspot parameterizations rather than self-consistent physical models. While connecting surface heating directly to the magnetospheric geometry provides a more natural physical pathway, computing global magnetospheric solutions is too computationally expensive to perform on-the-fly during parameter inference. In this work, we bridge this gap by deriving fully analytic, first-principles expressions for surface return currents in mixed dipole–quadrupole magnetospheres. Working within force-free electrodynamics, we generalize the field-aligned current invariant $\Lambda$, the crucial scalar that maps the far-zone magnetic structure to the near-zone heating rate, from the standard dipole approximation to arbitrary quadrupolar configurations. We demonstrate that even when the quadrupole component is sub-dominant in the far zone (the mixing regime), using a dipole-based heating prescription fails to capture the significant enhancement or suppression of the return-current density on the polar cap. Our consistent quadrupole-aware framework reveals that these multipolar currents redistribute the surface heating, leading to systematic discrepancies in predicted pulse profiles that are amplified by atmosphere beaming and can reach $\sim 30\%$ near pulse peaks. These results provide a rigorous analytic foundation for mapping global magnetic geometry to surface heating in multipolar magnetospheres, enabling physically consistent inference beyond the idealized dipole approximation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12411" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Role of Faraday Rotation in the Polarization of the X-rays from Magnetically Powered Black Hole Coronas</a><span class="id">[2602.12411]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic reconnection is one of the prime candidate mechanisms that may energize the plasma emitting the strongly polarized X-ray emission from black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) in their hard states. The mechanism requires strong magnetic fields in the upstream plasma entering the reconnection layer, and weaker, but still substantial, magnetic fields in the downstream regions. In this Letter, we estimate the coronal magnetic fields for three different magnetic energy dissipation mechanisms: plasmoid-dominated magnetic reconnection, fast collisionless reconnection, and magnetic field relaxation. We show that the lack of strong Faraday depolarization constrains viable models and can be used to benchmark numerical accretion flow models. We conclude by discussing the difficulties of disentangling the various effects that can depolarize the signals from BHXRBs at low energies. We furthermore emphasize that Faraday rotation is unlikely to play a role in the polarization of the coronal X-ray emission of active galactic nuclei.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Broadband Timing and Spectral Study of Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsar SAX J1808.4$-$3658 during Its 2022 Outburst</a><span class="id">[2602.12425]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on our investigation of the NuSTAR and AstroSat observations along with simultaneous NICER observations of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4$-$3658, obtained during its tenth outburst from 2022. The NuSTAR observation captured the source near the outburst peak, while AstroSat observed it during the decay phase. Coherent pulsations at $\sim$401 Hz were detected throughout the outburst, with the fundamental amplitude in the 3–30 keV range increasing from $\sim$4% near the peak to $\sim$6% during the decay. The pulsations display strong energy dependence and negative time lags of $\sim$0.2–0.3 ms, with harder photons leading softer ones. The broadband spectra in both epochs are well described by a soft thermal component and Comptonized continuum, together with a prominent relativistic reflection component. As the outburst evolved, the continuum softened ($\Gamma$ increasing from $\sim$1.88 to $\sim$1.99) and the coronal electron temperature decreased ($kT_{\rm e}$ from $\sim$31 to $\sim$18 keV), consistent with enhanced Compton cooling at lower accretion rates. The ionization parameter declined ($\log \xi$ from $\sim$3.4 to $\sim$1.8) while the reflection fraction increased, suggesting a changing accretion geometry with a more compact corona and a larger disk covering fraction during the decay phase. The X-ray luminosity decreased by a factor of $\sim$3 between the two epochs. Our results suggest the coupled evolution of the corona, disk, and magnetosphere as the mass accretion rate declines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12428" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Correlated and uncorrelated Monte Carlo neutron capture rate variations in weak $\textit{r}$-process simulations</a><span class="id">[2602.12428]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reliable predictions of weak rapid neutron capture ($\textit{r}$-process) abundances require a systematic treatment of nuclear physics uncertainties, especially neutron capture rates far from stability. We employ new neutron capture rates from cross sections calculated with Yet Another Hauser-Feshbach Code ($\texttt{YAHFC}$) using an uncertainty-quantified Koning-Delaroche potential modified for use on neutron-rich systems. Using these rates as a baseline, we perform Monte-Carlo studies with independent rate variations (uncorrelated Monte Carlo) and find correlations between specific neutron capture rates and the resulting elemental abundances for the three weak r-process scenarios: two separate simulations of neutron star merger remnant accretion disks and a simulation of a magnetorotational supernova. We discuss the underlying nuclear dynamics that give rise to these correlations and the role of astrophysical conditions in them. We demonstrate how reducing the uncertainty in these rates would improve the prospects for conducting precision $\textit{r}$-process studies in the future. We additionally present a correlated Monte Carlo study, which incorporates the full covariance matrix that describes the relationships between individual neutron capture rates that arise from an uncertainty-quantified optical potential. We find that the magnitude of the uncertainty in the abundance pattern is similar to that produced by an uncorrelated Monte Carlo that employs only the on-diagonal components of the covariance matrix. We show how correlations restructure how the abundances co-vary, but do not necessarily decrease the overall uncertainty envelope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parker Solar Probe observations of solar energetic particle (SEP) events with inverse velocity arrival (IVA) features</a><span class="id">[2602.12475]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In SEP events, velocity dispersion (VD) is characterized by the earlier arrival of faster, higher-energy particles relative to slower ones, assuming negligible acceleration time and transport effects. The &quot;Labor Day event&quot; at Parker Solar Probe (PSP) on 2022 September 5 provided a unique arrival profile, in which the medium energy (  few MeV) particles arrive earlier than both lower and higher energy particles. This created a so-called &quot;nose&quot; structure in the intensity spectrogram formed by measurements from the two energetic particle instruments, EPI-Lo and EPI-Hi, of the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) suite. Unlike typical VD, the delayed arrival of higher energy particles compared to medium energy particles, i.e., the &quot;inverse velocity arrival&quot; (IVA), could be caused by various acceleration, transport, and instrumental effects, including shock acceleration. By applying a new method based on the contour-line of the intensity, we found 14 IVA events in the ISOIS observations up to the end of 2024. Several parameters that may modify velocity dispersion characteristics are further explored including the spacecraft radial distance, the speed of corresponding CMEs and shocks, the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field, and the spacecraft magnetic footpoint longitudinal separation from the flare location. The energy of the early arriving particles, i.e., the nose energy, can be grouped into low (L, &lt;0.5 MeV), medium(M, 0.5 - 5 MeV), and high(H, &gt;5 MeV) categories. Most (11/14) of the IVA events have medium nose energies. This SEP list provides ingredients for examination of shock acceleration in the inner heliosphere, and the existence of IVA events sheds new light on the acceleration and propagation of SEPs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unusual Circumstances of the 2024 June 8 GLE</a><span class="id">[2602.12507]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) in large solar energetic particle (SEP) events is indicative of protons accelerated to GeV energies. Almost all GLE events are associated with sustained gamma-ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun because the latter require &gt;300 MeV protons that are readily present during GLEs. Here we report on the 2024 June 8 GLE event, which has the distinction of not being associated with an SGRE event. All the associated phenomena typical of SGRE events were present: a fast and wide CME, a major solar flare, and an intense type II radio bursts that extend from the metric to kilometric wavelength domains. There was a data gap of  51 min, but the SGRE is expected to last for hours. We suggest the east-west asymmetry in the flow of energetic particles from the shock is likely to be the reason for the lack of SGRE emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ballistic Surfing Acceleration as a Coherent Mechanism for Electron Acceleration in Galaxy Cluster Shocks</a><span class="id">[2602.12647]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radio relics in merging galaxy clusters are widely interpreted as synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated at large-scale shocks. However, the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is expected to be reduced in the low-Mach-number, weakly turbulent environments characteristic of cluster merger shocks, and recent results suggest that DSA itself may not constitute a viable physical mechanism. In this work, we investigate ballistic surfing acceleration (BSA) as an electrodynamically grounded mechanism for electron energization that does not rely on prescribed diffusion coefficients. We formulate BSA under typical cluster shock conditions and derive the balance between coherent acceleration by the shock convection electric field and radiative losses due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton cooling. This balance determines both the maximum electron energy and the resulting steady-state spectrum. By forward-modeling the associated synchrotron emission and comparing it with integrated radio observations of the Sausage and Toothbrush relics, we find that the observed spectral curvature and high-frequency steepening can be reproduced when only a very small fraction ($\sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$) of the available BSA acceleration capacity contributes to systematic electron energization. Despite this extremely small efficiency, it is sufficient to accelerate electrons to Lorentz factors $\gamma \sim 10^4 - 10^5$ under cluster conditions. These results suggest that radio relics provide a promising astrophysical laboratory for probing coherent acceleration, and that the BSA framework may account for the production of relativistic electrons in cluster shocks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A rotational line CO cooling rate prescription for AGB outflows</a><span class="id">[2602.12777]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars significantly contribute to the chemical composition of the universe. In their outflows, complex chemistry takes place, which critically depends on the local temperature. Therefore, if we want to accurately model the AGB environment, we need accurate cooling rates. The CO molecule is abundant in AGB outflows, and has a dipole moment, which enables it to cool through emission from its rotational transitions. We therefore expect it to significantly contribute to cooling in this environment, even at low temperatures ($10$ K $\leqslant T\leqslant 3000$ K). Currently, CO cooling rates are available for ISM-like conditions, which encompasses a different parameter regime, with generally lower densities and velocity gradients, compared to AGB winds. Therefore, these ISM cooling rates might not be applicable to the AGB regime. In this paper, we compute CO cooling rates for hydrodynamics simulations of AGB outflows. To evaluate the net cooling rate, we calculate the energy level distribution of CO self-consistently, using the non Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE) line radiative transfer code Magritte. We verify whether already existing CO cooling rate prescriptions for the interstellar medium (ISM) are applicable for this regime. We noticed minor differences between these prescriptions and our calculated cooling rates in general. However, when used far outside their originally intended parameter regimes, significant differences occur. Therefore, we propose a new CO cooling rate prescription for the AGB environment and we study how the computed cooling rate varies depending on input parameters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12814" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray line diagnostics of the multi-phase gas in the Centaurus cluster core with XRISM/Resolve</a><span class="id">[2602.12814]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the multi-temperature structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the Centaurus cluster core observed with XRISM/Resolve. Thanks to its high energy resolution, Resolve enables us to measure fine structures of highly ionized emission lines from Si to Fe and to directly determine the excitation temperature and the ionization temperature from the emission line ratio diagnostics. The observed spectrum in the Centaurus core is well-represented by a double-temperature thermal plasma at collisional ionization equilibrium state rather than an isothermal one. The line ratio diagnostics also support this biphasic temperature structure. Particularly, the observed line ratios show a trend of increasing ionization temperature with atomic mass, while the ionization and excitation temperatures of Fe show nearly the same temperature. The resultant line ratios, which are well-represented by the two temperatures ICM,   1.6 and   3 keV, are also fairly consistent with the expected numbers when assuming the radial single-temperature ICM was projected in the cluster core along the line of sight. Due to the limited low-energy sensitivity of the Resolve with the gate valve closed, we investigated the effect of the cool component using the XMM-Newton/RGS spectrum, but it ultimately did not affect our results. The observed flux ratio between the Fe XXV He alpha resonance and forbidden lines shows an about 20% reduction, suggesting the presence of resonant scattering.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On The Stability Of $H_0$ And The Inverse Distance Ladder</a><span class="id">[2602.12822]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The `Inverse Distance Ladder' uses relative-distance measurements with type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), anchored to an absolute distance scale from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB), to provide an alternative measurement technique for the local expansion rate $H_0$. Using SNe Ia from the Dark Energy Survey and BAO measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, we show that the inverse distance ladder is unable to explain the Hubble Tension, anchored as it is to the CMB and its value of $H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.5$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To do so, we first show that the suite of systematics considered in cosmology analyses with SNe Ia only move the inferred $H_0$ by $&lt;0.1$kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and second, we investigate the scale of redshift-dependent magnitude changes necessary to change the inferred inverse distance ladder $H_0$ from $67$ to the local network of distance measurements value of $73$, and the impact that this would have on other cosmological inferences with SNe Ia. We find that a change of $d\mu/dz = 0.2$ mag would be necessary to infer an $H_0$ in concordance with local distance measurements, and that this $d\mu/dz$ value would result in a Flat $\Lambda$CDM $\Omega_M = 0.23$, $10\sigma$ discrepant with other cosmological probes, {indicating that the precision of SNe Ia measurements preclude the necessary redshift evolution for an $H_0$ of 74 kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$}. Therefore, we conclude that current SN Ia cosmology leaves little freedom for the inverse distance ladder to yield $H_0$ values significantly different from $67$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on GRB Jet Properties from IceCube Upper Limits: Insights from GRB 221009A and GRB 240825A</a><span class="id">[2602.12837]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The IceCube neutrino telescope has provided upper limits on neutrino emission from gamma ray bursts.

We study various GRB emission models, such as the internal shock model, the photospheric models, and also include a model-independent case. Based on these models, we calculate the neutrino fluence using the photo-hadronic interaction process. We estimate the bulk Lorentz factor using the well-known correlations between prompt phase observables, which is then used to calculate the emission site for the model-dependent scenarios. For GRB 221009A, we find that a low baryon loading scenario is consistent with the IceCube upper limits; however, for GRB 240825A, a higher value of baryon loading is preferred. Also, the values of the microphysical parameters $\epsilon_e$ and $\epsilon_B$ for GRB 240825A are lower by factors of approximately 10 and 100, respectively, compared to those of GRB 221009A. Further, using neutrino upper limits for these two sources, we estimate the lower limits on the dissipation radius for our models. The current TeV PeV upper limits for GRB 221009A are already useful for constraining parameter space for the BPH and MPH models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12863" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining Axion-like Particles through Multi-epoch Monitoring of Strong Gravitational Lenses</a><span class="id">[2602.12863]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new constraints on ultralight axion-like particles (ALPs) through multi-epoch measurements of differential birefringence induced due to a coupling ($g_{a\gamma}$) between the ALP and electromagnetic fields. Broadband polarimetric observations in the 2-8 GHz range of the gravitationally lensed system CLASS B1152+199 were carried out over five epochs spanning three months with a cadence of roughly 20 days, and the differential birefringence angle ($\Delta\,\theta_{a,{\rm lens}}$) between the lensed images were estimated. We also combined an archival observation that effectively increases the span to 9.5 yr to probe the effect of an oscillating ALP field imprinted as oscillating ${\Delta\,\theta_{a,{\rm lens}}}$ over time. Here we present a new technique for combining multi-epoch measurements of ${\Delta\,\theta_{a,{\rm lens}}}$ by considering the coherence of the ALP field, such that, ${\Delta\,\theta_{a,{\rm lens}}}$ over these observations are related. The time scale of coherence depends on the mass of the ALP field ($m_a$). With these new observations, we constrain $g_{a\gamma} \leq 9.0\times 10^{-12} \,\left( {\rho_{a,\text{em}}}/{20 \text{ GeV cm}^{-3}} \right)^{-1/2}\;\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ to $\leq 3.5\times 10^{-8} \,\left( {\rho_{a,\text{em}}}/{20 \text{ GeV cm}^{-3}} \right)^{-1/2}\;\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for $m_a$ between $1.6\times 10^{-22}\;\mathrm{eV}$ and $3.8\times 10^{-18}\;\mathrm{eV}$, where $\rho_{a,{\rm em}}$ is the density of the ALP field at emission. This improves over the constraint provided by the CERN Axion Solar Telescope by up to an order of magnitude in the $m_a$ range $1.6\times 10^{-22}\;\mathrm{eV}$ to $3\times 10^{-21}$ eV.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BSN-VI: Multiband Light Curve Modeling of Four W UMa-Type Contact Binaries I. Revisiting Energy Transfer Mechanisms and Luminosity Behavior</a><span class="id">[2602.12864]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We presented the first high-precision, detailed photometric analysis of four W Ursae Majoris (W UMa)-type contact binaries, Linear 10772300, Linear 11150338, Linear 20372537 and DM Cir. In addition to ground-based multiband photometric observations, data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) were employed for the analysis of the DM Cir system. New ephemeris and linear fit to the O-C diagrams were derived using extracted times of minima and additional literature. The light curve modeling was performed using the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the BSN application, employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. In each systems, the two stellar components exhibited minimal temperature differences ($\Delta T&lt;150$ K), confirming efficient energy exchange within their common convective envelopes. Absolute parameters were estimated using the Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3) parallax and astrophysical equations. Based on effective temperatures and component masses, two systems were classified as W-subtype systems, while others belonged to the A-subtype. We computed the initial masses of the primary ($M_{1i}$) and secondary ($M_{2i}$) components for four target systems using a method based on the observational properties of overluminous secondary components. We found initial primary masses in the range 0.6-1.0$M_\odot$ and initial secondary masses in the range 0.9-1.7$M_\odot$ with mass loss $&lt;1.0M_{\odot}$. We investigated the relative energy transfer rates ($U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$) and nuclear luminosities ($L_{10}$ and $L_{20}$) based on the physical parameters of 411 W UMa-type contact binaries, including the four systems analyzed in this study, through wide range of mass ratios. The results for all systems provided a comprehensive view of energy transfer behavior throughout different evolutionary stages of contact binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12870" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAME: Genetic Algorithms with Marginalised Ensembles for model-independent reconstruction of cosmological quantities</a><span class="id">[2602.12870]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Genetic Algorithms (GA) are a powerful tool for stochastic optimisation and non-parametric symbolic regression, already widely used in cosmology. They are capable of reconstructing analytical functions directly from data points without introducing new physical models. A limitation of this approach is that while the reconstructed function is very efficient at reproducing the behaviour of the data points, non-observable quantities involving derivatives are particularly sensitive to stochasticity, hyperparameters, and to the choice of the best-fit function obtained by the GA, which implies the risk of the algorithm getting stuck in a local minimum. In this work we propose an update to the GA methodology for the reconstruction of analytical functions that involves computing a weighted average of an ensemble of GA configurations (\texttt{GAME}). We define the weights via a quantity that accounts for both the goodness-of-fit of the points and the smoothness of the resulting function. We also present a practical method to analytically estimate and correct the errors on the averaged function by combining a path-integral approach with an ensemble variance. We demonstrate the improvement offered by \texttt{GAME} methodology on a generic test function. We then apply the new methodology to a non-parametric reconstruction of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ using Cosmic Chronometers data and, assuming a flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker background and General Relativity, we infer the corresponding dark energy equation of state $w(z)$. Through consistency tests, we show that current data produces results compatible with $\Lambda$CDM, and that Stage IV cosmology surveys will allow GA reinforced with \texttt{GAME} methodology to become an even more competitive tool for discriminating between different models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12890" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Effect of Gravitational Stratification on Kink Oscillations in Curved Coronal Loops</a><span class="id">[2602.12890]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Kink oscillation frequency is a key parameter for coronal seismology. It is still unclear how gravitational stratification affects the kink frequency in curved coronal loops. This work aims to investigate the effect of gravitational stratification on the frequency of kink oscillations in curved coronal loops and discuss their seismological potential. We conduct numerical computations within the ideal MHD framework to study different kink polarizations and harmonics in a curved, gravitationally stratified coronal loop. The oscillation frequencies derived from the Lagrangian displacement are compared with the WKB approximation. For the vertically polarized fundamental mode, the oscillation frequency deviates from the WKB approximation by about 18\% in the current numerical setup. Nevertheless, the oscillation frequency closely matches the local Alfvén frequency near the loop apex. On the other hand, the frequency of the horizontally polarized fundamental mode exhibits only a 7\% deviation in our current model from the WKB approximation and closely matches the local Alfvén frequency near one quarter of the loop. For the first overtones, the frequencies for both polarizations can be well described by the WKB approximation. The frequency of vertically polarized fundamental kink modes can be predicted by the local Alfvén frequency near the loop apex. In contrast, the WKB approximation remains highly reliable for estimating the frequency of horizontally polarized fundamental modes and first overtones, which is also well described by the local Alfvén frequency near one quarter of the loop. These results therefore pave the way for spatially dependent coronal seismology, enabling, e.g., the probing of magnetic field strength at different locations along a coronal loop.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12906" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaps and Rings: A Near-Universal Trait of Extended Protoplanetary Discs</a><span class="id">[2602.12906]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Substructures such as rings, gaps, and cavities are commonly observed in protoplanetary discs and are thought to play a key role in dust evolution and planet formation. However, a fraction of the extended discs (68% dust radii &gt; 30 AU) in nearby star-forming regions remain unresolved, leaving their substructure content uncertain and thereby limiting our understanding of dust evolution and the initial conditions for planet formation across the full disc population. We aim to investigate the presence of substructures in previously unresolved, extended discs to assess whether all extended protoplanetary discs in the Solar neighbourhood exhibit substructures. We present new high-resolution ($\sim$0.12&quot;) ALMA Band 6 continuum observations at 1.33 mm of 26 previously unresolved, extended discs within 200 pc, completing the high-resolution sample of extended discs in Taurus, Ophiuchus, Chamaeleon, Lupus, Upper Scorpius, Upper Centaurus-Lupus and Lower Centaurus-Crux. We analyse radial intensity profiles using Frankenstein and Galario to detect substructures. Seventeen discs show clear substructures, while nine appear compact and structureless, smooth or ambiguous due to inclination or possible binarity/late-stage infall. We detect $^{12}$CO J=2-1 emission in 15 discs, with extended emission in four. Combined with literature data, our complete sample of 730 protoplanetary discs reveals that nearly all extended discs exhibit substructures, $\sim$91% detected in the full sample, and up to $\sim$98% when correcting for high-inclination systems where substructures may be hidden. Substructures are a near-universal feature of extended protoplanetary discs. They are more commonly detected in larger, massive discs and around higher-mass stars, and structured discs retain their dust mass over time. This supports the scenario in which dust traps, possibly induced by giant planets, shape disc morphologies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A nearby He-rich superluminous supernova at photospheric phases</a><span class="id">[2602.12948]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aim.

The planet was initially detected from a single transit in TESS Sector 33. A photometric monitoring campaign of 228 nights with NGTS detected a transit egress of the planet, which together with spectroscopic radial velocity monitoring with CORALIE and HARPS identified an orbital period of  180.5,d. These radial velocity measurements also showed the mass of the companion to be planetary. Additional transit observations coordinated by the TESS follow-up observing program allowed further confirmation and refinement of this period. With its relatively cool equilibrium temperature of $458\pm11$,K, NGTS-38 b joins a small but growing population of well characterised transiting warm-Jupiters and has one of the longest periods of any discovered to date.

However, the mechanical strength of dust at sizes in the micrometer to millimeter range is poorly known. Recent studies suggested that dust particles in the Solar system might have a higher critical fragmentation energy $Q_{D}^*$ value than previously anticipated. Another recent study considered the Fomalhaut debris disk and found lower $Q_{D}^*$ values to provide better fits to the data. In order to constrain the mechanical strength of dust, we investigate collisional evolution of debris disks with $Q_{D}^*$ prescriptions differing by $\sim 3$ orders of magnitude. We find that, above a certain threshold $Q_{D}^*$ value, the disk's collisional evolution is dominated by rebounding – rather than disruptive or cratering – collisions. Rebounding (a.k.a. bouncing) collisions are those in which both impactors survive, being only slightly eroded and producing fragments that only carry a minor fraction of their mass. We show that disks dominated by rebounding collisions would have brightness profiles increasing outward outside the parent belt. Since such profiles are not observed, this places an upper limit on how hard the debris dust is allowed to be in order not to violate the observations. We derive an approximate analytic expression for this limit: $Q_{D}^* \approx (1/8) v_{K}^2(r)$ for grains close to the radiation pressure blowout size, where $v_{K}$ in the Keplerian circular speed at a distance $r$ from the star. This implies $Q_{D}^* \lesssim 10^{9...10} \,\hbox{erg}\,\hbox{g}^{-1}$ for micrometer-sized grains in typical debris disks. Even though rebounding collisions are not expected to affect debris disk evolution significantly, we emphasize that these collisions are actually much more frequent than disruptive and cratering ones in all debris disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TIC65910228b: A single-transit discovery of a massive long-period warm Jupiter with TESS</a><span class="id">[2602.13125]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Warm Jupiters are excellent case studies for the investigation of giant planet internal structures and formation theories. However, the sample of long-period transiting giants is still small today for a better understanding of this population. Aims. Starting from a single transit found in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data, we confirm the planetary nature of the signal and measure its orbital parameters, mass, and radius. We put this system in the context of long-period giant transiting planets and analyzed the viability to sustain atmospheric or dynamical follow-up. Methods. We carried out a spectroscopic follow-up using FEROS and PLATOSpec to obtain precise radial velocities.

At those frequencies, the dominant signal is expected to be a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) produced by the incoherent superposition of the quasi-monochromatic GW emissions from a population of supermassive black hole binaries. While the radio PTAs have recently announced compelling evidence for a GWB signal with a power law spectrum of strain amplitude $\approx2-3\times10^{-15}$ (at the frequency of $1 {\rm yr}^{-1}$), in 2022 an analysis of $12.5$ years of Fermi data for 35 pulsars led to an upper limit of $1\times10^{-14}$ for the GWB amplitude. The analysis was carried out on times-of-arrival (TOAs) obtained by folding from six months up to one year of photon observations. A photon-by-photon approach was also tested to infer constraints on the GWB amplitude from individual pulsars, but without accounting for the cross-pulsar correlations that a GWB would induce. Here, we reanalyse the same dataset using a regularized likelihood method that correctly models cross-pulsar correlations directly from the photons, while additionally marginalising over the uncertain pulse profile shape. While the two methods are not expected to have significant differences in sensitivity, we prove through simulations of gamma-ray PTA datasets that the photon-by-photon method for GWB recoveries is, statistically, more robust. The resulting upper limit obtained for the GWB strain amplitude is $1.2\times10^{-14}$, indicating that the improved method yields a consistent result with the previous analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V515 And: An Intermediate Polar in the Period Gap Exhibiting Outbursts</a><span class="id">[2602.13153]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using long-term observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) along with spectroscopic observations from the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT), we present a comprehensive time-series and spectral analysis of the intermediate polar V515 And.

Both the stellar structure equations and the radial oscillation equations are solved for the two-fluid system, where the ordinary matter component and dark matter component couple only through gravity. For the ordinary matter components, we adopt the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock method for nuclear matter, and the Dyson-Schwinger or the field-correlator model for quark matter. For the dark matter component, we use a non-self-annihilating self-interacting fermionic model.

We investigate hyperon emergence in neutron star matter using the $SU(3)$ parity doublet model with chiral representation $(3,\bar{3}) + (\bar{3},3)$. This framework naturally incorporates chiral symmetry restoration and provides a systematic description of baryon masses in dense matter through the interplay between the chiral condensate and the chiral invariant mass $m_0$. We find that the hyperon onset density exhibits strong sensitivity to $m_0$: for $m_0 = 500$ MeV, hyperons first appear at $1.9n_0$ while for $m_0 \gtrsim 750$ MeV, hyperons emerge only above $5n_0$. This delayed onset arises from the weakened density dependence of baryon masses at larger $m_0$ values. When the hyperon onset density exceeds the expected quark-hadron transition range ($2$–$5n_0$), matter undergoes deconfinement before hyperons populate, avoiding the EoS softening while maintaining consistency with massive neutron star observations.

Parameterizations of this kind place observers in a privileged position-specifically on the plane that divides the two hemispheres. To quantify potential deviations from the cosmological principle without presuming a special location, we develop a stochastic framework that parametrizes departures from statistical homogeneity and isotropy. The near-uniform temperature of the cosmic microwave background indicates that anisotropy is negligible (at the $\lesssim 10^{-5}$ level) on the last scattering surface. This serves as a zero boundary condition, enabling the construction of an orthogonal basis of functions below the recombination redshift. Within this basis, we expand the relative deviation from the Hubble diagram of isotropic models (such as $\Lambda$CDM or $w_0w_a$CDM) in a hierarchy of increasing resolution. Applying this approach, we test the cosmological principle using Type Ia supernovae, strong lensing time delays, and gravitational-wave standard sirens. For the class of large-scale anisotropies and low-order radial variations described by this framework, the current datasets are found to be consistent with statistical homogeneity and isotropy on gigaparsec scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMB line-of-sight integrators for nearly-isotropic cosmological models</a><span class="id">[2506.07786]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Homogeneous and nearly-isotropic cosmological models are natural extensions of standard Friedmann cosmologies. Constraining their features is crucial, as any detection of their properties would impact our understanding of inflation and the cosmological principle. Since these models evolve as a set of non-interacting scalar, vector, and tensor modes on top of homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, their imprints on cosmological observables, particularly the CMB, can be obtained using standard line-of-sight methods. This requires (1) that one resorts on Laplacian eigenmodes on spatially curved spaces and (2) that radial functions for these modes are analytically continued to accommodate complex (i.e., supercurvature) wavenumbers. We introduce two line-of-sight integrators implementing the evolution of the CMB anisotropies in these models: \texttt{AniLoS}, a user-friendly and easy to modify \texttt{Python} package, and \texttt{AniCLASS}, an advanced and efficient extension of the Boltzmann solver \texttt{CLASS}. We discuss possible initial conditions that could generate such fluctuations and provide illustrative examples using our codes. This work offers a pathway for leveraging diverse cosmological datasets to constrain superhorizon anisotropies of the late-time universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Waves from First-Order Phase Transitions Assisted by Temperature-Enhanced Scatterings</a><span class="id">[2507.13135]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scatterings whose cross sections increase as the cosmic temperature decreases, known as temperature - enhanced scatterings, can have a significant impact on the thermal effective potential of scalar fields responsible for driving cosmological first-order phase transitions. We show that such effects naturally manifest as finite-temperature self-energy corrections to the scalar mass term, leading to an additional contribution of the form \(c\,T^{p}\phi^{2}\) in the effective potential. In this work, we systematically investigate how these loop-induced, temperature-dependent corrections affect key phase transition parameters, including the nucleation temperature, latent heat release, and inverse duration parameter. These modifications influence both the strength and duration of the phase transition, which in turn determine the properties of the resulting stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. Employing semi-analytic computational methods, we evaluate the GW spectra generated under these conditions and compare our predictions with the projected sensitivities of forthcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. Our analysis demonstrates that finite-temperature scattering effects of this kind can substantially strengthen first-order transitions and produce GW signals that lie within the reach of future observational facilities. The results establish a concrete thermal-field-theoretic origin for temperature-dependent modifications of the scalar potential and emphasize their importance in shaping early-Universe cosmological signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15756" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulating a Gaussian stochastic gravitational wave background signal in pulsar timing arrays</a><span class="id">[2507.15756]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit the theoretical modeling and simulation of a Gaussian stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal in a pulsar timing array (PTA).

To investigate the origin of this phenomenon, we conducted high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic \texttt{PPMstar} simulations of a non-rotating \unit{25}{\Msun} zero-age main sequence star, modeling 95\% of the stellar structure with both a core and a thin outer envelope convection zone. The outer envelope convection zone was implemented through modification of the opacity model, shifting the Fe opacity bump inward and enhancing its amplitude for computational feasibility. The luminosity power spectrum from our primary simulation (M424) exhibits qualitative and quantitative characteristics similar to observed SLF variability, with a $\approx2$-dex difference between high- and low-frequency power. The spectrum displays distinct features attributable to internal gravity wave (IGW) eigenmodes. To isolate the contributions of different stellar regions, we performed numerical experiments with suppressed core convection, envelope convection and envelope-only configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that outer envelope convection alone produces significantly less low-frequency power than the full-star configuration. In our simulations the outer envelope convection zone excites at its inner boundary a rich IGW eigenmode spectrum in the layer just below. In an otherwise identical simulation where the core convection is not driven by heating, the SLF spectrum is remarkably similar and the integrated power is reduced by only 10\%, suggesting that the envelope convection is the dominant contributor to SLF power spectrum. The IGW spectral characteristics depend on the complete stellar stratification, demonstrating that interior structure could influence observable surface variability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V717 Andromedae: An Active Low Mass Ratio Contact Binary</a><span class="id">[2509.23278]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Multi-band photometric analysis of the contact binary V717 Andromedae (V717 And) is presented.

Building on a generalised Press &amp; Schechter model and triaxial collapse (GPS+), we predict the HMF in terms of the variance of the linear density field, with only a weak explicit dependence on halo mass and no explicit dependence on redshift. The GPS+ model naturally provides the correct normalization and high-mass behaviour without requiring empirical fitting. We calibrate and validate the GPS+ model using the Uchuu N-body simulation suite, which combines large cosmological volume and high mass resolution under Planck cosmology. Using six simulations with up to 300 realizations, we obtain precision HMF measurements spanning halo masses in the range 6.5 &lt; log($M_{\rm 200m}$/[h$^{-1}$ $M_{\odot}$]) &lt;16 over 0 &lt; z &lt; 20, with reduced cosmic variance. Across this full domain, the GPS+ model reproduces the simulated HMF with deviations typically below 10-20%. Comparison with the Sheth-Tormen (ST) model shows similar performance at z &lt; 2, but markedly improved agreement at higher redshifts, where ST can deviate by 70-80% while our model remains within  20%. Finally, we assess the impact of the halo mass definition: adopting the evolving virial overdensity of Bryan &amp; Norman (1998) worsens agreement at low redshift and high masses, whereas M200m yields a more universal, nearly redshift-independent HMF.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The disk precession in a Be star-magnetar binary and its application to the rotation measure of FRB 20201124A</a><span class="id">[2512.12995]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio bursts with poorly known origins. Most FRB sources are detected only once, while some are repeaters. Variation patterns observed in the rotation measure (RM) of some repeaters – indicate that the local magneto-ionic environments of these FRB sources are highly dynamic. It has been suggested that a Be star-magnetar binary system is a possible origin for such variation. FRB 20201124A is notable among these sources since it is the most active one and exhibits substantial temporal variations of RM measured by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The physics behind this long-term behavior is poorly understood. Here we propose that, within the framework of the Be star-magnetar binary scenario, the observed variation of RM is attributed to a combination of orbital motion and the precession of the circumstellar disk of the Be star. While a  785-day precession of the disk contributes to the observed decrease in the amplitude of the variation, our model predicts that the amplitude oscillates with this period.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16289" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astrophysical Implications of Eccentricity in Gravitational Waves from Neutron Star-Black Hole Binaries</a><span class="id">[2512.16289]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The gravitational-wave signal from the neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger GW200105 is consistent with this binary having significant orbital eccentricity close to merger. This raises the question of how eccentric NSBHs form. Compact binaries that evolve in isolation radiate away any orbital eccentricity long before their gravitational-wave signal enters the sensitive frequency range of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network. Meanwhile, dynamical environments – which can be conducive to mergers on eccentric orbits – produce very few NSBHs. Here, we focus on a formation channel that efficiently produces NSBHs with both misaligned spins and significant eccentricity close to merger: isolated field triples. We estimate the minimum measurable eccentricity of NSBHs at 10 Hz orbit-averaged gravitational-wave frequency, e_min,10, finding that for GW200105, GW200115, and GW230529-like systems, e_min,10 is O(0.01). For a GW190814-like unequal-mass binary with significant higher-order mode content, e_min,10 = 0.003; this is an order of magnitude lower than when higher modes are not present. For dominant-mode signals from binaries with $m_2=1.5$ M$_\odot$ and total masses from $3\,{\rm M_\odot} \leq M \leq50\,\rm M_\odot$, we find $0.008 \leq$ e_min,10 $\leq 0.022$. The relationship between $M$ and e_min,10 is linear when the binaries are non-spinning. When the binaries are maximally spin-precessing, e_min,10 decreases as mass ratio becomes more unequal. We estimate the sensitivity of a quasi-circular aligned-spin templated search to NSBH mergers from field triples, finding that we recover only 46% of systems that would have been detected with a search containing the full physics of the injected population. Finally, we show that if $\sim\nicefrac{1}{3}$ of present NSBH detections are measurably eccentric, then $\geq40\%$ are consistent with an isolated field triple origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08903" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IK Pegasi and the Double-merger Path to Type Ia Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2601.08903]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent Gaia astrometry has revealed thousands of main-sequence + white-dwarf binaries (MS+WD) at separations of  0.1-10 au, including a subset hosting unusually massive (&gt; 0.8 Msun) WDs.

For a massive WD, standard single-star evolution requires a massive (&gt; 4 Msun) progenitor, yet such progenitors produce negligible s-process yields. We define IK Peg-type systems as those exhibiting this mass-yield tension: barium-enhanced companions orbiting WDs too massive to have descended from efficient s-process producers. The well-known system IK Peg exemplifies this class. Applying this framework to published spectroscopic data reveals several additional candidates, and we estimate that a few dozen such systems should exist in the current Gaia sample.

For a Type B anomaly ($\alpha=0$), we obtain wormhole geometries assuming a constant redshift function and show that the SET components increase with the parameter $\lambda$. In the case of a Type A anomaly ($\lambda=0$), we generalize previously known solutions, yielding a family of geometries that includes Lorentzian wormholes, naked singularities, and the Schwarzschild black hole. Using isotropic coordinates, we identify parameter choices that produce traversable wormhole solutions. Extending to the full trace-anomaly contribution, we solve the differential equation near the throat to obtain the redshift function and demonstrate that both the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars remain finite at the throat. We further analyze the trajectories of null and timelike particles, showing that the height and width of the effective potential for null geodesics increase monotonically with $\alpha$, while the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius also grows with larger $\alpha$.

What was the actual origin of these two words? There are many aspects hidden under this name, which are seldom explained. They are discussed here. To frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. And this includes names given to outstanding theorems and spectacular discoveries, too. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled in this context. These points will be at the heart of the quest here, concerning the concept of “Big Bang&quot;, which only a few people know what it means, actually. Fred Hoyle was the first to pronounce these words, in a BBC radio program, with a meaning that was later called inflation. But listeners were left with the image he was trying to destroy: the explosion of Lemaître's primeval atom (an absolutely wrong concept). Hoyle's Steady State will be carefully compared with inflation cosmology. They are quite different, and yet, in both cases, the possibility of creating matter/energy out of expanding space is rooted in the same fundamental principles: those of General Relativity. As is also, the possibility of having a universe with zero total energy, anticipated by R.C. Tolman, in 1934 already. It will be shown, how to obtain accelerated expansion from negative pressure; how to reconcile energy conservation with matter creation in an expanding universe; and a curious relation between de Sitter spacetime and Steady State cosmology. Concerning the naming issue, it will be remarked that, today, the same label “Big Bang&quot; is used in very different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21538" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial black holes and Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves formed by inflation potential with non-trivial characteristics</a><span class="id">[2601.21538]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) generally requires large density perturbations, which is widely supported by researchers.

We revisit the mechanism by which echoes are suppressed in a diffeomorphism-invariant, analytic entire-function ultraviolet completion of quantum gravity. We show that the absence of observable echoes is not due to a suppression of quasinormal-mode frequencies or a filtering of the gravitational-wave spectrum. The extreme blueshift of the proper local frequency in the near-horizon region activates the diffeomorphism-invariant entire-function regulator, which smooths out sharp reflecting inner structures and drives the reflection coefficient to zero. The nonlocal regulator acts as a covariant smearing operator on effective stress–energy and curvature, replacing sharp, partially reflective surfaces by smooth transition regions. As a result, the would-be echo cavity required for repeated reflections fails to form, and the associated phase-coherent back scattering is eliminated. This mechanism applies both to regular black holes with horizons and to horizonless compact objects generated by nonlocal smearing, and is independent of the detailed value of the nonlocal scale provided it lies at or above the Planck scale. Our results clarify the physical origin of echo suppression in nonlocal quantum gravity and demonstrate that the absence of echoes is a structural consequence of analytic nonlocality rather than a dynamical damping of gravitational-wave frequencies.</p></div></details></article></body>
