The resulting RHN distribution sources novel low-frequency gravitational-waves (GWs) in addition to the standard bubble-collision contribution. A stable lightest RHN can account for the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance for masses as low as $M_{1} \equiv m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, with the associated novel GW signal accessible in LISA, ET and upcoming LVK detectors. If the RHNs are unstable, their CP-violating decays generate the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis for $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and phase transition temperatures $T_* \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, for which the novel GW spectrum is detectable in ET, BBO and upcoming LVK. If RHN decays also populate a dark-sector fermion with mass $m_{\chi} \in [10^{-4},10^{4}],\mathrm{GeV}$, successful co-genesis of baryons and asymmetric dark matter occurs for $T_* \gtrsim 10^{7}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, naturally explaining $\Omega_{\rm DM} \simeq 5\Omega_{\rm B}$. The corresponding GW signals are testable with LISA, ET, and BBO. Finally, we analyze a UV-complete multi-Majoron model, based on a global $U(1)_N \times U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ extension, motivated from the hierarchy of lepton masses, which we dub as Mojaron collider. The corresponding FOPT in this model leaves a distinctive GW signature arising from RHN production during $U(1)_N$ symmetry breaking detectable by BBO, ET and upcoming LVK. Successful leptogenesis is realized for heaviest RHN mass $M_3 \sim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and a $U(1)_N$ breaking vev $v_2 \sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$, which sets the seesaw scale.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02460" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic reconnection with a 0.1 rate: Effective resistivity in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics</a><span class="id">[2601.02460]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Relativistic magnetic reconnection is thought to power various multi-wavelength emission signatures from neutron stars and black holes. Relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics (RRMHD) offers the simplest model of reconnection. However, a small uniform resistivity underestimates the reconnection rate compared to first-principles kinetic models. By employing an effective resistivity based on kinetic models - which connects the reconnection electric field to the charge-starved current density - we show that RRMHD can reproduce the increased reconnection rate of kinetic models, both in local current sheets and in global black hole magnetospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02461" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutrino flavor instabilities in neutron star mergers with moment transport: slow, fast, and collisional modes</a><span class="id">[2601.02461]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Determining where, when, and how neutrino flavor oscillations must be included in large-scale simulations of hot and dense astrophysical environments is an enduring challenge that must be tackled to obtain accurate predictions. Using an angular moment-based linear stability analysis framework, we examine the different kinds of flavor instabilities that can take place in the context of the post-processing of a neutron star merger simulation, with a particular focus on the collisional flavor instability and a careful assessment of several commonly used approximations. First, neglecting anisotropies of the neutrino field, we investigate the extent to which commonly used monoenergetic growth rates reproduce the results obtained from a full multi-energy treatment. Contrary to the large discrepancies found in core-collapse supernova environments, we propose a simple combination of energy-averaged estimates that reproduces the multi-energy growth rates in our representative simulation snapshot. We then quantify the impact of additional physical effects, including nuclear many-body corrections, scattering opacities, and the inclusion of the vacuum term in the neutrino Hamiltonian. Finally, we include the neutrino distribution anisotropies, which allows us to explore, for the first time in a multi-energy setting, the interplay between collisional, fast, and slow modes in a moment-based neutron star merger simulation. We find that despite a dominance of the fast instability in most of the simulation volume, certain regions only exhibit a collisional instability, while others, especially at large distances, exhibit a slow instability that is largely underestimated if anisotropic effects are neglected.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A possible challenge for Cold and Warm Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2601.02466]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Measuring the density profile and mass concentration of dark-matter haloes is a key test of the standard cold dark matter paradigm. Such objects are dark and thus challenging to characterise, but they can be studied via gravitational lensing. Recently, a million-solar-mass object was discovered superposed on an extended and extremely thin gravitational arc. Here we report on extensive tests of various assumptions for the mass density profile and redshift of this object. We find models that best describe the data have two components: an unresolved point-mass of radius $\leq10$ pc centred on an extended mass distribution with an almost constant surface density out to a truncation radius of 139 pc. These properties do not resemble any known astronomical object. However, if the object is dark matter-dominated, its structure is incompatible with cold dark matter models, but may be compatible with a self-interacting dark matter halo where the central region has collapsed to form a black hole. This detection could thus carry substantial implications for our current understanding of dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02476" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Maximum Gravity Model for partial Tidal Disruption Events: Mass Loss, Peak Fallback Rate and Dependence on Stellar Properties</a><span class="id">[2601.02476]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A star entering the tidal sphere of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can be partially stripped of mass, resulting in a partial tidal disruption event (TDE). Here we develop an analytical model for properties of these events, including the peak fallback rate, $\dot{M}_{\rm peak}$, the time at which the peak occurs, $t_{\rm peak}$, and the amount of mass removed from the star, $\Delta M$, for any star and any pericenter distance associated with the stellar orbit about the black hole. We compare the model predictions to 1276 hydrodynamical simulations of partial TDEs of main-sequence stars by a $10^6 M_\odot$ SMBH. The model yields $t_{\rm peak}$ predictions that are in good agreement (to within tens of percent) with the numerical simulations for any stellar mass and age. The agreement for $\dot{M}_{\rm peak}$ is weaker due to the influence of self-gravity on the debris stream dynamics, which remains dynamically important for partial TDEs; the agreement for $\dot{M}_{\rm peak}$ is, however, to within a factor of $\sim 2-3$ in the majority of cases considered, with larger differences for low-mass stars ($M_\star \lesssim 0.5 M_\odot$) on grazing orbits with small mass loss. We show that partial TDE lightcurves for disruptions caused by $\sim 10^6M_\odot$ SMBHs can span $\sim 20-100$ day peak timescales, whereas grazing encounters of high-mass stars with high-mass SMBHs can yield longer peak timescales ($t\gtrsim 1000$ days), associated with some observed transients. Our model provides a significant step toward an analytical prescription for TDE lightcurves and luminosity functions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02479" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards a global model for planet formation in layered MHD wind-driven discs: A population synthesis approach to investigate the impact of low viscosity and accretion layer thickness</a><span class="id">[2601.02479]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planet formation is inherently linked to protoplanetary disc evolution, which recent developments suggest is driven by magnetised winds rather than turbulent viscosity. We study planet formation in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind-driven discs, assuming accretion occurs in a laminar surface layer above a weakly turbulent midplane. Our goal is to assess the global consequences of recent hydrodynamical results, including inefficient midplane heating and the existence of two Type II migration regimes: slow viscosity-dominated and fast wind-driven migration. We perform single-embryo planetary population syntheses with varying initial disc conditions (i.e. disc mass, size and angular momentum transport), and embryo starting locations, testing different prescriptions for the accretion layer thickness $\Sigma_\text{active}$. Thin ($\lesssim0.01\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}}$) or fast ($\gtrsim12\%$ sonic velocity) accretion layers result in slow, viscosity-dominated regime which strongly limits the extent of Type II migration. For thick ($\gtrsim1\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}}$) or slow ($\lesssim3\%$ sonic velocity) accretion layers, fast wind-driven Type II migration occurs frequently, leading to long-range inward migration that sets in once planets reach masses sufficient to block the accreting layer. Disk-limited gas accretion is also strongly affected by deep and early gap opening, limiting maximum giant planet masses. These effects strongly influence the final mass-distance distribution. For thin layers, giant planets form nearly in situ once they have entered Type II migration, which happens already at a few Earth masses, while thick layers lead to numerous migrated Hot Jupiters. Overall, we find that while the global properties of the emerging planet population are strongly modified relative to classical viscous discs, key properties of the observed population can be reproduced within this new paradigm.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Models and Observational Predictions of Dust Traps in Protoplanetary Discs</a><span class="id">[2601.02486]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This manuscript investigates the impact of key dust evolution parameters on dust retention and trapping in protoplanetary discs. Using models with and without pressure bumps, combined with radiative transfer simulations, images of the dust continuum emission at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths, their fluxes and observed disc sizes are presented. For discs without pressure bumps (smooth discs), significant dust mass can only be retained over Myr timescales when dust fragmentation velocities are low (1m/s) and with viscosity values of $\alpha=10^{-3}$. For such a combination of fragmentation velocity and viscosity, the synthetic images show a bright inner emission follow by a shallow emission with potential gaps if they are present in the gas profile as well. At higher fragmentation velocities (5-10m/s), most dust is lost due to radial drift at million-year timescales unless pressure traps are present, in which case dust masses can increase by orders of magnitude and structures are observed in synthetic images. The viscosity parameter strongly shapes observable features, with low $\alpha$ producing sharper, potentially asymmetric inner wall cavities in inclined discs due to optically thick emission. High $\alpha$ favors the appearance of shoulders around the predominant rings that dust trapping produces. However, distinguishing between different fragmentation velocities observationally remains challenging. The inferred dust disc sizes from synthetic observations do not always correspond directly to dust model sizes or to the location of pressure bumps. Finally, we discuss implications for pebble fluxes and the delivery of volatiles to the inner disc. These results emphasize the strong degeneracies among dust evolution parameters and highlight the need for multi-wavelength, high-resolution observations to disentangle the processes shaping the formation of planets in protoplanetary discs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The intermediate neutron capture process. VI. Proton ingestion and i-process in rotating magnetic asymptotic giant branch stars</a><span class="id">[2601.02488]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The intermediate neutron-capture process (i-process) can occur during proton ingestion events (PIEs), which may take place in the early evolutionary phases of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We investigate the impact of rotational and magnetic mixing on i-process nucleosynthesis in low-metallicity, low-mass AGB stars. We computed AGB models with [Fe/H] = $-2.5$ and $-1.7$ and initial masses of 1 and 1.5 $M_{\odot}$ using the STAREVOL code, including a network of 1160 nuclei coupled to transport equations. Rotating models incorporate a calibrated Tayler-Spruit (TS) dynamo to account for core rotation rates inferred from asteroseismic observations of solar-metallicity sub-giants and giants. Initial rotation velocities of 0, 30, and 90 km s$^{-1}$ were considered, along with varying assumptions for magnetic mixing. We find that rotation without magnetic fields strongly suppresses the i-process due to the production of primary $^{14}$N, which is subsequently converted into $^{22}$Ne $-$ a potent neutron poison during the PIE. Including magnetic fields via the TS dynamo restores the models close to their non-rotating counterparts: strong core-envelope coupling suppresses shear mixing and prevents primary $^{14}$N synthesis, yielding i-process nucleosynthesis similar to non-rotating models. We also find that rotational mixing during the AGB phase is insufficient to affect the occurrence of PIEs. Proton ingestion event-driven nucleosynthesis proceeds similarly in asteroseismic-calibrated magnetic rotating AGB stars and non-rotating stars, producing identical abundance patterns.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02495" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gas rotation and turbulence in the galaxy cluster Abell 2029</a><span class="id">[2601.02495]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We constrain the rotation and turbulent support of the intracluster medium (ICM) in Abell 2029 (A2029), using dynamical equilibrium models and a combination of state-of-the-art X-ray datasets. We reduce and conduct the spectral analysis of the XRISM/Resolve data. The rotating, turbulent ICM in the model has a composite polytropic distribution in equilibrium in a spherically-symmetric, cosmologically motivated dark halo. The profile of rotation velocity and the distribution of turbulent velocity dispersion are described with flexible functional forms, consistent with the properties of synthetic clusters formed in cosmological simulations. Adopting realistic profiles for the metallicity distribution of the ICM and for the point spread function of XRISM and XMM-Newton, we tune via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm the observables of the intrinsic quantities of the plasma in our model to reproduce the radial profiles of the thermodynamic quantities as derived from the spectral analysis of the XMM-Newton and Planck maps and the measurements of the line-of-sight (LOS) non-thermal velocity dispersion and redshift (probing the LOS velocity) in the XRISM pointings. Our model accurately reproduces the measurements of redshift and LOS non-thermal velocity dispersion, as further demonstrated by simulating and analyzing synthetic counterparts of the XRISM spectra, in accordance with the posterior distribution of our model. We find turbulence-to-total pressure ratio $\approx$ 2% across the (0 - 650) kpc radial range, and a rotation-to-dispersion velocity ratio peaking at 0.15 between 200 - 600 kpc. The hydrostatic-to-total mass ratio is $\approx$ 0.97 at r2500, the radius enclosing an overdensity of 2500 times the average value.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamically consistent analysis of Galactic WN4b stars</a><span class="id">[2601.02498]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have optically thick winds that cloak the hydrostatic layers of the underlying star. In these cases, traditional spectral analysis methods are plagued by degeneracies that make it difficult to constrain parameters such as the stellar radius and the deeper density and velocity structure of the atmosphere. Focussing on the regime of nitrogen-rich WN4-stars with strong emission lines, we employ hydrodynamically-consistent modelling using the PoWR-HD code branch to perform a next generation spectral analysis. The inherent coupling of the stellar and wind parameters enables us to break parameter degeneracies, constrain the wind structure, and get a mass estimate. With this information, we can draw evolutionary implications and test current mass-loss descriptions for WR stars. We selected a sample of six Galactic WN4b stars. Applying updated parallaxes from Gaia DR3 and calculating PoWR-HD models that sufficiently resemble most of their spectral appearance, we obtain new values for the stellar and wind parameters of the WN4b sample. We compare our results to previous studies employing grid models with a beta = 1 velocity structure and cross-check our derived parameters with stellar structure predictions from GENEC and FRANEC evolution tracks. For all six targets, we obtain a narrow range of stellar temperatures T 140 kK, in contrast to previous grid-model analyses. We confirm the existence of WRs with luminosities as low as log L/Lsol = 5.0 and M 5 Msol. All derived velocity fields include a plateau feature at  85% of the terminal velocity. Both the distance updates and the switch to dynamically-consistent atmospheres lead to substantial parameter adjustments compared to earlier grid-based studies. A comparison of the derived mass-loss rates favours a different description for the WN4b sample than for WN2 stars analysed with the same methodology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02545" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing Pebble Drift History in Two Protoplanetary Disks with CO Enhancement</a><span class="id">[2601.02545]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pebble drift is an important mechanism for supplying the materials needed to build planets in the inner region of protoplanetary disks. Thus, constraining pebble drift's timescales and mass flux is essential to understanding planet formation history. Current pebble drift models suggest pebble fluxes can be constrained from the enhancement of gaseous volatile abundances when icy pebbles sublimate after drifting across key snowlines. In this work, we present ALMA observations of spatially resolved $^{13}$C$^{18}$O J=2-1 line emission inside the midplane CO snowline of the HD 163296 and MWC 480 protoplanetary disks. We use radiative transfer and thermochemical models to constrain the spatial distribution of CO gas column density. We find that both disks display centrally peaked CO abundance enhancement of up to ten times of ISM abundance levels. For HD 163296 and MWC 480, the inferred enhancements require 250-350 and 480-660 Earth Masses of pebbles to have drifted across their CO snowlines, respectively. These ranges fall within cumulative pebble mass flux ranges to grow gas giants in the interior to the CO snowline. The centrally peaked CO enhancement is unexpected in current pebble drift models, which predict CO enhancement peaks at the CO snowline or is uniform inside the snowline. We propose two hypotheses to explain the centrally-peaked CO enhancement, including a large CO desorption distance and CO trapped in water ice. By testing both hypotheses with the 1D gas and dust evolution code chemcomp, we find that volatile trapping (about 30\%) best reproduces the centrally peaked CO enhancement observed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dearth of Photosynthetically Active Radiation Suggests No Complex Life on Late M-Star Exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2601.02548]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rise of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere during the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) occurred about 2.3 billion years ago. There is considerably greater uncertainty for the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis, but it likely occurred significantly earlier, perhaps by 700 million years. Assuming this time lag is proportional to the rate of oxygen generation, we can estimate how long it would take for a GOE-like event to occur on a hypothetical Earth-analog planet orbiting the star TRAPPIST-1 (a late M star with Teff 2560 K). Although in the habitable zone, an Earth-analog planet located in TRAPPIST-1e's orbit would receive only 0.9% of the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) that the Earth gets from the Sun. This is because most of the star's light is emitted at wavelengths longer than the 400-700 nm PAR range. Thus it would take 63 Gyrs for a GOE to occur. But the linear assumption is problematic; as light levels increase, photosynthesis saturates then declines, an effect known as photoinhibition. Photoinhibition varies from species to species and depends on a host of environmental factors. There is also sensitivity to the upper wavelength limit of the PAR: extending just 50 nm increases the number of photons by a factor of 2.5. Including these and other factors greatly reduces the timescale to roughly 1-5 Gyrs for a GOE. However, non-oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria can thrive in low-light environments and can use near-IR light out to 1100 nm, providing 22 times as many photons. With this huge light advantage, and because they evolved earlier, anoxygenic photosynthesizers would likely dominate the ecosystem. On a late M-star Earth-analog planet, oxygen may never reach significant levels in the atmosphere and a GOE may never occur, let alone a Cambrian Explosion. Thus complex animal life is unlikely.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isotopic Ratios in the Disk of HD 163296</a><span class="id">[2601.02593]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Isotopic abundance ratios in protoplanetary disks are critical for understanding volatile inheritance and chemical evolution in planet-forming environments. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the rare isotopologue 13C18O(2-1) at approximately 0.3 arcsec resolution from the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296, combined with archival observations of C17O(2-1), C18O(1-0), and C17O(1-0), to empirically constrain carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios without detailed disk modeling. Both the C17O/13C18O(2-1) and C18O/C17O(1-0) flux ratios rise sharply across the CO snowline and flatten beyond 1.5 arcsec (r &gt;= 150 au), where the emission becomes optically thin. This transition, reflecting a steep drop in CO column density set by the disk's thermal structure, makes HD 163296 an optimal case for isotopic analysis. Using beam-averaged intensities of the four transitions measured in this optically thin region, we derive isotopic ratios of 12C/13C = 75.3 (+14.7/-11.4) and 18O/17O = 3.28 (+0.31/-0.26), both consistent with local interstellar medium values. The 16O/18O ratio remains weakly constrained due to moderate optical depth in the C18O(1-0) line and degeneracy with CO column density. These results demonstrate that rare CO isotopologues can provide robust, empirical constraints on isotopic ratios in disks when sharp structural transitions allow for the identification of optically thin regions, and establish HD 163296 as a benchmark for extending such studies to other systems with resolved snowline structures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Composition Mixing in Kilonova Ejecta with Ray-by-ray Simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.02600]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binary neutron star merger (BNSM) ejecta are considered a primary repository of $r$-process nucleosynthesis and a source of the observed heavy-element abundances. We implement composition mixing into ray-by-ray radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of BNSM ejecta, coupled with an online nuclear network (NN). We model mixing via a gradient-based mixing approximation that evolves simultaneously with the hydrodynamics. We find that mixing occurs in regions where the electron fraction changes rapidly. While mixing smooths composition gradients in transition regions, it has a negligible impact on the heavy-element yields. This is because the primary $r$-process site (the equatorial ejecta) is initially homogeneous in free neutrons, leaving no strong gradients for mixing to act upon. In each angular ray, the abundances of the most produced elements are robust under mixing, while the less abundant ones are more affected. The total global abundances change only slightly from mixing, since each angular ray contributes its most abundant elements. Furthermore, the predicted kilonova light curves show only minor reddening, with differences below the detectability of state-of-the-art telescopes. In general, we do not observe significant effects from mixing in the time span of the $r$-process. Consequently, mixing only leads to minor variations in abundances and light curves in ray-by-ray simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02637" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantifying the Contamination of TESS Ecliptic-Plane Light Curves by Minor Planets</a><span class="id">[2601.02637]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Though missions devoted to time series photometry focus primarily on targets far beyond the solar system, their observations can be contaminated by foreground minor planets, especially near the ecliptic plane where solar system objects are most prevalent. Crucially, depending on one's choice of data reduction/background estimation algorithm, these objects can induce both apparent brightening and/or dimming events in processed light curves. To quantify the impact of these objects on archived TESS light curves, we used N-body integrations of all currently known minor planets to postdict all 600,000+ of their interactions with stars selected for high-cadence observations during TESS ecliptic plane sectors. We then created mock images of these moving sources and performed simple aperture photometry using the same target and background apertures used in SPOC processing. Our resulting 10,000+ target-specific light curves, which faithfully model the time-dependent positions and magnitudes of the actual solar system objects that approached each target, reveal that $&gt;95\%$ of high-cadence ecliptic plane targets experience a minor planet crossing within 1 TESS pixel of the source. Additionally, 50% of all $T&gt;13$ mag targets experience at least one instantaneous moment where the contaminating flux from minor planets exceeds 1% of the target flux. We discuss these population-level results and others, and highlight several case studies of bright flybys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2024abfl: A Flat-Plateau, Low-Luminosity Type IIP Supernova with Early CSM Interaction</a><span class="id">[2601.02638]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024abfl, a low-luminosity Type IIP supernova (LLSN) discovered shortly after explosion. The transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_V = -14.9$ and exhibited an extended, flat plateau lasting $\sim$125 days. From the late-time bolometric light curve, we estimate a $^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim0.01~M_\odot$, consistent with other LLSNe. Analytical shock-cooling models fail to reproduce the rapid early rise, indicating that circumstellar material (CSM) interaction contributed to the initial emission. The spectroscopic evolution is typical of LLSNe, with relatively narrow metal lines and low expansion velocities ($\lesssim 3000$ km s$^{-1}$) that decline slowly over time. We detect a broad “ledge” feature around 4600 Åwithin three days of explosion, which we interpret as a blend of high-ionization shock-accelerated CSM lines. Multi-peaked H$\alpha$ profiles develop during the plateau phase, consistent with complex ejecta-CSM interactions. As one of the best-observed examples of LLSNe, SN 2024abfl exhibits a weak explosion and signatures of nearby CSM, offering new insights into progenitor properties, pre-explosion mass loss, and the diversity of LLSNe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02665" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOI-4495: A Pair of Aligned, Near-Resonant Sub-Neptunes that Likely Experienced Overstable Migration</a><span class="id">[2601.02665]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of a sub-Neptune and a Neptune-like planet ($R_b = 2.48^{+0.14}_{-0.10}\,R_\oplus$, $R_c = 4.03^{+0.23}_{-0.15}\,R_\oplus$) orbiting the F-type star TOI-4495. The planets have orbital periods of 2.567 days and 5.185 days, lying close to a 2:1 mean-motion resonance (MMR). Our photodynamical analysis of the TESS light curves constrains the planetary masses to $M_b = 7.7 \pm 1.4\,M_\oplus$ and $M_c = 23.2 \pm 4.7\,M_\oplus$. The measured masses and radii indicate the presence of volatile-rich gaseous envelopes on both planets. The Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and the Doppler shadow of TOI-4495 c reveal a well-aligned orbit with a projected stellar obliquity of $\lambda = -2.3^{+8.3}_{-7.8}\,\mathrm{deg}$. Combined with the low mutual inclination constrained by the photodynamical analysis ($\Delta I &lt; 8.7\,\mathrm{deg}$), the planetary orbits are likely coplanar and aligned with the host star's spin axis. We show that the planets are near, but not in, the 2:1 MMR, with a circulating resonant angle. We also find substantial free eccentricity for the inner planet, TOI-4495 b ($e_b = 0.078^{+0.020}_{-0.013}$). Given the observed proximity to the 2:1 resonance and the more massive outer planet, TOI-4495 b and c are particularly susceptible to resonant overstability, which can convert resonantly excited eccentricity into free eccentricity. However, additional mechanisms (e.g., planetesimal scattering) may be required to further excite the eccentricity by $\sim 4\%$. To prevent tidal damping from reducing the eccentricity below the observed level over the star's lifetime (1.9 Gyr), the reduced tidal quality factor of TOI-4495 b must be $Q' \gtrsim 10^5$, consistent with the presence of a thick envelope on the planet.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super-Orbital Variations in Magnetar Rotation Measure Arising from the Precession of Companion Star: Implications for FRB 20220529</a><span class="id">[2601.02734]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations of FRB 20220529 reveal significant variation and a partial reversal in its rotation measure (RM), suggesting the presence of a dynamically evolving magnetized environment, which could be caused by the orbital motion of the magnetar within the binary system. Here we develop the binary model by suggesting that the spin and magnetic axis of the companion star could undergo precession around the orbital axis. It is then investigated how the precession period and the inclination of the magnetic axis, as well as a possible disc wind, can influence the evolution behaviors of the RM and dispersion measure (DM) of FRB emission. As the foremost consequence, the RM variation can be significantly altered on timescales longer than the orbital period, producing super-orbital evolution and complex patterns. Applying this model to FRB 20220529, we find that its RM evolution could be reproduced with a precession period of 182 days and an inclination angle of approximately $19^{\circ}$, while the other binary parameters are fixed at their typical values. Meanwhile, the absence of significant variation of the DM argues against the presence of a dense equatorial disc around the companion star, which would be constrained by future long-term observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02772" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finite Plasma Beta Three-dimensional Magnetic Field Extrapolation Based on MHD Relaxation Method</a><span class="id">[2601.02772]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field in the solar atmosphere provides crucial information to understand the explosive phenomenon such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Since it is still hard that we determine the 3D magnetic field from direct observation, a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation is one of the best modeling methods that provides 3D magnetic field. However, the method is based on zero-beta assumption, i.e., the model ignores the gas pressure gradient and gravitational force. The magnetic field based on an NLFFF is not well reconstructed in high-beta region, such as in chromospheric or lower height layer and in weak field region. To overcome this problem, we need to consider the magnetohydrostatic equilibrium. In this study, we developed a finite plasma beta magnetic field extrapolation method based on magnetohydrodynamic relaxation method. In our method, we consider a force balance of the Lorentz force and the gas pressure. We tested three different schemes and extrapolated 3D magnetic field using an observational photospheric vector magnetic field of one solar active region, which is a quadrupole complex sunspot group and well studied with an NLFFF. The verification of three schemes is performed by comparing the residual force, and we concluded that our methods reduce  4% of residual force of the previous NLFFF. We also examined the plasma beta profile along the height and found that, in the core of the active region, plasma beta reaches a local minimum of  0.01 in the lower corona with beta  1 at the photosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02789" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indications of a Late-Time Transition to a Strongly Interacting Dark Sector</a><span class="id">[2601.02789]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the transition from the $\Lambda$CDM to an interacting dark sector by introducing a model with a redshift threshold that controls the onset of the energy transfer between the dark energy and the dark matter. Below the transition redshift, the interaction between dark matter and dark energy becomes active, while at earlier times the cosmological evolution coincides with that of $\Lambda$CDM. This approach allows us to determine the epoch in the comic history where the interacting effects have an impact in the description of the dark sector. We constrain the free parameters of the model using late-time cosmological observations, namely Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Supernova data from the Pantheon Plus, Union3.0, and DES-Dovekie catalogues. The analysis provides an indication of a strong interacting term that describes energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, which is activated at low redshifts. The PantheonPlus sample provides a threshold of $z_{T}&lt;0.624$, the Union3.0 sample yields $z_{T}=0.400_{-0.23}^{+0.021}$, and the DES-Dovekie sample gives $z_{T}=0.371_{-0.26}^{+0.028}$.

Transient anisotropy changes have been observed below 150 GeV, especially near the passage of an interplanetary shock and coronal mass ejection containing a magnetic flux rope ejected by a solar storm, which can trigger a geomagnetic storm with practical consequences. In such events, cosmic rays provide remote sensing of the magnetic field properties. Here we report the observation of transient large-scale anisotropy in TeV cosmic ray ions using data from the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We analyze hourly skymaps of the transient cosmic ray intensity excess or deficit, the gradient of which indicates the direction and magnitude of transient large-scale anisotropy across the field of view. We observe enhanced anisotropy above typical hourly fluctuations with $&gt;$5$\sigma$ significance during some hours of November 4, 2021, in separate data sets for four primary cosmic ray energy ranges of median energy from $E$=0.7 to 3.1 TeV. The gradient varies with energy as $E^{\gamma}$, where $\gamma\approx-0.5$. At a median energy $\leq$1.0 TeV, this gradient corresponds to a dipole anisotropy of at least 1\%, or possibly a weaker anisotropy of higher order. This new type of observation opens the opportunity to study interplanetary magnetic structures using air shower arrays around the world, complementing existing in situ and remote measurements of plasma properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonlinear Weak Lensing reconstruction for Galaxy Clusters</a><span class="id">[2601.02816]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a numerical investigation of nonlinear cluster lens reconstruction using weak lensing mass mapping. Recent advances in imaging and shear estimation have pushed reliable reduced shear measurements closer to cluster cores, making mass reconstruction accessible in the nonlinear regime. However, the Kaiser-Squires based algorithm becomes unstable in cluster cores, where convergence $\kappa$ significantly deviates from zero and the linear approximation breaks down. To address this limitation, we develop a reconstruction framework with two key modifications: applying smooth masks to these regions and using a model-derived analytical solution as the initial guess, rather than assuming $\kappa = 0$. We validate our framework using simulated cluster lensing data with known mass distributions, incorporating realistic masks that arise from limitations in reduced shear measurements. We show that in the absence of shape noise, our framework yields high-fidelity mass reconstruction in regions of large reduced shear, with the best-performing method achieving residuals below $0.02 \sigma$ in the unmasked regions. This pushes mass reconstruction to higher accuracy in the nonlinear regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studying the surface effect in Procyon A as an F-type star</a><span class="id">[2601.02840]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Procyon A is an F-type main-sequence star in a binary system. It has been the subject of numerous ground-based and space-based observing campaigns, providing precise classical constraints, including a well-determined mass. It was also among the first stars in which individual frequencies were detected, making it a crucial benchmark for F-type stars. Our goal is to investigate the surface effect, namely the discrepancy between observed and model oscillation frequencies due to inadequate modeling of the surface stellar layers, especially important in F-type stars. Using Procyon A as a case study, we aim to understand how different surface correction prescriptions impact the inference of the fundamental properties of this star, and compare the results with those obtained when the surface corrections are neglected. We inferred the fundamental stellar properties employing a grid of models computed with MESA, including gravitational settling, radiative accelerations, and turbulent mixing. We selected the best-fit models using the AIMS code taking into account different methods to fit the individual frequencies. We find that the use of surface corrections can introduce uncertainties up to 7\% in the inferred stellar mass. We identify that the most reliable stellar mass estimates are obtained when using frequency ratios, the Sonoi et al. (2015) surface correction or directly fitting the individual frequencies. Our results indicate that the surface effects in F-type stars differ from those found in the Sun and in solar-like stars, highlighting the need to be careful when considering the surface corrections for these stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring the homogeneity scale using the peculiar velocity field</a><span class="id">[2601.02886]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose an innovative definition of the scale at which the Universe becomes homogeneous based on measurements of velocities rather than densities. When using the matter density field, one has to choose an arbitrary scale (e.g. within 1\% of the average density) to define the transition to homogeneity. Furthermore, the resulting homogeneity scale is strongly degenerate with the galaxy bias. By contrast, peculiar velocities (PV) allow us to define an unambiguous scale of homogeneity, namely the distance at which the velocities between pairs of galaxies change from being on-average correlated to anti-correlated. Physically, this relates to when the motion of pairs of galaxies is influenced by the matter density between them, rather than beyond. The disadvantage is that peculiar velocities are more difficult to measure than positions, resulting in smaller samples with larger uncertainties. Nevertheless, we illustrate the potential of this approach using the peculiar velocity correlation functions obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey PV catalog, finding an homogeneity scale of $R_H\approx 133\substack{+28 \\ -52}\, \rm{Mpc/h}$. Finally, we show that more precise measurements are within reach of upcoming peculiar velocity surveys, and highlight this homogeneity scale's potential use as a standard ruler within the standard cosmological model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing ionized bubbles around luminous sources during reionization with SKA 21-cm observations</a><span class="id">[2601.02889]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detecting and characterizing individual ionized bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) using the redshifted HI 21-cm signal provides a direct probe of the early ionizing sources and the intergalactic medium. We develop and validate a computationally efficient estimator that operates on gridded visibilities to detect ionized bubbles. This serves as an accurate alternative to the more computationally demanding bare estimator that uses all baselines and frequency channels. Further, we employ a non-parametric foreground-subtraction method based on Gaussian process regression, which minimizes loss of the HI 21-cm signal and yields improved signal-to-noise ratios. Our analysis indicates that ionized bubbles at redshifts $z \sim 7 - 8$ can be detected with SNR $\gtrsim 10$ using $\sim 100$ hours of SKA1-Low AA$^*$ and AA4 observations. We further derive a scaling relation that connects the SNR to the bubble radius, redshift, total observing time, and the mean neutral hydrogen fraction of the surrounding IGM. This helps to quickly predict the observational outcome for any planned observations and is, therefore, useful for devising observational strategies. Finally, we apply a Bayesian likelihood framework with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to the residual visibilities to recover ionized bubble properties, including radius, position, and the mean neutral fraction. The resulting posterior distributions demonstrate accurate recovery of the bubble parameters. This confirms the feasibility of robustly characterizing individual ionized regions with the SKA1-Low.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators: emulating individual mode frequencies with a branching neural network</a><span class="id">[2601.02926]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurately measuring stellar ages and internal structures is challenging, but the inclusion of asteroseismic observables can substantially improve precision. However, the curse of dimensionality means this comes at a high computational cost when using standard interpolation methods across grids of stellar models.

We present PITCHFORK – a multilayer perceptron neural network with a branching architecture capable of rapid emulation of both classical stellar observables and individual asteroseismic oscillation modes of solar-like oscillators. PITCHFORK can predict the classical observables $T_{\text{eff}}$, $L$, and $\left[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}\right]$ with precisions of $5.88\,\text{K}$, $0.014\,\text{L}_{\odot}$, and $0.001\,\text{dex}$, respectively, and can predict 35 individual radial mode frequencies with a uniform precision of $0.02$ per cent. PITCHFORK is coupled to a vectorised Bayesian inference pipeline to return well-sampled and fully marginalised posterior distributions. We validate our rigorous treatment of the random uncertainties – including the asteroseismic surface effect – in an extensive hare-and-hounds exercise. We also demonstrate our ability to infer the stellar properties of benchmark stars – namely, the Sun and the binary stars 16 Cygni A and B. This work demonstrates a computationally scalable and statistically robust framework for stellar parameter inference of solar-like oscillators using individual asteroseismic mode frequencies. This provides a foundation for the treatment of systematics in preparation for the imminent abundance of asteroseismic data from future missions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02961" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarization of the CMB in the Standard Model Extension</a><span class="id">[2601.02961]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In standard cosmology, Cosmic Microwave Background photons near the last scattering surface exhibit only linear polarization due to Compton scattering, leading to the assumption that primordial circular polarization is negligible.

Our calculations employ the latest molecular and atomic line lists and pressure-broadening treatments, and include contributions from collision-induced absorption, free electrons, and scattering processes. We further provide cloudy mean opacity tables that account for cloud particle extinction across a range of particle sizes and capture the sequential removal of condensates as the gas cools. We benchmark our cloud-free tables against widely used opacity tables and find significant relative differences, exceeding 100% in Rosseland mean opacities at T \gtrsim 3000 K due to the inclusion of additional short-wavelength absorbers. Differences in Planck mean opacities at high temperatures are even larger, in some cases exceeding two orders of magnitude, which is most likely driven by the inclusion of Ca, Mg, and Fe cross-sections and updated Na D and K I resonance line treatments. Cloud opacities substantially increase Rosseland mean opacities for T \lesssim 2800 K, while their effect on Planck mean opacities is weaker. We also discuss limitations of our mean opacities at high pressures, where non-ideal effects become important.

In this paper, we study the cosmological model of BI with a dynamical dark energy. We find that individual consideration of the CPL parameterization and the data \texttt{DESI DR2} tend to larger Hubble constants for both BI and power law (PL) case with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Employing BI with combined CPL parameterization and \texttt{DESI DR2}, we obtain the Hubble constant $H_ 0 = 65.2^{ + 1.8}_{ - 2.2} \ \mathrm{km} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \cdot \mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$, which is larger than $H_ 0 = 64.0 \pm 2.1 \ \mathrm{km} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \cdot \mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$ for the PL case.

Positioned at the cool edge of the line-driven wind regime, many are candidate luminous blue variables (LBVs) likely near the Eddington Limit. Although brief, this evolutionary stage deeply impacts their surroundings and subsequent evolution. We study the mechanisms behind OBAHG winds and spectra, covering the temperature range of non-eruptive LBVs. Using the PoWR atmosphere code, we compute models with an Eddington parameter Gamma_e   0.4 and moderate turbulent pressure, typical for cool hypergiants, varying the effective temperature from  12.5 to  38.0 kK at solar metallicity. Our models show a complex temperature-dependent mass-loss pattern, with regions of higher/lower rates linked to two wind solutions: &quot;dense&quot; and &quot;airy.&quot; Spectra of known OBAHGs and LBVs match models from all solution regions. We find bi-stability jumps – with sharp mass-loss increases – at temperatures where Fe IV recombines to Fe III (and Fe III to Fe II). &quot;Drops&quot; in mass-loss also occur when the leading Fe ion changes at wind onset, signaling a switch to airy solutions under insufficient driving opacity. The resulting velocity fields also reflect these different regimes: airy solutions match the empirical terminal velocity vs temperature relation, while dense ones deviate. Turbulent pressure is crucial for wind acceleration at cooler temperatures, especially in airy regimes. We demonstrate that the bi-stability jumps exist in OBAHGs but are part of a broader complex behavior not replicated by current mass-loss recipes. Combining our and other recent results, we suggest that the switch between airy and dense solutions only occurs within a certain proximity to the Eddington Limit. Testing this requires future models with broader parameters and advanced treatments of radiatively-driven turbulence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Late-time Background Constraints on Linear and Non-linear Interacting Dark Energy after DESI DR2</a><span class="id">[2601.03122]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we present observational constraints on a class of phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) models that admit analytical solutions for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$.

For all eight IDE models, we find a better fit than $\Lambda$CDM from a $\Delta\chi^2$ analysis for both combinations of datasets considered. When using the Akaike Information Criterion ($\Delta$AIC), we find a similarly improved fit in all cases, except for one dataset combination in $Q=3H\delta\rho_{\rm de}$. Our analysis also shows a preference for sign-switching interactions, with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter at low redshift, reversing direction at higher redshift. These results should be interpreted with caution, as the latter direction of energy transfer is accompanied by negative dark energy densities in the past, which may be unphysical. Models that do not allow sign-changing behaviour instead show a preference for energy flow from dark matter to dark energy, and hence negative dark energy densities. The only exceptions are $Q=3H\delta\rho_{\rm de}$ and $Q=3H\delta\left(\tfrac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$, which exhibit energy flow in the opposite direction. Furthermore, for all interactions considered, we find a phantom-divide crossing in the effective dark energy equation of state $w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}$, with the dark energy density decreasing ($w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}&gt;-1$) at present and at low redshift, while increasing ($w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}&lt;-1$) in the past at high redshift.

V4641 Sgr is known for its superluminal radio jet discovered in 1999, but no radio counterpart of a large-scale jet has been observed. The goal of this work is to search for a radio counterpart of the extended VHE source. We observed V4641 Sgr with the MeerKAT radio telescope at the L and UHF bands and produced deep maps of the field using high dynamic range techniques. We report the discovery of a large-scale (35 pc), bow-tie-shaped, diffuse, radio structure around V4641 Sgr, with similar angular size to the extended X-ray emission discovered by XRISM. However, it is not spatially coincident with the extended VHE emission. After discussing the association of the structure with V4641 Sgr, we investigate the nature of the emission mechanism. We suggest that the bow-tie structure arose from the long-term action of large-scale jets or disk winds from V4641 Sgr. If the emission mechanism is of synchrotron origin, the radio/X-ray extended structure implies acceleration of electrons up to more than 100 TeV as far as tens of parsecs from the black hole.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helioseismic Evidence That the Solar Dynamo Originates near the Tachocline</a><span class="id">[2601.03238]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The exact location of the solar dynamo remains uncertain–whether it operates primarily in the near-surface shear layer, throughout the entire convection zone, or near the tachocline, a region of sharp transition in the solar rotation, located at the base of the convection zone, approximately 200,000 km beneath the surface. Various studies have supported each of these possibilities. Notably, the solar magnetic &quot;butterfly&quot; diagram and the pattern of zonal flows (&quot;torsional oscillations&quot;) exhibit strikingly similar characteristics, suggesting a link between magnetic field evolution and solar flows. Since magnetic fields cannot be measured directly in the deep solar interior, torsional oscillations and rotation gradients are employed as diagnostic proxies. Our analysis reveals that the gradient of rotation displays &quot;butterfly&quot;-like behavior near the tachocline, which is similar to the magnetic butterfly diagram at the surface. This result supports the idea that the solar dynamo has a deep-seated origin, likely operating either near the tachocline or throughout the convection zone, thereby disfavoring the recent scenario of a shallow, near-surface dynamo.

This motivates cross-correlations, to ascertain the cosmological nature of measured HI fluctuations, and to study their connections with galaxies and the underlying matter density field. However, these same foregrounds render the cross-correlation with projected fields such as the lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) difficult. Indeed, the correlated Fourier modes vary slowly along the line of sight, and are thus most contaminated by the smooth-spectrum radio continuum foregrounds. In this paper, we implement a method that avoids this issue by attempting to measure the non-linear gravitational coupling of the small-scale 21cm power from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) with large-scale Planck CMB lensing. This measurement is a position-dependent power spectrum, i.e. a squeezed integrated bispectrum. Using 94 nights of CHIME data between $1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.3$ and aggressive foreground filtering, we find that the expected signal is five times smaller than the current noise. We forecast that incorporating the additional nights of CHIME data already collected would enable a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, without any further improvements in filtering for foreground cleaning.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heavy Black-Holes Also Matter in Standard Siren Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2601.03257]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the release of the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog GWTC-4.0 by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, 218 candidate detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) have been reported. This milestone represents a major advancement for GW cosmology, as many methods, particularly those employing the spectral siren approach, critically depend on the number of available sources. We investigate the impact of a novel parametric model describing the full population mass spectrum of CBCs on the estimation of the Hubble constant. This model is designed to test the impact of heavy black holes in GW cosmology. We perform a joint inference of cosmological and population parameters using 142 CBCs from GWTC-4.0 with a false alarm rate smaller than 0.25 per year, using both spectral and dark siren approaches. With spectral sirens, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = 78.8^{+19.0}_{-15.3}\,{\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL), while the dark siren method yields $H_0 = 82.5^{+16.8}_{-14.3}\,{\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL). These results improve the uncertainty by approximately 30.4% and 36.2%, respectively. We show that this improvement is linked to the presence of a new mass scale in the binary black hole mass spectrum at $63.3^{+4.8}_{-4.8}\,M_{\odot}$, which provides additional constraints on the Hubble constant. Besides providing the tightest standard-siren constraints on $H_0$, this highlights the importance of a heavy-mass feature in the black hole spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02393" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral Properties and Energy Injection in Mercury's Magnetotail Current Sheet</a><span class="id">[2601.02393]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mercury's magnetotail hosts a thin and highly dynamic current sheet (CS), where magnetic reconnection and strong fluctuations frequently occur. Here, we statistically analyze magnetic field power spectra across 370 magnetotail CSs observed by MESSENGER. About 20% of the events are quasi-laminar, showing single power-law spectra, whereas 80% are turbulent, exhibiting a spectral break separating inertial and kinetic ranges. A dawn-dusk asymmetry is identified: inertial-range slopes are systematically shallower on the dawnside, whereas kinetic-range slopes are steeper, indicating more developed turbulence there, consistent with the higher occurrence of reconnection-related processes on the dawnside. Component analysis shows that the transverse components, orthogonal to the tail-aligned principal field (BX), display shallow slopes near -1 in the inertial range, suggesting energy injection at ion scales rather than a classical inertial range. These results demonstrate that Mercury's unique plasma environment fundamentally reshapes the initiation of turbulence and the redistribution of energy in the magnetotail.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Hole Formation in $f(R)=R+αR^2$ Gravity: Perturbative and Non-Perturbative Analysis</a><span class="id">[2601.02416]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a complete analytic and semi-analytic study of gravitational collapse and primordial black hole (PBH) formation in the quadratic $f(R)$ model $f(R)=R+\alpha R^2$.

For a collapsing flat FLRW dust interior we compute the explicit first-order corrections to the scale factor, the stellar radius, and the horizon formation time. We then use these results to obtain the shift in the PBH formation threshold $\delta_c$. The perturbative effect is small for PBHs forming in the deep radiation era, but becomes important when the background curvature is high. To access this early regime we reformulate the theory in the Einstein frame, where the model becomes GR plus the scalaron field $\phi$ with the Starobinsky potential. We provide the complete ODE system governing both the cosmological background and the evolution of an overdense closed FLRW patch. This system can be numerically integrated to obtain the critical overdensity $\delta_c(k)$ for PBH formation near the end of inflation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02468" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resonances in b-EMRIs: playing the black hole piano</a><span class="id">[2601.02468]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar-mass binaries evolving in the vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be common in the universe, either in active galactic nuclei or in other astrophysical environments. Here, we study in detail the resonant excitation of SMBH modes driven by a nearby stellar-mass binary. The resulting resonant energy fluxes vary with the orbital location and frequency of the binary, exhibiting a rich and complex structure. In particular, we find that the total energy flux radiated to infinity is maximized at a gravitational-wave frequency that is close to, but not exactly equal to, the real part of the corresponding quasinormal-mode frequency. Moreover, as the binary is moved farther away from the SMBH, this offset from the mode frequency becomes increasingly pronounced. In addition, for suitable orientations, the binary can effectively “feed” the light ring of the SMBH, selectively exciting particular oscillation modes. For rotating (Kerr) black holes, the mode spectrum is significantly more intricate; however, individual modes are also less strongly damped, leading to an enhanced - but more difficult to interpret - resonant response.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02980" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Universal Upper Bound on the Pressure-to-Energy Density Ratio in Neutron Stars</a><span class="id">[2601.02980]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The equation-of-state (EOS) parameter $\phi \equiv P/\varepsilon$, defined as the ratio of pressure to energy density, encapsulates the fundamental response of matter under extreme compression. Its value at the center of the most massive neutron star (NS), $\x \equiv \phi_{\rm c} = P_{\rm c}/\varepsilon_{\rm c}$, sets a universal upper bound on the maximum denseness attainable by any form of visible matter anywhere in the Universe. Remarkably, owing to the intrinsically nonlinear structure of the EOS in General Relativity (GR), this bound is forced to lie far below the naive Special Relativity (SR) limit of unity. In this work, we refine the theoretical upper bound on $\x$ in a self-consistent manner by incorporating, in addition to the causality constraint from SR, the mass-sphere stability condition associated with the mass evolution pattern in the vicinity of the NS center. This condition is formulated within the intrinsic-and-perturbative analysis of the dimensionless Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations (IPAD-TOV) framework. The combined constraints yield an improved bound, $\x \lesssim 0.385$, which is slightly above but fully consistent with the previously derived causal-only limit, $\x \lesssim 0.374$. We further derive an improved scaling relation for NS compactness and verify its universality across a broad set of 284 realistic EOSs, including models with first-order phase transitions, exotic degrees of freedom, continuous crossover behavior, and deconfined quark cores. The resulting bound on $\x$ thus provides a new, EOS-independent window into the microphysics of cold superdense matter compressed by strong-field gravity in GR.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflation in Extra-Dimensions with one or two branes</a><span class="id">[2601.02982]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we study two inflationary models, namely, monomial inflation and the simplest $\alpha$-attractor inflation, within extra-dimensional frameworks.

However, the maximum acceleration capability of W51C for CRs remains elusive. Based on observations conducted with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we report a significant detection of $\gamma$ rays emanating from the W51 complex, with energies from 2 TeV to 200 TeV. The LHAASO measurements, for the first time, extend the $\gamma$-ray emission from the W51 complex beyond 100 TeV and reveal a significant spectrum bending at tens of TeV. By combining the “$\pi^0$-decay bump&quot; featured data from Fermi-LAT, the broadband $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the W51 region can be well-characterized by a simple pp-collision model. The observed spectral bending feature suggests an exponential cutoff at $\sim400$ TeV or a power-law break at $\sim200$ TeV in the CR proton spectrum, most likely providing the first evidence of SNRs serving as CR accelerators approaching the PeV regime. Additionally, two young star clusters within W51B could also be theoretically viable to produce the most energetic $\gamma$ rays observed by LHAASO.

This paper conducted a dedicated data analysis of 1LHAASO J0007+7303u using the data collected from December 2019 to July 2023. This source is well detected with significances of 21$\sigma$ and 17$\sigma$ at 8$-$100 TeV and $&gt;$100 TeV, respectively. The corresponding extensions are determined to be 0.23$^{\circ}\pm$0.03$^{\circ}$ and 0.17$^{\circ}\pm$0.03$^{\circ}$. The emission is proposed to originate from the relativistic electrons and positrons accelerated within the PWN of PSR J0007+7303. The energy spectrum is well described by a power-law with an exponential cutoff function $dN/dE = (42.4\pm4.1)(\frac{E}{20\rm\ TeV})^{-2.31\pm0.11}\exp(-\frac{E}{110\pm25\rm\ TeV})$ $\rm\ TeV^{-1}\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}$in the energy range from 8 TeV to 300 TeV, implying a steady-state parent electron spectrum $dN_e/dE_e\propto (\frac{E_e}{100\rm\ TeV})^{-3.13\pm0.16}\exp[(\frac{-E_e}{373\pm70\rm\ TeV})^2]$ at energies above $\approx 50 \rm\ TeV$. The cutoff energy of the electron spectrum is roughly equal to the expected current maximum energy of particles accelerated at the PWN terminal shock. Combining the X-ray and gamma-ray emission, the current space-averaged magnetic field can be limited to $\approx 4.5\rm\ \mu G$. To satisfy the multi-wavelength spectrum and the $\gamma$-ray extensions, the transport of relativistic particles within the PWN is likely dominated by the advection process under the free-expansion phase assumption.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00379" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Enigmatic PeVatron in an Area around HII Region G35.6$-$0.5</a><span class="id">[2412.00379]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Identifying Galactic PeVatrons (PeV particle accelerators) from the ultra-high-energy (UHE, &gt;100 TeV) $\gamma$-ray sources plays a crucial role in revealing the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.

However, it is important to note that the radiation from GRB afterglows and the radio emission from SNe may be both produced by outflows evolving within the same ambient medium. In this study, we present the first comprehensive theoretical predictions of radio emission from a Type IcBL supernova associated with a GRB jet, explicitly accounting for the structure of the ambient medium. We model each component of the radio emission, with particular emphasis on exploring wide ranges of isotropic explosion energy and viewing angle in our GRB afterglow calculations. We show that, within specific regions of parameter space, the composite radio light curve exhibits a characteristic double-peaked structure. This clear double-peaked feature emerges when either (1) the isotropic explosion energy is small (low-luminosity GRB) or (2) the viewing angle is large (off-axis GRB). Our results demonstrate that follow-up radio observations carried out within a few years of the optical discovery of nearby Type IcBL SNe (-100 Mpc) can provide a unique diagnostic of off-axis GRBs that would otherwise remain undetected in Type IcBL SNe. This represents a step toward revealing the nature of long GRB progenitors and clarifying their connection to Type IcBL SNe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08863" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Water ice in the debris disk around HD 181327</a><span class="id">[2505.08863]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Debris disks are exoplanetary systems that contain planets, minor bodies (i.e., asteroids, Kuiper belt objects, comets, etc.), and micron-sized debris dust.

This implies the presence of a water-ice reservoir in the HD 181327 exoKuiper belt. Gradients of water-ice features at different stellocentric distances reveal a dynamic process of destroying and replenishing water ice in the disk, with estimated water-ice mass fractions ranging from 0.1% at  85 au to 14% at  113 au. It is highly plausible that the icy bodies that release water ice in HD 181327 could be the extra-solar counterparts of some of the Kuiper belt objects in our Solar System, supported by their spectral similarity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Going beyond $S_8$: fast inference of the matter power spectrum from weak-lensing surveys</a><span class="id">[2506.16434]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Weak lensing surveys are often summarized by constraints on the derived parameter ${S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}}$, obscuring the rich scale and redshift information encoded in the data, and limiting our ability to identify the origin of any tensions with $\Lambda$CDM predictions from the cosmic microwave background. In this work, we introduce a fast and flexible framework to extract the scale-dependent matter power spectrum $P(k, z)$ from cosmic shear and CMB lensing measurements, parameterizing deviations from the Planck $\Lambda$CDM prediction as a free function $\alpha(k)$. Using public data from DES Y3, KiDS-1000, HSC Y3, and ACT DR6, we constrain $\alpha(k)$ with fast Hamiltonian Monte Carlo inference, employing multipoles up to $\ell_{\rm max}\sim2000$ for the galaxy lensing surveys. Our results show a consistent 15-30% suppression in the matter power spectrum at intermediate scales ($k \sim 0.1-1{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) in galaxy-lensing data relative to a Planck $\Lambda$CDM prediction with a CDM-only (no baryonic feedback) power spectrum, with combined tensions reaching up to $4\sigma$. This is under a fixed cosmology and with analytic marginalization over shear and redshift calibration uncertainties. In contrast, ACT CMB lensing is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM at ${k\lesssim 0.1 {\rm Mpc}^{-1}}$. We validate our method using mock data, quantify consistency between datasets, and demonstrate how the resulting $\alpha(k)$ likelihoods can be used to test specific models for the power spectrum. All code, data products, and derived likelihoods are publicly released. Our results highlight the importance of reporting lensing constraints on $P(k, z)$ and pave the way for model-agnostic test of growth of structure with upcoming surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22537" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helium Atmospheres May Hide in Current Exoplanet Analysis Frameworks</a><span class="id">[2506.22537]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The increasing number of detailed exoplanet observations offers an opportunity to refine our analyses and interpretations. Here, we show that atmospheres that appear volatile-rich and/or cloudy may instead be helium-rich. As transmission spectra constrain the atmospheric scale height ($H$), a He-enriched atmosphere can be misinterpreted as H$_2$-dominated water-rich to bring the mean molecular weight ($\mu$) to intermediate values ($\sim$4$-$10) when He/H$_2$ is fixed. Similarly, a cloud deck can reduce the spectral features, and thus the apparent (i.e., cloud-free equivalent) $H$. We present a proof-of-concept reanalysis of HD 209458 b's JWST transmission spectrum treating He/H$_2$ as a free parameter, resulting in sets of He-rich solutions. We argue that He enhancement must be considered to reliably constrain atmospheric composition, be sensitive to a more diverse planetary population, and ultimately yield robust trends to inform formation and evolution pathways. Looking ahead, we suggest leveraging insights from differences in pressure-broadening effects, outflow measurements, and atmospheric chemistry to disentangle reliably between He-, volatile-rich, and cloudy atmospheres – while recognizing that associated models need targeted upgrades to reach the fidelity level required to this end.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective Theories of Redshift-Space Galaxy Peculiar Velocities</a><span class="id">[2508.00066]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present predictions for redshift-space peculiar velocity statistics in the Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations of the effective field theory (EFT) of large-scale structure.

However, instrumental miscalibration angles $\alpha$ can mimic this signal, necessitating a joint estimation approach. In this work, we forecast the sensitivity of the AliCPT experiment, combined with Planck HFI data, on constraining the isotropic CB angle using a semi-analytical maximum-likelihood method. We simulate observations under various foreground complexities, rotation angles, and scanning strategies, and demonstrate that AliCPT can achieve an uncertainty of $\sigma(\beta)=0.09^\circ$ with one-year data, which will improve to $0.026^\circ$ after four years' observations.

Various physical processes in the disk could trigger such features – one of which that has been previously theorized for passive disks is the thermal wave instability – the flared disk may become unstable as directly illuminated regions puff up and cast shadows behind them. This would manifest as bright and dark rings, and a staircase-like structure in the disk optical surface. We provide a realistic radiation hydrodynamic model to test the limits of the thermal wave instability in irradiated disks. We carry out global axisymmetric 2D hydrostatic and dynamic simulations including radiation transport with frequency-dependent ray-traced irradiation and flux-limited diffusion (FLD). We found that starlight-driven shadows are most prominent in optically thick, slow cooling disks, shown by our models with high surface densities and dust-to-gas ratios of sub-micron grains of 0.01. We recover that thermal waves form and propagate inwards in the hydrostatic limit. In contrast, our hydrodynamic models show bumps and shadows within 30 au that converge to a quasi-steady state on several radiative diffusion timescales – indicating a long-lived staircase structure. We find that existing thermal pressure bumps could produce and enhance this effect, forming secondary shadowing downstream. Hydrostatic models with self-consistent dust settling instead show a superheated dust irradiation absorption surface with a radially smooth temperature profile without staircases. We conclude that one can recover thermally induced flared-staircase structures in radiation hydrodynamic simulations of irradiated protoplanetary disks using flux-limited diffusion. We highlight the importance of modeling dust dynamics consistently to explain starlight-driven shadows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delayed Wind Onset in Pa 30, the Remnant of Type Iax SN 1181</a><span class="id">[2511.14829]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pa 30 is the recently identified remnant of the historical supernova SN 1181, likely a Type Iax event, and a nebula surrounding the central white dwarf launching a fast wind ($\sim10^9~\cm~\s^{-1}$) is observed in optical and infrared bands. X-ray observations show that this wind collides with the surrounding material and produces a termination shock, and the observed extent of the shock indicates that the wind started blowing centuries after 1181 A.D. rather than immediately after the SN explosion. We propose that the wind is triggered by delayed ignition of fallback carbon-rich material on the WD surface and investigate the conditions that reproduce such delayed ignition. We show that producing delays of several centuries requires a relatively hot post-explosion WD core with a temperature $T_c \simeq 6\times10^8~\mathrm{K}$.

Using 3D simulations of rotating convection in spherical shells, we show that inertial modes–oscillations restored by the Coriolis force–emerge naturally in rotationally constrained turbulence, without imposing any external forcing other than thermal/buoyancy driving. By varying the rotation rate at fixed Rayleigh number, we find that coherent modes appear only when the convective Rossby number, the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time, falls below about one-half, where rotation dominates the dynamics. These modes are mostly retrograde in the rotating frame, equatorially symmetric, and confined to mid and high latitudes, with discrete frequencies well below twice the background rotation rate. At lower viscosities, or smaller Prandtl number, mode excitation becomes more efficient and a broader spectrum of inertial modes emerges. While the precise excitation mechanism remains uncertain, our results suggest that the modes are driven by instabilities due to differential rotation rather than stochastic forcing by convection. We conclude that similar inertial modes are likely to exist in the interiors of giant planets and stars, though their low frequencies will make them difficult to detect.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05588" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Squared-field cross-correlation between kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and 21-cm intensity mapping</a><span class="id">[2512.05588]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutral hydrogen (HI) 21-cm intensity mapping is an effective method to track the distribution of baryonic matter, and extract astrophysical and cosmological information. The 21-cm intensity field has a nonvanishing cross-correlation with the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect that traces the velocity and density perturbations of free electrons. By using the linear perturbation theory, in this paper we calculate analytically, for the first time, the cross-correlation between the squared kSZ field and the projection of the squared HI intensity mapping field with the flat-sky approximation. This statistic remains nonvanishing even after the long-wavelength line-of-sight modes ($k_{\parallel}$) are removed due to foreground contamination. We further forecast for the prospects of detection with the SKA-MID 21-cm intensity mapping experiments (redshifts in range of $0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1$), and the kSZ maps measured by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Simons Observatory (SO). The predicted cumulative signal-to-noise ratio is $1.92$ for SKA-ACT and $3.99$ for SKA-SO. These results show a possible on-the-edge detection on the cross-correlation signal at low redshifts, which in turn could serve as a validation step toward using it for the Epoch of Reionization studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cygnus X-3: A variable petaelectronvolt gamma-ray source</a><span class="id">[2512.16638]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of variable $\gamma$-rays up to petaelectronvolt from Cygnus X-3, an iconic X-ray binary.

A plausible driver is upstream turbulence. Broadband fluctuations arriving at the front can continually wrinkle it, changing the local shock geometry and, in turn, conditions for particle injection and radiation. We develop a linear-MHD formulation that treats the shock as a moving interface rather than a fixed boundary. In this approach the shock response can be summarized by an effective impedance determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot base state and the shock geometry, while the upstream turbulence enters only through its statistics. This provides a practical mapping from an assumed incident spectrum to the corrugation amplitude, its drift along the surface, and a coherence scale set by weak damping or leakage. The response is largest when the transmitted downstream fast mode propagates nearly parallel to the shock in the shock frame, which produces a Lorentzian-type enhancement controlled by the downstream normal group speed. We examine how compression, plasma $\beta$, and obliquity affect these corrugation properties and discuss implications for fine structure in heliospheric and supernova-remnant shock emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decoding Cygnus X-2: The Critical Role of Reflection in IXPE Data</a><span class="id">[2601.01669]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a spectro-polarimetric re-analysis of the first IXPE observation of Cygnus X-2 which we determine to be mainly in the normal branch, from quasi-simultaneous observations with NuSTAR, NICER, and INTEGRAL.

Leveraging NuSTAR's detection of both the relativistic Fe K emission line and the Compton hump, we constrain the flux contribution of the reflected emission from the inner accretion disk to be 10% of the total X-ray flux in the IXPE energy band. Unlike previous studies that modeled only the Fe K emission line, we fit the full-band reflection spectrum using a fully relativistic disk model. There is strong degeneracy between the Comptonized and reflection components. Given that the Comptonized component is not expected to be highly polarized, a polarization degree of approximately 20% for the reflection component could explain the X-ray polarization data from IXPE.

Different modes of oscillations are frequently observed in solar prominences/filaments, and prominence seismology helps estimate important physical parameters like the magnetic field strength. Although the simultaneous detection of longitudinal and transverse oscillations in the same filament is not common, such rare observations provide a unique opportunity to constrain the physical parameters of interest. Aims. In this study, we aim to estimate the physical parameters of prominences undergoing simultaneous longitudinal and transverse oscillations. Methods. We apply Bayesian seismology techniques to observations of longitudinal and transverse filament oscillations to infer the magnetic field strength, the length, and the number of twists in the flux tube holding the prominence plasma. We first use the observations of longitudinal oscillations and the pendulum model to infer the posterior probability density for the magnetic field strength. The obtained marginal posterior of the magnetic field, combined with the observations of the transverse oscillations, is then used to estimate the probable values of the length of the magnetic flux tube that supports the filament material using Bayesian inference. This estimated length is used to compute the number of twists in the flux tube. Results. For the prominences under study, we find that the length of the flux tubes supporting the quiescent prominences can be very large (from 100 to 1000 Mm) and the number of twists in the flux tube are not more than three. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian analysis offers valuable methods to perform parameter inference in the context of prominence seismology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Betelgeuse Enigma: The Betelbuddy Hypothesis</a><span class="id">[2601.02012]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the past six years, Betelgeuse has been in the news and drawn significant public interest.

In a previous article, the author discussed the most accepted explanation to the dimming caused by episodic mass loss that released large dust grains, which obscured Betelgeuse's light and made it appear fainter. This interpretation suggested that the dimming was not a precursor to a supernova, as Betelgeuse is likely still far from reaching that stage. On 21 July 2025, the existence of the companion star was confirmed with direct imaging, for the first time, by the alopeke instrument on the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope. The companion is 6 magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse and orbits close to Betelgeuse itself, within the supergiant star's extended outer atmosphere. The stellar companion was detected at an angular separation of 52 mas and a position angle of 115 deg east of north. These measurements, along with its brightness, being roughly 6 magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse at 466 nm, are in excellent agreement with dynamical predictions. Although this was only a 1.5 sigma detection, the agreement in the companion's appearance, separation, position angle, magnitude difference, and estimated mass is reasonable, making the result tentatively acceptable. The next optimum period for observations is November 2027, when we hope to get better observations. This article describes the interesting twists and turns of this study and what lies in the future for Betelgeuse and its companion, Betelbuddy or Siwarha.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09064" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monitoring the daily variation of Sun-Earth magnetic fields using galactic cosmic rays</a><span class="id">[2410.09064]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) between the Sun and Earth is an extension of the solar magnetic field carried by the solar wind into interplanetary space.

By comparing the attenuation length of the muon content with predictions from high-energy hadronic interaction models (QGSJET-II-04, SIBYLL 2.3d, and EPOS-LHC), it is evident that LHAASO results are significantly shorter than those predicted by the first two models (QGSJET-II-04 and SIBYLL 2.3d) but relatively close to those predicted by the third model (EPOS-LHC).

Our analysis indicates that in its planned five year run the DSA-2000 could reach sensitivity to QCD axion parameters, improve current limits on compact dark matter by an order of magnitude, and enhance cosmological weak lensing neutrino mass constraints by a factor of three.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freeze-in production of scalaron dark matter in $f(R)$ gravity</a><span class="id">[2506.06436]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We demonstrate that the scalaron, a scalar degree of freedom, emerging from the $f(R)$ theory of gravity, can account for the observed dark matter (DM) abundance if its mass is around the MeV scale, to ensure its cosmological stability. Focusing on two well-known $f(R)$ gravity models, we systematically show that if scalaron production proceeds via the freeze-in mechanism, the right relic abundance is satisfied over a very narrow window of reheating temperature $10^{14}\lesssim T_{\rm rh}\lesssim 10^{16}$ GeV. We delineate the viable parameter space of the $f(R)$ models consistent with the observed DM abundance, and highlight relevant experimental constraints from searches targeting DM decay signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implications of DESI for Dark Matter &amp; Cosmic Birefringence</a><span class="id">[2506.12589]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore an interacting dark matter (DM)-dark energy (DE) framework that naturally yields an effective dynamical DE equation of state crossing the phantom barrier at early times, as indicated by recent DESI data, while also accounting for the observed isotropic rotation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) linear polarization. Within this unified framework, we also explain the DM relic abundance without introducing additional fields or couplings. Depending on the DE potential, we identify two viable scenarios: a superheavy freeze-in DM requiring a high reheating temperature, or a strongly interacting dark sector with a GeV-TeV scale thermal DM candidate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02637" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Classification of $f(R)$ Theories Of Inflation And The Uniqueness of Starobinsky Model</a><span class="id">[2507.02637]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We classify $f(R)$ theories using a mathematical analogy between slow-roll inflation and the renormalization-group flow. We derive the power spectra and spectral indices class by class and compare them with the latest data. The framework used for the classification allows us to determine the general structure of the $f(R)$ functions that belong to each class. Our main result is that only two classes survive. Moreover, we show that the Starobinsky model is the only polynomial $f(R)$ that can realize slow-roll inflation. In fact, all other polynomials belong to a special class that can only realize constant-roll inflation, at least far enough in the past. We point out some of the issues involved in considering a smooth transition between constant-roll and slow-roll inflation in this class of models. Finally, we derive the map that transforms the results from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05508" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond $ρ^{2/3}$ Scaling: Microscopic Origins and Multimessengers of High-Density Nuclear Symmetry Energy</a><span class="id">[2510.05508]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ encoding the cost to make nuclear matter more neutron rich has been the most uncertain component of the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter. It affects significantly the radii, tidal deformations, cooling rates and frequencies of various oscillation modes of isolated neutron stars as well as the strain amplitude and frequencies of gravitational waves from their mergers, besides its many effects on structures of nuclei as well as the dynamics and observables of their collisions. Siemens (1970s) observed that $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ scales as $(\rho/\rho_0)^{2/3}$ near the saturation density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter, since both the kinetic part and the potential contribution (quadratic in momentum) exhibit this dependence. The scaling holds if: (1) the nucleon isoscalar potential is quadratic in momentum, and (2) the isovector interaction is weakly density dependent. After examining many empirical evidences and understanding theoretical findings in the literature we conclude that: (1) Siemens' $\rho^{2/3}$ scaling is robust and serves as a valuable benchmark for both nuclear theories and experiments up to $2\rho_0$ but breaks down at higher densities, (2) Experimental and theoretical findings about $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ up to $2\rho_0$ are broadly consistent, but uncertainties remain large for its curvature $K_{\mathrm{sym}}$ and higher-order parameters, (3) Above $2\rho_0$, uncertainties grow due to poorly constrained spin-isospin dependent tensor and three-body forces as well as the resulting nucleon short-range correlations. Looking forward, combining multimessengers from both observations of neutron stars and terrestrial heavy-ion reaction experiments is the most promising path to finally constraining precisely the high-density $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ and the EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observable Signatures of a Quarkyonic Phase in Neutron Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.23405]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Performing Bayesian inference on quarkyonic equation-of-state models for neutron star matter, we find they satisfy all current astrophysical observations, thus reinforcing the argument for the use of such neutron star matter equation-of-state models alongside traditional ones. To observationally differentiate between stars with and without a quarkyonic phase, we identify a novel observational signature- the slope of the mass-radius relation at some fixed mass in conjunction with the sound speed at the star's center. In this plane, we find quarkyonic stars in a region with high central sound speed and positive slope, that is distinct from purely nucleonic stars. High accuracy NS radii measurements facilitated by the next generation of detectors, coupled with ongoing studies of mapping astrophysical observables to microphysical properties like sound speed can be used for testing this signature. Our results indicate that a neutron star with these properties would be a strong evidence for existence of a quarkyonic phase or a similar crossover transition in its core.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Bondi accretion of a self-interacting complex scalar field</a><span class="id">[2511.04650]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scalar fields with a global U(1) symmetry often appear in cosmology and astrophysics. We study the spherically-symmetric, stationary accretion of such a classical field onto a Schwarzschild black hole in the test-field approximation. Thus, we consider the relativistic Bondi accretion beyond a simplified perfect-fluid setup. We focus on the complex scalar field with canonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either preserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is well known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such a scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate that going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate with respect to the perfect fluid case. Hence, black holes can provide a way to distinguish a perfect fluid from its ultraviolet completion in form of the complex scalar field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00980" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graviton-Photon Mixing by a Kerr-Newman Black Hole with Worldline EFT</a><span class="id">[2601.00980]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In black hole perturbation theory, the difficulty in separating electromagnetic and gravitational sectors of the coupled Teukolsky equations has prevented a general treatment of scattering processes involving both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves in presence of a Kerr-Newman black hole. We present the first computation of the gauge-invariant, low-frequency scattering amplitude for graviton photoproduction by a Kerr-Newman black hole at tree level up to $\mathcal{O}\big((\omega/m)^2\big)$ or $\mathcal{O}(S^2)$ and linear in $\kappa$, using the worldline effective field theory. The relevant Wilson coefficients are determined by matching the graviton and photon one-point functions to the Kerr-Newman solution. We obtain the full angular dependence of the conversion cross section in the presence of spin and comment on the factorization relation between the graviton photoproduction amplitude and the photon Compton amplitude for a classical spinning source. The result provides a benchmark for future analyses of coupled gravitoelectromagnetic scattering in spinning charged compact object backgrounds.</p></div></details></article></body>
