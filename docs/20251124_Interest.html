The lecture covered the circumstances of the author's start in radio astronomy, the demographics of radio astronomers, discussions of the outstanding, mostly serendipitous, discoveries made by radio astronomers over the past century, and concluded with reflections on the prospects for further new discoveries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17203" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mathematics: the Rise of the Machines</a><span class="id">[2511.17203]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We argue how AI can assist mathematics in three ways: theorem-proving, conjecture formulation, and language processing. Inspired by initial experiments in geometry and theoretical physics in 2017, we summarize how this emerging field has grown over the past years, and show how various machine-learning algorithms can help with pattern detection across disciplines in the mathematical sciences. At the heart is the question how does AI help with theoretical discovery, and the implications for the future of mathematics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analogical models to introduce high school students to modern physics: an inquiry-based activity on Rutherford's gold foil experiment</a><span class="id">[2504.10366]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study presents the design and the implementation of an inquiry-based reconstruction of Rutherford's gold foil experiment.

<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teaching quantum computing to computer science students: Review of a hands-on quantum circuit simulation practical</a><span class="id">[2511.17218]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a practical course targeting graduate students with prior knowledge of the basics of quantum computing. The practical aims to deepen students' understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing by implementing quantum circuit simulators. Through hands-on experience, students learn about different methods to simulate quantum computing, including state vectors, density matrices, the stabilizer formalism, and matrix product states. By implementing the simulation methods themselves, students develop a more in-depth understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing, including superposition, entanglement, and the effects of noise on quantum systems. This hands-on experience prepares students to do research in the field of quantum computing and equips them with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle complex research projects in the field. In this work, we describe our teaching approach and the structure of our practical, and we discuss evaluations and lessons learned.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Role of Conceptual Problem Solving in Learning Physics: A Study in a General Relativity University Course</a><span class="id">[2502.08564]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Effective physics learning, especially in complex topics, requires balancing mathematical formalism with conceptual understanding. Conceptual problem-solving involves connecting math to physical reality, and using an epistemological framework like problem framing helps students justify their mathematical decisions. This approach deepens students' understanding by linking theory to practice and enhancing their reasoning skills. This study explores the effectiveness of conceptual problem-solving in learning complex topics like general relativity (GR) through a pedagogical framework that emphasizes the integration of qualitative and quantitative reasoning. We present a case study conducted at the University of Cagliari in 2021 and 2022, examining how students construct problem frames and how this influences their conceptual understanding of GR. Findings indicate that students who effectively integrate conceptual reasoning with mathematical formalism demonstrate a deeper grasp of physical principles and enhanced problem-solving capabilities. The research underscores the importance of symbol sense and the iterative nature of problem framing, suggesting that an integrated approach - combining visual, symbolic, and natural language representations - can improve students' conceptual engagement. Furthermore, the methodology offers instructors valuable insights into students' thinking processes, supporting more effective and targeted feedback.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analogical models to introduce high school students to modern physics: an inquiry-based activity on Rutherford's gold foil experiment</a><span class="id">[2504.10366]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study presents the design and the implementation of an inquiry-based reconstruction of Rutherford's gold foil experiment.

It can simulate linear and nonlinear optical phenomena in real time, a task that pushes the boundaries of current consumer hardware. This paper details the concept, implementation, and evaluation of a dynamic graph-based solution tailored to the specific requirements and challenges of the simulation. Resource usage is optimized through a selective updating strategy that identifies and preserves laser paths unchanged between simulation frames, eliminating the need for unnecessary recalculations. Benchmarking of real-world scenarios confirms that our approach delivers a smooth user experience, even on mobile VR platforms with limited computing power. The methodologies, solutions and insights outlined in this paper may be applicable to other interactive, dynamic graph-based real-time simulations.</p></div></details></article></body>
