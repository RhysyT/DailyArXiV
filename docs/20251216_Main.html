Direct imaging surveys of intermediate-mass stars have suggested that the brown dwarf desert may be fundamentally a feature in the mass ratio. Microlensing surveys provide a unique opportunity to investigate the nature of this desert around low mass stars, as microlensing hosts have typical masses of 0.05-0.8 $M_\odot$. Here, we perform a statistical analysis of homogeneously selected binary-lens microlensing events in the literature, and identify a companion mass-ratio desert at $0.02\lesssim q\lesssim0.05$ and projected separations around 1-5 au. We derive a statistically significant truncation to the giant-planet mass-ratio distribution at $q\simeq0.02$, above which the occurrence rate density drops by approximately an order of magnitude. Due to the possibility that the small number of detected companions in this desert orbit white dwarfs, this mass-ratio desert may be closer to being completely dry around main-sequence stars. Below this desert, we derive a giant-planet ($q&gt;4\times10^{-4}$) occurrence rate density of $5.8\pm0.8$% per decade of projected separation. Our analysis furthers the hypothesis that the brown dwarf desert is fundamentally a feature in the mass ratio, separating distinct populations of planetary and non-planetary companions that are likely formed via core accretion and gravitational instability, respectively. The persistence of this desert across stellar types suggests that both gas-giant planets and sub-stellar companions form in a scale-invariant fashion, with planets growing to a maximum of approximately 2% their host masses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of Partial Coherence due to Multipath Propagation for FRB 20220413B with CHIME/FRB</a><span class="id">[2512.11969]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a $\sim$ millisecond-long transient phenomenon that propagate across extragalactic distances and are effectively a point source. Radio wave propagation through inhomogeneous distributions of plasma can act as a lens, generating multiple images of the emitted electric field. A lens can produce images of a point source where the phase of the electric field between images remains coherent when observed by a radio telescope. FRB 20220413B shows a complicated pulse structure with time separated components that may be image copies of the main components due to plasma lensing. We perform several analyses to determine if FRB 20220413B is consistent with expectations of a plasma lensed FRB. We analyze and fit the morphology of the burst to a plasma lens model and find consistency in the spectro-temporal profile but not the observed flux. Using the complex-valued channelized voltage data from the CHIME telescope, we perform a time-lag correlation analysis and report correlation signatures present in the electric field of FRB 20220413B. We find that there exists an excess correlation signature only in absolute power and not in phase. We perform a frequency-lag correlation analysis on the spectra of all subcomponents of the burst and find a consistent scintillation bandwidth across all components. We find the scintillation bandwidth is consistent with expectations of scattering due to the Milky Way. We interpret this as all burst components propagating through the same scintillation screen located in the Milky Way, which would generate the excess variance signature observed, even in the absence of phase coherence between burst components. We find that while the burst morphology can be modeled by a plasma lens, the coherent signature present in the time-lag correlation is consistent with the expectations of a common scattering screen, but not coherent plasma lensing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11971" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Earths to Super-Earths: Five New Small Planets Transiting M Dwarf Stars</a><span class="id">[2512.11971]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Earth-sized planets transiting M dwarf stars present one of the best opportunities with current facilities for studying the atmospheric and bulk compositions of terrestrial worlds. Here, we statistically validate five new transiting Earth and super-Earth sized planets orbiting M dwarf stars using a combination of light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, multi-color observations from Palomar and Las Cumbres Observatory, high-resolution imaging, and stellar spectroscopy. The sample includes: TOI-5716 b, an Earth-sized planet (R_p = 0.96 $\pm$ 0.05 Rearth) with a 6.766-day orbit around a metal-poor thin-disk star ([Fe/H] = -0.54 $\pm$ 0.10); TOI-5728 b, a super-Earth (R_p = 1.31 $\pm$ 0.05 Rearth) on an 11.497-day orbit; and TOI-5736 b, a larger planet (R_p = 1.56 $\pm$ 0.07 Rearth) with an ultra-short period of just 0.649 days. We also statistically validate a multi-planet system, TOI-5489, hosting two similarly-sized super-Earths: TOI-5489 b (R_p = 1.40 $\pm$ 0.05 R_earth) and TOI-5489 c (R_p = 1.28 $\pm$ 0.07 R_earth) with orbital periods of 3.152 and 4.921 days, respectively. Due to their longer orbital periods, TOI-5716 b and TOI-5728 b both have equilibrium temperatures $\leq$ 400 K, making them useful test cases for studies of atmospheric mass loss. If TOI-5728 b is confirmed to have an Earth-like bulk composition, it would join the very small sample of rocky planets orbiting mid- to late-M dwarfs that lie below the cosmic shoreline and therefore may have retained high mean molecular weight atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST/NIRSpec Detects Warm CO Emission in the Terrestrial-Planet Zone of HD 131488</a><span class="id">[2512.11972]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have obtained a high-resolution, JWST NIRSpec $2.87$ – $5.14$ $\mu$m spectrum of the debris disk around HD 131488. We discover CO fundamental emission indicating the presence of warm fluorescent gas within $\sim10$ AU of the star. The large discrepancy in CO's vibrational and rotational temperature indicates that CO is out of thermal equilibrium and is excited with UV fluorescence. Our UV fluorescence model gives a best fit of $1150\,$K with an effective temperature of $450$, $332$, and $125\,$K for the warm CO gas kinetic temperature within $0.5$, $1$, and $10\,$AU to the star and a gas vibrational temperature of $8800\,$K. The newly discovered warm CO gas population likely resides between sub-AU scales and $\sim\,10\,$AU, interior to the cold CO reservoir detected beyond $35\,$AU with HST STIS and ALMA. The discovery of warm, fluorescent gas in a debris disk is the first such detection ever made. The detection of warm CO raises the possibility of unseen molecules (H$_2$O, H$_2$, etc) as collisional partners to excite the warm gas. We estimated a lower mass limit for CO of $1.25\times 10^{-7}\text{M}_{\oplus}$, which is $10^{-5}$ of the cold CO mass detected with ALMA and HST. We demonstrate that UV fluorescence emerges as a promising avenue for detecting tenuous gas at $10^{-7}$ Earth-mass level in debris disks with JWST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Residual energy in weakly compressible turbulence with a mean guide field</a><span class="id">[2512.11973]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The energy distribution is a fundamental property of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. In strongly magnetized turbulence energy imbalances can arise, quantified by the so-called residual energy: $E_r~=~(E_{kin}~ - ~E_{mag})$; $E_{kin}$ and $E_{mag}$ stand for the volume-averaged kinetic and magnetic energy, respectively. Numerical simulations of incompressible turbulence yield $E_r &lt; 0$, which is consistent with Solar wind observations, while in highly compressible turbulence simulations $E_r &gt; $ 0. Differences arise in the cascade of $E_r$ between the two regimes. We explore the properties of $E_r$ in weakly compressible MHD turbulence in the presence of an initially strong (guide) magnetic field. We study the influence of different driving mechanisms and field strengths on the cascade of $E_r$. We run a suite of direct numerical simulations with the PENCIL code. All simulations are maintained through forcing in a quasi-static regime with sonic Mach numbers close to 0.1. We solely change the Alfvén Mach number, or equivalently the plasma beta ($\beta$) of the simulations. We drive turbulence by either injecting velocity or magnetic fluctuations at large scales and study the power spectra of kinetic, magnetic, density, and $E_r$. Magnetically-driven simulations show locally imbalanced Alfvénic fluctuations and a $\propto k^{-3/2}$ cascade, consistent with the dynamic alignment theory. Kinetically-driven simulations give rise to a $\propto k^{-1}$ scaling, consistent with interactions between Alfvén waves scattered by density inhomogeneities – a hallmark of reflection-driven turbulence. Residual energy is positive with a spectral slope ($\alpha$) depending on $\beta$ as: for $\beta = 4.0$, $-2 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -5/3$, for $\beta = 1.0$, $-5/3 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -3/2$, and for $\beta = 0.3$, $\alpha \approx -1$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The maximum offsets of binary neutron star mergers from host galaxies</a><span class="id">[2512.12018]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analytically derive, and illustrate with a population synthesis model, the maximum offset of binary neutron star mergers ejected from their host galaxies. This approximate maximum offset is 300 kpc $\times\ (v_\mathrm{esc} / 500\ \mathrm{km}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1})^{-7}$, where $v_\mathrm{esc}$ is the escape velocity from the host galaxy. Massive hosts with high escape velocities are unlikely to yield very large offsets. This maximum offset should inform the host associations of mergers that are not coincident with galaxies. We also discuss potential correlations between offsets and system masses, and possibly the duration of the gamma-ray burst accompanying the merger.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direct measurement of $^{59}$Cu($p$,$α$)$^{56}$Ni precludes a strong NiCu cycle in Type-I X-ray bursts</a><span class="id">[2512.12025]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Model-observation comparisons of type-I X-ray bursts (XRBs) can reveal the properties of accreting neutron star systems, including the neutron star compactness. XRBs are powered by nuclear burning and a handful of reactions have been shown to impact the model results. Reactions in the NiCu cycles, featuring a competition between $^{59}$Cu($p$,$\gamma$)$^{60}$Zn and $^{59}$Cu($p$,$\alpha$)$^{56}$Ni, have been shown to be among the most important reactions as they are a critical checkpoint in $rp$-process flow and significantly impact the light curves and burst ashes. We report a direct measurement of $^{59}$Cu($p$,$\alpha$)$^{56}$Ni bringing stringent constraints on this reaction rate. New results rule out a strong NiCu cycle in XRBs, with a negligible degree of recycling, $\leq$5\% up to 1.5 GK. The new reaction rate, when varied within new uncertainty limits, shows no impact on one-zone XRB model light-curves tailored for clocked-burster $\tt{GS 1826-24}$, hence removing an important nuclear physics uncertainty in the model-observation comparison.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray Evolution of Young Stars: Early Dimming and Coronal Softening in Solar-Mass Stars with Implications for Planetary Atmospheres</a><span class="id">[2512.12055]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) emission from young stars plays a critical role in shaping the evolution of planetary atmospheres and the conditions for habitability. To assess the long-term impact of high-energy stellar radiation, it is essential to empirically trace how X-ray luminosities and spectral hardness evolve during the first  &lt;1 Gyr, when atmospheric loss and chemical processing are most active. This study extends the X-ray activity-mass-age analysis of &lt;25 Myr stars by Getman et al. (2022) to ages up to 750 Myr, using Gaia-based cluster memberships, new Chandra observations of five rich open clusters ( 45–100 Myr), and archival ROSAT and Chandra data for three older clusters ( 220–750 Myr). We find a mass-dependent decay in X-ray luminosity: solar-mass stars undergo a far more rapid and sustained decline, accompanied by coronal softening and the disappearance of hot plasma by  100 Myr, compared to their lower-mass siblings. These trends in solar-mass stars are likely linked to reduced magnetic dynamo efficiency and diminished ability to sustain large-scale, high-temperature coronal structures. The trends are significantly stronger than predicted by widely used XUV-rotation-age relations. The revised trends imply systematically lower rates of atmospheric mass loss and water photolysis, as well as altered ionization environments and chemical pathways relevant to the formation of prebiotic molecules, for planets in close orbits around solar analogs. These effects persist throughout at least the  &lt;750 Myr interval probed in this study.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inference of Neutron Star Mass Distributions and the Equation of State from Multi-messenger Observations</a><span class="id">[2512.12130]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We construct a combined model to incorporate neutron star (NS) mass measurements with electromagnetic mass-radius constraints and gravitational-wave observations using Bayesian inference. We use different mass distributions for three populations depending on the companion stars: double neutron stars, NS - white dwarfs, and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). To observe the effects of different parametrizations, we use two equation of state (EoS) models: a piecewise polytrope and a fixed sound-speed model at high densities in combination with a low-density EoS. Our results show that the mass distributions of these NS populations are distinct and sensitive to the EoS prior choices. In addition, using a uniform prior on the observable NS maximum mass rather than a nuisance parameter from the unknown high-density EoS, shifts the posterior maximum mass to larger values. For polytrope-like EoSs, the maximum mass posterior shifts from $M_\mathrm{max}=2.09_{-0.07}^{+0.18} M_\odot$ to $2.15_{-0.10}^{+0.19} M_\odot$ at the 90% confidence level. This change in prior also impacts the posterior for the shape of the mass distribution of NSs in LMXBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the dark matter origin of the halo-like 20 GeV $γ$-ray excess with the AMS-02 antiproton data</a><span class="id">[2512.12176]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Very recently, a significant $\sim 20$ GeV gamma-ray excess in the Milky Way halo has been reported and a dark matter origin has been suggested. The inferred dark matter parameters are $ m_\chi \sim 0.5-0.8 $ TeV and $ \langle \sigma v \rangle \sim (5-8) \times 10^{-25}~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$ for the $ b\bar{b} $ channel. If correct, prominent antiproton emission is produced and can be directly tested by the AMS-02 data. In this work we calculate the corresponding antiproton emission and show that the expected flux at $\sim 100$ GeV is already above the AMS-02 observation. A proper treatment on the antiproton background resulting from the high energy cosmic ray propagation would suggest an annihilation cross section of $&lt; 2\times 10^{-26}~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$, which is a few$\times 10$ times lower than that needed to interpret the potential signal. We therefore conclude that the $\sim 20$ GeV gamma-ray excess in the Milky Way halo is not a viable dark matter signal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational Properties of $β$ Cephei Stars: 88 new samples discovered Based on TESS and Gaia Data</a><span class="id">[2512.12190]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a systematic investigation of $\beta$ Cephei (BCEP) stars by integrating photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) with astrometric parameters from Gaia Data Release 3. Utilizing TESS's short-cadence (SC) and full-frame image (FFI) photometry, along with Gaia parallaxes and temperatures derived from the Extended Stellar Parametrizer for Hot Stars (ESP-HS) pipeline, we identify 88 new BCEP stars and candidates–85 from SC data and 3 from SPOC-processed FFI observations. These targets exhibit visual magnitudes ranging from 8.0 to 12.0 mag, parallaxes between 0.11 and 1.74 mas, effective temperatures of 18,000 to 30,000 K, and luminosities from 1,500–38,000 $L_\odot$, consistent with previously cataloged BCEP populations, thereby demonstrating the robustness of our classification criteria. Key findings include: (1) a significant detection disparity between SC and FFI datasets, with 30\% of SC targets exceeding 18,000 K compared to only 0.7\% in FFI, reflecting observational biases toward high-luminosity, hotter stars in SC data; (2) four samples near the red edge of the theoretical instability strip, exhibiting sparse pulsation modes that are important samples for testing pulsation models under low-mass, low-temperature conditions; and (3) spatial clustering within the Galactic disk ($|b| &lt; 20^\circ$), with two high-latitude outliers likely representing runaway stars ejected from disk environments. Our analysis underscores the critical role of space-based photometry in detecting low-amplitude pulsators and the transformative potential of multi-survey integration in the era of time-domain astronomy. These results provide new samples to constrain stellar pulsation theories of massive stars and to study Galactic dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12227" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Merger Rate of Primordial Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2512.12227]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The merger rate of primordial black hole (PBH) binaries can be used to understand the source population of the merging black hole binaries observable through gravitational-waves (GWs) and also to constrain the possible contribution of PBHs to dark matter. In the literature, the PBH merger rate is calculated analytically, assuming that PBH binaries stay in isolation (i.e. are unperturbed) and evolve solely via GW emission during their entire lifetime. However, if some or all of dark matter consists of PBHs, then as cosmic structures grow, PBH binaries and single PBHs fall inside dark matter halos. In those halos, the PBH binaries' interactions with their environment significantly affect the subsequent evolution of their orbital properties. In this paper, we present a numerical framework that accurately calculates the total PBH merger rate by combining the evolution of isolated binaries outside halos with the dynamics of binaries inside halos. In our work we have found that the isolated binary channel is suppressed at low redshifts and dynamical interactions in halos reshape the merger rate evolution with time, accelerating some mergers. At redshifts of $\lesssim 2$ the total merger rate is a factor of $\simeq 50 \%$ higher than the results assuming that all PBH binaries effectively stay unperturbed until their merger. Our simulations provide a definitive calculation on the total PBH merger rates, that are currently being probed and constrained from gravitational-wave observations. We make our merger rates publicly available at Zenodo</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray properties of RR Lyrae and Cepheid variables from eROSITA</a><span class="id">[2512.12290]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a search for X-ray counterparts to RR Lyrae and Cepheid variables using data from the first eROSITA all-sky survey. We identify seven RR Lyrae and eight Cepheid variables with positional matches to X-ray sources. While most Cepheid associations appear reliable, the RR Lyrae matches are predominantly spurious. Only one source, OGLE-BLG-RRLYR-00252, appears to be a plausible RR Lyrae detection, potentially representing the first observational evidence of X-ray emission from a star of this type. Its inferred luminosity suggests that RR Lyrae stars are intrinsically at least two orders of magnitude fainter in X-rays than the brightest Cepheids. We also observe a tentative increase in X-ray luminosity with pulsation period among classical Cepheids, and higher luminosities in type II Cepheids at comparable periods. These trends may reflect intrinsic differences in atmospheric structure and shock efficiency, offering new insight into the mechanisms driving high-energy emission in pulsating stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NICER Magnetar Burst Catalog</a><span class="id">[2512.12291]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we present a comprehensive catalog of short bursts from magnetars based on eight years of NICER observations. A total of 1130 bursts were identified, making this the largest magnetar burst catalog to date. The sample is dominated by SGR 1935+2154, which contributes 76% of all detected bursts. We analyzed burst durations, spectral properties, and their correlations across multiple sources. Bursts from SGR 1935+2154 exhibit significantly longer durations, with a mean of 317 ms, compared to a mean of 23 ms for bursts from other magnetars. Two microsecond-scale bursts were detected for the first time, originating from 1E 1048.1-5937 and CXOU J010043.1-721134. Spectral analysis in the 0.5–8 keV range using both blackbody and power-law models shows that bursts with higher fluences have harder spectra. In contrast, correlations between burst duration and spectral parameters are weak or absent. This catalog provides a valuable dataset for studying magnetar short bursts, enabling future modeling efforts and improving our understanding of the diversity and physical mechanisms of magnetar bursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12298" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Effect of a Self-bound Equation of State on the Structure of Rotating Compact Stars</a><span class="id">[2512.12298]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper investigates how a self bound equation of state (EOS), which describes strange quark stars, affects the rotational properties of compact stars, focusing on deviations from universal relations governing gravitational mass and radius changes due to rotation. The analysis reveals significant deviations in stars with higher surface-to-center total energy-density ratios, $\frac{\epsilon_s}{\epsilon_c+c^2P_c}$, challenging the established universal relations. For Newtonian stars, hydrostatic equilibrium ensures that the difference between the gravitational potential at the center, $\Phi_c$, and at the poles, $\Phi_p$, remains constant within sequences of rotating neutron stars characterized by the same central and polar specific enthalpy ($\Phi_c - \Phi_p = -h_c +h_p$). Combined with the scaling $\Phi \propto R_e^2$, where $R_e$ denotes the equatorial radius, this condition naturally leads to a quasi-universal behavior in the rotational change of radius within these sequences. Similarly, in general relativistic stars, the hydrostatic equilibrium maintains that $\Phi^{GR}_{p} - \Phi^{GR}_{c}$ remains unchanged within these sequences, where $\Phi^{GR}$ is one of the metric potentials. Inspired by this theoretical framework, a toy model has been developed to capture the dependence of gravitational mass and radius deviations on the surface-to-central total energy density ratio. Subsequently, an improved set of empirical universal relations has been proposed, for accurately modeling rapidly rotating compact stars with self-bound EOSs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local Nonlinear Transforms effectively Reveal Primordial Information in Large-Scale Structure</a><span class="id">[2512.12304]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To eliminate gravitational non-Gaussianity, we introduce the $\mathcal{Z}$-$\kappa$ transform, a simple local nonlinear transform of the matter density field that emulates the inverse of nonlinear gravitational evolution. Using $N$-body simulations, we show that the $\mathcal{Z}$-$\kappa$ transform with $\kappa=6$ or $\kappa\to\infty$ (i.e., log) substantially Gaussianizes the density distribution, and recovers the linear power spectrum. In an extended parameter space including primordial non-Gaussianity, summed neutrino mass, and $\Lambda$CDM parameters, Fisher analysis demonstrates that power spectra of transformed fields provide strong complementary constraints. A central result is that these power spectra can directly capture the local primordial non-Gaussianity imprinted in large-scale structure.

Additionally, we find that these flows turn over and change direction at depths below 0.97R, forming circulation cells with lifetimes dictated again by the hemispheric magnetic imbalance, which is dominated by the occurrences of large sunspots.

The QS observations acquired on 28 October 2023 in 174A channel of High Resolution EUV Imager (HRIEUV) of EUI and 171A channel of AIA are used. During the time of the observations, the separation angle between Solar Orbiter and SDO was approximately 26\de. A novel image alignment analysis shows that the dominant formation heights are 11.4Mm for HRIEUV and 4Mm for AIA. Despite this height difference, the PD velocity fields obtained from the observations from the two instruments are in good agreement across the region. In the QS the median PD speed is around 6.7 and 7.4\kms\ for HRIEUV and AIA respectively, with maximum speeds of around 40\kms. The small equatorial CH is a region dominated by a low temperature of $\approx$0.8MK and is host to high PD speeds, with a median speed of 17\kms. The velocity field bridges coherently across the CH from neighbouring QS regions from east to west, thus the CH must be overlaid by a system of long, low-lying closed magnetic loops. This unexpected configuration is supported by a potential field (PF) magnetic model and may be due to the longevity of the CH, allowing time for interchange reconnection with neighbouring closed-field regions. The FC is observed to be multithermal, with a narrow central strip of high emission at both low (0.8MK) and high (2.5MK) temperatures and low emission at warm (1.2MK) temperature. The FC has PD speeds similar to those of the QS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12345" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar-cycle variations in meridional flows and rotational shear within the Sun's near-surface shear layer</a><span class="id">[2512.12345]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using solar-cycle long helioseismic measurements of meridional and zonal flows in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun, we study their spatio-temporal variations and connections to active regions. We find that near-surface inflows towards active latitudes are part of a local circulation with an outflow away from them at depths around 0.97 R, which is also the location where the deviations in the radial gradient of rotation change sign. These results, together with opposite-signed changes over latitude and depth in the above quantities observed during the solar minimum period, point to the action of the Coriolis force on large-scale flows as the primary cause of changes in the rotation gradient within the NSSL. We also find that such Coriolis force-mediated changes in near-surface flows towards active latitudes only marginally change the amplitude of zonal flow and hence are not likely to be its driving force. Our measurements typically achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio ($&gt;$5$\sigma$) for near-surface flows but can drop to 3$\sigma$ near the base (0.95 R) of the NSSL. Close agreements between the depth profiles of changes in rotation gradient and in meridional flows measured from quite different global and local helioseismic techniques, respectively, show that the results are not dependent on the analysis techniques.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring the Collisional Evolution of Debris Clusters in an Asteroid System</a><span class="id">[2512.12353]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Rotational instability of rubble-pile asteroids can trigger mass shedding, forming transient debris clouds that may provide the initial conditions for secondary formation in binary systems. Aims. We investigate the dynamical and collisional evolution of a debris cloud numerically generated around a Didymos-like progenitor, as a representative case for the early formation of Dimorphos. The analysis focuses on the growth and structural properties of clusters composed of centimetre- to decimetre-scale particles. Methods. We perform full-scale simulations of debris evolution around a near-critically rotating asteroid using a cross-spatial-scale approach combined with the discrete element method (DEM). To overcome computational timescale limitations, an equivalent cluster-scale simulation framework is introduced to capture the essential collisional growth processes efficiently. These simulations quantify the efficiency of cluster growth and the structural evoution within the debris cloud. Results. Our simulations reveal that particles shed from a rotationally unstable asteroid exhibit a consistent migration pattern toward low-geopotential regions, which governs the mass distribution and dynamical structure of the debris cloud. The collisional velocity are well described by a Weibull distribution (lambda = 0.0642, k = 1.8349), where low-velocity impacts favor accretion. These collisions enable clusters to grow from centimeter-decimeter scales to meter-sized bodies, developing compact, moderately porous structures (Delta I \approx 0.8, phi \approx 0.52). Collisions between meter-sized clusters do not exhibit a bouncing barrier: low-velocity impacts yield Dinkinesh-like shapes, while moderate velocities promote plastic merging and continued growth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thread Separation and Expansion Observed in Multi-Stranded Solar Coronal Loops</a><span class="id">[2512.12417]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The theoretical expectation that coronal loops should expand with height contrasts with observations that typically show constant cross-sections. We investigate the idea that this discrepancy results from loops being composed of fine threads whose expansion occurs below the resolution limits of instruments like SDO/AIA. In this paper, we present two significant findings: (1) several extended loops exhibit measurable expansion, suggesting length as a critical factor in detection capability, and (2) high-resolution Solar Orbiter/EUI observations have captured expanding loops in active regions. For both AIA and EUI data, we observe cases where thread separation is directly visible as the loops evolve. These findings complement our previous work indicating AIA loops may consist of relatively few threads. Collectively, these observations provide compeling evidence supporting the multi-thread model and offer a potential resolution to the long-standing loop expansion problem in solar coronal physics. However, the high densities and narrow temperature distributions of observed coronal loops remain unresolved.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12481" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Readdressing the contribution of photonuclear reactions to the muon content of extensive air showers: a heuristic approach</a><span class="id">[2512.12481]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The indirect ground-based observations of cosmic rays through extensive air showers in modern experiments typically involve the use of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the characteristics of the primary particles. These simulations necessitate assumptions about particle interactions at energies that have not yet been experimentally probed, which introduces systematic uncertainties in key observables, particularly the number of muons. Current research on this uncertainty primarily focuses on hadronic interaction models, the dominant source of muon production. This study presents an approach that takes into account another significant mechanism for muon generation: photonuclear reactions. A robust heuristic technique has been developed to estimate the contribution of these interactions to the total number of muons over a wide range of extensive air shower parameters (including primary particle type, energy, and slant atmospheric depth) and photonuclear interaction models, with an absolute percentage error on the order of $10\%$ in the estimated number of muons. Furthermore, several potential applications of the suggested method in relation to modern challenges in extensive air shower physics are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetized transonic accretion disks</a><span class="id">[2512.12494]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Theoretical studies of transonic accretion onto black holes reveal a wide range of possible solutions, broadly classified into smooth flows and flows featuring shocks. Accretion solutions that involve the formation of shocks are particularly intriguing, as they are expected to naturally produce observable variability features. However, despite their theoretical significance, time-dependent studies exploring the stability and evolution of such shocked solutions remain relatively scarce. To address this gap, we perform simulations of transonic accretion flows around a black hole in ideal magneto-hydrodynamic framework. Our simulations are initialized using boundary conditions derived from semi-analytical hydrodynamical models, allowing us to explore the stability of these flows under varying magnetic field strengths. The presence of magnetic fields modifies the dynamics of the accretion flow through magnetic pressure, and the resulting force imbalance induces oscillations in the position of shock front. Our results show that variations in the emitted luminosity arising from shock oscillations appear as quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), a characteristic feature commonly observed in accreting black holes. We find that the QPO frequency is determined by the radial position of the shock front: oscillations occurring closer to the black hole produce frequencies of tens of hertz, whereas shocks located farther out yield sub-hertz frequencies</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12557" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraint on magnetized black bounce spacetime from HFQPOs data and the selection of resonance models via information criterion</a><span class="id">[2512.12557]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper primarily explores the dynamics of charged particle in the magnetized SV spacetime, and constrains the parameters of the SV spacetime along with its surrounding magnetic fields. The constraints are given by using $\chi^2$ analysis combined with high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) data observed from three microquasars: GRS 1915+105, XTE 1550-564, and GRO J1655-40. The results indicate that the magnetic field significantly influences the position of the innermost stable circular orbit of charged particle and frequency distribution of epicyclic motion, which excites more resonance model variants, enhancing observational effects. Additionally, we employ the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate resonance model and its various variants. The support for different models from observational data shows significant variation: $E R_8$ as the best model is supported strongly, $ER_3$ model has moderate evidence of support, $ER_6$ and $ER_7$ models are considerably less support, while other resonance models have essentially no support. For models more supported by the observational data, the allowed ranges of the regularization parameter: $0\leq a&lt;0.736$ ($68\%$ confidence level) suggests that HFQPOs data support the magnetized black bounce spacetime as a regular black hole, and the smaller value of the regularization parameter indicates a possibility of the presence of quantum effects. According to the constraint results, we get the best-fit values of magnetic field strength around $10^{-5}\sim 10^{-4}$ GS for electrons and around $10^{-2}\sim 10^{-1}$ GS for protons. Finally, as a comparison, we test the SV spacetime without a magnetic field using microquasar observational data, and the calculated results of AIC show that this case is incompatible with the HFQPOs data, further supporting the existence of a magnetic field in SV spacetime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Search for Soft $γ$-ray Emission from the Galaxy Cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell 3667) Using INTEGRAL/ISGRI</a><span class="id">[2512.12616]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a search for soft $\gamma$-ray emission from the merging galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell 3667) using archival INTEGRAL/ISGRI observations. This cluster located at $z=0.0556$ hosts prominent radio relics associated with merger-driven shocks, suggesting the presence of relativistic electrons capable of producing inverse-Compton (IC) emission in the 30–300 keV band. Using standard OSA 11.2 imaging and spectral pipelines and a total effective exposure of 2506 s, we find no significant emission at the cluster position in any energy interval. The extracted ISGRI spectrum is consistent with pure background, and no physically meaningful model parameters can be constrained. From the mosaic variance maps, we derive a conservative $3\sigma$ upper limit of $F_{30-300\,\mathrm{keV}} &lt; 6.9 \times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ assuming a power-law spectrum with $\Gamma = 2$. This limit rules out bright IC scenarios and constrains the efficiency of merger-driven particle acceleration in SPT-CL J2012-5649.

The coupling of these modes to the radiative interior is yet to be discussed. We aim to understand the dependence of the modes on the uniformly rotating subadiabatic region below the convection zone, and whether this leads to measurable changes at the surface. We used the Dedalus code to compute the linear eigenmodes in the inertial frequency range in a setup including both the convection zone and the radiative interior down to $0.5 R_\odot$. We imposed free-surface boundary conditions at both radial boundaries. For comparison, we also computed the eigenmodes in a setup restricted to the convection zone. We find that the inclusion of the radiative zone only slightly modifies the frequencies and the eigenfunctions at the surface, excluding some modes with significant radial motions (high-frequency retrograde and prograde columnar modes). On the other hand, most modes penetrate significantly into the overshooting layer below the convection zone, which significantly reduces the growth rate of the modes and distorts their eigenfunctions near the base of the convection zone. Furthermore, the uniformly rotating subadiabatic radiative zone supports oscillations due to Rossby modes of all possible spherical harmonics and radial nodes. In particular, when the nearest inertial mode in frequency space lies within around 10 nHz and shares the same north-south symmetry, these Rossby modes evolve into mixed modes characterized by significant motions within both the radiative and convection zones. However, such mixed modes have a large mode mass in the radiative interior and thus will be difficult to excite stochastically by convection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12720" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Particle Acceleration in Magnetized Shear-Driven Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2512.12720]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Shear flows, ubiquitous in space and astrophysical plasmas, can accelerate particles through turbulence excited by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We present the first numerical study of particle acceleration in non-relativistic, magnetized, and purely shear-driven turbulence that includes full particle backreaction. Using two-dimensional MHD-PIC simulations with an initially uniform flow-aligned magnetic field and external stirring force, we demonstrate that sustained particle acceleration requires continuously driven turbulence, whereas freely decaying turbulence rapidly depletes its energy reservoirs and halts the acceleration. The acceleration mechanism operates through the systematic distortion of gyro-orbits by turbulent electric fields: acceleration phases extend the particle trajectory along the electric force, increasing the energy gain, while deceleration phases shorten the trajectory, reducing the energy loss. This asymmetry produces net energy gain despite stochastic fluctuations, with the mean energy change scaling quadratically with shear velocity, characteristic of second-order Fermi acceleration. Initially monoenergetic particles develop substantial non-thermal tails after the turbulence onset. For particles repeatedly crossing shear layers, their energization follows geometric Brownian motion with weak systematic drift, yielding a log-normal distribution. High-energy particles exhibit pitch-angle anisotropy, becoming preferentially perpendicular to the flow-aligned magnetic field as their gyroradii exceed the turbulent layer width. These results establish shear-driven turbulence as a viable particle acceleration mechanism, providing a general model for particle energization in shear flows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAO: A New and Public Non-Relativistic Reflection Model</a><span class="id">[2512.12728]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new non-relativistic reflection model, DAO, designed to calculate reflection spectra in the rest frame of accretion disks in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.

It plays a key role in forming close binaries such as hot subdwarfs, double white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and double neutron stars. However, its outcomes remain highly uncertain. Depending on the efficiency of envelope ejection, a system may either survive as a close binary or undergo a complete merger. In this work, we investigate the post merger evolution of systems where a CO WD mergers with the core of an AGB star. A grid of merger remnant models with various core and envelope masses is constructed. At the onset of evolution, the CO core contracts and undergoes off-center carbon ignition, producing an inwardly propagating carbon flame. For remnants with relatively low mass of CO core, the flame phase is followed by core contraction and subsequent H-shell burning. For more massive CO cores, the carbon flame reaches the center and is soon followed by off-center neon burning, which is expected to eventually lead to core-collapse supernovae. The merger remnants occupy nearly the same region on HR diagram as ordinary AGB or super-AGB stars, exhibiting similar surface properties. Although their surface abundance may differ slightly from those of normal AGB stars depending on the initial core and envelope masses, these differences are strongly reduced once mass-loss is taken into account. We suggest that some giant-like stars, including candidates for Thorne-Zytkow objects (e.g., HV 2112), might alternatively be explained as AGB-WD merger remnants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12765" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The TRAPUM Large Magellanic Cloud pulsar survey with MeerKAT II: 12 new discoveries and timing solutions for 7 pulsars</a><span class="id">[2512.12765]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of 12 new radio pulsars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as part of the TRAPUM (TRAnsients and PUlsars with MeerKAT) Large Survey Project, using the MeerKAT L-band receivers (856–1712 MHz).

II. Modeling the wind braking and the rotational coupling in the entire mass range of solar-like stars</a><span class="id">[2512.12782]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In recent years, ground- and space-based photometric surveys have characterized the rotational evolution of solar-like stars to an unprecedented level of detail. In this work we focus on the slow-rotator sequence, an emergent feature recognizable in the color-period diagram of Galactic open clusters. Understanding the evolution of this sequence is a promising avenue to formulate a robust rotation period-mass-age relation, which can be used to estimate stellar ages. Our model of the rotational evolution of stars on the slow-rotator sequence takes into account magnetized wind braking and the rotational decoupling between the radiative interior and the convective envelope. This decoupling naturally develops as the internal redistribution of angular momentum lags behind the loss of angular momentum at the stellar surface, and is parameterized in the model by a rotational coupling timescale. Using literature data on rotation and membership of stars in a selection of open clusters of age between 100 Myr and 4 Gyr, we constrain the mass dependence of the two competing processes of wind braking at the surface and angular momentum transport in the interior. Consistently with our previous findings, our best-fitting model requires a mass-dependent coupling timescale; this result is insensitive to the details of the wind braking model used. We show that the mass dependence of the coupling timescale follows a broken power-law in the entire solar-like mass range (0.4-1.25 Msun), with the exponent change occurring at   0.6 Msun. At the same time, our approach can be used to infer semi-empirically the mass dependence of the wind braking model that best fits the observational constraints. Based on our findings, we propose a novel wind braking law with a particularly simple mass term, directly proportional to the moment of inertia of the convective envelope of the star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super-Eddington Accretion Geometry: a Remarkable Stability of the Hidden Ultraluminous X-Ray Source Cygnus X-3</a><span class="id">[2512.12879]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on the average and orbital phase-resolved polarization of Cyg X-3 in the hard state during the 2023 Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observational campaign.

In this work, we model the disk formation following the debris stream self-intersection in a TDE. We track the multi-band emission using three-dimensional, frequency-integrated and multi-group radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We find a more circularized disk forms about 24 days following the initial stream-stream collision, after the mass fallback rate peaks and once the debris stream density decreases. Despite the absence of a circularized disk at early times, various shocks and the asymmetric photosphere are sufficient to drive a wide range of optical-to-X-ray ratios and soft-X-ray variability. We find that with strong apsidal precession, the first light is from the stream-stream collision. It launches an optically-thick outflow, but only produces modest prompt emission. The subsequent optical and ultraviolet (UV) light curve rise is mainly powered by shocks in the turbulent accretion flow close to the black hole. The optical-UV luminosity peaks roughly when the disk forms and shock-driven outflows subside. The disk is optically and geometrically thick, extending well beyond the circularization radius. Radiation pressure clears the polar region and leaves optically-thin channels. We obtain the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) directly from multi-group simulations with 16-20 frequency groups. The SED has a black body component that peaks in the extreme UV. The soft X-ray component either resembles a thermal tail, or can be described by a shallower power law associated with bulk Compton scattering. The blackbody parameters are broadly consistent with observed optical TDEs and vary weakly with viewing angle. In contrast, soft X-ray emission is highly angle-dependent.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The disk precession in a Be star-magnetar binary and its application to the rotation measure of FRB 20201124A</a><span class="id">[2512.12995]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio bursts with poorly known origins.

However, the rapid fading of their afterglows and the scarcity of spectroscopic measurements make photometric classification crucial for timely high-redshift identification. We present an ensemble machine learning framework for redshift classification of GRBs based solely on their optical plateau and prompt emission properties. Our dataset comprises 171 long GRBs observed by the Swift UVOT and more than 450 ground-based telescopes. The analysis pipeline integrates robust statistical techniques, including M-estimator outlier rejection, multivariate imputation using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator feature selection, followed by a SuperLearner ensemble combining parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric algorithms. The optimal model, trained on raw optical data with outlier removal at a redshift threshold of z equals 2.0, achieves a true positive rate of 74 percent and an area under the curve of 0.84, maintaining balanced generalization between training and test sets. At higher thresholds, such as z equals 3.0, the classifier sustains strong discriminative power with an area under the curve of 0.88. Validation on an independent GRB sample yields 97 percent overall accuracy, perfect specificity, and an ensemble area under the curve of 0.93. Compared to previous prompt- and X-ray-based classifiers, our optical framework offers enhanced sensitivity to high-redshift events, improved robustness against data incompleteness, and greater applicability to ground-based follow-up. We also publicly release a web application that enables real-time redshift classification, facilitating rapid identification of candidate high-redshift GRBs for cosmological studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transitional Dynamics: Unveiling the Coexistence and Interplay of Type-B and Type-C QPOs in MAXI J1348-630</a><span class="id">[2512.13124]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Based on broadband timing analysis of Insight-HXMT and NICER data from the 2019 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) MAXI J1348-630, we report the detection of the coexistence and competitive interplay between type-C and type-B quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Specifically, the two QPO types were detected simultaneously but exhibited distinct energy dependencies: the type-C QPO was dominant in the hard X-ray band (10-30 keV), while the type-B QPO was more prominent in the soft X-ray band (1-10 keV). Further analysis reveals that the emergence of the type-C QPO suppresses the strength of the type-B QPO, particularly above 10 keV. Tracking the detailed evolution of these QPOs, we find that the weakening of the type-B QPO coincides with the strengthening of the type-C QPO, indicating a competitive interaction between them. These findings reveal a more complex relationship between type-B and type-C QPOs than previously recognized, suggesting they originate from distinct but interacting physical components within the accretion flow and/or jet, and providing new insights into the dynamics of accretion state transitions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the role of the streaming instability for the cosmic-ray spectrum in the GeV to TeV range</a><span class="id">[2512.13128]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A complete understanding of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum remains a challenge to theory that must be met by comprehensive modeling efforts.

They are recognized as the most evolved population of hydrogen-rich cataclysmic variables. Yet they exhibit energetic disk-powered outbursts with an amplitude of 6-9 mag, duration of a month, and decade-long outburst cycles. Despite the dramatic increase in the number of WZ Sge stars over the last decades, there are many unresolved questions, both in terms of their binary evolution and outburst mechanism. In this proceeding paper, I review the recent studies on WZ Sge stars, focusing on their outbursts. Recent observations, both photometrically and spectroscopically, have found the absence of enhanced emission from the hotspot during the early outburst rise in WZ Sge stars, casting doubt on the occurrence of the enhanced mass transfer. Meanwhile, several WZ Sge stars are newly suggested to harbor a magnetic white dwarf, inferring an inner disk truncation in quiescence. Diversity among systems has been discovered: a WZ Sge star with superoutbursts both accompanying and lacking an early superhump phase, one possibly harboring an ONe and massive white dwarf, and one showing optical spectra strongly affected by disk winds. I introduce the connections of WZ Sge stars to period bouncers, helium-rich AM CVn stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries. Finally, prospects of WZ Sge stars in the upcoming time-domain surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory LSST, are presented.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13151" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiband gravitational wave observations of eccentric escaping binary black holes from globular clusters</a><span class="id">[2512.13151]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar-mass binary black holes (sBBHs) formed in globular clusters (GCs) are promising sources for multiband gravitational wave (GW) observations, particularly with low- and middle-frequency detectors. These sBBHs can retain detectable eccentricities when they enter the sensitivity bands of low-frequency GW observatories. We study multiband GW observations of eccentric sBBHs that escape from GC models simulated with the MOCCA code, focusing on how low- and middle-frequency detectors can constrain their eccentricities and other parameters. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we generate ten realizations of cosmic sBBHs by combining the MOCCA sample with a cosmological model for GC formation and evolution. We then assess their detectability and the precision of parameter estimation. Our results show that LISA, Taiji, the LISA-Taiji network (LT), and AMIGO could detect $0.8\pm0.7$, $11.6\pm2.0$, $15.4\pm2.7$, and $7.9\pm1.3$ escaping sBBHs, respectively, over four years, while LT-AMIGO could detect $20.6\pm3.0$ multiband sBBHs in the same period. LT and AMIGO can measure initial eccentricities with relative errors of approximately $10^{-6}-2\times10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}-0.7$, respectively. Joint LT-AMIGO observations have a similar ability to estimate eccentricities as LT alone.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The First X-Ray Polarimetry of an Eclipsing Low-Mass X-Ray Binary: Serendipitous IXPE Observation of AX J1745.6-2901</a><span class="id">[2512.13182]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first X-ray polarimetric measurement of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary system AX J1745.6-2901 conducted by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite.

This candidate implies an exceptionally large $J$-factor of $\sim 10^{23}\,{\rm GeV^2\,cm^{-5}}$, exceeding that of known classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies by orders of magnitude and rivaling the Galactic Center. In this work, we utilize more than 17 years of $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data to search for gamma-ray emission from this subhalo. We identify a tentative excess in the region with ambiguous origin. Adopting a conservative strategy, we retain this excess without modeling additional astrophysical components, treating it instead as unmodeled background to derive upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section for the $b\bar{b}$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ channels. Despite this conservative treatment, the resulting limits remain stringent due to the exceptionally large $J$-factor. Subject to the dynamical confirmation of the subhalo, these constraints are potentially orders of magnitude stronger than those obtained from combined analyses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and blind subhalo searches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13277" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Challenging historical novae: AT Cnc (1645), Te-11 (483), and M22 (BC 48) revisited</a><span class="id">[2512.13277]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Connections between novae with shells and historical observations are crucial for astrophysical understanding of long-term evolution of shells and cataclysmic variables. Three of five previously considered links are revisited here: extended features in M22 in BC48, Te-11 in 483, and AT Cnc in 1645. We aim to develop a procedure to check whether these links are credible. Literal translations of the Chinese texts, historically based arguments, and close readings are combined with astrophysics, (peak brightness, decay time estimate, shell age expansion model calculation, etc.). (a) Nandou's second star, near which the BC48 `guest star' was reported, is identified as tau Sgr, not lambda Sgr, far from the M22 location. A nova in M22 would peak at only m=6.4 \pm 1.4 mag, and thus a description as a `blue-white' `melon' does not fit; it was likely a comet. (b) The imprecise position (`Shen['s] east') of the `guest star' in 483, its extended (dipper-like) radiance, and the context speak for a bolide. Considering the new (larger) Gaia distance and small extinction towards Te-11 (outside a cloud), its bi-polar morphology and current expansion velocity point to a planetary nebula; as a nova, the shell expansion age is 1100-2000 yr from detailed supersonic expansion calculations. (c) Most certainly, Mars was meant when the source for 1645 reported `a large star entered Yugui'; the verb implies motion. AT Cnc lies neither in Yugui's asterism box nor in the eponymous lunar mansion range. The fluid drag expansion age of AT Cancri's ejecta is 128-631 yr. All three exact ages are unsubstantiated. True novae or nova shells can be connected to historical records only if the position and object type are plausible.

Using the energy spectra measured in two mutually orthogonal top hat analyzers (THA 1 and 2), which are part of the Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS) subsystem of the Aditya Solar Wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) on board India's Aditya L1 mission, we gain insights into intricate features of ICME ICME interactions during May 2024 solar event. We report here an unprecedented two-orthogonal-plane perspective of ICME ICME interactions for the first time from the L1 point. The investigation reveals a special interaction region formed by the propagation of the forward shock driven by complex ejecta in the preceding ICME. The interaction causes the formation of a downstream region spanning over 13 hours, which propagates in the interplanetary medium. The observations reveal that this region serves as a site for proton and alpha particle energization, and the particles within this region get distributed from one plane to the other. The presence of forward shock and particle energization is confirmed by the energetic particle flux measurements by the SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of ASPEX. These observations provide an unprecedented perspective on how solar wind ions become energized and distributed in an ICME-ICME interaction region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistical properties of spicules in MURaM-ChE</a><span class="id">[2512.13390]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Numerical simulations of the solar chromosphere have progressed towards reproducing spicules, which are transient features observed at the solar limb using spectral lines such as H$\alpha$, Ca II H&amp;K, or Mg II h&amp;k. Two types of spicules, referred to as types I and II, have been identified in observations and studied in previous numerical works. The statistics of type II spicules in 3D numerical simulations have not yet been studied. We aim to compare the statistics of properties such as lengths, lifetimes, widths, heights, inclinations, and maximum velocities of self-consistently formed spicules in a MURaM-ChE simulation with observations. We employ a H$\alpha$ proxy to identify fine-scale structures at the solar limb resembling spicules in a simulation of an enhanced network region. We track the evolution of 58 such features found in a 21-minute time sequence, and compare their dynamical and morphological properties with those derived from quiet-Sun observations using the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard the Hinode mission in the Ca II H spectral line. Previous studies have shown that spicules show very similar properties in Ca II H and H$\alpha$. The spicule-like structures found in the simulation have statistical properties which are broadly consistent with those observed with Hinode/SOT. In particular, we find evidence for the self-consistent formation of both type I and type II spicules within the simulation, even in the absence of ambipolar diffusion. We also investigate the properties of rapid blueshifted and redshifted excursions (RBEs and RREs) in the simulation in relation to the spicules.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Maximum Particle Energy Gain During Magnetic Reconnection</a><span class="id">[2512.13394]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The factors that control the maximum energy attained by protons and electrons during magnetic reconnection are investigated analytically and using large-scale simulations with the \textit{kglobal} model. Previous work revealed that a strong ambient guide field strongly impacts particle energy gain during reconnection, suppressing energy gain from Fermi reflection by increasing the radius of curvature of reconnected field lines. However, previous simulations have also shown that the maximum energy gain increases with the system size. The physical basis for this result has not been explored. We perform simulations that vary the effective system size over a large range to isolate the processes determining the maximum energy gain. The maximum energy $W_{max}$ is regulated by the number of magnetic-island mergers that occur, as multiple flux ropes that form at early time repeatedly merge until the largest approaches the system scale. Fermi reflection in these repeated mergers dominates particle energy gain. The number of mergers is linked to the effective system size – larger systems produce a larger number of flux ropes and more mergers. That $W_{max}$ is linked to the number of flux rope mergers has implications for understanding why particle-in-cell simulations only produce powerlaw distributions of energetic particles with a limited range in energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three-dimensional numerical simulations of neutron star cores in the two-fluid MHD approximation: simple configurations</a><span class="id">[2512.13408]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores is not fully understood. We describe the field evolution both for one barotropic fluid as well as two collisionally coupled barotropic fluids with different density profiles using the anelastic approximation and the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the evolution in three dimensions. In the one-fluid case, a single fluid describes the motion of the charged particles. In the two-fluid model, the neutral fluid is coupled to the electrically conductive fluid by collisions, the latter being dragged by the magnetic field. In this model, both fluids have distinct density profiles. This forces them to move at slightly different velocities, resulting in a relative motion between the two barotropic fluids – ambipolar diffusion. We develop a code based on Dedalus and study the evolution of simple poloidal dipolar and toroidal magnetic fields. Previous 2D studies found that poloidal magnetic fields evolve towards a stable Grad-Shafranov equilibrium. In our 3D simulations we find an instability of the two-fluid system similar to the one in the barotropic fluid system. After the instability saturates, a highly non-linear Lorentz force introduces small-scale fluid motion that leads to turbulence, development of a cascade and significant, non-axially symmetric changes in the magnetic field configuration. Fluid viscosity plays an essential role in regularizing the small-scale fluid motion, providing an energy drain.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Quality Issues in Flare Prediction using Machine Learning Models</a><span class="id">[2512.13417]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Machine learning models for forecasting solar flares have been trained and tested using a variety of data sources, such as Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) operational and science-quality data.

Strong magnetic fields are also observed in massive stars, but it is still unclear how they are generated. There are different theories for their origin: the magnetic fields could be fossil fields from star formation, they could be generated in dynamo processes during stellar evolution, or they could be generated during a merger of two stars. Here, we show how magnetic fields are generated in simulations of mergers of massive main-sequence stars, conducted with the 3D magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO. In these simulations, a $9\,M_\odot$ and a $8\,M_\odot$ main sequence star merge, whereby the more massive star transfers mass to the less massive one until it is finally disrupted, forming a core–disk structure. During the initial mass transfer, magnetic fields start to be amplified in the accretion stream, saturating after the disruption at an equipartition level. Correspondingly, the magnetic energy starts being present at small scales, growing to larger scales during the merger. During the merger, the magnetic pressure is much smaller than the gas pressure, thus the dynamical impact of the magnetic fields on the merger is small. After the merger, both are similar in some regions and the magnetic field shows a large-scale structure that is mostly toroidal and that is expected to be stable. Thus, our simulations show that magnetic fields in massive stars can originate from a merger of two main sequence stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSR J0537-6910: Exponential recoveries detected for 12 glitches</a><span class="id">[2512.13426]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar glitches are unresolved increments of the rotation rate that sometimes trigger an enhancement of the spin-down rate. On occasions, the augmented spin-down decays gradually in an exponential manner, particularly after the largest glitch events. The young pulsar PSR J0537-6910 exhibits the highest known glitching rate, with 60 events detected in nearly 18 years of monitoring. Despite most PSR J0537-6910 glitches being large, only one exponential recovery has been reported, following its first discovered glitch. This is puzzling, as pulsars of similar characteristics typically present significant exponential recoveries. We aim to determine whether this reflects an intrinsic difference in PSR J0537-6910 or a detectability issue, for example due to its high glitch frequency. The full dataset, including recent NICER observations, was systematically searched for exponential relaxations. Each glitch was tested for evidence of a recovery over a broad range of trial timescales. Promising candidates were investigated further by comparing recovery models with and without an exponential term using Bayesian evidence. We discovered six new glitches, bringing the total to 66. Our criteria strongly indicates the presence of 11 previously undetected exponential recoveries. We presente updated glitch and timing solutions. Exponential recoveries are detected only for the largest glitches, though not all of them. The inferred timescales range from 4 to 37 d, with the decaying frequency increment generally below $1\%$ of the total. We find that $\ddot\nu$ can remain stable across several glitches, with persistent changes associated with only some events. In particular, it tends to be lowest after glitches with exponential recoveries, yielding inter-glitch braking indices between 6 and 9. Following glitches without recoveries, $\ddot\nu$ is higher, leading to braking indices between 10 and 35.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13476" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High Resolution Overtone Spectroscopy of HNC$^+$ and HCN$^+$</a><span class="id">[2512.13476]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rotationally resolved spectra of the HNC$^+$ and HCN$^+$ molecular ions have been recorded in the spectral range between 6200 and 6800 \rcm\ using a cryogenic ion trap instrument.

It has a diameter of only 3deg to 4deg and is located much closer to the binary meridian than the accretion-heated region studied in the u-band. The longitudinal shift of the two accretion regions is of order 30deg, due to early and late coupling of accreted matter onto the magnetic field lines in low and high accretion states, respectively.

These pulsars were initially discovered through their single-pulse emission and therefore designated as rotating radio transients (RRATs). Follow-up timing campaigns yielded a number of higher signal-to-noise summed pulse profiles for each pulsar, allowing us to obtain timing solutions both through single pulses as well as the standard method of time-integrating the pulsar's emission. We find that the two methods return timing parameters which are usually in agreement within two standard deviations, and have similar sized error bars. The single-pulse timing solutions have significantly higher RMS errors and reduced chi-squared values, likely due to pulse jitter. The distribution of wait times between detected single pulses indicates a significant amount of pulse clustering in time on short timescales from all three sources. For all sources, the presence of low-level emission outside of the sparse bright pulses and lack of giant pulses is more reminiscent of highly nulling canonical radio pulsars than extremely transient RRATs, highlighting the diversity of emission behavior observed from sources published as RRATs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13503" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Flying Saucer edge-on disc's Near Infrared silhouette revealed by the JWST JEDIce program</a><span class="id">[2512.13503]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Edge-on discs offer a unique opportunity to probe radial and vertical dust and gas distributions in the protoplanetary phase.

As part of the JWST Edge-on Disc Ice program ('JEDIce'), we use NIRSpec IFU observations of the Flying Saucer, serendipitously observed against a PAH-emitting background, to constrain the dust distribution and grain sizes through radiative transfer modelling. Observation of the Flying Saucer in silhouette at 3.29 microns reveals that the midplane radial extent of small dust grains is  235 au, larger than the large-grain disc extent previously determined to be 190 au from millimetre data. The scattered light observed in emission probes micron sized icy grains at large vertical distances above the midplane. The vertical extent of the disc silhouette is similar at visible, near-IR, and mid-IR wavelengths, corroborating the conclusion that dust settling is inefficient for grains as large as tens of microns, vertically and radially.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Serendipitous Axiodilaton: A Self-Consistent Recombination-Era Solution to the Hubble Tension</a><span class="id">[2512.13544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axio-dilaton cosmology provides a minimal benchmark model for both Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) that is well motivated by fundamental physics. The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, with the $\chi^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3\sigma$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity.

They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tides in Massive Binaries: Numerical Solutions and Semi-Analytical Comparisons</a><span class="id">[2512.13551]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a systematic comparison between the tidal secular evolution timescales predicted by the direct numerical method and those given by the commonly used semi-analytic prescriptions implemented in 1-D hydrostatic binary evolution codes. Our study focuses on binary systems with intermediate- to high-mass primaries ($M_1 = 5$-$50\,M_\odot$), companion masses between $1.4\,M_\odot$ and $10\,M_\odot$, and orbital periods ranging from 0.5 to 50 days. Before mass transfer, both approaches predict synchronization and orbital decay timescales that agree within $\sim$2 orders of magnitude and typically exceed the stellar main sequence lifetime, implying negligible tidal impact on secular orbital evolution. However, the implied dissipation channels differ, and the differences become more pronounced once mass transfer begins. To test the theoretical predictions against observations, we apply both approaches to the well-characterized PSR J0045–7319 system, which has an orbital decay timescale of 0.5 Myr. The numerical solution reveals strong resonances with internal gravity waves, bringing the predicted orbital period change rate close to the observed value. In contrast, the semi-analytic prescriptions predict orbital decay timescales longer than the Hubble time. These results suggest that for population studies, modestly calibrated parameterized equations may suffice, but for individual systems, reliable interpretation requires direct numerical approaches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling the X-ray Secrets of Fermi-detected Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies with XMM-Newton Observations</a><span class="id">[2512.13569]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the innermost regions of active galactic nuclei, where the accretion disk, corona, and jet processes are closely coupled, X-ray observations offer a direct probe to study the physics of disk-jet coupling and the mechanisms driving relativistic outflows.

A moderate intraday flux variability is observed throughout the sample, with fractional variability ranging from 5 to 16\%. The temporal study of 1H 0323+342 reveals a distinctive turnover timescale in structure functions, along with notable variations in flux and power spectral density slopes. The hardness ratio in some epochs demonstrates a clear trend of softer-when-brighter. The X-ray spectra of 1H 0323+342, PMN J0948+0022, RGB J1644+263, PKS 1502+036, and J1246+0238 are well fitted by a power-law + blackbody model, suggesting a bright disk along with a jet, and J1222+0413 is fitted by broken power-law, while the remaining sources are well fitted by a power-law model revealing the non-thermal domination. The X-ray luminosity exhibits a strong correlation with $\gamma$-ray and disk luminosity, and a strong correlation with the jet power, suggesting a close coupling of disk and jet. Additionally, we have found an anti-correlation between the X-ray spectral index and the X-ray luminosity, as well as with the FWHM of H$\beta$ line, indicating a complex interaction between the central engine, jet activity, and the accretion disk in these sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fermionic versus Bosonic Dark Matter in Neutron Stars: A Bayesian Study with Multi-Density Constraints</a><span class="id">[2512.13574]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform a comparative Bayesian analysis of fermionic and bosonic dark matter admixed neutron stars (DMANS) by incorporating a comprehensive set of theoretical, experimental, and astrophysical constraints. The hadronic matter equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field approach, constrained by chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) calculations at low densities, finite nuclei and heavy-ion collision data at intermediate densities, and neutron star (NS) observations at high densities. For the dark sector, we consider fermionic dark matter (FDM) interacting via a dark vector meson, and two bosonic dark matter models (BDM1 and BDM2) characterized by self-interacting scalar fields. Bayesian inference is employed to constrain the model parameters, including the dark matter mass, coupling strength, and dark matter fraction within NSs. Our analysis finds that all models yield consistent nuclear matter parameters, allowing a small dark matter fraction under 10%. The presence of dark matter slightly softens the EoS, leading to a modest reduction in NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability, though all models remain compatible with NICER and GW170817 observations. The log-evidence and likelihood analyses reveal no statistical preference among the FDM and BDM models, indicating that current astrophysical data cannot decisively distinguish between fermionic and bosonic dark matter scenarios. This study provides a unified statistical framework to constrain dark matter properties using NS observables.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leptonic and Hadronic Models of High-energy Nebula Around V4641 Sgr</a><span class="id">[2512.13578]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A prominent, 200-pc-scale high-energy nebula surrounding the microquasar V4641 Sgr is the brightest known gamma-ray source in the Southern sky at $E &gt; 100\,\mathrm{TeV}$. In this paper, we develop self-consistent leptonic, hadronic, and leptohadronic models that reproduce both the observed spectrum and morphology of the source. Purely leptonic models are energetically more favorable yet they require rather specific morphological assumptions. The gamma-ray morphology of the source can be better explained within a hadronic scenario based on the identification of cold gas structures spatially correlated with the observed gamma-ray emission. However, a purely hadronic model for the source emission requires a substantial energy reservoir in protons and fails to reproduce the extended X-ray emission recently detected by XRISM. We show that emission including a combination of leptonic and hadronic components can reproduce both the spectral and morphological properties of the source.

However, stellar binarity can alter observable properties and introduce strong biases. We aim to provide a holistic picture of the binary population and its evolution in the red giant phase by characterizing a sample of binaries hosting oscillating red giants from a combination of extensive asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and astrometric surveys. We investigate the binary properties of evolved stars in the APOKASC3 and APO-K2 catalogs, leveraging asteroseismic constraints and Gaia DR3 non-single-star solutions. We explore the mass distribution of red-giant binary systems and analyze the evolution of their binary fraction. For stars with M$\leq$1.8M$_\odot$, we find binary fractions $\sim$31% and $\sim$41% for oscillating and non-oscillating solar-like stars on the main-sequence (MS). By the power excess ($\nu_\mathrm{max}$) as luminosity proxy, we detect a binary attrition of $\sim$69% and $\sim$81% on the low- and high-luminosity red-giant branch (RGB) and an additional $\sim$38% to the red clump (RC), with respect to the MS. Binaries hosting RC and secondary clump stars (2RC) stars are largely depleted at $P_\mathrm{orb}\lesssim$500 and $\lesssim$200 days, respectively. Mass-dependent differences in binary fractions and orbital properties point to more substantial binary attrition for stars with M $\leq$1.8 M$_\odot$. The distinct mass distributions and the depletion of short-period binaries during the red-giant phase underscore the impact of stellar expansion and binary interactions on stellar evolution. RC systems with $P_\mathrm{orb}\lesssim$800 to 1,000 days are likely shaped by past interactions, such as mass transfer or loss, which can lead to significantly biased age estimates if not accounted for.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13584" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identification of radio and gamma-ray pulsars in X-rays using data from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey</a><span class="id">[2512.13584]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using the data from the all-sky survey in soft X-rays performed by the eROSITA telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma observatory we identified known radio and $\gamma$-ray pulsars in the eastern half of the sky.

We show that this conclusion becomes much weaker in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds and strongly non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations, by studying how these phenomena affect the link between SIGWs and PBHs, and reevaluate LISA's sensitivity to asteroid-mass PBHs. In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity.

The method combines $E$ and $B$ modes with inverse-variance weights, to yield an unbiased reconstruction of $m(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ to first order. We study the ability of future Stage IV surveys to obtain an unbiased reconstruction of the $m$-bias in differing scenarios, considering differing bias morphologies, and characteristic scales, as well as differing metrics to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed map. Considering an $m$ pattern repeating on $\sim 1^\circ\times1^\circ$ sky patches, as might be the case for an $m$ field caused by focal-plane systematics. With a Euclid-like redshift distribution, we find that $\sim5\%$ rms variations in $m$-bias may be detected at the 20$\sigma$ level, after stacking between $\sim400$ and $\sim1000$ patches (rising to between $\sim2800$ and $\sim7600$ for $1\%$ rms variations, data volumes that are becoming available with upcoming surveys), depending on the morphology of the $m$ pattern. We show that these results are robust against the cosmological model assumed in the reconstruction, as well as the presence of intrinsic alignments or baryonic effects, and that the method shows no spurious response to additive ($c-$) bias. These results demonstrate that percent-level, spatially-varying $m-$bias can be detected at high significance, enabling diagnosis and mitigation in the Stage IV weak lensing era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-parametric exploration of minimally coupled gravity with phantom crossing</a><span class="id">[2512.13691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), especially when combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and supernova data, favor a late-time dark energy equation of state that crosses $w=-1$, which has been argued to point toward non-minimal conformal coupling in Horndeski gravity. We test this interpretation by performing a non-parametric exploration of the minimally coupled, luminal Horndeski subclass known as kinetic gravity braiding (KGB). Using mochi_class and its manifestly stable effective field theory (EFT) basis implementation, we efficiently scan a broad class of models in which the EFT functions are allowed to vary freely in time, while enforcing the absence of ghost and gradient instabilities from the outset. We identify a set of KGB models that realize phantom crossing and remain broadly consistent with current probes of the background and linear large-scale structure, including CMB temperature and lensing power spectra, redshift-space distortions, cosmic shear, and the cross-correlation between galaxies and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect.

The differential equations to determine the subleading correction of the structure variables are presented. The system retains the current $j^\mu$ accounting for the steady flow, which contributes to the entropy current $s^\mu$ in such a general covariant form that $s^\mu=au^\mu+ bj^\mu$ with $a, b$ unknown parametric functions. To determine them, a new condition is proposed. This condition imposes the entropy current to be of an unconventional form $s^\mu=(s-bj^0)u^\mu/u^0+ bj^\mu$, where $s$ is the entropy density.

Our study derives the Hawking temperature using standard surface gravity methods and examines quantum corrections through both the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and exponential entropy modifications, showing enhanced thermal radiation and potential remnant formation scenarios. The gravitational redshift analysis separates contributions from mass, cosmological constant, electromagnetic charge, and Born-Infeld (BI) corrections, with the latter scaling as $a^4/r^6$ and thus confined to near-horizon regimes. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate light deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, demonstrating how dispersive media can either enhance or suppress nonlinear electrodynamic signatures depending on observational configurations. The thermodynamic analysis in extended phase space, where the BH mass corresponds to enthalpy, reveals phase structures with heat capacity transitions between positive and negative values, indicating regions of local stability and instability sensitive to parameter choices. We study BH heat engines operating in rectangular thermodynamic cycles, achieving efficiencies of $\eta \sim 0.11$–$0.21$ that reach 30–61\% of the corresponding Carnot limits, consistent with other AdS BH systems. Comparison with Johnson's analysis confirms that BI corrections to heat engine efficiency are of order $10^{-12}$ for typical parameter ranges, though these effects become appreciable in the strong-field regime where $r_h \lesssim 1.5$ in Planck units.

The RPM ensures \emph{structureless test particles} and attributes precession to geodesic motion alone. Here, we refine the RPM by incorporating the internal structure of rotating test bodies, while preserving the test particle approximation (TPA), and propose a \emph{macroscopic precession model} (MPM) by means of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations, applied to a Schwarzschild background, which introduces 1) a shift in the Keplerian frequency and 2) an \emph{effective spin correction} to the radial epicyclic frequency that, once the spin tensor is modeled, reproduces a quasi-Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) correction. We apply the MPM to eight neutron star low mass X-ray binaries (NS-LMXBs), performing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fits to twin kHz QPOs and find observational and statistical evidence in favor of precise power law spin reconstructions. Further, our model accurately predicts the $3:2$ frequency clustering, the disk boundaries and the NS masses. From the MPM model, we thus conclude that complexity of QPOs can be fully-described including the test particle internal structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Massless Spectra from Cosmic String Cusps</a><span class="id">[2512.12258]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the standard picture of cosmic strings, cusps are generic features of Nambu-Goto loops where the string momentarily reaches the speed of light.

At large $|\Phi|$, higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operators become relevant and impart a kick in the angular direction, generating a conserved $U(1)$ charge that sustains rotation as the symmetry is approximately restored. Because phases randomize across causally disconnected regions, multiple domains with distinct charges form. The subsequent axion potential converts the domain charges into an axion abundance, yielding dark matter even when the net global charge vanishes. We analyze the dynamics through a linear, domain-averaged treatment and identify two thermal histories: (i) Ricci reheating via saxion decays to Higgs bosons; (ii) external reheating with efficient damping of saxion energy by Higgs/fermion scatterings.

With the goal to understand the stellar masses of BLAPs, we therefore carried out a linear non-adiabatic analysis of a grid of models computed using mesa-rsp, with appropriate input stellar parameters $ZXMLT_{\rm eff}$ and convection parameter sets. We discuss the impact of stellar mass, metallicity, helium abundance and convection parameters on the theoretical instability regions of BLAPs. We also derive new theoretical period relations; our theoretical period relations using low stellar masses seem to be in better agreement with the observed period relations. Although only two BLAPS have been observed to be multi-periodic oscillator so far, we analyse theoretical $P_{1O}/P_F$ ratios and compare these values with other classical pulsators. Furthermore, we provide the first asteroseismic mass estimate for the triple-mode pulsator, OGLE-BLAP-030 which seems to be well-constrained in the range of $0.62-0.64 M_{\odot}$ with a high metallicity of $Z=0.07$, albeit with a few sources of uncertainty involved. This would place the BLAP star intermediate to the two proposed mass scenarios so far.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12788" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray reverberation black hole mass and distance estimates of Cygnus X-1</a><span class="id">[2501.12788]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We fit X-ray reverberation models to Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data from the X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 in its hard state to yield estimates for the black hole mass and the distance to the system. The rapid variability observed in the X-ray signal from accreting black holes provides a powerful diagnostic to indirectly map the ultra-compact region in the vicinity of the black hole horizon. X-ray reverberation mapping exploits the light crossing delay between X-rays that reach us directly from the hard X-ray emitting 'corona', and those that first reflect off the accretion disc. Here we build upon a previous reverberation mass measurement of Cygnus X-1 that used the RELTRANS software package. Our new analysis enhances signal to noise with an improved treatment of the statistics, and implements new RELTRANS models that are sensitive to distance. The reduced uncertainties uncover evidence of mass accretion rate variability in the inner region of the disc that propagates towards the corona, which we approximate as a point-like 'lamppost' source. Our best fitting model returns a mass of $M=15\pm 4 ~M_\odot$ and a distance of $D=3.4_{-1.2}^{+1.6}$ kpc (90 per cent uncertainties), which are consistent with the most recent dynamical and parallax measurements respectively.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantitative Image-Based Validation Framework for Assessing Global Coronal Magnetic Field Models</a><span class="id">[2503.13292]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronagraph observations provide key information about the orientation of the Sun's magnetic field. Previous studies used various algorithms to segment quasi-radial features in coronagraph images and approximate their local plane-of-sky geometry and orientation which can be used as input for optimizing and constraining coronal magnetic field models. We present a new framework that allows for further quantitative evaluations of image-based coronal segmentation methods against magnetic field models, and vice-versa. We compare quasi-radial features identified from QRaFT, a global coronal feature tracing algorithm, in white-light coronagraph images to outputs of MAS, an advanced magnetohydrodynamic model. We use the FORWARD toolset to produce synthetic polarized brightness images co-aligned to real coronagraph observations, segment features in these images, and quantify the difference between the inferred and model magnetic field. This approach allows us to geometrically compare features segmented in artificial images to those segmented in white-light coronagraph observations against the plane-of-sky projected MAS coronal magnetic field. We quantify QRaFT's performance in the artificial images and observational data, and perform statistical analyses that measure the accuracy and uncertainty of the model output to the observational data. The results demonstrate that a coronal segmentation method identifies the global large-scale orientation of the coronal magnetic field within $\sim\pm10^\circ$ of the plane-of-sky projected MAS magnetic field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Misalignment of the Lense-Thirring precession by an accretion torque</a><span class="id">[2503.20577]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Orbiting matter misaligned with a spinning black hole undergoes Lense-Thirring precession, due to the frame-dragging effect. This phenomenon is particularly relevant for type-C QPOs observed in the hard states of low-mass X-ray binaries. However, the accretion flow in these hard states is complex, consisting of a geometrically thick, hot corona surrounded by a geometrically thin, cold disk. Recent simulations have demonstrated that, in such a truncated disk scenario, the precession of the inner hot corona slows due to its interaction with the outer cold disk. This paper aims to provide an analytical description of the precession of an inner (hot) torus in the presence of accretion torques exerted by the outer (cold) disk. Using the angular momentum conservation equation, we investigate the evolution of the torus angular momentum vector for various models of accretion torque. We find that, in general, an accretion torque tilts the axis of precession away from the black hole spin axis. In all models, if the accretion torque is sufficiently strong, it can halt the precession; any perturbation from this stalled state will cause the torus to precess around an axis that is misaligned with the black hole spin axis. The accretion torque exerted by the outer thin disk can cause precession around an axis that is neither aligned with the black hole spin axis nor perpendicular to the plane of the disk. This finding may have significant observational implications, as the jet direction, if aligned with the angular momentum axis of the torus, may no longer reliably indicate the black hole spin axis or the orientation of the outer accretion disk</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Hard X-ray Properties of $γ$-ray Emitting Narrow Line Seyfert-I Galaxies through NuSTAR Observations</a><span class="id">[2504.04492]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We studied the six gamma-ray-detected Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies using the hard X-ray observations from Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and optical g- &amp; r-band from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The X-ray spectra corresponding to all objects are well-fitted with a power-law spectral model, and a strong &quot;redder-when-brighter&quot; trend is seen, which is mostly seen in Blazars. The X-ray light curves were produced for all the available observations, and the F$_{var}$ is estimated. In 1H 0323+342, we found that F$_{var}$ lies between 9$\%$ to 22$\%$, suggesting significant variability in the source. Similarly, for PKS 2004-447, we found F$_{var}$ lies between 10$\%$ to 21$\%$. We see a strong X-ray and $\gamma$-ray spectral index correlation among these objects, suggesting that these are produced through a similar process. Comparing the X-ray spectral index with other class objects, we see that NLSy1 galaxies are similar to LBL and IBL types. We see a negative trend of X-ray flux with the $\gamma$-ray luminosity in these objects, suggesting an anti-correlation between them. A similar trend is seen between the X-ray flux, total jet power, and disk luminosity. The X-ray spectral index also shows a negative trend with total jet power and disk luminosity. The optical variability amplitude (in magnitude) lies between 0.90 to 2.32, and the fractional variability varies from 13\% to 40\%. The color-magnitude plot shows mostly the redder-when-brighter (RWB) trend, suggesting $\gamma$-NLSy1 are much closer to FSRQs than BL Lacs.

Marked Correlation Functions (MCFs) extend information beyond the two-point correlation. For the first time, this study integrated the tomographic AP test with MCFs to constrain the flat $w$CDM cosmology model. Our findings show that multiple density weights in MCFs outperform the traditional two-point correlation function, reducing the uncertainties of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and dark energy equation of state $w$ by 48\% and 45\%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a novel principal component analysis (PCA) compression scheme that efficiently projects high-dimensional statistical measurements into a compact set of eigenmodes while preserving most of the cosmological information. This approach retains significantly more information than traditional coarse binning methods, which simply average adjacent bins in a lossy manner, yielding an additional $\sim 40\%$ reduction in error margins. To assess robustness, we incorporate realistic redshift errors expected in future spectroscopic surveys. While these errors modestly degrade cosmological constraints, our combined framework, which utilizes MCFs and PCA compression within tomographic AP tests, is less affected and always yields tight cosmological constraints. This scheme remains highly promising for upcoming slitless spectroscopic surveys, such as the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polynomial Potential Inflation in the ACT Era: From CMB to Primordial Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2505.12816]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) favor a higher value of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ compared to the Planck data, challenging many well-established inflationary models.

By exploring the parameter space and deriving constraints on the model coefficients, we find that the cubic to quintic models can provide a good fit to the data, while the quadratic model struggles to simultaneously accommodate the ACT data and the requirement of sufficient inflation. Notably, the quintic case ($n=5$) not only matches cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations but also produces an inflection point that simultaneously triggers primordial black hole formation and generates a scalar-induced gravitational wave.

Thanks to recent advances in astrophysical instrumentation, the spins can now be measured using both gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes and electromagnetic radiation from accreting X-ray binaries containing black holes. A key finding of the gravitational-wave observatories is that premerger black holes in binaries have low spin values, with an average dimensionless spin parameter of $a_*\sim$0.1–0.2, with 90\% having $a_*\lesssim 0.6$. This implies that the natal spins of black holes are generally low, and the angular momentum transport in massive stars is efficient. On the other hand, most of the published spins in X-ray binaries are very high. In particular, this is the case for binaries with high-mass donors (potential progenitors of mergers), where their published spins range from 0.8 to 1.0. At the same time, their short lifetimes prevent significant spin-up by accretion. Those with low-mass donors could be spun-up to $a_*\gtrsim 0.7$ by accretion only if the donor initial masses were more than several solar masses, which remains unproven. However, the existing methods of spin measurements suffer from significant systematic errors. The method relying on relativistic X-ray line broadening is based on the separation of the observed spectra into incident and reflected ones, which is highly uncertain. The method relying on spectral fitting of accretion disk continua uses models that predict the disk to be highly unstable, while stability is observed. Improved stable models predict lower spins. The published spin measurements in X-ray binaries are uncertain. The spins of the binaries with high-mass donors may be low, while those with low-mass donors have a broader spin distribution, ranging from low to high.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photospheric emission from GRB 211211A altered by a strong radiation-mediated shock</a><span class="id">[2506.08122]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectra are typically non-thermal, with many including two spectral breaks suggestive of optically-thin emission. However, the emitted spectrum from a GRB photosphere, which includes prior dissipation of energy by radiation-mediated shocks (RMSs), can also produce such spectral features. Here, we analyze the bright GRB 211211A using the Kompaneets RMS Approximation (KRA). We find that the KRA can fit the time-resolved spectra well, significantly better than the traditionally used Band function in all studied time bins. The analysis of GRB 211211A reveals a jet with a typical Lorentz factor ($\Gamma \sim 300$), and a strong RMS (upstream dimensionless specific momentum, $\gamma_u \beta_u \sim 3$) occurring at a moderate optical depth ($\tau \sim 35$) in a relatively cold upstream ($\theta_u = k_{\rm B} T_u / m_e c^2 \sim 10^{-4}$). We conclude that broad GRB spectra that exhibit two breaks can also be well explained by photospheric emission. This implies that, {in such cases}, the spectral shape in the MeV-band alone is not enough to determine the emission mechanism during the prompt phase in GRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A thermonuclear supernova interacting with hydrogen- and helium-deficient circumstellar material.

The rare subclass of SNe Ia that interacts with circumstellar material (Type Ia-CSM) allows for studies of the progenitor's environment before explosion, and generally favours single-degenerate progenitor channels. The case of SN Ia-CSM PTF11kx clearly connected thermonuclear explosions with hydrogen-rich CSM-interacting events, and the more recent SN 2020eyj connected SNe Ia with helum-rich companion progenitors. Here we present a study of SN 2020aeuh, a Type Ia-CSM with delayed interaction. We analyse photometric and spectroscopic data that monitor the evolution of SN 2020aeuh and compare its properties with those of peculiar SNe Ia and core-collapse SNe. At early times, the evolution of SN 2020aeuh resembles a slightly overluminous SN Ia. Later, the interaction-dominated spectra develop the same pseudocontinuum seen in Type Ia-CSM PTF11kx and SN 2020eyj. However, the later-time spectra of SN 2020aeuh lack hydrogen and helium narrow lines. Instead, a few narrow lines could be attributed to carbon and oxygen. We fit the pseudobolometric light curve with a CSM-interaction mode, yielding a CSM mass of 1-2 M$_{\odot}$. We propose that SN 2020aeuh was a Type Ia supernova that eventually interacted with a dense medium which was deficient in both hydrogen and helium. Whereas previous SNe Ia-CSM constitute our best evidence for nondegenerate companion progenitors, the CSM around SN 2020aeuh is more difficult to understand. We include a hydrodynamical simulation for a double-degenerate system to showcase how the dynamical evolution of such a progenitor scenario could produce the CSM observed around SN 2020aeuh. It is clear that SN 2020aeuh challenges current models for stellar evolution leading up to a SN Ia explosion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">89.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09297" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Necessary Condition for the Submergence of Proto-Neutron Star Magnetic Fields by Supernova Fallback</a><span class="id">[2507.09297]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Central compact objects (CCOs) are a subclass of neutron stars with a dipole magnetic field strength considerably weaker than those of radio pulsars and magnetars. One possible explanation for such weak magnetic fields in the CCOs is the hidden magnetic field scenario, in which supernova fallback submerges the magnetosphere of a proto-neutron star beneath a newly formed crust. However, the fallback mass and timescale required for this submergence process remain uncertain. We perform one-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the supernova fallback onto a magnetized proto-neutron star, while considering neutrino cooling. In our simulations, the infalling material compresses the magnetic field and drives a strong shock. The shock initially expands outward, but eventually stalls and recedes as neutrino cooling becomes significant. After the shock stalls, the gas density above the magnetosphere increases rapidly, potentially leading to the formation of a new crust. To understand the shock dynamics, we develop semi-analytic models that describe the resulting magnetospheric and shock radii when the shock stalls. By comparing the fallback time scale with the shock stalling time scale, corresponding to the waiting time for the new crust formation, we derive a necessary condition for the submergence of the PNS magnetic field. Our results will provide guidance for investigating the diversity of young isolated neutron stars through multidimensional simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">90.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12530" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reconstruction of Dark Matter and Baryon Density From Galaxies: A Comparison of Linear, Halo Model and Machine Learning-Based Methods</a><span class="id">[2507.12530]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For many analyses in cosmology it is necessary to reconstruct the likely distribution of unobserved fields, such as dark matter or non-luminous baryons, from observed luminous tracers. The dominant approach in cosmology has been to use the so-called halo model, which assumes radially symmetric profiles centered around luminous tracers such as galaxies. More recently, field-level machine learning methods have been proposed that can learn to estimate the unobserved field after being trained on simulations. However, it is unclear whether machine learning methods indeed significantly improve over linear methods or the halo model. In this paper we make a systematic comparison of different approaches to reconstruct dark matter and non-luminous baryons, from galaxy data using the CAMELS simulations. These simulations are in a $25\ \texttt{Mpc/h}$ box, allowing us to compare performance on the mildly non-linear scales $(k\sim 0.4\ \mathrm{h/Mpc})$ down to the size of individual halos.

An emerging structure in the mass distribution indicates the presence of multiple peaks around chirp masses of $8M_\odot$, $14M_\odot$, and $27M_\odot$. In particular, there is a lack of observations between chirp masses of 10 and 12 $M_\odot$. In this article, we report that observations significantly favour the model supporting suppression of the rate in a narrow chirp mass range compared to the model that doesn't include suppression at a confidence greater than 99.5\%. Using another test, which measures the deviation between the inferred chirp mass distributions from the two models, we conservatively estimate a 95\% confidence in the presence of a feature. A lack of confidence has been reported in the presence of a gap around a comparable location in the component mass distribution. The differing conclusions are due to a unique correlation between the primary (heavier of the two masses) and the secondary (lighter of the two masses) masses of binary black holes. This correlation results in increased clustering of measured chirp masses around specific values.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">92.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07358" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signature of polarized ultralight vector dark matter in pulsar timing arrays</a><span class="id">[2508.07358]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate observational signatures of ultralight vector dark matter with masses $m \sim 10^{-24}$-$10^{-22}$ eV in pulsar timing arrays, taking into account general polarization states of the vector field.

However, the compositions of bodies within the Solar System and the stability of volatile-rich solids in accretionary disks suggest that a planet rich in water should also acquire as much as 40% refractory organic carbon (“soot”). This would reduce the water mass fraction well below 50%, making the composition of these planets similar to those of Solar System comets. Here we show that soot-rich planets, with or without water, can account for the low average densities of exoplanets that were previously attributed to a binary combination of rock and water. Formed in locations beyond the soot and/or snow lines in disks, these planets are likely common in our galaxy and already observed by JWST. The surfaces and interiors of soot-rich planets will be influenced by the chemical and physical properties of carbonaceous phases, and the atmospheres of such planets may contain plentiful methane and other hydrocarbons, with implications for photochemical haze generation and habitability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">95.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Very Large Telescope Observations of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS.

Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities.

The extreme carbon enrichment poses a severe challenge to the current understanding of “black widow” companions, which were expected to consist of a wider range of elements due to their origins as stripped stellar cores.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">98.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stochastic inflation with gradient interactions</a><span class="id">[2509.05124]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stochastic inflation rests on the separate-universe approximation, i.e. the ability to describe long-wavelength fluctuations in an inflating universe as homogeneous perturbations of its background dynamics. Although this approximation is valid in most cases, it has been recently pointed out that it breaks down during transition periods between attractor and non-attractor phases. Such transitions are ubiquitous in single-field models giving rise to enhanced perturbations at small scales, that are required to form primordial black holes. The current inability to apply the stochastic-inflation program in such models is therefore one of the main obstacles to investigating the role of backreaction in primordial-black-hole scenarios. In this work, we show how gradient interactions can be incorporated in stochastic inflation, via a set of Langevin equations of higher dimension. We apply our formalism to a few cases of interest, including one with a sharp transition. In all cases, in the classical limit we show that gradient corrections as predicted from cosmological perturbation theory are properly recovered. We uncover the existence of a &quot;pullback&quot; effect by which the tails of the first-passage-time distributions are dampened by gradient interactions. We finally discuss the role of backreaction in the presence of gradient interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">99.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06729" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HD 143811 AB b: A Directly Imaged Planet Orbiting a Spectroscopic Binary in Sco-Cen</a><span class="id">[2509.06729]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present confirmation of HD 143811 AB b, a substellar companion to spectroscopic binary HD 143811 AB through direct imaging with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and Keck NIRC2. HD 143811 AB was observed as a part of the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) in 2016 and 2019 and is a member of the Sco-Cen star formation region. The exoplanet is detected $\sim 430$ mas from the host star by GPI. With two GPI epochs and one from Keck/NIRC2 in 2022, we confirm through common proper motion analysis that the object is bound to its host star. We derive an orbit with a semi-major axis of $64 ^{+32}_{-14}$ au and eccentricity ${0.23 ^{+0.24}_{-0.16}}$. Spectral analysis of the GPI $H$-band spectrum and NIRC2 \textit{L'} photometry provides additional proof that this object is a substellar companion. We compare the spectrum of HD 143811 AB b to PHOENIX stellar models and Exo-REM exoplanet atmosphere models and find that Exo-REM models provide the best fits to the data. From the Exo-REM models, we derive an effective temperature of $1042^{+178}_{-132}$ K for the planet and translate the derived luminosity of the planet to a mass of $5.6 \pm 1.1~M_\textrm{Jup}$ assuming hot-start evolutionary models. HD 143811 AB b is the first directly imaged planet around a binary that is not on an ultra-wide orbit. Future characterization of this object will shed light on the formation of planets around binary star systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">100.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the origin of the dominant waves in the extended solar corona</a><span class="id">[2509.09016]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The extended solar corona at 10-30 solar radii is essentially devoid of all waves below 100 kHz other than triggered ion acoustic waves (TIAW), which consist of a low frequency electromagnetic wave at a frequency of a few Hz coupled to one or more electrostatic waves at a few hundred Hz, such that the amplitudes of the higher frequency waves peak at a fixed phase of each low frequency wave period. All the waves in a TIAW event travel at the same phase speed, which is found to be 150 km/sec (the ion acoustic speed was about 100 km/sec). It has not been possible to explain the TIAW as a resonant wave-wave interaction, so a non-resonant interaction has been considered in which the loss of energy by the low frequency wave is used to both heat the electrons and grow the higher frequency waves. Evidence in support of this explanation is described and a PIC simulation that discusses this process is summarized. This simulation demonstrates wave-particle interactions driven by the enhanced LF fluctuations, which subsequently modify the proton VDF and create conditions favorable for the growth of HF waves. This interplay between a pair of waves, mediated by modifications of plasma parameters and energy conversion, represents a significant nonlinear process in plasma physics, the study of which will deepen the understanding of energy transfer, wave generation, and plasma dynamics in diverse astrophysical environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">101.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interaction between disk and extended corona in a general relativistic framework</a><span class="id">[2509.10177]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The energy equilibrium between the corona and the underlying disk in a two-phase accretion flow sets a lower limit on the achievable photon index. A slab corona may not explain the hard state observations of X-ray binaries (XRBs). We incorporate energy feedback to the accretion disk resulting from illumination by an extended corona, and vice versa. The interaction between these two components allows for the possibility of finding an energetically self-consistent equilibrium solution for a given disk-corona system. We have upgraded the existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MONK, to incorporate the interaction between the disk and the extended corona within the general relativistic framework. We introduce an albedo parameter to specify the fraction of the incident flux that is reflected by the disk, while the remainder is absorbed and added to the intrinsic dissipation. Reflection is modeled assuming a semi-infinite electron atmosphere. We find global equilibrium solutions by iterating interaction between disk and extended slab corona. A higher black hole spin, higher coronal temperature, and higher albedo all lead to harder spectra. For typical coronal temperatures and disk albedo, the lowest achievable photon index with a static slab corona fully covering the disk is approximately 1.7-1.8. With the upgraded version of MONK, we are now able to achieve global energy equilibrium for a given disk-corona system. This approach holds significant potential for constraining the coronal geometry using not only the observed flux but also polarization. A static slab does not appear to be a favorable coronal geometry for the hard state of XRBs, even when global energy balance is taken into account.

Much of this uncertainty is dominated by the inability to resolve the lines in frequency, leading to the use of approximate frequency-averaged treatments, often employing the `line-expansion formalism'. In this short paper we assess the usage of this formalism in simulations, specifically the prominent Eastman &amp; Pinto 1993 formula (hereafter EP93). As a case study, we reproduce EP93 opacities from the commonly-used STELLA simulations. The latter previously yielded orders of magnitude discrepancy in observed emission relative to similar simulations from our group. The discrepancy is due to differences in line opacity treatment. We show that the widely used EP93 expansion opacity substantially underestimates photon emissivity and reprocessing rates, even when it correctly captures photon mean-free-paths. We also highlight the importance of introducing micro-plasma electron excitation level cutoffs in the equation of state (EOS) for calculating opacity. We propose a new method for calculating emissivity, based on a modification of the simple frequency-bin averaged opacity method, in a way that incorporates the effect of expansion on effective line strength. This formulation should reduce the overestimation of the opacity that may occur with the simple averaging method. To our knowledge, no fully-consistent coarse-frequency solution currently exists for line modeling in these systems. Finally, we describe new features in our updated publicly available high-resolution frequency-dependent opacity table.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">105.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The EBLM project XVI.

There is likely too much angular momentum in a collapsing, fragmenting protostellar cloud to form such binaries in situ, suggesting some post processing. One probe of a binary's dynamical history is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes – its obliquity. The classical method for determining stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, but less than a dozen stellar binaries. In this paper, we present the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of EBLM J0021-16, a $0.19M_\odot$ M-dwarf eclipsing a $1.05M_\odot$ G-dwarf on a 5.97 day, almost-circular orbit. We combine CORALIE spectroscopy with TESS photometry and a measured primary star rotation period of 7.04 days, according to star spot modulation. We show that the orbital axis is misaligned with the primary star's spin axis, with a true 3D obliquity of $\psi=28.9\pm2.1^{\circ}$. EBLM J0021-16, being neither spin-orbit aligned nor synchronized, yet with an almost circular orbit, is a curious case for tidal evolution in tight binaries. It becomes one of a handful of eclipsing binaries with true obliquity measurements. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf's mass and radius to a fractional precision better than 1\%. The radius of the M-dwarf is inflated by 6\% ($7.4\sigma$) with respect to stellar models, consistent with many other M-dwarfs in the literature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">106.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</a><span class="id">[2510.02260]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs.

Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J013656.5+093347, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k = 3) at pressure levels   1 bar, corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation, suggest a potential North-South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect deviations from bulk (composite) variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">107.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27619" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equation-of-state-informed pulse profile modeling</a><span class="id">[2510.27619]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>NICER has enabled mass-radius inferences for pulsars using pulse profile modeling (PPM), providing constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of cold, dense matter. To date, PPM and EOS inference have been carried out as two separate steps, with the former using EOS-agnostic priors. This approach has several drawbacks. Ideally, one would perform a fully hierarchical Bayesian inference where the pulse profile and EOS model parameters are jointly fit, but implementing such a framework is complex and computationally demanding. Here, we present an intermediate solution introducing an EOS-informed prior on mass-radius into the existing PPM pipeline using normalizing flows. By focusing on the parameter space consistent with certain EOSs, this approach both tightens constraints on neutron star parameters while reducing computational costs and requiring minimal additional implementation effort. We test this approach on two pulsars, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715, and with two EOS model families: a model based on the speed of sound inside the neutron star interior (CS) and a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model. Both EOS models implement constraints from chiral effective field theory calculations of dense matter. For both pulsar datasets, the inferred radius credible intervals are narrower than in the EOS-agnostic case, with CS favoring smaller radii and PP favoring larger radii. For PSR J0437-4715, the EOS-informed priors reveal a new, more extreme geometric mode that is statistically favored but physically questionable. Including the PPM posteriors in the subsequent EOS inference further tightens the mass-radius posteriors through the chiral effective field theory constraints. However, there is also a sensitivity to the high-density extensions, where the PP (CS) model produces a shift towards larger (smaller) radii and corresponding stiffening (softening) of the pressure-energy density relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">108.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Correlation Between the Final Separation and Mass Ratio from Common Envelope Simulations</a><span class="id">[2511.02150]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Analytical models for common envelope evolution (CEE), particularly the energy formalism, are used in binary population synthesis to predict post-CEE configurations. This formalism is based on an efficiency parameter alpha, which relates the orbital energy released during CEE to that required to unbind the envelope of the giant. However, one of the main challenges is that CEE is a multiscale, multiphysics process. As a result, there may not be a universal value for alpha, or even a general expression. Using 13 3D simulations of CEE with RGBs (1 and 2 M$_\odot$ primary; four mass ratios; with and without corotation), we present an empirical linear correlation between the post-plunge-in separation and the mass ratio, normalized by the giant radius. This trend for the plunge-in phase of CEE persists across RGB, AGB, and supergiant simulations in the literature, even for partially bound envelopes. Therefore, alpha from simulations should not be used to predict the final separation, but rather as a diagnostic of whether sufficient orbital energy has been liberated to completely eject the envelope immediately after the radial plunge. If this condition is not met, further in-spiral is expected in later stages of CEE, which may explain why the final separation of post-CEE observations is generally smaller than those predicted by the linear fit. Our results reinforce the idea that a better description could emerge if CEE is treated as a sequence of distinct phases, rather than treating it as a single event governed by alpha.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">109.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starobinsky Inflation and the Latest CMB Data: A Subtle Tension?</a><span class="id">[2511.06640]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the Starobinsky inflation model and the impact of curvature corrections, particularly a cubic $R^3$ term, to assess their behavior in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).

Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) instruments will have a higher sensitivity and a smaller inner working angle than instruments up to now, which should allow more productive searches and detailed characterisation. We study the observability of accreting gas giants with METIS, the first-generation ELT spectrograph. We focus on the accretion-tracing hydrogen recombination lines accessible at a resolution R=1e5, mainly Brackett alpha and Pfund-series lines. Our approach is general but we take PDS 70 b as a fiducial case. To calculate high-resolution line profiles, we combine a semianalytical multidimensional description of the flow onto an accreting planet and its circumplanetary disc (CPD) with local non-equilibrium shock-emission models. We assume the limiting scenario of no extinction appropriate for gas giants in gaps and negligible contribution from magnetospheric accretion columns. We use simulated detector sensitivities to compute required observing times. Both the planet surface and the CPD surface shocks contribute to the total line profile, which is non-Gaussian and much narrower than the free-fall velocity. For the adopted baseline accretion rate onto PDS 70 b, the Br alpha line peak is equal to the photospheric continuum modulated mostly by water features. However, the rotation of the planet broadens the features, helping the shock excess stand out. At Br alpha, already the continuum of PDS 70 b should yield SNR=12 in 4 h. The peak excess should require only about 15 min to reach SNR=3. Br alpha is a potent planet formation tracer accessible to METIS in little integration time. Resolved line profiles will place independent constraints especially on the mass and radius of an accreting planet, and help identify the accretion mechanism(s) at work.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">111.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Constraints on the Phenomenological Interacting Dark Energy Model with Fermi Gamma-Ray Bursts and DESI DR2</a><span class="id">[2511.16032]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we constrain the phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) model using \emph{Fermi} gamma-ray burst (GRB) dataset and the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2).

By decomposing the emitting region into a set of one-dimensional luminous segments, each characterized by its inclination angle and inner radius, we construct transfer functions that capture key image features-namely, the direct image, lensing ring, and photon ring. This approach allows a unified treatment of disk geometry and viewing angle. We explore three regimes: optically thin, optically thick, and partially optically thick disks. For optically thin flows, increasing the disk thickness (characterized by the half-opening angle $\psi_0$) broadens the lensing ring, gradually bridging the photon ring and the direct image. The photon ring remains narrow, but its position robustly defines the innermost edge of the lensing structure. In the optically thick case, image features are primarily determined by the first intersection of traced light rays with the disk, and we provide analytical criteria for the presence of lensing and photon rings based on the critical deflection angles. For partially optically thick disks, we adopt a simplified radiative transport model and find a critical absorption coefficient $\chi \sim (6M\psi_0)^{-1}$ beyond which the image rapidly transitions from an optically thin- to thick-disk appearance. These results help clarify the respective roles of the photon and lensing rings across different disk configurations, and may offer a useful framework for interpreting future high-resolution black hole observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">117.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospects for joint multiband detection of intermediate-mass black holes by LGWA and the Einstein Telescope</a><span class="id">[2507.10165]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational-wave (GW) detection offers a novel approach to exploring intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs).

We consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two population models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform distribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their combination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers. Our results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for high-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH binaries with primary masses above $5 \times 10^4~M_\odot$ is largely insensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more suited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\odot$. The multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection capabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the multi-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH population distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band observations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for IMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this important yet still poorly observed class of black holes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">118.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Proton versus Electron Heating and Energization during Magnetic Reconnection</a><span class="id">[2508.00119]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The mechanisms controlling the relative heating and energization of electrons and protons during magnetic reconnection are explored. Simulations are carried out with the kglobal model, which produces bulk heating and the extended powerlaw distributions of both species that have been documented in observations. The simulations have been carried out with a range of proton-to-electron mass ratios and upstream temperatures to isolate the factors that control energy gain. The simulations reveal that when the upstream temperatures of the two species are equal, the proton heating and energization exceeds that of electrons and that this is a consequence of the much larger energy gain of protons on their first entry into the reconnection exhaust. The effective energy gain of protons on exhaust entry scales as $m_iC_A^2$ since the protons counterstream at the Alfvén speed $C_A$ while the initial electron energy gain is smaller by the factor $(\beta_{e0}m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$. Since Fermi reflection during flux rope merger dominates energy gain in large-scale reconnecting systems and the rate of energy gain is proportional to energy, protons continue to gain energy faster than electrons for the duration of the simulations, leading to temperature increments of protons exceeding that of electrons and the non-thermal energy content of protons also exceeding that of electrons.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">119.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for a Dark Dimension Right-handed Neutrino in KATRIN</a><span class="id">[2509.05233]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the possibility that the Right-handed neutrino is a five-dimensional state propagating along a micron size extra dimension, as required in the dark dimension proposal. We work out the signatures of R-neutrino production in KATRIN experiment and compare them with those of a sterile neutrino which manifests by a kink in the electron energy spectrum of the beta-decay at a value corresponding to the sterile neutrino mass. We explore the allowed parameter space of the compactification scale and the R-neutrino bulk mass versus the Yukawa coupling, and show that a large part of it is within KATRIN's sensitivity. When the bulk mass is much smaller than the compactification scale, several kinks could be observed corresponding to the positions of the R-neutrino Kaluza-Klein excitations, while for large bulk mass there will be effectively one kink at the position of the bulk mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">120.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14306" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From geometry to cosmology: a pedagogical review of inflation in curvature, torsion, and extended gravity theories</a><span class="id">[2509.14306]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a simplified review of inflationary cosmology across various modified gravity theories.

This development enables efficient neutron tagging via the large capture cross section of gadolinium, greatly improving the identification of inverse beta decay events, the primary channel for detecting the diffuse supernova neutrino background [DSNB]. The upgrade also enhances sensitivity to galactic and pre-supernova neutrinos, as well as atmospheric neutrino interactions. To realize this capability, extensive work was performed, including the construction and operation of the EGADS demonstrator, the refurbishment of the SK tank, the development of radiopure gadolinium production methods, and the validation of the loading and uniformity of gadolinium in solution. Early SK-Gd operation has demonstrated high neutron-tagging efficiency, reduced backgrounds, and world-leading limits on the DSNB flux. With these advances, SK-Gd now stands at the threshold of discovering the DSNB and opens a wide range of new opportunities in astrophysics and neutrino physics.</p></div></details></article></body>
