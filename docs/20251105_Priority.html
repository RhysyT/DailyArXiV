Three kilometer-sized interstellar objects (ISOs) have been detected transiting the Solar System, and spacecraft have directly measured micrometer-scale interstellar dust (ISD). Yet no intermediate-size interstellar meteoroids have been identified in current meteor surveys. Aims. We test whether a power-law flux extrapolation connecting spacecraft ISD and kilometer-scale ISOs is consistent with meteor surveys, and we quantify the expected interstellar impacting flux based on various observational reports. Methods. We compiled differential fluxes and limits from spacecraft ISD, radar and optical meteor surveys, and theoretical estimates. We evaluated the power-law size-frequency fits, computed the 3I-like flux, and compared measured fluxes to predictions. Results. The spacecraft-measured dust flux exceeds extrapolations constrained by meteor surveys and kilometer-scale ISOs by $\sim$2-7 orders of magnitude. An $r^{-3.0}$ fit combining spacecraft ISD detections with kilometer-scale ISOs overpredicts the number of meteors with hyperbolic orbits, whereas slopes of $r^{-2.7}$-$r^{-2.3}$ (derived from radar and optical meteor upper limits, respectively) instead yield interplanetary-to-interstellar flux ratios of $10^{3}$-$10^{6}$. Conclusions. A simple power-law from ISD to ISOs is inconsistent with meteor survey constraints and yields unrealistic predictions for interstellar meteoroids. The data reveal a gap between submicron dust entrained in the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) and macroscopic bodies ejected from planetary systems. This gap may reflect distinct origins and destruction-transport processes rather than a continuous size-frequency distribution. This would imply either the dominance of a small-particle LIC component or the need to reassess spacecraft dust fluxes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identification and characterization of optical companions to the population of millisecond pulsars in the globular cluster M3</a><span class="id">[2511.01969]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The study of binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in globular clusters (GCs) is a key ingredient to study binary and stellar evolution under extreme conditions. In this context, an accurate analysis of the optical emission, which is mostly dominated by the companion star, is essential for a comprehensive characterization of these systems and their role within their environment. In this work, we present a multi-wavelength investigation of five binary MSPs in the Galactic GC M3 (NGC 5272) using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. Our analysis builds on the timing solutions obtained with the FAST radio Telescope by Li et al. (2024). For each MSP, we carry out precise astrometric cross-matching with the accurate radio positions to identify potential counterparts. When a match is found, we analyse its location in the colour-magnitude diagrams and compare the results with updated binary evolution models to infer the system properties. We confirm the identification of the optical companion to M3B, matching the source previously reported by Cadelano et al. (2019), and successfully identify and characterize the optical companions to M3D and M3F. All three are consistent with helium white dwarfs, as expected from the canonical formation scenario. For M3A and M3E, no reliable counterparts are found, but we place strong upper limits on the brightness and mass of the undetected companion. In the case of M3E, we detect a red object near the radio position in two F814W observations; however, astrometric measurements over a 15-year baseline reveal a significant proper motion inconsistent with cluster membership, identifying the source as a foreground contaminant. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining precise radio timing with deep, multi-band HST images to uncover and constrain the nature of MSP companions in GCs, offering insights into their formation and evolutionary histories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The lives and deaths of faint satellite galaxies around M31</a><span class="id">[2511.01977]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present predictions for proper motions, infall times and times of first pericentric passage for 39 of M31's satellite galaxies. We estimate these by sampling satellite orbits from cosmological N-body simulations matched on mass, distance and velocity along the line of sight, in addition to properties of the host system. Our predictions are probabilistic based on repeated sampling from the uncertainty distributions of all quantities involved. We use these constraints on the satellites' orbital histories in conjunction with their published star formation histories to investigate the dominant environmental mechanisms for quenching satellites of M31-like hosts. Around half of the satellites appear to have quenched before their first pericentric passage around M31. Only the most massive satellites (with stellar masses &gt; 10^8 M_sun) are able to maintain star formation for up to billions of years after infall. The majority of faint satellites, with stellar masses &lt; 10^8 M_sun , were likely quenched before entering the M31 system. We compare our results for M31 against predictions for the Milky Way's satellites from the literature; M31's has a more active recent accretion history with more recently quenched satellites than the Milky Way.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ODIN: Using multiplicity of Lyman-Alpha Emitters to assess star formation activity in dark matter halos</a><span class="id">[2511.01981]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate if systems of multiple Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) can serve as a proxy for dark matter halo mass, assess how their radiative properties relate to the underlying halo conditions, and explore the physics of star formation activity in LAEs and its relation to possible physically related companions. We use data from the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey, which targets LAEs in three narrow redshift slices. We identify physically associated LAE multiples in the COSMOS field at $z = 2.4$, $z = 3.1$, and $z=4.5$, and use a mock catalog from the IllustrisTNG100 simulation to assess the completeness and contamination affecting the resulting sample of LAE multiples. We then study their statistical and radiative properties as a function of multiplicity, where we adopt the term multiplicity to refer to the number of physically associated LAEs. We find a strong correlation between LAE multiplicity and host halo mass in the mocks, with higher multiplicity systems preferentially occupying more massive halos. In both ODIN and the mock sample, we find indications that the mean Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and UV magnitude of LAEs in multiples increase with multiplicity. The halo-wide LAE surface brightness densities in Ly$\alpha$ and UV increase with multiplicity, reflecting more compact and actively star-forming environments. The close agreement between the model and ODIN observations supports the validity of the Ly$\alpha$ emission model in capturing key physical processes in LAE environments. Finally, a subhalo-based perturbation induced star formation model reproduces the minimum subhalo mass distribution in simulations at $z=2.4$, suggesting that local perturbations, rather than the presence of LAE companions, drive star formation in these systems. For the higher redshifts, neighbor perturbations do not seem to be the main driver that triggers star formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01986" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Formation Histories and Stellar Dynamics in the Central Galaxies of RX J0820.9+0752, A1835, and PKS 0745-191</a><span class="id">[2511.01986]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations of stellar populations in three galaxies at the centers of cooling flow clusters. All three host rich molecular gas reservoirs and show prominent Balmer absorption from $30-100$ Myr-old stars consistent with long lasting star formation. Two systems, A1835 and PKS 0745-191, have extended young stellar populations in their centers with recent star formation rates of 100 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 8 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. In A1835 we uncover a massive blueshifted clump of young stars moving at high speed with respect to the gas and central galaxy. We suggest this feature is a young population that formed in a gaseous outflow that has detached from its natal gas and is falling back toward the galaxy. This result, combined with a companion study ( arXiv:2404.02212 ) tracing nebular emission which presumably cooled from the hot X-ray atmosphere, indicates that star formation is proceeding in a dynamically complex environment resulting from the central galaxy's motion with respect to the cooling clouds and motion induced by feedback from the central radio jets. In RX J0820.9+0752 intermediate age stars are found in a filament outside of the nucleus with no discernible star formation at the center of the galaxy. All projected galaxies are composed of old stellar populations with deep D4000 breaks and are devoid of detectable warm gas. While in some instances they may be interacting gravitationally with the central galaxy, they cannot have donated the upward of $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas found in these systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01993" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Extended, Physically Calibrated FP for Elliptical Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.01993]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a physically motivated extension of the FP for elliptical galaxies, derived from the scalar virial theorem and calibrated using observational data. Starting from the basic equilibrium condition, we incorporate key physical parameters that govern galaxy structure and dynamics, namely stellar mass-to-light ratio, central dark matter fraction, and structural non-homology as traced by the Sersic profile. The resulting model retains the original dependencies on velocity dispersion and surface brightness, but introduces physically interpretable corrections that significantly improve the fit to real data. Using a large galaxy sample, we demonstrate that this extended FP achieves a higher level of accuracy than the classical form, with all parameters showing strong statistical significance. Our results indicate that the observed FP can be understood as an empirical refinement of the virial prediction, once variations in stellar populations, dark matter content, and internal structure are taken into account. This work provides a unified framework that bridges theoretical expectations with observed scaling relations in elliptical systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02009" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quasars acting as Strong Lenses Found in DESI DR1</a><span class="id">[2511.02009]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quasars acting as strong gravitational lenses offer a rare opportunity to probe the redshift evolution of scaling relations between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, particularly the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$–$M_{\mathrm{host}}$ relation. Using these powerful probes, the mass of the host galaxy can be precisely inferred from the Einstein radius $\theta_{\mathrm{E}}$. Using 812{,}118 quasars from DESI DR1 ($0.03 \leq z \leq 1.8$), we searched for quasars lensing higher-redshift galaxies by identifying background emission-line features in their spectra. To detect these rare systems, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on mock lenses constructed from real DESI spectra of quasars and emission-line galaxies (ELGs), achieving a high classification performance (AUC = 0.99). We also trained a regression network to estimate the redshift of the background ELG. Applying this pipeline, we identified seven high-quality (Grade A) lens candidates, each exhibiting a strong [O \textsc{ii}] doublet at a higher redshift than the foreground quasar; four candidates additionally show H$\beta$ and [O \textsc{iii}] emission. These results significantly expand the sample of quasar lens candidates beyond the twelve identified and three confirmed in previous work, and demonstrate the potential for scalable, data-driven discovery of quasars as strong lenses in upcoming spectroscopic surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the Role of Protostellar Variability with PRIMA Using Monte Carlo Simulations</a><span class="id">[2511.02024]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Evidence suggests that protostellar outbursts likely play a critical role in the stellar mass assembly process, but the extent of this contribution is not well understood. Using the proposed observing program of PRIMA, a concept far-IR observatory (PRIMA GO Case #43 in Moullet et al. 2023), we examine the probe's ability to unambiguously determine whether or not variable accretion events dominate the stellar mass assembly process ($M_{\rm burst}\geq0.5M_{*}$). To do this, we construct multiple protostellar ensembles using Herschel 70$\mu$m flux data and evolve them using a toy Monte Carlo simulation through steady-state and high magnitude accretion events. Ensembles are observed at various epochs in the evolution process to conclude how many large amplitude outbursts are observationally recoverable during the proposed program. Based on our synthetic observations and our simulation specifications, we determine that observing a protostellar ensemble of at least 2000 protostars using PRIMA's proposed program is sufficient for determining the importance of protostellar outbursts in the stellar mass assembly process.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaping the Milky Way. II. The dark matter halo's response to the LMC's passage in a cosmological context</a><span class="id">[2511.02031]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way (MW) is expected to exhibit a large-scale dynamical response to the recent infall of the LMC. This event produces a dynamical friction wake and shifts the MW's halo density center. The structure of this response encodes information about the LMC- MW mass ratio, the LMC's orbit, the MW halo's pre-infall structure and could provide constraints on dark matter physics. To extract this information, a method to separate these effects and recover the initial shape of the MW's halo is required. Here, we use basis function expansions to analyze the halo response in eighteen simulations of MW-LMC-like interactions from the MWest cosmological, dark-matter-only zoom-in simulations. The results show that mergers similar to the LMC consistently generate a significant dipole and a secondary quadrupole response in the halo. The dipole arises from the host density center displacement and halo distortions, and its amplitude scales as the square of the MW-LMC mass ratio, peaking 0.2-0.7 Gyr after the LMC's pericenter. The quadrupole's strength depends primarily on the original axis ratios of the host halo, though contributions from the dynamical friction wake cause it to peak less than 0.3 Gyr before pericenter. Future measurements of both the dipole and quadrupole imprints of the LMC's passage in the density of the MW's stellar halo should be able to disentangle these effects and provide insight into the initial structure of the MW's halo, the MW's response, and the mass of the LMC.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The origin of ionized gas in retired galaxies: dynamical clues</a><span class="id">[2511.02045]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the kinematical and dynamical properties of quiescent cluster galaxies with weak emission lines, referred to as retired (R), and those without emission lines, dubbed passive (P), to better understand the origin of the ionized gas in R galaxies and what drives the differences between these populations. We stack 2,907 P and 2,387 R galaxies from 336 relaxed galaxy clusters to build an ensemble cluster and estimate their projected number density and velocity dispersion profiles, $\sigma_P(R)$, as well as their projected phase-space (PPS) distributions. Additionally, we apply the MAMPOSSt code and the Jeans equation inversion technique to constrain the velocity anisotropy profiles, $\beta(r)$. We find that P galaxies tend to reside closer to the cluster centres than R galaxies, and that both populations exhibit similar $\sigma_P(R)$ and $\beta(r)$ profiles, regardless of their stellar mass, stellar age, or morphology. The only exception is elliptical R galaxies, which are marginally more concentrated and display more radial orbits than their P counterparts. PPS analyses indicate that R galaxies were, on average, accreted later than P galaxies, except for those with $D_n4000 &gt; 1.86$ or elliptical morphology. These results suggest that R galaxies, though accreted more recently, have already had enough time to evolve towards a dynamical state more consistent with that of the dynamically relaxed P population. Finally, our findings suggest that the ionized gas in early-type R galaxies likely originates from accretion from their own hot gas haloes, and that its removal triggers the transition toward the P phase over relatively long timescales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bars in low-density environments rotate faster than bars in dense regions</a><span class="id">[2511.02054]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Does the environment of a galaxy directly influence the kinematics of its bar? We present observational evidence that bars in high-density environments exhibit significantly slower rotation rates than bars in low-density environments. Galactic bars are central, extended structures composed of stars, dust and gas, present in approximately 30 to 70 per cent of luminous spiral galaxies in the local Universe. Recent simulation studies have suggested that the environment can influence the bar rotation rate, $R$, which is used to classify bars as either fast ($1\leq R \leq1.4$) or slow ($R \gt 1.4$). We use estimates of $R$ obtained with the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to Integral Field Unit spectroscopy from MaNGA and CALIFA. After cross-matching these with the projected neighbour density, $\log\Sigma$, we retain 286 galaxies. The analysis reveals that bars in high-density environments are significantly slower (median $R = 1.67^{+0.72}_{-0.42}$) compared to bars in low-density environments (median $R = 1.37^{+0.51}_{-0.34}$); Anderson-Darling $\textit{p}$-value of $p_{\mathrm{AD}}= 0.002$ ($3.1\,\sigma$). This study marks the first empirical test of the hypothesis that fast bars are formed by global instabilities in isolated galaxies, while slow bars are triggered by tidal interactions in dense environments, in agreement with predictions from numerous $\textit{N}$-body simulations. Future studies would benefit from a larger sample of galaxies with reliable Integral Field Unit data, required to measure bar rotation rates. Specifically, more data are necessary to study the environmental influence on bar formation within dense settings (i.e. groups, clusters and filaments).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02061" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GMCs and Star Formation in the Galaxy: I. Effects of an HII region on a GMC</a><span class="id">[2511.02061]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The destruction of Giant Molecular Clouds is a key component in galaxy evolution. We theoretically model the destruction of GMCs by HII regions, which evaporate ionized gas and eject neutral gas during their expansion. HII regions follow one of three tracks, depending on the EUV luminosity, $S$, of the ionizing OB association: the expansion can stall inside the cloud; it can break out, forming a blister (champagne) flow; or, for $S&gt;S_{\rm com}$, it can result in the formation of a cometary cloud. We present results for the accumulated mass loss, $M_{\rm loss}(t)$, and the final mass loss, $M_{{\rm loss},f}$, by evaporation and ejection for a range of cloud masses ($10^4&lt;M&lt;10^{7}$ M$_\odot$), cloud surface densities ($50&lt;\Sigma&lt;1000$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$), OB association luminosities ($10^{44}&lt;S&lt;10^{52}$ s$^{-1}$), and off-center position of the association. We do not consider starbursts; our neglect of radiation pressure restricts our treatment to $S&lt;10^{52} [(M/10^6$ M$_\odot)^{0.3})/(\Sigma /100$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$)] s$^{-1}$, and our neglect of gravity restricts $(M/10^6$ M$_\odot$)($\Sigma/ 100$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}) &lt; 10$. We find that $M_{{\rm loss},f}$ for the range $0.1 &lt; M_{{\rm loss},f}/M &lt; 0.7$ , is proportional to $S^p$, where $p\sim 0.45-0.75$ depends on $M$, $\Sigma$, and association position. We find analytic fits to $S_{\rm com}$ as a function of $\Sigma$, $M$, and association position. $S&gt; S_{\rm com}$ associations destroy at least 70% of the initial cloud. We find a critical cloud mass $M_{\rm survive}$ above which clouds never become cometary and lose $&lt;$ 70% of their mass via a single association. Low mass clouds mostly lose mass via ejection of neutral gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02178" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Extremely Luminous Flare Recorded from a Supermassive Black Hole</a><span class="id">[2511.02178]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Since their discovery more than 60 years ago, accreting supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) were recognized as highly variable sources, requiring an extremely compact, dynamic environment. Their variability traces to multiple phenomena, including changing accretion rates, temperature changes, foreground absorbers, and structural changes to the accretion disk. Spurred by a new generation of time-domain surveys, the extremes of black hole variability are now being probed. We report the discovery of an extreme flare by the AGN J224554.84+374326.5, which brightened by more than a factor of 40 in 2018. The source has slowly faded since then. The total emitted UV/optical energy to date is $\sim10^{54}$ erg, i.e., the complete conversion of approximately one solar mass into electromagnetic radiation. This flare is 30 times more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few physical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy. We discuss potential mechanisms, including the tidal disruption of a high mass $(&gt;30\, M_\odot)$ star, gravitational lensing of an AGN flare or supernova, or a supermassive (pair instability) supernova in the accretion disk of an AGN. We favor the tidal disruption of a massive star in a prograde orbit in an AGN disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02186" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Face-on Accretion Disk Geometry Revealed by Millimeter-wave Periodicity in Sgr A$^*$</a><span class="id">[2511.02186]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyzed 77 epochs of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) archival data to investigate flux variability in Sagittarius A$^*$ (Sgr A$^*$), the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center.

With about 1.9 million AGNs observed in Gaia DR3 at optical precision comparable to radio wavelengths, Gaia provides a solid foundation for constructing the next-generation, kinematically non-rotating optical reference frame. Accurate assessment of systematic residuals in AGN astrometry is therefore crucial. In this talk, we analysed the parallaxes and proper motions of Gaia DR3 AGNs to characterize systematic errors and their correlations with various physical and observational properties. A subset of Gaia-CRF3 AGNs exhibits significant astrometric offsets, mainly arising from dual or lensed quasars whose structural variations induce photocenter jitter, mimicking parallax and proper motion. Such sources must be carefully excluded from reference frame construction. To this end, we introduce an astrometric quality index for each source to quantify its astrometric reliability. The results reveal a strong correlation between lower quality index values and increasing errors in position, proper motion, and parallax, demonstrating that the proposed index provides an effective metric for selecting high-fidelity AGNs as primary reference sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Birth Radii in the LMC: Insights into Chemodynamics, Radial Migration, and Star Formation Across the Disk</a><span class="id">[2511.02231]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The LMC and SMC are interacting dwarf galaxies that offer a valuable testbed for studying the effects of galactic mergers. We investigate the chemodynamic history of the LMC in the context of its interaction with the SMC by inferring stellar birth radii, first validated on a hydrodynamical simulation tailored to reproduce their interaction history. Using inferred birth radii and stellar ages, we identify signatures of dynamical and chemical evolution across the LMC disk. We find that the LMC's metallicity gradient steepened around 5, 3, and 1 Gyr ago, coinciding with enhanced star formation (SF) episodes. These events exhibit distinct spatial patterns – initially concentrated in the inner disk at 5 Gyr, expanding outward by 3 Gyr, and becoming widespread with renewed central activity at 1 Gyr – likely reflecting changes in spin alignment between the interacting disks if the enhancements of SF tracks the pericenter passages of the SMC to the LMC. The inferred radial migration strength of the LMC shows notable enhancements at 0.5, 2, and 5 Gyr. The most $\alpha$-enriched stars form 2-3 Gyr ago at birth radii of 2-4 kpc, the only epoch when star formation is broadly distributed across the disk. Finally, unlike the Milky Way, the LMC lacks a clear [$\alpha$/M]-[Fe/H] bimodality. This is likely due to its more centrally concentrated star formation during these periods, compared to the MW's more extended outer-disk star formation enhancements. These findings place strong constraints on the LMC's assembly history and its interaction with the SMC.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02334" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hierarchical Structure and Self-gravity in the Rosette Molecular Cloud</a><span class="id">[2511.02334]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the hierarchical structure in the Rosette Molecular Cloud (RMC) using $^{13}$CO J=1-0 data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey with a non-binary Dendrogram algorithm that allows multiple branches to emerge from parent structures.

The mass and radius follow power-law distributions with exponents of 2.2-2.5, with slightly flatter slopes for substructures inside the HII region. The velocity dispersion scales weakly with radius ($\sigma_v \propto R^{0.45\pm 0.03}$, $r = 0.58$), but shows a tighter correlation with the product of surface density and size ($\sigma_v \propto (\Sigma R)^{0.29\pm 0.01}$, $r = 0.73$). Self-gravitating substructures are found across scales from $\sim$0.2 to 10 pc, and nearly all structures with peak brightness above 4 K are gravitationally bound ($\alpha_{\rm vir} &lt; 2$). The fraction of bound structures increases with mass, size, and surface density, supporting the scenario of global hierarchical collapse (GHC) for the evolution of molecular clouds, in which molecular clouds and their substructures are undergoing multiscale collapse.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02375" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ELAIS-N1 Deep Field uGMRT Band-2: Constraints on Diffuse Galactic Synchrotron Emission Power Spectrum</a><span class="id">[2511.02375]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high sensitivity, low radio frequency continuum observations of the ELAIS-N1 field with 32 hours of observations of the uGMRT Band-2 ($120-250$ MHz) covering $5.86\,\text{deg}^2$ area, achieving a central off-source RMS noise of $237\,\mu\mathrm{Jy}/\mathrm{beam}$ with a resolution of $11.45''$ at the central frequency of 183 MHz. A radio source catalogue of 1027 sources statistically matches with similar observations at different frequencies within the sensitivity range of the uGMRT. The calibrated data is further used to characterise the dominant foreground, the Diffuse Galactic Synchrotron Emission (DGSE), in angular scale and frequency regime. We derived the angular power spectrum (APS) of DGSE in two ways: image-based estimator (i-APS) and visibility-based Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE; hereafter as t-APS). We assess the characteristics of DGSE with a power-law form of $C_{\ell} = A({1000}/{\ell})^{\beta}$. Combining data from Band-2 and earlier Band-3 observations, we derived a spectral variation of $C_{\ell}$ in the form of $C_{\ell} = A{\nu^{-2{\alpha}}}{\ell^{-{\beta}}}$. Our result indicates a spectral break at $\nu = 230\,{\pm}\,5$ MHz, corresponding to a synchrotron age of $t_\text{syn} = 106\,{\pm}\,1$ Myr for the cosmic-ray electrons (CRe). This break result suggests a low-energy cutoff in the CRe population, leading to spectral curvature at low frequencies. Using both of the techniques, i-APS and t-APS, we find that the mean spectral index $\alpha$ and power-law index $\beta$ are consistent within the frequency range $120-500$ MHz.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02476" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nominal thresholds for good astrometric fits, and prospects for binary detectability, for the full extended \textit{Gaia} mission</a><span class="id">[2511.02476]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The full extended Gaia mission spans slightly over 10 years of data, whilst the current data releases represent only a fraction of that timescale (DR3, 34 months). The longer baseline improves the quality of astrometric fits, lowering the noise floor and making consistently bad fits (for example, due to binarity) more apparent. In this paper, we use simulated binaries from the Gaia Universe Model to examine the long-term astrometric behaviour of single stars and stellar binaries. We calculate nominal upper limits on the spread of goodness of astrometric fits for well-behaved single stars. Specifically, for the RUWE parameter, for upcoming DR4 ($\rm RUWE_{lim}=1.15$) and DR5 ($\rm RUWE_{lim}=1.11$), using the full mission nominal scanning law. These can be used to identify poor astrometric fits, and in particular can flag potential binary systems. We show the increase in the number and type of binaries detectable through RUWE. With our updated RUWE thresholds, the number of detectable low-period binaries increases by 5-10% with each subsequent data release, suggesting detections may be possible for orbital periods down to days. The number of detectable long-period systems increases by 10-20%, with periods up to 100 years, causing significant deviations in low moderate-eccentricity binaries. Very eccentric systems with much longer periods (thousands of years) can still be detected if they pass through periapse during the observing window. Finally, we compare our results to the analytic estimate for the spread in UWE, which we predict from a $\chi$-distribution moderated by the number of observations. These agree with our inferred population limits but suggest that we may be biased by a small number of poorly sampled systems. In regions of the sky that are more frequently observed, lower limits could be employed, potentially bringing even more binaries above the threshold for detectability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anisotropy ansatz for the Jeans equations: oblate galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.02547]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the solution of the Jeans equations for axisymmetric galaxy models the “$b$-ansatz&quot; is often adopted to prescribe the relation between the vertical and radial components of the velocity dispersion tensor, and close the equations. However, $b$ affects the resulting azimuthal velocity fields quite indirectly, so that the analysis of the model kinematics is usually performed after numerically solving the Jeans equations, a time consuming approach. In a previous work we presented a general method to determine the main properties of the kinematical fields resulting in the $b$-ansatz framework before solving the Jeans equations; results were illustrated by means of disk galaxy models. In this paper we focus more specifically on realistic ellipsoidal galaxy models. It is found that how and where $b$ affects the galaxy kinematical fields is mainly dependent on the flattening of the stellar density distribution, moderately on the presence of a Dark Matter halo, and much less on the specific galaxy density profile. The main trends revealed by the numerical exploration, in particular the fact that more flattened systems can support larger $b$-anisotropy, are explained with the aid of simple ellipsoidal galaxy models, for which most of the analysis can be conducted analytically. The obtained results can be adopted as guidelines for model building and in the interpretation of observational data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02665" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benchmarking differential reddening in front of globular clusters</a><span class="id">[2511.02665]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interstellar extinction is a major obstacle in determining accurate stellar parameters from photometry near the Galactic disk. It is especially true for globular clusters at low galactic latitudes, which suffer from significant amounts of, and spatially variable reddening. Although differential reddening maps are available for tens of clusters, establishing and validating the absolute zero point of relative maps is a challenge. In this study, we present a new approach to determine and evaluate absolute reddening zero-points for Galactic globular clusters by combining three-dimensional reddening maps with Gaia DR3 RR Lyrae data. As a first case study, we investigate the low-latitude globular cluster M9. We compare the Gaia photometry and color data of the cluster member RR Lyrae stars to field RR Lyrae stars with accurate parallaxes and whose photometric metallicities match that of M9, as well as to theoretical models. We calculate the dereddened Gaia colors for the M9 stars based on three zero points. We confirm that the original SFD map appears to be overcorrecting the reddening for at least some RR Lyrae stars, albeit not excessively. In contrast, the 3D Bayestar map and the recalibrated version of the SFD map provide physically plausible reddenings, which we accept as lower and upper limits for M9, respectively. Our results provide a physically motivated reddening range for M9, and outline a methodology that can be directly extended to other globular clusters that are accessible to the Gaia mission, and to other multicolor sky surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The effect of mass and morphology on the mass assembly of galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.02715]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The pace at which galaxies grew into their current stellar masses and how this growth is regulated is still not fully understood, nor is the role that morphology plays in this process. We applied full spectral fitting techniques with pyPipe3D to the MaNGA sample to obtain its star formation and stellar mass histories and used these to investigate the mass assembly of galaxies by measuring how their specific star formation correlates to their stellar mass at different look-back times. We find that the correlation between these two parameters was shallower in the past. Galaxies used to have similar mass doubling times and the current negative correlation between the specific star formation and M* is primarily due to more massive galaxies 'dropping' off the main sequence earlier than less massive ones. Additionally, selecting the galaxies into bins based on their present-day morphology shows a segregation in specific star formation rate (sSFR) that is maintained even at high look-back times, showing that the factors that determine which morphology a galaxy ends up in are in place at very early times. Similarly, selecting them based on their current star formation status shows that, on average, currently retired galaxies used to have slightly a higher sSFR before the drop-off, whereas galaxies that have continued to form stars until today had a lower sSFR initially. We compare our results to a set of cosmic surveys, finding partial agreement in our results with several of them, though with significant offsets in redshift. Finally, we discuss how our results fit with certain theoretical models on galaxy evolution as well as cosmological simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring the expansion history of the Universe with DESI Cosmic Chronometers</a><span class="id">[2511.02730]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Studying large samples of massive, passively evolving galaxies (called cosmic chronometers, CC) provides us with the unique ability to measure the Universe's expansion history without assuming a cosmological model.

We used nine well resolved star-forming z&lt;1 galaxies from the UVCANDELS survey, where a total of 10 HST bands including UV follow up in UVIS/F275W allow us to reconstruct the star formation histories (SFHs) of regions across each galaxy. This approach provides a powerful tool to explore the spatio-temporal connection between star formation and galaxy evolution. The spatial and temporal profiles of stellar mass and star formation rate surface density were obtained from the SFHs of these regions. We measure scaling relations and projected radial profiles of regions within each galaxy at the time of observation and at 1 Gyr lookback time, noting possible trends in the evolution. By comparing the change in star formation over time we can infer the timing and location of star formation and see early signs of star formation shut off before quenching occurs. We compared the star formation rate density – stellar mass density scaling relations for individual galaxies as they evolve from 1 Gyr lookback time. The correlation lines pivot around a log-stellar mass surface density of 7.25 [$M_\odot$ $kpc^{-2}$] may be evidence of a self-regulating process on these scales. Radial profiles of galaxy Log sSFR show an overall decrease over 1 Gyr, but five galaxies show a greater change in Log sSFR at the outskirts than the center indicating a possible early onset of quenching in these galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02355" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signatures of a Schwarzschild-like Black Hole Immersed in Dark Matter Halo</a><span class="id">[2511.02355]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Astrophysical black holes are often surrounded by dark matter, which can influence their dynamics and observational signatures.

We demonstrate that a single encounter with a 2-50 Jupiter-mass object, passing through the solar system at a perihelion distance less than 20 AU and a hyperbolic excess velocity of 1-3 km/s, can excite the giant planets' eccentricities and mutual inclinations to values comparable to those observed. We describe a metric to evaluate how closely a simulated flyby system matches the eccentricity and inclination secular modes of the solar system. We estimate that there is about a 1-in-9000 chance that such a flyby occurs during the solar system's residence in its primordial cluster and produces a dynamical architecture similar to that of the solar system. The scenario of an ancient close encounter with a substellar object offers a plausible explanation for the origin of the moderate eccentricities and inclinations and the secular architecture of the planets.

We present a simple radiative transfer model for spatially resolved galactic H$\alpha$ emission, which includes emission from the warm-hot diffuse interstellar medium. The atomic level populations are in steady-state and computed in the coronal approximation. The model is applied to multiple IllustrisTNG simulations in the redshift range $1\leq z \leq 2$ to produce the luminosity function (LF) and the halo occupation distribution (HOD). Collisional processes account for a significant fraction of $\approx 40\%$ of the total ${\rm H}\alpha$ luminosity ($L_{{\rm H}\alpha}$). Our LFs are in reasonable agreement with measurements from H$\alpha$ surveys if a uniform extinction of $0.3&lt;A_{{\rm H}\alpha}&lt;0.85$ mag is assumed. Our HOD is consistent with that of the ${\it Euclid}$ Flagship galaxy mock up to differences that can be attributed to baryonic feedback, which is absent from the latter. When H$\alpha$ luminosities are computed from an empirical relation between $L_{{\rm H}\alpha}$ and the total star formation rate (SFR) the resulting LFs are in tension with previous observations.

We simulate the physical conditions in the blazar and show that the observed SEDs are well reproduced in the framework of a &quot;standing feature&quot; where the position of the emitting region is almost stationary, located beyond the outer radius of the broad-line region and into which fresh blobs of relativistically moving magnetised plasma are continuously injected. Meanwhile, a model with a single &quot;moving blob&quot; does not describe the data well. We obtain a robust upper limit to the amount of high-energy protons in the jet of 3C 454.3 from the electromagnetic SED. We construct a neutrino light curve of 3C 454.3 and estimate the expected neutrino yield at energies $\geq 100$ TeV for 3C 454.3 to be up to $6 \times 10^{-3}$ $\nu_{\mu}$ per year.

The nature of these sources, called `little red dots' (LRDs), is still debated, as it is unclear if they host active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their number seems to drastically drop at z&lt;4. We take advantage of the $63 °^2$ covered by the quick Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) to extend the search for LRDs to brighter magnitudes and to lower redshifts than what has been possible with JWST. The selection is performed by fitting the available photometric data (Euclid, the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC), and ground-based $griz$ data) with two power laws, to retrieve both the rest-frame optical and UV slopes consistently over a large redshift range (i.e, z&lt;7.6). We exclude extended objects and possible line emitters, and perform a careful visual inspection to remove any imaging artefacts. The final selection includes 3341 LRD candidates at z=0.33-3.6, with 29 detected also in IRAC. The resulting rest-frame UV luminosity function, in contrast with previous JWST studies, shows that the number density of LRD candidates increases from high-z down to z=1.5-2.5 and decreases at lower z. However, less evolution is apparent focusing on the subsample of more robust LRD candidates having IRAC detections, which however has low statistics and limited by the IRAC resolution. The comparison with previous quasar (QSO) UV luminosity functions shows that LRDs are not the dominant AGN population at z&lt;4 and $M_{\rm UV}&lt;-21$. Follow-up studies of these LRD candidates are pivotal to confirm their nature, probe their physical properties and check for their compatibility with JWST sources, given the different spatial resolution and wavelength coverage of Euclid and JWST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling the Ionized and Neutral ISM at z &gt; 10 : The Origin of [O III] /[C II] Ratios from a Sub-parsec Resolution Radiative Transfer Simulation</a><span class="id">[2505.12397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent multi-wavelength observations by JWST and ALMA are unveiling both ionized and neutral ISM components in high-redshift ($z&gt;6$) galaxies. In this work, we investigate the origin of rest-frame far-infrared [OIII]88 $\mu$m and [CII]158 $\mu$m emission by performing zoom-in cosmological simulations of dwarf-galaxy progenitors at $z=9-13$. Our simulations incorporate on-the-fly radiative transfer at sub-pc ($\sim$ 0.1 pc) resolution, allowing us to resolve the multi-phase ISM. We compute emission lines on a cell-by-cell basis, taking into account local temperature, density, metallicity, radiation field strength, column density, and spectral hardness of radiation bins. We find that [OIII] predominantly arises from centrally located ionizing bubbles with temperatures of $\sim (1-5)\times 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$ and high ionization parameters of $\log U_{\mathrm{ion}} \simeq -1.5$. In contrast, [CII] is produced in the surrounding dense neutral regions at $\sim 5\times 10^3\,\mathrm{K}$, which are heated by strong FUV radiation ($G/G_0 \sim 10^{3-5}$) from the central stellar clusters. This spatial arrangement leads to large local variations in [OIII]/[CII], ranging from $\sim$ 100 to 0.01. Our galaxy reproduces the global ratio [OIII]/[CII]$\sim5-30$, consistent with recent ALMA detections at $z&gt;6$ without invoking enhanced O/C abundance ratios. We further derive that [OIII]/[CII] linearly scales with the mass and density ratios of ionized to neutral gas, $M_{\rm HII}/M_{\rm HI}$ and $n_{\rm HII}/n_{\rm HI}$ and show that the [OIII]/[CII] ratio typically changes from 5.7 to 0.3 from high-z to low-z. For future synergies of JWST and ALMA, we derived $M_{\rm HII}/M_{\rm HI}$ for observed $z &gt;6$ galaxies using ${\rm H}\beta$ and [CII] and show the validity of our scaling relations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Matter Density Profile Around a Newborn First Star</a><span class="id">[2505.17828]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ambient dark matter (DM) around binary black holes can imprint characteristic signatures on gravitational waves emitted from their merger.

Our flagship model achieves a DM particle mass of $3.7\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot$ and resolves the inner-most structure down to $0.02\,$pc. We show that the halo experiences a two-stage gravitational collapse, where a rotating, constant-density core with $r\lesssim3\,$pc is formed first, surrounded by an extended outskirts. Baryonic infall toward the center continues to raise the local Keplerian velocity and promotes adiabatic contraction of DM. The resulting density profile has an approximately power-law shape of $\rho_{\rm dm} \propto r^{-0.6}$ inside $\sim\!1\,$ this http URL find that a piecewise power-law fit reproduces the simulation result to better than 10\%, and also find numerical convergence down to $\simeq\!0.01\,$pc.

Using single-fibre spectroscopy from the SAMI Cluster Redshift Survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we trace SF activity across the cluster sample by identifying the star-forming galaxy (SFG) population based on spectral features. We find a mild enhancement in the star-forming galaxy fraction ($f_{SFG}$) in merging clusters, although not statistically significant. The spatial and projected phase-space distributions show that SFGs in merging clusters are well-mixed with the passive population, while galaxy populations exhibit a clear segregation in the relaxed clusters. Analysis of the equivalent width of the $\rm H\alpha$ line, as a tracer of recent SF activity, does not reveal strong evidence of triggered SF activity as a function of dynamical state for both the global cluster environment and subsamples of galaxies selected near possible merger features.

However, they are not available for distant stars. Instead, we focused on the nearest massive stars in the Orion Belt. We obtained VLTI interferometric observations of Orion Belt stars and calibrated visibility data from the GRAVITY and PIONIER instruments. Additionally, we obtained spectroscopic data from the CFHT and CTIO observatories. For modelling, we used a modified version of PHOEBE2, extended with new interferometric and spectroscopic modules. To describe non-spherical, rotating, or Roche-like stars, integrals over triangular meshes have to be computed, using extensive grids of synthetic spectra. For fitting, we used the simplex algorithm and chi2 mapping of the parameter space. In this paper, we present single-star models of the B0Ia supergiant eps Ori. Interferometric visibilities indicate that the star is not spherical but rotating close to its critical velocity. The preferred distance, d=(384+-8)pc, corresponds to the median of distances for the Orion OB1b association. We obtained the following parameters: m=(28.4+-2.0)Msol, R=(27.6+-1.5)Rsol, Teff=25000 K, i=45deg, longitude of the ascending node, Omega=300deg, and Prot=4.3+1.0d. This compromise model provides a reasonable fit to wind-free Balmer line profiles, but there is still some tension between interferometric and spectroscopic datasets, corresponding to a faster- vs. slower-rotating star. Our fast-rotating model implies that circumstellar matter should be naturally present, in the form of wind or disk, and contribute to continuum radiation. The fast rotation of eps Ori is compatible with a merger, formed from a multiple system of comparable mass, like del, zet or sig Ori.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hierarchical Dynamical State of Molecular Gas from 3 to 300 pc in NGC 253</a><span class="id">[2507.03744]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding how the dynamical state of the interstellar medium (ISM) changes across spatial scales can provide important insights into how the gas is organized and ultimately collapses to form stars.

We decompose this emission with a hierarchical, multiscale dendrogram algorithm to identify 2463 structures with deconvolved sizes ranging from $\sim3$ to $300$ pc, complete to a limiting mass of $10^4~M_\odot$. By comparing the virial parameter of these structures against physical properties including size, mass, surface density, velocity dispersion, and hierarchical position, we carry out a comprehensive search for a preferred scale at which gravitationally bound structures emerge. Ultimately, we do not identify evidence of an emergent scale for bound objects in our data, nor do we find a significant correlation between the virial parameter and structure sizes. These findings suggest that simple observational estimates of gravitational binding cannot be used to define molecular clouds and emphasize the need for multiscale approaches to characterize the ISM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Potential Impact of Primordial Black Holes on Exoplanet Systems</a><span class="id">[2507.05389]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The orbits of planetary systems can be deformed from their initial configurations due to close encounters with larger astrophysical bodies.

Detectable eccentricity provides a powerful diagnostic for distinguishing between different formation channels, but resolving their eccentricity distributions requires the detection of a large number of eccentric mergers. Future gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will detect tens of thousands of BBH mergers out to redshifts $z \ge 10$, making it critical to understand the redshift-dependent evolution of eccentricity distributions. We simulate this evolution for two key channels: dynamical assembly in globular clusters (GCs), which leads to rapid, eccentric mergers; and hierarchical triples in the field, where three-body dynamics can induce eccentricity in the inner binary. When considering all BBH mergers, the GC channel dominates overall, consistent with previous studies. However, when focusing on mergers with detectable eccentricity in next-generation detectors, we find that hierarchical triples dominate the eccentric merger rate at $0\le z \le 4$, with GC mergers becoming competitive at higher redshifts. Across all model variations, eccentric mergers in the local Universe ($z\lesssim 1$) have significant contributions from field triples, challenging the common view that such systems primarily form in dense environments. We show that, regardless of cluster and stellar evolution uncertainties, hierarchical triples contribute at least 30 per cent of eccentric mergers across a large range of redshifts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bursting at the seams: the star-forming main sequence and its scatter at z=3-9 using NIRCam photometry from JADES</a><span class="id">[2508.04410]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive study of the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) and its scatter at redshifts $3 \leq z \leq 9$, using NIRCam photometry from the JADES survey in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields. Our analysis is based on a sample of galaxies that is stellar mass complete down to $\log \left(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\right) \approx 8.1$. The redshift evolution of the SFMS at an averaging timescale of 10 Myr follows a relation, quantified by the specific star-formation rates (sSFR$_{10}$), of $\mathrm{sSFR}\propto(1+z)^{\mu}$ with $\mu = 2.30^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$, in good agreement with theoretical predictions and the specific mass accretion rate of dark matter halos. We find that the SFMS normalisation varies in a complex way with the SFR averaging timescale, reflecting the combined effects of bursty star formation and rising star formation histories (SFHs). We quantify the scatter of the SFMS, revealing that it decreases with longer SFR averaging timescales, from $\sigma_{\rm{int}} \approx 0.4-0.5~\mathrm{dex}$ at 10 Myr to $\sigma_{\rm{int}} \approx 0.2~\mathrm{dex}$ at 100 Myr, indicating that shorter-term fluctuations dominate the scatter, although long-term variations in star formation activity are also present. Our findings suggest that bursty SFHs are more pronounced at lower stellar masses. Furthermore, we explore the implications of our results for the observed over-abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$, concluding that additional mechanisms, such as top-heavy initial mass functions, increased star-formation efficiencies, or increased burstiness in star formation are needed to explain these observations. Finally, we emphasize the importance of accurate stellar mass completeness limits when fitting the SFMS, especially for galaxies with bursty SFHs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The changing look of the neutrino-emitter blazar candidate 5BZQ J1243+4043</a><span class="id">[2509.17211]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In recent years, changing-look blazars have called the traditional view of BL Lacs-flat spectrum radio quasars into question within the empirical classification of blazars. Based on the intensity of optical lines, they appear to transition between the two classes over time. We focus on the blazar 5BZQ J1243+4043, recently proposed as a promising candidate for the emission of high-energy neutrinos observed by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and reported as a changing-look blazar in the literature. We study the spectral properties of this blazar, inferring its radiation field and accretion regime across different epochs. This study presents new optical spectroscopy observations of 5BZQ J1243+4043 taken with Gran Telescopio Canarias. We used this new dataset and two optical spectra available from the literature to investigate the continuum and line emissions and pinpoint the physical properties of the source. In particular, we used the emission lines to probe the accretion regime. The newly collected data for 5BZQ J1243+4043 shows broad emission lines, consistent with the spectrum of the first epoch and the redshift z = 1.5181$\pm$0.0002 known from the literature. For the second epoch, the spectrum appears featureless and so, we placed limits on the emission lines and related properties. We observed spectral variability for both the continuum and line emissions among the three spectra. Nonetheless, the accretion properties of the blazar generally remain unvaried, indicating that the intrinsic physics stays the same across the three epochs. In the broader multi-messenger context, this suggests that, despite the changing look in the optical band, the candidate neutrino-emitter blazar 5BZQ J1243+4043 is still characterized by the presence of intense external radiation fields and radiatively efficient accretion, typical of high-excitation radio galaxies, which may foster neutrino production.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</a><span class="id">[2510.07534]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We review the state of the evidence for the existence and observational appearance of supermassive black hole binaries. Such objects are expected from standard hierarchical galaxy evolution to form after two galaxies, each containing a supermassive black hole, have merged, in the centre of the merger remnant. A complex interaction is predicted to take place with stars and gas in the host galaxy, leading to observable signatures in weakly as well as actively accreting phases. Direct observational evidence is available and shows examples of dual active galactic nuclei from kpc scales down to parsec scales. Signatures of possibly closer supermassive black hole binaries may be seen in jetted black holes. The interaction with stars and gas in a galaxy significantly affects the hardening of the binary and hence contributes to uncertainties of the expected gravitational wave signal. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should in the future detect actual mergers. Before the launch of LISA, pulsar timing arrays may have the best chance to detect a gravitational wave signal from supermassive black hole binaries.

In this study, we analyze the dynamics of the Centaurus A (CenA) and M83 galaxies, along with their associated dwarf companions identified via Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance measurements, to constrain both the group mass and the local value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$). By examining the motions of these galaxies relative to the system's barycenter, we apply both the minor and major infall models, which provide bounds on the true radial velocity dispersion. From the overlap of these approaches, we obtain a virial mass estimate of $(7.3 \pm 2.0) \times 10^{12}\,M_{\odot}$ and a Hubble flow-based mass of $(2.6 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{12}\,M_{\odot}$. Modeling the cold Hubble flow around the group center of mass yields a corresponding Hubble constant of $(64.0 \pm 4.6)\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. These results offer an independent, dynamically motivated constraint on the local value of $H_0$, explicitly accounting for the impact of peculiar velocities in the nearby Universe. We also discuss the $\sim 2\sigma$ tension between the virial and Hubble flow-based mass estimates, which likely arises from the proximity of M83 to the velocity surface, breaking the assumptions of the Hubble flow model. While the Hubble flow fit emphasizes galaxies that follow smooth expansion on the lower branch of the velocity-distance relation, the virial mass estimate is in good agreement with the group mass derived from the $K$-band luminosity of its brightest members and from projected mass methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey compact source catalogue</a><span class="id">[2510.23707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a catalogue of compact sources detected in the SARAO MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS).

Two competing theories for its origin have emerged, positing the gas to be primordial or secondary. Primordial gas survives from the belt's parent protoplanetary disk and is therefore H$_2$-rich. Secondary gas is outgassed \textit{in-situ} by exocomets and is relatively H$_2$-poor. Discriminating between these scenarios has not been possible for belts hosting unexpectedly large quantities of CO. We aim to break this gas origin dichotomy \textit{via} direct measurement of H$_2$ column densities in two edge-on CO-rich exocometary belts around $\sim$15 Myr-old A-type stars, constraining the $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratio and CO gas lifetimes. Observing edge-on belts enables rovibrational absorption spectroscopy against the stellar background. We present near-IR CRIRES+ spectra of HD 110058 and HD 131488 which provide the first direct probe of H$_2$ gas in CO-rich exocometary belts. We target the H$_2$ (v=1-0 S(0)) line at 2223.3 nm and and the $^{12}$CO $v=2\rightarrow0$ rovibrational lines in the range 2333.8-2335.5 nm and derive constraints on column densities along the line-of-sight to the stars. We strongly detect $^{12}$CO but not H$_2$ in the CRIRES+ spectra. This allows us to place $3\sigma$ lower limits on the $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratios of $&gt; 1.35 \times 10^{-3}$ and $&gt; 3.09 \times 10^{-5}$ for HD 110058 and HD 131488 respectively. These constraints demonstrate that at least for HD 110058, the exocometary gas is compositionally distinct and significantly H$_2$-poor, compared to the $&lt;10^{-4}$ $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratios typical of protoplanetary disks. We also find H$_2$ alone is unlikely to shield CO over the lifetime of the systems. Overall this suggests that the gas in CO-rich belts is most likely not primordial in origin, supporting the presence of exocometary gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistical properties of the gravitational force through ordering statistics</a><span class="id">[2201.08478]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the statistical distribution of Newtonian gravitational forces acting on a test particle embedded in an infinite, homogeneous, and uncorrelated random gas of particles.

Standard PTA analyses assign fixed uniform noise priors to each pulsar, an approach that can introduce systematic biases when combining the array. To overcome this limitation, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling strategy in which noise priors are parametrized by higher-level hyperparameters. We further address the challenge posed by the correlations between hyperparameters and physical noise parameters, focusing on those describing red noise and dispersion measure variations. To decorrelate these quantities, we introduce an orthogonal reparametrization of the hierarchical model implemented with Normalizing Flows. We also employ i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to efficiently explore the resulting higher-dimensional parameter space. We apply our method to a minimal 3-pulsar case study, performing a simultaneous inference of noise and SGWB parameters. Despite the limited dataset, the results consistently show that the hierarchical treatment constrains the noise parameters more tightly and partially alleviates the red-noise-SGWB degeneracy, while the orthogonal reparametrization further enhances parameter independence without affecting the correlations intrinsic to the power-law modeling of the physical processes involved.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermal and Electrical Properties of Prototype Readout Components for CMB-S4</a><span class="id">[2511.02173]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>CMB-S4 is the fourth-generation ground-based cosmic microwave background project, designed to probe the early universe and cosmic inflation.

These results establish the feasibility of a fully integrated, GPU-accelerated single-pulse search stack, capable of scaling to the data volumes expected from upcoming large-scale surveys.

It shows that TCL is the best option to be used as practical time reference on the Moon, without the need to define a new time scale based on a scaling of TCL.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02756" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Development of Silicon Micromachined Waveguide Filter-Banks for On-Chip Spectrometers</a><span class="id">[2511.02756]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Development of high-speed, spatial-mapping spectrometers in the millimeter and far-infrared frequencies would enable entirely new research avenues in astronomy and cosmology. An &quot;on-chip&quot; spectrometer is one such technology that could enable Line Intensity Mapping. Recent work has shown the promise of high-speed imaging; however, a limiting factor is that many of these devices suffer from low optical efficiency. Here we present the fabrication of a metalized, Si waveguide filter-bank fabricated using deep reactive ion etching for use in millimeter spectroscopy. Our design simultaneously provides high-density pixel packing, high optical efficiency, high spectral resolution, and is readily compatible with simple and multiplexable MKID arrays. Gold plated test waveguide and filter show excellent match to simulations with a measured resolving power of 263 and a loss quality factor of 1116 at room temperature. The results show promise for extending the measurements to larger, multi-wavelength designs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02798" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visualization of High Dynamic Range Solar Imagery and the Radial Histogram Equalizing Filter</a><span class="id">[2511.02798]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Standard visualizations of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) solar imagery often fail to convey the full complexity of the Sun's corona, especially in faint off-limb regions. This can leave the misleading impression of the Sun as a bright ball in a dark void, rather than revealing it as the dynamic, structured source of the solar wind and space weather. A variety of enhancement algorithms have been developed to address this challenge, each with its own strengths and tradeoffs. We introduce the Radial Histogram Equalizing Filter (RHEF), a novel hybrid technique that optimizes contrast in high dynamic range solar images. By combining the spatial awareness of radial graded filters with the perceptual benefits of histogram equalization, RHEF reveals faint coronal structures and works out of the box – without requiring careful parameter tuning or prior dataset characterization. RHEF operates independently on each frame, and it enhances on-disk and off-limb features uniformly across the field of view. For additional control, we also present the Upsilon redistribution function – a symmetrized cousin of gamma correction – as an optional post-processing step that provides intuitive programmatic tonal compression. We benchmark RHEF against established methods and offer guidance on filter selection across various applications, with examples from multiple solar instruments provided in an appendix. Implemented and available in both Python sunkit_image and IDL, RHEF enables immediate improvements in solar coronal visualization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computing the Full Earth System at 1 km Resolution</a><span class="id">[2511.02021]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first-ever global simulation of the full Earth system at \qty{1.25}{\kilo\meter} grid spacing, achieving highest time compression with an unseen number of degrees of freedom.

This uncertainty affects estimates of parameter means and credible intervals in gravitational wave analyses and beyond, and yet, it is typically not accounted for in standard uncertainty estimation methods. In this paper, we present two novel methods to quantify this uncertainty more accurately for any chain based nested sampler, using the additional likelihood calls made at runtime in producing independent samples. Using injected signals of black hole binary coalescences as an example, we first show concretely that the usual uncertainty estimation method is insufficient to capture the true error bar on parameter estimates. We then demonstrate how the extra points in the chains of chain based samplers may be carefully utilised to estimate this uncertainty correctly, and provide a way to check the accuracy of the resulting error bars. Finally, we discuss how this uncertainty affects $p$-$p$ plots and coverage assessments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accelerated nested sampling with posterior repartitioning and $β$-flows for gravitational waves</a><span class="id">[2411.17663]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There is an ever-growing need in the gravitational wave community for fast and reliable inference methods, accompanied by an informative error bar. Nested sampling satisfies the last two requirements, but its computational cost can become prohibitive when using the most accurate waveform models. In this paper, we demonstrate the acceleration of nested sampling using a technique called posterior repartitioning. This method leverages nested sampling's unique ability to separate prior and likelihood contributions at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we define a `repartitioned prior' informed by the posterior from a low-resolution run. To construct this repartitioned prior, we use a $\beta$-flow, a novel type of conditional normalizing flow designed to better learn deep tail probabilities. $\beta$-flows are trained on the entire nested sampling run and conditioned on an inverse temperature $\beta$. Applying our methods to simulated and real binary black hole mergers, we demonstrate how they can reduce the number of likelihood evaluations required for a given evidence precision by up to an order of magnitude, enabling faster model comparison and parameter estimation. Furthermore, we highlight the robustness of using $\beta$-flows over standard normalizing flows for posterior repartitioning. Notably, $\beta$-flows are able to recover posteriors and evidences which are generally consistent with those from traditional nested sampling, even in cases where standard normalizing flows fail.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrahMap: A scalable and modular map-making framework for the CMB experiments</a><span class="id">[2501.16122]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments have reached an era of unprecedented precision and complexity. Aiming to detect the primordial B-mode polarization signal, these experiments will soon be equipped with $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ detectors. Consequently, future CMB missions will face the substantial challenge of efficiently processing vast amounts of raw data to produce the initial scientific outputs - the sky maps - within a reasonable time frame and with available computational resources. To address this, we introduce BrahMap, a new map-making framework that will be scalable across both CPU and GPU platforms. Implemented in C++ with a user-friendly Python interface for handling sparse linear systems, BrahMap employs advanced numerical analysis and high-performance computing techniques to maximize the use of super-computing infrastructure.

In this paper, we present Astromer 2 a foundational model specifically designed for extracting light curve embeddings. We introduce Astromer 2 as an enhanced iteration of our self-supervised model for light curve analysis. This paper highlights the advantages of its pre-trained embeddings, compares its performance with that of its predecessor, Astromer 1, and provides a detailed empirical analysis of its capabilities, offering deeper insights into the model's representations. Astromer 2 is pretrained on 1.5 million single-band light curves from the MACHO survey using a self-supervised learning task that predicts randomly masked observations within sequences. Fine-tuning on a smaller labeled dataset allows us to assess its performance in classification tasks. The quality of the embeddings is measured by the F1 score of an MLP classifier trained on Astromer-generated embeddings. Our results demonstrate that Astromer 2 significantly outperforms Astromer 1 across all evaluated scenarios, including limited datasets of 20, 100, and 500 samples per class. The use of weighted per-sample embeddings, which integrate intermediate representations from Astromer's attention blocks, is particularly impactful. Notably, Astromer 2 achieves a 15% improvement in F1 score on the ATLAS dataset compared to prior models, showcasing robust generalization to new datasets. This enhanced performance, especially with minimal labeled data, underscores the potential of Astromer 2 for more efficient and scalable light curve analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14825" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MadVoro: Parallel Construction of Voronoi Diagrams in Distributed Memory Systems</a><span class="id">[2502.14825]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Voronoi diagrams are essential geometrical structures with numerous applications, particularly astrophysics-driven finite volume methods. While serial algorithms for constructing these entities are well-established, parallel construction remains challenging. This is especially true in distributed memory systems, where each host manages only a subset of the input points. This process requires redistributing points across hosts and accurately computing the corresponding Voronoi cells. In this paper, we introduce a new distributed construction algorithm, which is implemented in our open-source C++ 3-dimensional Voronoi construction framework. Our approach leverages Delaunay triangulation as an intermediate step, which is then transformed into a Voronoi diagram. We introduce the algorithms we implemented for the precise construction and our load-balancing approach and compare the running time with other state-of-the-art frameworks. MadVoro is a versatile tool that can be applied in various scientific domains, such as mesh decomposition, computational physics, chemistry, and machine learning.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20479" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leveraging pre-trained vision Transformers for multi-band photometric light curve classification</a><span class="id">[2502.20479]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study investigates the potential of a pre-trained vision Transformer (VT) model, specifically the Swin Transformer V2 (SwinV2), to classify photometric light curves without the need for feature extraction or multi-band preprocessing. The goal is to assess whether this image-based approach can accurately differentiate astronomical phenomena and serve as a viable option for working with multi-band photometric light curves. We transformed each multi-band light curve into an image. These images serve as input to the SwinV2 model, which is pre-trained on ImageNet-21K. The datasets employed include the public Catalog of Variable Stars from the Massive Compact Halo Object (MACHO) survey, using both one and two bands, and the first round of the recent Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), which includes six bands. The performance of the model was evaluated on six classes for the MACHO dataset and 20 distinct classes of variable stars and transient events for the ELAsTiCC dataset. The fine-tuned SwinV2 achieved better performance than models specifically designed for light curves, such as Astromer and the Astronomical Transformer for Time Series and Tabular Data (ATAT). When trained on the full MACHO dataset, it attained a macro F1-score of 80.2 and outperformed Astromer in single-band experiments. Incorporating a second band further improved performance, increasing the F1-score to 84.1. In the ELAsTiCC dataset, SwinV2 achieved a macro F1-score of 65.5, slightly surpassing ATAT by 1.3.</p></div></details></article></body>
