<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05129" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermal stability originates the vanishing of the specific heats at the absolute zero</a><span class="id">[2512.05129]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The relationship between the vanishing of the heat capacities as $T\to0^+$ and the thermal stability is examined. The heat capacities vanish as fast as or faster than $T$ as $T\to0^+$ for states at the phase space boundary ($T=0$) to sustain the standard thermal stability criterion $U_{ss}&gt;0$. Conversely, weakly vanishing heat capacities, which signify a loss of curvature in $U(S)$ at $T=0$, are the signature of a critical condition precisely at $T=0$, as exemplified in marginal Fermi liquids. Therefore, the vanishing of the specific heat should be viewed not as a new law but as a confirmatory result of the existing framework of thermodynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revised comment on the paper titled &quot;The Origin of Quantum Mechanical Statistics: Insights from Research on Human Language</a><span class="id">[2512.07881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This short note comments on \citet{Aerts2024Origin}, which proposes that ranked word frequencies in texts should be read through the lens of Bose–Einstein (BE) statistics and even used to illuminate the origin of quantum statistics in physics. The core message here is modest: the paper offers an interesting analogy and an eye-catching fit, but several key steps mix physical claims with definitions and curve-fitting choices. We highlight three such points: (i) a normalization issue that is presented as &quot;bosonic enhancement&quot;, (ii) an identification of rank with energy that makes the BE fit only weakly diagnostic of an underlying mechanism, and (iii) a baseline comparison that is too weak to support an ontological conclusion. We also briefly flag a few additional concerns (interpretation drift, parameter semantics, and reproducibility).</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08297" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optics experiments as a tool for developing critical thinking in physics education</a><span class="id">[2512.08297]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Experimental activities are an essential part of physics education. In addition to conveying scientific knowledge, they play a significant role in developing scientific literacy, inquiry skills, and critical thinking. In today's world, where students are exposed to vast amounts of information of varying quality, the ability to analyse, evaluate, and interpret information correctly has become increasingly important. This paper presents a series of physics experiments in the field of optics, specifically designed to foster critical thinking at various stages of the inquiry process. The topic of optics was chosen deliberately, as many optical phenomena occur naturally in everyday life, are familiar to students, and stimulate their curiosity. At the same time, they provide space for formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, interpreting data, and evaluating alternative explanations. Each experiment begins with a real-life problem situation that students are expected to explore and resolve through their own investigative work. The tasks are structured to encourage discussion, require argumentation, and promote reflection on both the process and the outcomes. The proposed experiments are suitable for students at both primary and secondary school levels and can be implemented in formal as well as non-formal educational settings. The aim of this contribution is to demonstrate how well-designed and pedagogically grounded experiments can not only enhance the understanding of physical concepts but also systematically develop critical thinking skills - one of the key competencies of 21st-century education.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report on the Scoping Workshop on AI in Science Education Research 2025</a><span class="id">[2511.14318]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This report summarizes the outcomes of a two-day international scoping workshop on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in science education research. As AI rapidly reshapes scientific practice, classroom learning, and research methods, the field faces both new opportunities and significant challenges. The report clarifies key AI concepts to reduce ambiguity and reviews evidence of how AI influences scientific work, teaching practices, and disciplinary learning. It identifies how AI intersects with major areas of science education research, including curriculum development, assessment, epistemic cognition, inclusion, and teacher professional development, highlighting cases where AI can support human reasoning and cases where it may introduce risks to equity or validity. The report also examines how AI is transforming methodological approaches across quantitative, qualitative, ethnographic, and design-based traditions, giving rise to hybrid forms of analysis that combine human and computational strengths. To guide responsible integration, a systems-thinking heuristic is introduced that helps researchers consider stakeholder needs, potential risks, and ethical constraints. The report concludes with actionable recommendations for training, infrastructure, and standards, along with guidance for funders, policymakers, professional organizations, and academic departments. The goal is to support principled and methodologically sound use of AI in science education research.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07924" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microlensing Signatures of Dyson Sphere-like Structures around Primordial Black Holes as Technosignatures of Extraterrestrial Advanced Civilizations</a><span class="id">[2512.07924]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the microlensing detectability of extraterrestrial technosignatures originating from Dyson sphere \textendash like structures, such as Dyson Swarms surrounding primordial black holes (PBHs). These hypothetical swarms consist of stochastically varying, partially opaque structures that could modulate standard microlensing light curves through time-dependent transmission effects. We introduce a probabilistic framework that includes a stochastic transmission model governed by variable optical depth and random gap distributions. We perform a parameter scan and generate heatmaps of the optical transit duration. We study the infrared excess radiation and peak emission wavelength as complementary observational signatures. Additionally, we define and analyze the effective optical depth and the anomalous microlensing event rate for these stochastic structures. Our findings provide a new avenue for searching for extraterrestrial advanced civilizations by extending microlensing studies to include artificial, dynamic modulation signatures.</p></div></details></article></body>
