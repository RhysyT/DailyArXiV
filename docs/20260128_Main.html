Here we derive a population-agnostic scaling law that places an absolute energetic ceiling on stochastic backgrounds across the entire GW frequency spectrum, from nanoHertz to kilohertz. We apply this framework to bound the backgrounds from supermassive black hole binaries, intermediate-mass black hole captures by supermassive black holes in AGN disks, extreme mass-ratio inspirals, binary neutron stars, Population III remnants, and stellar-mass binary black holes. We find that the energetic ceiling for supermassive black hole binaries is $A \leq 1.6^{+0.3}_{-0.3} \times 10^{-15}$ at a reference frequency of $1\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This astrophysical GWB ceiling is within $1\sigma$ with the GWB amplitude reported by NANOGrav, EPTA, and PPTA, implying that the current observed signal is consistent with being powered by a population of ultramassive black holes ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 10^{10}\,M_\odot$). Finally, we demonstrate that the total astrophysical background from all channels combined cannot exceed $\Omega_{\rm gw} \sim 10^{-7}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18862" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redshift-space 21-cm bispectrum multipoles as an SKA-era gravity test in the post-reionization Universe</a><span class="id">[2601.18862]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The redshifted 21-cm line from neutral hydrogen ($\textrm{H}\textsc{i}$) enables volumetric intensity mapping of large-scale structure in the post-reionization Universe. In anticipation of \texttt{SKA-MID}'s wide redshift coverage and high signal-to-noise clustering measurements, we study the redshift-space 21-cm bispectrum and its spherical-harmonic multipoles as probes of anisotropic non-linear structure formation and departures from General Relativity. Using a tree-level perturbative description for the 21-cm brightness-temperature field in redshift space, and adopting the Hu–Sawicki $f(R)$ model as a representative modified-gravity scenario, we forecast the detectability of configuration-dependent signatures with an \texttt{SKA-MID}–like survey. We derive the bispectrum-multipole covariance including sample variance and thermal noise and evaluate the expected signal-to-noise of deviations relative to $\Lambda$CDM. We find that the observable information is dominated by the lowest multipoles, while higher-order modes are strongly suppressed. This concentration in the lowest multipoles is well matched to \texttt{SKA-MID} sensitivity and to the quasi-linear modes that are expected to remain accessible in practice. The strongest modified-gravity sensitivity arises from squeezed and stretched triangle configurations on quasi-linear scales, where scale-dependent growth enhances the bispectrum relative to the total variance. Our results position 21-cm bispectrum multipoles as a practical, SKA-ready observable for testing gravity beyond $\Lambda$CDM in the post-reionization epoch.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18865" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Induced Scattering of Fast Radio Bursts in Magnetar Magnetospheres</a><span class="id">[2601.18865]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate induced Compton/Brillouin scattering of electromagnetic waves in magnetized electron and positron pair plasma by verifying kinetic theory with Particle-in-Cell simulations. Applying this to fast radio bursts (FRBs) in magnetar magnetospheres, we find that the scattering–although suppressed by the magnetic field–inevitably enters the linear growth stage. The subsequent evolution bifurcates: full scattering occurs when the density exceeds a critical value, whereas below it the scattering saturates and the FRB can escape. This eases the tension with observations of compact emission regions and may explain the observed diversity, including the presence or absence of FRBs associated with X-ray bursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18866" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniform Forward-Modeling Analysis of Ultracool Dwarfs. IV. Benchmarking the Sonora Diamondback and Saumon &amp; Marley (2008) Atmospheric Models Across Late-M, L, and T types with Low-Resolution 0.8-2.5 $μ$m Spectroscopy</a><span class="id">[2601.18866]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>(Abridged) We present a systematic assessment of two major cloudy atmospheric model grids – SM08 (Saumon &amp; Marley 2008) and Sonora Diamondback – when applied to low-resolution near-infrared (0.8-2.5 $\mu$m) spectroscopy. Our analysis focuses on a uniform sample of 142 age-benchmark brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects spanning late-M, L, and T spectral types, with independently determined ages from 10 Myr to 10 Gyr. We perform forward-model spectral fitting for all benchmarks' IRTF/SpeX spectra ($R\sim$80-250) using both SM08 and Sonora Diamondback atmospheric models to infer effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, radii, and cloud sedimentation efficiencies. The two model grids yield broadly consistent results. Among L4-L9 dwarfs, we identify a statistically significant, population-level age dependence of the cloud parameter $f_{\rm sed}$, with young benchmarks ($&lt;300$ Myr) exhibiting systematically lower $f_{\rm sed}$ values than older counterparts. This trend is absent across L0-T5 and T0-T5, demonstrating that cloud properties vary with age and surface gravity and offering explanations for the observed gravity-dependent photometric properties at the late-L end of the L/T transition. By comparing spectroscopically inferred parameters with predictions from evolution models, we quantify systematic errors in the fitted atmospheric parameters and establish empirical calibrations to anchor future studies using these atmospheric models. Stacked residuals of the sample reveal wavelength-dependent data-model mismatches associated with key atomic and molecular absorption bands, highlighting the need for improved opacities and rainout chemistry. Finally, we show that including an interstellar-medium-like extinction term significantly improves the spectral fits, confirming and broadening previous findings and suggesting missing opacity sources in current cloudy models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for a Peak at $\sim$0.3 in the Eccentricity Distribution of Typical Super-Jovian Exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2601.18877]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we compute completeness-corrected occurrence rates of giant exoplanets as a function of mass, semimajor axis, and eccentricity, using the approximately uniform California Legacy Survey sample of RV-discovered planets published in Rosenthal et al. 2021. We recover the previously-detected rise in occurrence with semimajor axis for both lower- and higher-mass subsets of the population out to $\sim$5 au. When restricting to planets with semimajor axes between 0.1 and 4.5 au (roughly speaking, the &quot;peak&quot; of giant planet occurrence), we find evidence for distinct eccentricity distributions for each of two mass sub-populations. Most strikingly, we observe a peak in the eccentricity distribution of super-Jovian planets (3-20 M$_{\rm J}$) at 0.3, which is apparent using two different parameterizations of the eccentricity distribution model. A hierarchical histogram model reveals that $\sim$92% of posterior samples indicate an elevated occurrence rate of super-Jupiters with modest eccentricities (0.2-0.4) compared to lower or higher eccentricities (i.e. evidence for a moderate eccentricity &quot;peak&quot;), and 99% of samples indicate super-Jupiters with modest eccentricities are more common than those with lower eccentricities (i.e. evidence that moderate eccentricities are more common than low eccentricities). We use a truncated Gaussian model fit to pinpoint the location of the super-Jupiter eccentricity peak with more precision, finding a maximum a posterior (MAP) peak location of $e=0.3$. This low but elevated characteristic eccentricity could be the result of dynamically hot histories, perhaps involving a giant impacts phase. All analysis code for this project is publicly available on Zenodo ( this https URL ) and GitHub ( this http URL ).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18887" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AT2018cow Powered by a Shock in Aspherical Circumstellar Media</a><span class="id">[2601.18887]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a quantitative model for the luminous fast blue optical transient AT2018cow in which a shock propagating through an aspherical circumstellar medium (CSM) produces the X-ray and UV/optical/NIR emission. X-rays are emitted from hot post-shock electrons, and soft X-ray photons are reprocessed into optical/UV emission in the cool downstream. This naturally explains two previously puzzling features: (i) the coordinated evolution of the optical and soft X-ray after day 20, (ii) the hard X-ray hump above 10 keV that disappears around day 15 as the Thomson optical depth transitions from $\tau_T \gg1$ to $\tau_T \sim 1$. Our model is over-constrained, and it quantitatively reproduces the bolometric luminosity evolution, soft X-ray spectrum, and time-dependent soft/hard X-ray and soft X-ray/optical luminosity ratios. It also explains additional puzzles: X-ray fluctuations with $\sim4-10$ day timescales arise from a global radiative shock instability, while the NIR excess and the apparent receding blackbody radius result from reprocessed X-rays in matter far from thermodynamic equilibrium. The radio is naturally explained as originating from a shock driven by the same ejecta in the more dilute CSM. The light curve steepening after $\sim 40$ days likely indicates the shock reaches the edge of the dense CSM at $\sim {\rm few} \times 10^{15}$ cm. We infer explosion energy $\sim 1-5 \times 10^{50}$ erg, carried by an ejecta at $\sim 0.1c$ and a mass of $0.01-0.05 M_\odot$, in a dense asymmetric CSM with $\sim 0.3 M_\odot$, embedded in a more dilute CSM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Solar Neighborhood LIV: 54 Orbits of M Dwarf Multiples within 30 Parsecs with Speckle Interferometry at SOAR</a><span class="id">[2601.18905]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present 1066 speckle measurements of M dwarf multiples observed over 2021-2024, all taken with HRCam on the Southern Astrophysical Research 4.1 m telescope. Among these, 900 observations resolve companions in 212 pairs, with separations spanning 17 milliarcseconds to 3.4 arcsec and brightness differences ranging from 0 to 4.9 magnitudes in the I filter. We have characterized the orbits of 54 of these companions, spanning periods of 0.67-30 yr, by combining our data with literature astrometry, radial velocities, and, in four cases, Hipparcos-Gaia accelerations. Among the orbits presented here are 28 that are the first-ever such characterizations for their systems, and 26 that revise previously-published orbits, thus providing a significant update to the observed dynamics of M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. From these orbits, we provide new and updated dynamical total masses for these systems, precise to 0.7-7% in nearly all cases. Future mass derivations for components in these systems will contribute to efforts in refining the mass-luminosity relation for the smallest stars, and will enhance investigations of age, magnetism, and metallicity effects on luminosities at a given mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The MIRI Excess around Degenerates (MEAD) Survey II: A Probable Planet detected via IR Excess around WD 0644+025</a><span class="id">[2601.18965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The MIRI Excess Around Degenerates (MEAD) Survey is a cycle 2 JWST program designed to image nearby white dwarfs with MIRI at 10 and 15 microns. This survey targeted 56 white dwarfs within 25 pc to search for mid-infrared excesses, flux deficits from collision-induced absorption, and resolved substellar companions. In this paper we present our analysis of WD 0644+025, an unusually massive white dwarf (0.95 Msun) and the MEAD target exhibiting the most significant mid-infrared excess. The observed JWST MIRI photometry shows a 7.3 sigma excess at 15 microns and a 3.6 sigma excess at 10 microns, which may be associated with either a planetary companion or a circumstellar dust disk. This excess corresponds to a companion mass of 6.8 Mjup (Teff=261 +/- 9 K) with orbital distance &lt;11.8 au, although substantially lower masses are possible if we consider a closely orbiting insolated companion. No spatially resolved sources are detected within 200 au, with contrast curve analysis excluding planets more massive than 2 Mjup beyond  12 au. Metal pollution is confirmed in both archival Keck HIRES spectra from 1999 and new observations from 2025, with no evidence suggesting the accretion rate has substantially changed over the decades. We explore possible dust disk morphologies to describe the observed IR excess, and find that traditional debris disks struggle to fit our data. WD 0644+025 thus represents a compelling case study in the growing population of white dwarfs with cold infrared excesses, and highlights JWST's ability to probe planetary system remnants inaccessible to prior infrared observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18986" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Progenitor of the recoiling super-massive black hole RBH-1 identified using HST/JWST imaging</a><span class="id">[2601.18986]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using a combination of \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} imaging, a runaway supermassive black hole (RBH-1) was recently identified with an inferred velocity of $954^{+110}_{-126}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, likely ejected from a compact star-forming galaxy (denoted as GX) at $z \approx 0.96$. Assuming the runaway black hole was the outcome of the gravitational-wave-driven merger of two black holes, we use its measured runaway velocity together with gravitational-wave recoil predictions from numerical relativity and black hole perturbation theory to constrain the mass ratio and spin configuration of the progenitor SMBHs that overcame the final-parsec problem and merged $\sim 70$ Myr ago. We find that the progenitor binary must have been precessing, with a mass ratio $m_1/m_2\lesssim 6$, and that the more massive SMBH must have possessed a high spin (dimensionless spin magnitude $\sim 0.75$) in order to generate a recoil of this magnitude. This has important astrophysical implications as similar SMBH mergers can be an interesting source population for the upcoming LISA mission with signal-to-noise ratios $\gtrsim$ 1000. Furthermore, the progenitor SMBH properties imply that GX was likely formed through a major, gas-rich (“wet”) merger between two galaxies of comparable mass, with a mass ratio $\lesssim 4$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A multiwavelength view of the nearby Calcium-Strong Transient SN 2025coe in the X-Ray, Near-Infrared, and Radio Wavebands</a><span class="id">[2601.19018]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Calcium-strong transients (CaSTs) are a subclass of faint and rapidly evolving supernovae (SNe) that exhibit strong calcium features and notably weak oxygen features. The small but growing population of CaSTs exhibits some aspects similar to thermonuclear supernovae and others that are similar to massive star core-collapse events, leading to intriguing questions on the physical origins of CaSTs. SN 2025coe is one of the most nearby CaSTs discovered to date, and our coordinated multi-wavelength observations obtained days to weeks post-explosion reveal new insights on these enigmatic transients. With the most robust NIR spectroscopic time-series of a CaST collected to date, SN 2025coe shows spectral signatures characteristic of Type Ib SNe (SNe Ib, i.e. He-rich stripped-envelope SNe). SN 2025coe is the third X-ray detected CaST and our analysis of the \textit{Swift} X-ray data suggest interaction with 0.12 $\pm\,0.11\ M_{\odot}$ of circumstellar material (CSM) extending to at least $2 \times 10^{15} $cm ($\sim 30,000\ R_{\odot}$), while our analysis of the 1-240 GHz radio non-detections gives an outer radius of that CSM of at most $\sim 4\times 10^{15}$ cm. This inferred nearby high-density CSM extending out to $3\pm 1 \times10^{15}$ cm is similar to that seen in the other two X-ray detected CaSTs, and its presence suggests that either intensive mass-loss or some polluting mechanism may be a common feature of this subclass. Our work also expands upon recent studies on the optical properties of SN 2025coe and explores our current understanding of different progenitor systems that could possibly produce CaSTs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-linear evolution in $f(R)$ gravity: iterative modelling of the Chameleon mechanism</a><span class="id">[2601.19108]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the non-linear evolution of matter perturbations in $f(R)$ models with the Chameleon screening mechanism. The novel feature of our investigation is an iterative solution for the non-linear equation for the scalar field $\chi = \Phi - \Psi$, where $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ are the potentials that characterise scalar perturbations of the metric. We demonstrate the scheme on spherical perturbations - smooth, compensated top-hats of varying length scales. We find that the effect of the Chameleon mechanism is seen most prominently on scales where the size of the top-hat is comparable to the Compton scale of the background. There is a density enhancement near the outer edge of the top-hat and the top-hat does not retain its shape. We explain this well-known observation in the context of the spatio-temporal evolution of the Compton scale. Additionally, we find a slight enhancement of the density near the origin, a feature not reported previously in the literature. On scales much smaller or much larger than the background Compton length, including the Chameleon screening has no appreciable effect on the perturbations. In the former, the growth is enhanced as compared to GR and is almost the same as GR in the latter. Finally, we examine the non-linear density velocity divergence (DVDR) relation and find that for evolution affected by Chameleon screening, the DVDR is no longer one-to-one even for a single profile. The relation between density and velocity depends on the location within the perturbation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximum Energy of Particles Accelerated in GRB Afterglow Shocks</a><span class="id">[2601.19135]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Particle acceleration in relativistic collisionless shocks remains an open problem in high-energy astrophysics. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations predict that electron acceleration in weakly magnetized shocks proceeds via small-angle scattering, leading to a maximum electron energy significantly below the Bohm limit. This upper bound manifests observationally as a characteristic synchrotron cutoff, providing a direct probe of the underlying acceleration physics. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows offer an exceptional laboratory for testing these predictions. Here, we model the spectral evolution of GRB afterglows during the relativistic deceleration phase, incorporating PIC-motivated acceleration prescriptions and self-consistently computing synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. We find that low-energy bursts in low-density environments, typical of short GRBs, exhibit a pronounced synchrotron cutoff in the GeV band within minutes to hours after the trigger. Applying our framework to GRB 190114C and GRB 130427A, we find that current observations are insufficient to discriminate between PIC-motivated acceleration and the Bohm limit, primarily due to large uncertainties in the Fermi-LAT band. Nevertheless, future MeV-TeV afterglow observations can break model degeneracies and place substantially tighter constraints on particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latent characterisation of the complete BATSE gamma ray bursts catalogue using Gaussian mixture of factor analysers and model-estimated overlap-based syncytial clustering</a><span class="id">[2601.19140]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Characterising and distinguishing gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has interested astronomers for many decades. While some authors have found two or three groups of GRBs by analyzing only a few parameters, recent work identified five ellipsoidally-shaped groups upon considering nine parameters $T_{50}, T_{90}, F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, P_{64}, P_{256}, P_{1024}$. Yet others suggest sub-classes within the two or three groups found earlier. Using a mixture model of Gaussian factor analysers, we analysed 1150 GRBs, that had nine parameters observed, from the current Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) catalogue, and again established five ellipsoidal-shaped groups to describe the GRBs. These five groups are characterised in terms of their average duration, fluence and spectrum as shorter-faint-hard, long-intermediate-soft, long-intermediate-intermediate, long-bright-intermediate and short-faint-hard. The use of factor analysers in describing individual group densities allows for a more thorough group-wise characterisation of the parameters in terms of a few latent features. However, given the discrepancy with many other existing studies that advocated for two or three groups, we also performed model-estimated overlap-based syncytial clustering (MOBSynC) that successively merges poorer-separated groups. The five ellipsoidal groups merge into three and then into two groups, one with GRBs of low durations and the other having longer duration GRBs. These groups are also characterised in terms of a few latent factors made up of the nine parameters. Our analysis provides context for all three sets of results, and in doing so, details a multi-layered characterisation of the BATSE GRBs, while also explaining the structure in their variability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Q-balls from thermal balls during a first-order phase transition: a numerical study</a><span class="id">[2601.19150]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We numerically study the Q-ball formation triggered by a cosmological first-order phase transition within the Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. By performing lattice simulations, we track the nonequilibrium dynamics throughout the transition, providing a precise description of the Q-ball formation mechanism and the resulting mass spectrum. Collapsing false-vacuum regions first form thermal balls, which subsequently cool via dissipative interactions and stabilize into long-lived Q-balls with nonzero spin. We observe a large population of low-mass Q-balls, as well as rare, massive Q-balls that are several times larger than the analytical prediction. The final Q-ball population exhibits a broad mass spectrum spanning over two orders of magnitude, characterized by an exponential tail of number density at large masses. The simulations suggest that the Q-ball abundance is approximately $50\%$ higher than predicted by analytical estimates, adjusting the result in the context of Q-balls as dark matter candidates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining FRB Microstructure with Polarised Shot Noise</a><span class="id">[2601.19254]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present FIRES, a polarised shot-noise framework that models fast radio burst (FRB) dynamic spectra as the incoherent superposition of Gaussian microshots. Applied to the CRAFT bursts FRB 20191001A and FRB 20240318A, FIRES reproduces key spectro-polarimetric behaviours: scattering suppresses position-angle (PA) variability on the trailing edge, while the leading edge preferentially retains intrinsic structure when sufficient signal-to-noise is present. We quantify this behaviour using the PA variance ratio $\mathcal{R}_\psi$ and explore the joint plane of measured linear polarisation fraction $\Pi_L$ versus PA variance to constrain the allowed parameter space of microshot number $N$, intrinsic PA dispersion $\sigma_\psi$, and intrinsic linear fraction $\Pi_{L,0}$ at fixed signal-to-noise. For FRB 20191001A, the data are consistent with an extended region spanning $\sigma_\psi \sim 10^\circ$–$30^\circ$ and $N \sim 5$–$1000$, reflecting degeneracies between intrinsic PA structure, microshot superposition, scattering, finite sampling, and noise. FRB 20240318A occupies a more restricted region, favouring fewer microshots ($N \lesssim 20$) and larger intrinsic PA dispersion ($\sigma_\psi \sim 15$–$23^\circ$), depending on $\Pi_{L,0}$, consistent with its observed PA variability. By combining an emission-mechanism-independent framework with minimal assumptions and observational constraints, FIRES provides direct, quantitative constraints on the space of viable FRB microphysical models and demonstrates that microshot superposition offers a natural explanation for the diverse polarimetric behaviours observed in FRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local environmental dependence on weak-lensing shear statistics</a><span class="id">[2601.19268]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Despite the assumption that an ideal FLRW observer is not dependent on the local environment, observations are biased by the positions of the observers due to the matter correlations in the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The variation of the mass distribution of the LSS of the universe implies that observers residing in different locations may suffer bias in their measurements when they look at the images of distant galaxies. Here, we assess the influence of the local environment on weak gravitational lensing (WL) shear statistics in the context of relativistic $N$-body code, \texttt{gevolution}. We derive numerical constraints on the cosmological parameters from the WL shear angular power spectrum and comment on the local environment's influence on WL shear. We find tighter constraints on the parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ above redshift $z$ = 0.2, which implies over this redshift the local environment's impact is minor. We also investigate the bispectrum and conclude that on average the impact of the local environment on $f_{\rm NL}$ (a measure of non-Gaussianities) is minimal and consistent with zero effect. However, we find that within the assembly of all possible observers/locations, there will also be a few that could infer the parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ of the order 10. These results could thus be used to estimate the uncertainty in the inference of cosmological parameters such as $f_{\rm NL}$ based on WL shear bispectrum and thus may have implications for future surveys requiring precision at the percent level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">STONKS first results: Long-term transients in the XMM-Newton Galactic plane survey</a><span class="id">[2601.19328]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The study of astronomical transients at high energies provides insights into some of the most extreme physical events in the universe; however, carrying out their detection and fast follow-up studies are limited by instrumental constraints.

We examined the alerts created by the STONKS pipeline from over 200 XMM observations of the Galactic plane, screening for instrumental effects. The 78 alerts associated with 70 real astrophysical sources were then subjected to further temporal and spectral analysis. From the 70 sources we identified, we were able to classify 32 with a high degree of confidence, including 7 X-ray binaries, 1 $\gamma$-Cas analogue, and 1 magnetar candidate. Of the 70 sources, 23 were detected for the first time in X-rays. This systematic analysis of publicly available data has shown the value and potential of STONKS in the application to XMM-Newton observations. It will enable the community to detect transient and highly variable sources at fainter fluxes than with any other X-ray transient detection systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19363" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to interpret near-infrared polarisation spectra of active M dwarfs?</a><span class="id">[2601.19363]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Analyses of global magnetic fields in M dwarfs rely on many approximations regarding the derivation of average line profiles from spectropolarimetric data, interpreting them with analytical functions and modelling them using Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI). These assumptions have not been systematically tested. We assessed the accuracy of standard treatments of average polarisation profiles in M dwarfs and their interpretation with ZDI. We focused on the filling-factor approach, which attempts to represent coexisting global and small-scale fields. We performed polarised radiative transfer calculations across the near-infrared spectrum of a typical M dwarf. From these theoretical spectra, we derived mean Stokes profiles and approximated them with different line-synthesis methods. To test the recovery of global fields, we performed ZDI inversions using simulated Stokes V observations for low- and high-activity cases. The analytical approximation of mean polarisation profiles reproduces Stokes I and V only for fields up to  1 kG and fails for linear polarisation. ZDI with single-line analytical Stokes V profiles is adequate for weakly magnetic M dwarfs with fields below a few hundred gauss. However, combined with the filling-factor formalism, this traditional modelling approach produces unphysical local fields and distorted global geometries for active M dwarfs with multi-kilogauss fields. These issues are mitigated using a new mapping technique based on theoretical Stokes profiles that account for both global and randomly distributed small-scale fields. Our study reveals fundamental limitations of current ZDI analyses of active M dwarfs and questions the reliability of some published maps.

Aims: We aim to understand the origins of the Necklace and its dwarf carbon central star. Methods: We study the carbon abundance of the nebula through far ultraviolet spectroscopy obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Furthermore, through simultaneous modelling of multiband light and velocity curves, we attempt to constrain the parameters of the central star system. Results: Puzzlingly, we find that the region of the inner nebula observed with the Hubble Space Telescope is seemingly not carbon-rich, at odds with the dwarf carbon star nature of the companion of the central star. The initial mass of the nebular progenitor was likely very close to the limit to become carbon-rich, perhaps experiencing a very late thermal pulse. The dwarf carbon star companion is found to be significantly inflated with respect to that expected for an isolated main sequence star of the same mass. Conclusions: The properties of the central binary are consistent with the progenitor having become carbon-rich and its companion having accreted a significant amount of that carbon-enriched material. However, it is unclear how this evolutionary hypothesis can be reconciled with the inner nebula potentially being carbon poor.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Almanac: HMC sampling with bounded velocity</a><span class="id">[2601.19390]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, the shape of the potential and the choice of the momentum distribution jointly give rise to the Hamiltonian dynamics of the sampler. An efficient sampler propagates quickly in all regions of the parameter space, so that the chain has a low autocorrelation length and the sampler has a high acceptance rate, with the goal of optimising the number of near-independent samples for given computational cost. Standard Gaussian momentum distributions allow arbitrarily large velocities, which can lead to inefficient exploration in posteriors with ridges or funnel-like geometries. We investigate alternative momentum distributions based on relativistic and Student's t kinetic energies, which naturally limit particle velocities and may improve robustness. Using Almanac, a sampler for cosmological posterior distributions of sky maps and power spectra on the sphere, we test these alternatives in both low- and high-dimensional settings. We find that the choice of parameterization and momentum distribution can improve convergence and effective sample rate, though the achievable gains are generally modest and strongly problem-dependent, reaching up to an order of magnitude in favorable cases. Among the momentum distributions that we tested, those with moderately heavy tails achieved the best balance between efficiency and stability. These results highlight the importance of sampler design and encourage future work on adaptive and self-tuning strategies for kinetic energy parameter optimization in high-dimensional settings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers with equal and near-equal mass ratios</a><span class="id">[2601.19405]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of GW230529_181500 suggested the existence of more symmetric black hole-neutron star mergers where the black hole mass can be as low as 2.6 times that of the neutron star. Black hole-neutron star binaries with even more symmetric mass ratios are expected to leave behind massive disks capable of driving bright electromagnetic transients like kilonovae. Currently, there is only a limited number of numerical-relativity simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers in this regime, which are vital for accurate gravitational waveform models and analytical fitting formulas for the remnant properties. Insufficient accuracy of these may lead to misclassification of real events and potentially missed opportunities to locate their electromagnetic counterparts. To fill this gap in the parameter space coverage, we perform simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers with mass ratios $q \in \{1, 1/2, 1/3\}$. We find the gravitational waveform models do not show good agreement with the numerical waveforms, with dephasing at the level of around 1 rad at the merger. We find that the masses of the dynamical ejecta and disk are in good agreement with the available fitting formulas. The analytical formulas for the remnant black hole are in excellent agreement for the black hole mass, but are less accurate with the predictions for its spin. Moreover, we analyze the remnant disk structure and dynamics, deriving the rotation law and identifying global trapped $g$-mode density oscillations. We distinguish three types of accretion in the postmerger and find modulation of the accretion rate by the global oscillations of the disk. Finally, we model the kilonova emission these systems would produce and find that most of them are potentially detectable by Vera C. Rubin Observatory within four days after merger, and by DECam within two days after merger if located at a distance of 200 Mpc.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A thin disk and a nearly universal accretion rate in luminous quasars</a><span class="id">[2601.19412]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quasars accretion models predict a broad range of optical and ultraviolet properties that depend primarily on black hole mass and accretion rate. Yet, most optically selected luminous quasars display strikingly similar continuum spectra. We show that this uniformity can be explained by a nearly constant luminosity to mass (Eddington) ratio, L_EDD and by thermal emission from a standard, optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disc. A standard disk with an Eddington ratio L_EDD=0.1 reproduces both the black hole mass/luminosity distribution of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars and their principal continuum properties. In this framework, the spectral energy distribution peaks beyond the observable ultraviolet range for nearly all sources. We show that the few quasars, expected to be cold enough to shift the peak into the observable region, indeed show this behaviour. This scenario is further supported by an analysis of the relation between the luminosity of the main broad emission lines and the continuum luminosity (i.e. the Baldwin effect). We find that 1) the observed slopes of the line to continuum relations match the expectations from the standard disk model, if we assume that the line emission is a good proxy of the ionizing luminosity; 2) the dispersions of the line-continuum luminosity relations are very small (as small as 0.13 dex), suggesting that the physics of the disk-broad line region system is dominated by only one parameter (the black hole mass) with a nearly constant Eddington ratio. Finally, we notice that our hypothesis of constant L_EDD=0.1 provides a black hole mass estimate (based on the observed luminosity) with a smaller error than the virial estimate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Union3.1: Self-consistent Measurements of Host Galaxy Properties for 2000 Type Ia Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2601.19424]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The determination of distances using time-series photometry of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) relies on a  5% empirical correction related to the properties of their host galaxies, e.g., global stellar mass. It is therefore crucial for unbiased cosmology inference that host galaxy properties be self-consistently determined across the full range of redshifts probed, which we undertake in this study for approximately 2000 SNe in the Union3 compilation (now Union3.1). We use aperture-matched, homogeneously-reduced, optical-infrared photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys to derive global galaxy properties using the stellar population synthesis and SED-fitting code Prospector. We find that the host masses of $z&lt;0.10$ SNe in Union3 were, on average, overestimated relative to the rest of the sample, while the opposite was true for $z&lt;0.15$ SNe in Pantheon+. After correction, the two studies' average distance modulus estimated for low-redshift SNe, previously $&gt;0.03$ mag discrepant, come into 0.01 mag agreement. We then update the UNITY SN analysis and find that the uncertainties on all standardization parameters shrink to 0.6-0.9x their previous sizes. For flat-$\Lambda$CDM, we find $\Omega_m=0.344^{+0.026}_{-0.025}$, a -0.3$\sigma$ shift from Union3. We then combine with measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) exactly as done by DESI DR2 and find $w_0=-0.719\pm0.084$, $w_a=-0.95^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$, corresponding to 3.4$\sigma$ evidence against a cosmological constant (down from 3.8$\sigma$). We also update the DESI combined probe analysis using our correction to Pantheon+ and the recent DES-SN5YR Dovekie recalibration, finding $3.2\sigma$ (up from 2.8$\sigma$) and 3.4$\sigma$ (down from 4.2$\sigma$) evidence against a cosmological constant in the $w_0w_a$ plane, altogether marking a significantly improved consistency across SN analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large-scale Modeling of the Observed Power Spectrum Multipoles</a><span class="id">[2601.19438]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current and upcoming large-scale structure surveys are pushing toward increasingly wide angular coverage, where wide-angle effects (arising from the varying line of sight across the curved sky) become critical for accurate modeling of the three-dimensional galaxy power spectrum. At the same time, these survey's broader redshift reach makes the effects of redshift evolution (beyond the effective-redshift approximation) non-negligible on large radial scales. Additional observational effects such as the survey window function and integral constraints also become significant on these large scales, necessitating a careful theoretical treatment to robustly constrain local primordial non-Gaussianities and relativistic effects. In this work, we present a consistent and accurate theoretical framework for modeling the commonly used power spectrum multipoles (PSM) on large scales using the discrete spherical Fourier-Bessel (dSFB) basis. This basis ensures numerical stability and allows an exact separation between angular and radial modes. Using the dSFB basis, we study the impact of wide-angle effects and redshift evolution on the PSM, and incorporate the effects of window function convolution and integral constraints. We validate our PSM modeling using lognormal mocks under radial integral constraints with realistic survey geometries, demonstrating the readiness of our framework for application to all-sky galaxy surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19450" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minkowski Functionals of the 21 cm Signal as a Probe of Primordial Features</a><span class="id">[2601.19450]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The redshifted 21 cm signal from the cosmic dawn and Epoch of Reionization (EoR) encodes important information about both astrophysical processes and primordial physics, such as inflation.

Focusing on primordial features from particle production during inflation we generate semi-numerical simulations of the 21 cm signal across redshifts 5 &lt; z &lt; 35, incorporating these features. Using Minkowski Functionals (MFs), we analyze the morphology of 21 cm fields: density, neutral hydrogen fraction, spin temperature, and brightness temperature. We demonstrate that MFs are highly sensitive to both the amplitude and scale of primordial features, capturing rich morphological information. In particular, we show that MFs can robustly identify inflationary features and distinguish them from the standard model. We further explore various EoR scenarios, and demonstrate that combining MFs across redshifts can disentangle the signatures of primordial features from EoR effects.

High inclination, dipping, neutron star Low Mass X-Ray Binaries (LMXBs) provide an excellent testbed to study the launching mechanism of such winds due to being persistently accreting and showing a nearly ubiquitous presence of highly-ionised plasmas. We aim to establish or rule out the presence of a wind in the high inclination LMXB 4U 1624-49, for which a highly ionised plasma has been repeatedly observed in X-ray spectra by Chandra and XMM-Newton, and a thermal-radiative pressure wind is expected. We leverage the exquisite spectral resolution of XRISM to perform phase-resolved spectroscopy of the full binary orbit to characterise the highly ionised plasma at all phases except during absorption dips. An outflow is clearly detected via phase-resolved spectroscopy of the source with XRISM/Resolve. Based on analysis of the radial velocity curve we determine an average velocity of  200-320 km/s and a column density above 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. The line profiles are generally narrow, spanning from  50 to  100 km/s, depending on the orbital phase, pointing to a low velocity sheer or turbulence of the highly ionised outflow and a potential increase of turbulence as the absorption dip is approached, likely due to turbulent mixing. The line profiles, together with the derived launching radius and wind velocity are consistent with a wind being launched from the outskirts of the disc and without stratification, pointing to a thermal-radiative pressure origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predicted incidence of Jupiter-like planets around white dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2601.19531]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Only a handful of gas giant planets orbiting white dwarfs are known. It remains unclear whether this paucity reflects observational challenges or the consequences of stellar evolution. We aim to carry out population synthesis of substellar objects around white dwarfs to predict the fraction and properties of white dwarfs hosting substellar companions. We generated a representative population of white-dwarf progenitors with substellar companion and used the stellar-evolution codes MESA and SSE with standard prescriptions for mass loss and stellar tides to predict the resulting population of white dwarfs and their companions. We find that the predicted fraction of white dwarfs hosting substellar companions in the Milky Way is, independent of uncertainties related to initial distributions, stellar tides, or stellar mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch, below  3%. The occurrence rate peaks at relatively low-mass ( 0.53 Msun to  0.66 Msun) white dwarfs and relatively young ( 1-6 Gyr) systems, where it exceeds 3%. The semimajor axes of the surviving companions range from 3-24 au. We estimate that  95% of the predicted companions are gas-giant planets. Owing to the strong dependence of companion occurrence on the metallicity of the white dwarf progenitor, the assumed age-metallicity relation strongly affects the predictions. Based on recent estimates of the local age-metallicity relation, we estimate that the fraction of white dwarfs with companions close to the Sun might reach  8%. If the planetary and brown dwarf companion distributions derived from intermediate-mass giant stars through radial velocity surveys reflect the characteristics of the true population, less than 3% of white dwarfs host substellar companions. This most likely represents an upper limit on possible detections because a significant number of companions might not be detectable with current facilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19584" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond solar metallicity: How enhanced solid content in disks re-shape low-mass planet torques</a><span class="id">[2601.19584]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The migration of low-mass planets is tightly controlled by the torques exerted by both gas and solids in their natal disks. While canonical models assume a solar solid-to-gas mass ratio (epsilon=0.01) and neglect the back-reaction of solid component of the disk, recent work suggests that enhanced metallicity can radically alter these torques. We quantify how elevated metallicities (epsilon=0.03 and epsilon=0.1) modify the gas and solid torques, test widely used linear scaling prescriptions, and identify the regimes where solid back-reaction becomes decisive. We performed global, 2D hydrodynamic simulations that treat solid material as a pressureless fluid fully coupled to the gas through drag and include the reciprocal back-reaction force. The planet was maintained on a fixed circular orbit, thus we computed static torques. The Stokes number was varied from 0.01 to 10, three surface-density slopes (p=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5) and three accretion efficiencies (eta=0, 10, and 100%) were explored. Torques, obtained by rescaling canonical epsilon=0.01 results, were compared with direct simulations. Solid torques scale linearly with epsilon, but gas torques deviate by 50-100% and can even reverse sign for St&lt;=1 in epsilon=0.1 disks. These are due to strong, feedback-driven, asymmetric gas perturbations in the co-orbital region, amplified by rapid planetary accretion. Solid back-reaction in high-metallicity environments can dominate the migration torque budget of low-mass planets. Simple metallicity rescalings are therefore unreliable for St&lt;=2, implying that precise migration tracks - particularly in metal-rich disks – require simulations that fully couple solid and gas dynamics. These results highlight metallicity as a key parameter in shaping the early orbital architecture of planetary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the rarity of rocket-driven Penrose extraction in Kerr spacetime</a><span class="id">[2601.19616]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a Monte Carlo study of energy extraction from rotating (Kerr) black holes via the Penrose process using rocket propulsion. Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \approx 0.91c$). When conditions are highly tuned to a specific &quot;sweet spot,&quot; success rates can reach 88.5%, representing a narrow extraction window rather than generic behavior. Furthermore, single-impulse thrust at periapsis achieves significantly higher cumulative efficiency ($\eta_{\rm cum} \approx 19\%$) compared to continuous thrust ($\sim$2–4%) due to path-averaging penalties. These constraints quantify the extreme fine-tuning required for material-based Penrose extraction, consistent with the astrophysical dominance of electromagnetic mechanisms.

Analysing beam kinematics inferred from the drift-rate reveals behaviour inconsistent with the emitter moving radially through smooth, monotonically decreasing density. We examine whether these features are driven by disturbances in the guiding magnetic field direction, such as switchbacks, rather than plasma inhomogeneities along the beam path. Using simulations and remote observations of 24 interplanetary type III bursts observed by Parker Solar Probe, we relate measured drift-rate variations to local field deflections. In 50% of events, we identify disturbances above a $2\sigma$ noise level that can be attributed to perpendicular deflections of the field between (0.7-1.7) R$_\odot$, over scales (1.8-6.4) R$_\odot$ at heliocentric distances (9-30) R$_\odot$. The features correspond to either density changes of (10-30)%, or deflections of the field direction by (23-88)$^\circ$. Further, beam transport simulations show field direction perturbations produce additional observational signatures in type III bursts: delayed emission, intensity breaks, and enhanced emission resembling stria fine structures. In addition, we identified four bursts where the observed variations are more plausibly explained by field deflections, possibly in the form of magnetic switchbacks, than by unrealistically large density changes along the field line. The results show that variations in type III burst profiles can arise from magnetic as well as density fluctuations, and demonstrate the value of type III bursts as remote probes of inner-heliospheric structure at kilometric wavelengths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lensing without mixing: Probing Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations and other scale-dependent features in cosmic shear surveys</a><span class="id">[2601.19696]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Weak-gravitational lensing tends to wash out scale and time-dependent features of the clustering of matter, such as the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) which appear in the form of wiggles in the matter power spectrum but that disappear in the analogous lensing $C_\ell$.

In addition to finding evidence for two different light-curve-shape (x1) distributions, we also find that the color distributions are different, that the light-curve-shape/magnitude standardization relations are different, and that these populations have different distributions across host-galaxy stellar mass and redshift. Importantly, we find that the residual host-mass luminosity step found in prior SN Ia cosmology analyses is now consistent with zero for unreddened SNe. We report a significantly tightened constraint on the split in the red-color standardization between SNe in low- and high-mass galaxies. We find that the estimated uncertainties shrink on cosmological parameters when fitting the same SNe assuming two modes versus one mode. We confirm similar trends in simulated data when running both versions of UNITY on the same (two-mode) simulations. For a flat LambdaCDM cosmology, we find Om = 0.334+0.025-0.024 from SNe alone; for a flat w0-wa cosmology, we find w0 = -0.760+0.084-0.082 and wa = -0.79+0.28-0.30 when including SNe, BAO, and CMB. In the 2D w0-wa plane, adding SNe to BAO and compressed CMB increases the tension with flat LambdaCDM from 2.1 sigma to 2.6 sigma.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the Equivalence Principle in Galaxy Clusters</a><span class="id">[2601.19861]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Clusters of galaxies have been used to measure a subtle effect predicted by Einstein: gravitational redshift. This signal encodes pristine information about our Universe, since it is sensitive to the depth of the clusters' gravitational potential wells. In this work, we show how gravitational redshift can be used to test a fundamental physical principle: the weak equivalence principle. This principle stipulates that all matter falls in the same way in a gravitational potential, regardless of its nature. By comparing the amplitude of the gravitational redshift signal with the velocity dispersion in galaxy clusters, we build a novel test of this principle targeted to the unknown dark matter. Our test is sensitive to any additional interaction that would alter the way dark matter falls in gravitational potentials, hence leading to a violation of the equivalence principle. We show that currently available data can constrain the presence of a fifth force in clusters at the level of 7-14%, while the newest surveys will reach a precision of a few percents. This demonstrates the crucial role played by galaxy clusters in testing fundamental properties of dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19870" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Cool Earth-sized Planet Candidate Transiting a Tenth Magnitude K-dwarf From K2</a><span class="id">[2601.19870]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The transit method is currently one of our best means for the detection of potentially habitable &quot;Earth-like&quot; exoplanets. In principle, given sufficiently high photometric precision, cool Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars could be discovered via single transit detections; however, this has not previously been achieved. In this work, we report a 10-hour long single transit event which occurred on the $V=10.1$ K-dwarf HD 137010 during K2 Campaign 15 in 2017. The transit is comparatively shallow ($225\pm10$ ppm), but is detected at high signal-to-noise thanks to the exceptionally high photometric precision achieved for the target. Our analysis of the K2 photometry, historical and new imaging observations, and archival radial velocities and astrometry strongly indicate that the event was astrophysical, occurred on-target, and can be best explained by a transiting planet candidate, which we designate HD 137010 b. The single observed transit implies a radius of $1.06^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ $R_\oplus$, and assuming negligible orbital eccentricity we estimate an orbital period of $355^{+200}_{-59}$ days ($a=0.88^{+0.32}_{-0.10}$ AU), properties comparable to Earth. We project an incident flux of $0.29^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$ $I_\oplus$, which would place HD 137010 b near the outer edge of the habitable zone. This is the first planet candidate with Earth-like radius and orbital properties that transits a Sun-like star bright enough for substantial follow-up observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fading Echoes of Interaction: Probing Centuries of Mass-Loss in Four Old Type IIn Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2601.19891]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernovae characterized by enduring narrow optical hydrogen emission lines (SNe IIn) are believed to result primarily from the core-collapse of massive stars undergoing sustained interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). While the properties of SN IIn progenitors have relatively few direct constraints, the ongoing ejecta-CSM interaction provides unique information about late-stage stellar mass-loss preceding core-collapse. We present late-time X-ray and radio observations of four $\geq$3000 day-old SNe IIn: SN 2013L, SN 2014ab, SN 2015da, and KISS15s. The radio and X-ray emission from KISS15s indicate a mass-loss rate of $\rm{\dot M\sim4\times 10^{-3}~{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}}$ at $\sim$450 years pre-supernova – 2 orders of magnitude below earlier optical estimates (which probed the mass-loss immediately preceding the supernova). We find hints of a spectral inversion in the radio SED of KISS15s; a possible signature of a secondary shock due to a binary system or the emergence of a pulsar wind. For SN 2013L, we obtain a mass-loss rate of $\rm{\dot M\sim2 \times 10^{-3}~\rm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}}$ at $\sim$400 years pre-explosion based on the X-ray detection. For SN 2014ab and SN 2015da, we find a upper limits on the mass-loss rates of $\rm{\dot M&lt;2\times10^{-3}~M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ explosion at $\sim$ 250 and 300 years pre-explosion, respectively. All four objects display mass-loss rates lower than estimates from earlier optical analyses by at least 1-3 orders of magnitude, necessitating a rapidly evolving progenitor process over the last centuries pre-explosion. Our analysis reveals how X-ray and radio observations can elucidate progenitor evolution when these objects have faded at optical wavelengths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18825" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark energy and a new realization of the matter Lagrangian</a><span class="id">[2601.18825]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A new realization of the matter Lagrangian is introduced which models the dark energy component as a non-standard combination of thermodynamics quantities of the baryonic matter.

We examine a simple proxy for this effect in the form of a single-wave solution of an axially symmetric fast flavor system. When the angular crossing is shallow and the growth rate of the instability correspondingly small, the flavor wave primarily affects resonant neutrinos that move in phase with it. The evolution of these resonant neutrinos becomes periodic, undergoing cycles of full flavor reversal. They feed power into the unstable wave, and subsequently return to their initial state, draining power back out. This new flavor pendulum captures the dynamics of weak, nearly monochromatic fast flavor instabilities. Since weakly unstable distributions always exhibit a narrow range of unstable wavenumbers, our model likely describes the earliest development of a flavor instability when it first appears. When the instability is not weak, the linear phase of a single-wave excitation does not connect to a regular nonlinear solution, unless the angle distribution consists of only two beams.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reconstructing inflation in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in light of ACT data</a><span class="id">[2601.18958]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During the inflationary epoch, we investigate the reconstruction of the background variables within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, considering the scalar spectral index $n_s(N)$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r(N)$, where $N$ denotes the number of $e-$folds.

We use 3D fully-kinetic simulations to investigate energy partition in weakly magnetized counter-propagating plasmas. Our results reveal a complex interplay between different processes, where at early times the Weibel instability drives a first stage of magnetic field amplification and at late times the kinking of current filaments drives a second amplification stage via a dynamo-type mechanism. Electrons are heated primarily during the latter phase through magnetic pumping. By the time the flows thermalize, we observe that the final temperature ratio $T_e/T_i$ and energy partition depend on the ion-to-electron mass ratio.

A Ground Level Enhancement GLE77 was observed on 11 November 2025 following an X5.1 class solar flare. A strong Forbush decrease occurred on 19 and 20 January 2026 during one of the most intense geomagnetic storms of Solar Cycle 25. Events were recorded coherently by the global neutron monitor network and by SEVAN detectors at multiple altitudes. Using spectrometric capabilities, we reconstruct energy spectra of missing neutrons and muons during the FD and compare them with corresponding spectra measured during GLE77. The analysis demonstrates that FD and GLE signatures are intrinsically asymmetric. FDs selectively suppress the preexisting galactic cosmic ray population, whereas GLEs introduce an additional, harder particle component. Neutron and muon channels exhibit markedly different spectral behavior, particularly at higher deposited energies, reflecting their sensitivity to different primary energy ranges. These results show that combined NM and SEVAN observations provide robust, complementary diagnostics of rigidity dependent cosmic ray modulation during extreme heliospheric disturbances.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19374" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Green's Function Formalism for Impurity-Induced Resonances in Sub-barrier Proton-Nucleus Scattering</a><span class="id">[2601.19374]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Motivated by recent experimental refinements of stellar reaction rates, we establish a non-perturbative Green's function formalism based on the exact solution of the Dyson equation for sub-barrier proton-nucleus resonant scattering. By utilizing bare Green's functions to map the quantum tunneling problem onto a scattering formalism, we demonstrate that the summation of infinite quantum paths recovers the exact tunneling coefficients, enabling an analytical solution of the Dyson equation where the strong nuclear force is modeled as a surface delta-shell impurity embedded within the Coulomb field. Applying this framework to the astrophysically relevant $p + {}^{7}\text{Li}$, $p + {}^{14}\text{N}$, and $p + {}^{23}\text{Na}$ systems, we achieve precise agreement with experimental resonance energies while revealing a fundamental physical distinction in resonance formation. The heavier ${}^{23}\text{Na}$ system is identified as a saturated state, residing on a geometric plateau where the resonance energy becomes insensitive to the interaction strength; our calculated value of $2.11$ MeV aligns remarkably well with the experimental level of $2.08$ MeV. In contrast, the lighter ${}^7\text{Li}$ and ${}^{14}\text{N}$ systems emerge as threshold states in a weak-coupling window, where the resonance energy is highly sensitive to the potential parameters and is sustained near the continuum edge. In this regime, our model yields energies of $0.489$ MeV and $1.067$ MeV, closely reproducing the experimental benchmarks of $0.441$ MeV and $1.058$ MeV, respectively.

Due to Hawking radiation, these types of PBHs are expected to be stable sources of cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and positrons with energies below $\mathcal{O}(10\,\mathrm{MeV})$. In many CR propagation models with diffusive re-acceleration characterized by a significant Alfvén velocity $V_a\sim \mathcal{O}(10)\,\mathrm{km/s}$, the energies of the evaporated electrons/positrons can be further enhanced to $\mathcal{O}(100)\,\mathrm{MeV}$ through their scattering with the Galactic random magnetic fields. Consequently, the observation of Galactic synchrotron emissions at frequencies above $\sim 20\,\mathrm{MHz}$ can provide useful constraints on the abundance of PBHs. Using the AMS-02 and Voyager-1 data on the boron-to-carbon nuclei flux ratio, we confirm that a significant Alfvén velocity $V_a \sim 20\,\mathrm{km/s}$ is favored in several benchmark diffusive re-acceleration models. We show that, in this scenario, the observed low-frequency synchrotron emissions (from 22 MHz to 1.4 GHz) can provide stringent constraints on PBH abundance.

We derive constraints from atomic-clock experiments and demonstrate that, although gravitational waves do not directly source the Weyl field at linear order, its dynamical contribution induces a backreaction on gravitational-wave propagation, leading to an anomalous strain.

There are currently no exact analytical solutions for this scenario. However, by using perturbation theory, where both the Proca mass and the black hole charge are small parameters, it is possible to find an exact analytical solution. In this solution, the metric tensor remains unchanged, but the vector potential deviates from the Coulomb potential. In particular, even if the Proca mass is limited by the value $m_{\gamma}&lt;10^{-48}\text{g}$, which is the current experimental upper limit for photon mass, it makes a significant contribution to the dynamical equations. In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and charged particles in the vicinity of a weakly Proca-charged black hole, and test the observational implications of the solution of the Einstein-Proca equations for gravitational bending, the black hole shadow, and the fit to the orbits of the Galactic center flares observed by the near-infrared GRAVITY instrument. We find that only extremely cold photons, which are likely scattered before reaching a distant observer, could reveal the non-zero photon mass effect through the black hole shadow. For the Galactic center flare analysis we obtained constraints on the dimensionless Proca parameter to $\mu \leq 0.125$ for the electric interaction parameter in the range $-1.1 &lt; \mathrm{Q} &lt; 0.5$, which can be potentially tested by future GRAVITY flare astrometry. Since the Proca parameter is coupled to the black hole mass, the effect of the Proca charge becomes more pronounced for supermassive black holes compared to stellar-mass objects. Our perturbative treatment remains valid essentially up to the horizon, with divergences appearing only in the immediate near-horizon region, where a fully non-perturbative analysis would be required.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectrum of radiation from global strings and the relic axion density</a><span class="id">[2601.19463]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We discuss key aspects of the nature of radiation from global strings and its impact on the relic axion density. Using a simple model we demonstrate the dependence on the spectrum of radiation emitted by strings. We then study the radiation emitted by perturbed straight strings paying particular attention to the difference between the overall phase of the field and the small perturbations about the string solution which are the axions. We find that a significant correction is required to be sure that one is analyzing the axions and not the self-field of the string. Typically this requires one to excise a sizeable region around the string - something which is not usually done in the case of numerical field theory simulations of string networks. We have measured the spectrum of radiation from these strings and find that it is compatible with an exponential, as predicted by the Nambu-like Kalb-Ramond action, and in particular is not a “hard” spectrum often found in string network simulations. We conclude by attempting to assess the uncertainties on relic density and find that this leads to a range of possible axion masses when compared to the measured density from the Cosmic Microwave Background, albeit that they are typically higher than what is predicted by the Initial Misalignment Mechanism. If the decay is via a “soft spectrum” from loops produced close to the backreaction scale we find that $m_{\rm a}\approx 160\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and a detection frequency $f\approx 38\,{\rm GHz}$. If axions are emitted directly by the string network, and we use emission spectra reported in field theory simulations, then $m_{\rm a}\approx 4\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and $f\approx 1\,{\rm GHz}$, however this increases to $m_a \approx 125\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and $f\approx 30\,{\rm GHz}$ using our spectra for the case of an oscillating string. In all scenarios there are significant remaining uncertainties that we delineate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effect of noise characterization on the detection of mHz stochastic gravitational waves</a><span class="id">[2601.19741]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar timing arrays' hint for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) leverages the expectations of a future detection in the millihertz band, particularly with the LISA space mission.

Starting from the thermodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases, we construct an equation of state for cold, catalyzed matter by combining relativistic fermion statistics with the liquid drop model of nuclear binding. The internal stratification of matter in the outer crust is described by $\beta$-equilibrium, neutron drip and a gradual transition to supranuclear matter. Short-range repulsive interactions inspired by Quantum Hadrodynamics are incorporated at high densities in order to ensure stability and causality. The resulting equation of state is used as input to the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations, yielding self-consistent neutron-star models. We compute macroscopic stellar properties including the mass-radius relation, compactness and surface redshift that can be compared with recent observational data. Despite the simplicity of the underlying microphysics, the model produces neutron-star masses and radii compatible with current observational constraints from X-ray timing and gravitational-wave measurements. This work demonstrates that physically transparent models can already capture the essential features of neutron-star structure and provide valuable insight into the connection between dense-matter physics and astrophysical observables while they can also be used as easy to handle models to test the impact of more complicated phenomena and variations in neutron stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of reconnection flux during eruption of magnetic flux ropes</a><span class="id">[2407.18188]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are powerful drivers of space weather, with magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) widely regarded as their primary precursors.

Our initial coronal configuration features an isothermal atmosphere and a potential arcade magnetic field beneath which an MFR emerges at the lower boundary. As the MFR rises, we observe significant stretching and compression of the overlying magnetic field beneath it. Magnetic reconnection begins with the gradual formation of a current sheet, eventually culminating with the impulsive expulsion of the flux rope. We analyze the temporal evolution of reconnection fluxes during two successive MFR eruptions while continuously emerging the twisted flux rope through the lower boundary. We also conduct a similar analysis using observational data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) for an eruptive event. Comparing our MHD simulation with observational data, we find that reconnection flux play a crucial role in determination of CME speeds. From the onset to the eruption, the reconnection flux shows a strong linear correlation with the velocity. This nearly realistic simulation of a solar eruption provides important insights into the complex dynamics of CME initiation and progression.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial black holes from an interrupted phase transition</a><span class="id">[2409.02175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a new mechanism of primordial black hole formation via an interrupted phase transition during the early matter-dominated stage of reheating after inflation. In reheating, induced by the decay of a pressureless fluid dominating the Universe at the end of inflation, dubbed as reheaton, the temperature of the radiation bath typically increases, reaching a maximum temperature $T_{\rm max}$, and then decreases. We consider a first-order phase transition induced by the increase of the temperature that is aborted as $T_{\rm max}$ is higher than the critical temperature but not sufficiently high for the bubble nucleation rate to overcome the expansion of the Universe. Although bubbles never fully occupy the space, some may be nucleated and expand until the temperature once again decreases to the critical temperature. We argue that these bubbles shrink and disappear as the temperature drops further, leaving behind macroscopic spherical regions with positive density perturbations. These perturbed regions accrete the surrounding matter (reheatons) and eventually collapse into primordial black holes whose mass continues to grow until the onset of radiation domination. We estimate the abundance of these primordial black holes in terms of the bubble nucleation rate at $T_{\rm max}$, and demonstrate that the abundance can be significantly large from a phenomenological perspective.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Effect of Massive Trans-Neptunian Objects in the Long-term Evolution and Leaking Rates of Neptune's 3:2 and 2:1 Mean Motion Resonances</a><span class="id">[2503.03900]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The current populations trapped in Neptune's main mean motion resonances in the Kuiper belt, Plutinos in the 3:2 and Twotinos in the 2:1, contain some of the best-characterized minor objects in the Solar System, given their dynamical importance.

We find that the decay rate in each resonance can be modeled as a stochastic process well described by an exponential decay with an offset determined by an underlying long-term stable population. The most massive TNOs, particularly Pluto, influence this decay rate significantly, as expected for the 3:2 resonance.

Modelling of gravitational lenses is fundamental to estimate the total mass of the lens galaxy, along with its dark matter content. Traditional modelling of gravitational lenses is computationally intensive and requires manual input. In this paper, we use a Bayesian neural network, LEns MOdelling with Neural networks (LEMON), to model Euclid gravitational lenses with a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile. Our method estimates key lens mass profile parameters, such as the Einstein radius, while also predicting the light parameters of foreground galaxies and their uncertainties. We validate LEMON's performance on both mock Euclid datasets, real lenses observed with Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and real Euclid lenses, demonstrating the ability of LEMON to predict parameters of both simulated and real lenses. Results show promising accuracy and reliability in predicting the Einstein radius, mass and light ellipticities, effective radius, Sérsic index, lens magnitude, and unlensed source position for simulated lens galaxies. The application to real data, including the latest Quick Release 1 strong lens candidates, provides encouraging results in the recovery of the parameters for real lenses. We also verified that LEMON has the potential to accelerate traditional modelling methods, by giving to the classical optimiser the LEMON predictions as starting points, resulting in a speed-up of up to 26 times the original time needed to model a sample of gravitational lenses, a result that would be impossible with randomly initialised guesses. This work represents a significant step towards efficient, automated gravitational lens modelling, which is crucial for handling the large data volumes expected from Euclid.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early solar wind and dynamo magnetic field topology predictions for (16) Psyche and other asteroids</a><span class="id">[2503.17311]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Asteroid (16) Psyche is a metal-rich body that might record an ancient coherent magnetization if some relict crust or mantle is preserved. Herein, we use magnetohydrodynamic simulations to predict (16) Psyche's field topology for several distinct pathways, (i) an early solar wind-induced magnetization imparted after a larger body was impacted, forming the present-day asteroid, (ii) a core dynamo magnetization imparted in an asteroid that is either presently largely intact or was a rubble pile, and (iii) magnetization in the turbulent solar nebula disk. For pathway (i) we find the field to be predominantly dipolar and spin axis-aligned. For pathway (ii) we find the field to be either dipolar and spin axis-misaligned, or highly multipolar. We also find that (iii) a field produced earlier before the solar nebula cleared, would be highly multipolar. In cases (i) and (ii) we also place constraints on the field strength. Simple detection of a magnetic field without constraining its topology and temporal variability would be insufficient to confirm a remanent source, due to the influence of the present-day solar wind, electromagnetic induction, and (16) Psyche's high obliquity. For sufficiently strong fields however, the field topology and orientation may reveal key observable consequences of the nature and history of (16) Psyche. Our framework is also broadly applicable to the study of magnetic fields from other asteroids.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interacting dark energy after DESI DR2: a challenge for $Λ$CDM paradigm?</a><span class="id">[2504.00994]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the scenario of interacting dark energy through a detailed confrontation with various observational datasets.

We present and validate a novel method for computing the Gaussian component of the conventional weak lensing covariance, adapted for use with void studies. We detect the stacked weak lensing void density profile at the $6.2\sigma$ level, the most significant detection of void lensing from spectroscopically-identified voids to date. We find that large and small voids have different matter density profiles, as expected from numerical studies of void profiles. This difference is significant at the $2.3\sigma$ level. Comparing the void profile to a measurement of the void-galaxy cross-correlation to test the linearity of the relationship between mass and light, we find good visual agreement between the two, and a galaxy bias factor of $2.45\pm0.36$, consistent with other works.

We test two different models to describe the evolution of neutrino emissivity with redshift, a power law model $\propto (1+z)^a$, and a model tracking the star formation history, assuming a simple power law model for the energy injection spectrum. We also consider a non-parametric reconstruction of the astrophysical neutrino emissivity as a function of redshift. We do not find any significant correlation, with our strongest results corresponding to a $1.9 \sigma$ deviation with respect to a model with zero signal. We use our measurements to place upper bounds on the bias-weighted astrophysical high-energy neutrino emission rate as a function of redshift for different source models.

They are prime targets for current interferometric searches and represent a key milestone for the capabilities of next-generation interferometers. This study aims to characterize how the gravitational waveform associated with prompt stellar convection depends on the rotational rate and magnetic field topology of the progenitor star. We carry out a series of axisymmetric simulations of a $16.5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ red supergiant with five configurations of initial magnetic fields and varying degrees of initial rotation. We then analyze the contribution of early-time convection and the proto-neutron star core to the waveform using ensemble empirical mode decomposition, alongside spectral and Fourier analyses, to facilitate comparison and interpretation of the results. Our simulations reveal that early post-bounce gravitational waves signals are dominated by the first six intrinsic mode functions, with variations due to rotation and magnetic fields influencing the signal strength. Strong magnetic fields decelerate core rotation, affecting mode excitation. Regardless of the initial rotation, convection consistently drives a low-frequency mode that lasts throughout the evolution. Additionally, our results show that the bounce signal is not consistently the strongest component of the waveform. Instead, we find that prompt convection generates a post-bounce signal of comparable or even greater amplitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perseus cluster in its X-ray entirety with SRG/eROSITA.

We combined SRG/eROSITA, XMM-Newton, and Chandra data to get a complete coverage of this cluster in X-rays up to $R_{\rm 200c}$ and beyond, although at the largest radii, spatial non-uniformities of the X-ray sky background and foreground dominate. While the Perseus central part represents a canonical cool-core structure with clear signs of AGN Feedback, the outskirts, in turn, serve as a convincing example of a merger-perturbed system. X-ray data suggest that IC310 is the main galaxy of a subcluster that merges with Perseus over the past $\sim 4\,{\rm Gyr}$. Overall, this configuration resembles the merger between the Coma cluster and the NGC4839 group. It is statistically more likely to find a merging group near the apocenter of its orbit. Therefore, it is not surprising that IC310 in Perseus has a relatively small velocity relative to the main cluster, similarly to NGC4839 in Coma. Perseus also hosts a high-velocity radio galaxy, NGC1265 (line-of-sight velocity is almost twice the virial velocity of the main cluster), which is known for its spectacular radio tail. Unless this galaxy has been accelerated by a time-variable potential associated with the merger, it has to move almost along the line of sight through the entire cluster, which would be a rare, but not a truly exceptional configuration. Both galaxies, IC310 and NGC1265, have remarkable radio tails with sharp bends that are reminiscent of a &quot;snake biting its tail&quot;. We speculate that these curious shapes are natural consequences of their (different) orbits in Perseus. For IC310, the proximity to the apocenter and the reversal of its radial velocity might play a role. For NGC1265, the nearly line-of-sight motion coupled with the gas motions in the merging system might be important.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sensitivity toward dark matter annihilation imprints on 21-cm signal with SKA-Low: A convolutional neural network approach</a><span class="id">[2508.08251]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study investigates the sensitivity of the radio interferometers to identify imprints of spatially inhomogeneous dark matter annihilation signatures in the 21-cm signal during the pre-reionization era. We focus on the upcoming low-mode survey of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Low) telescope. Using CNNs, we analyze simulated 3D 21-cm differential brightness temperature maps generated via the DM21cm code, which is based on 21cmFAST and DarkHistory, to distinguish between spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous energy injection/deposition scenarios arising from dark matter annihilation. The inhomogeneous case accounts for local dark matter density contrasts and gas properties, such as thermal and ionization states, while the homogeneous model assumes uniform energy deposition. Our study focuses on two primary annihilation channels to electron-positron pairs ($e^+e^-$) and photons ($\gamma \gamma$), exploring dark matter masses from 1 MeV to 100 MeV and a range of annihilation cross-sections. For $\gamma \gamma$ channel, the distinction across dark matter models is less pronounced due to the larger mean free path of the emitted photons, resulting in a more uniform energy deposition. For $e^+e^-$ channel, the results indicate that the CNNs can effectively differentiate between the inhomogeneous and homogeneous cases. Despite observational challenges, the results demonstrate that these effects remain detectable even after incorporating noise from next-generation radio interferometers, such as the SKA. We find that the inhomogeneous dark matter annihilation models can leave measurable imprints on the 21-cm signal maps distinguishable from the homogeneous scenarios for the dark matter masses $m_{\rm DM}=1$ MeV and the annihilation cross-sections of $\geq 5 \times 10^{-30}~{\rm cm^3/sec}$ ($\geq 5 \times 10^{-29}~{\rm cm^3/sec}$ for $m_{\rm DM}=100$ MeV) for moderate SKA-Low noise.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hurst index of gamma-ray burst light curves and its statistical study</a><span class="id">[2509.11631]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) rank among the most powerful astrophysical phenomena, characterized by complex and highly variable prompt emission light curves that reflect the dynamics of their central engines.

We further explore statistical correlations between the Hurst index and 12 other observational parameters through regression and correlation analyses. Our results reveal anti-correlations between the Hurst index and the burst durations ($T_{50}$, $T_{90}$), and moderate positive correlations with peak photon flux proxies ($P_{pk1}$–$P_{pk3}$). By contrast, the standard spectral parameters (including the low-energy index $\alpha$) show no evidence for a linear dependence on the Hurst index in our sample. We do not find a clear monotonic weakening of the correlation strength from 64 ms to 1024 ms peak-flux measures; rather, the correlation coefficients for $P_{pk1}$–$P_{pk3}$ are comparable within uncertainties. The results offer new perspectives on the temporal structure of the GRB emission and its potential link to the underlying physical mechanisms driving these bursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08309" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The MATISSE view of the inner region of the RY Tau protoplanetary disk</a><span class="id">[2511.08309]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The T-Tauri type young stellar object RY Tau exhibits a dust depleted inner cavity characteristic of a transition disk.

Employing a 2D temperature gradient model we estimate the orientation of the inner disk finding no evidence of significant misalignment between the inner and outer disk of RY Tau. Successively, we analyze the chemical composition of silicates depending on spatial region in the disk and identify several silicate species commonly found in protoplanetary disks. Additionally, a depletion of amorphous dust grains toward the central protostar is observed. Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations show that hot dust close to the protostar and in the line of sight to the observer, either in the uppermost disk layers of a strongly flared disk or in a dusty envelope, is necessary to model the observations. The shadow cast by a dense innermost disk midplane on the dust further out explains the observed closure phases in the L band and to some extent in the M band.

Results reveal fundamentally different adsorption mechanisms: weak physisorption on carbonaceous surfaces ($|\Delta\epsilon_{\rm ad}|\sim 0.1-0.2~{\rm eV}$) versus strong chemisorption on silicates ($|\Delta\epsilon_{\rm ad}|\sim 0.5-1.5~{\rm eV}$) via coordination bonds. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations incorporating these energies demonstrate divergent surface evolution: carbonaceous grains exhibit distinct condensation radius compared to silicates, while the cocrystal of H$_2$O and CO significantly increases the desorption temperature of CO. The actual radii of gas-phase molecule depletion could thus be a comprehensive result of temperatures, chemical compositions, and even evolution tracks. Meanwhile, silicates maintain chemisorbed molecular coatings throughout most disk regions. Such dichotomy in surface coverage could also provide a natural mechanism for carbon depletion in inner planetary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsed radio emission from a Central Compact Object</a><span class="id">[2512.17214]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The high magnetic fields and rapid spins of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants, such as the Crab and the Vela, established the standard pulsar model in which massive stellar explosions produce rapidly rotating, radio-luminous neutron stars.

The X-ray spectra across all epochs exhibit both neutral and ionized absorption, along with reflection features from the accretion disc, including a prominent Compton hump in the broadband data. Notably, the spectral shape varies across epochs. Our analysis suggests this variability is attributed to changes in both line-of-sight absorption and the intrinsic emission from PG 1535+547. The source is obscured by multiple layers of partially and/or fully covering neutral and ionized absorbers, with neutral column densities ranging from undetectable levels in the least obscured phase to $\sim0.3-5\times10^{23}\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ in the most obscured phase. A clear warm absorber is revealed during the least obscured phase. The continuum remains fairly consistent ($\Gamma\approx 2.2\pm0.1$) during the first two observations, followed by a substantial flux decrease (by a factor of $\sim7$ in the $2-10$ keV band) in 2016 compared to 2006. The 2016 data indicates the source is in a reflection-dominated state during this epoch, with a reflection fraction of $R&gt;7$ and an X-ray source located at a height $\leq 1.72r_g$. Simultaneous fitting of the multi-epoch data suggests a rapidly rotating black hole with a spin parameter, $a&gt;0.99$.

Owing to their asymmetric masses, gravitational-waves from neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries are prime candidates for displaying strong imprints of spin-precession. Current searches may therefore miss a significant fraction of the astrophysical population, and the detected NSBH population may be significantly suppressed or biased. Here we report the most sensitive search for NSBH binaries to date by including spin-precession for the first time. We analyze data from the entirety of the third LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA gravitational-wave observing run and show that when accounting for spin-precession, our search is up to 100% more sensitive than the search techniques currently adopted by the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA collaboration (for systems with strong precessional effects). This allows us to more tightly constrain the rate of NSBH mergers in the local Universe. When focusing on a potentially precessing subpopulation of NSBH mergers, the lack of observed candidates allows us to place an upper limit on the merger rate of $R_{90} = 79\, \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with 90% confidence. We then show that if there is no preferred direction of component spin, the overall rate of NSBH mergers is on average 16% smaller than previously believed.

This applies, in particular, to the Higgs field, making the Standard Model fermions very heavy and facilitating their production. Using the Bogolyubov coefficient approach, we compute the corresponding fermion abundance taking into account time dependence of the mass term. We find that the Standard Model fermion and the right-handed neutrino production grows dramatically compared to the naive estimate based on the low energy masses. The inflationary production mechanism can be the leading source of the right handed neutrinos, if they gain a Majorana mass from the Yukawa coupling to a light scalar.

To achieve this, we extend the SM gauge sector by an abelian gauge symmetry and a singlet scalar. Once the abelian gauge symmetry spontaneously breaks, the extra gauge boson acquires mass and becomes a suitable Dark Matter (DM) candidate. Due to the kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge group, DM can decay into SM particles. To explain the KM3NeT signal, we need $\mathcal{O}(100)$ PeV DM, which can be produced in the correct order of DM density in a low reheating scenario. In this scenario, the overabundance issue of heavy DM can be tackled by diluting its abundance through the continuous injection of entropy when the matter-like inflaton decays into the SM bath. Using the low reheating scenario, we can obtain the correct value of DM density both for freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms for super-heavy DM. Moreover, we have studied the Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced from cosmic strings, which fall within the detectable range of future proposed GW experiments. Additionally, the dominance of a quadratic inflaton potential before the reheating temperature changes the temperature-scale factor relation, which suppresses the GW spectrum at higher frequencies. Choosing an arbitrarily low reheating temperature provides only a tiny fraction of the DM density due to dilution from entropy injection. This fraction of the vector DM suggests that only the extragalactic contribution is relevant in the KM3NeT event because DM lifetime is shorter than the age of the Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Traversable wormholes inside anisotropic magnetized neutron stars: physical properties and potential observational imprints</a><span class="id">[2512.18795]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we formulate wormhole-plus-neutron-star (WH+NS) systems supported by two scalar fields, allowing for both pressure anisotropy of the neutron fluid and magnetic field.

To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.</p></div></details></article></body>
