A Lightcones Comparison Approach</a><span class="id">[2512.02067]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a geometrical approach that provides a non-perturbative technique, allowing the standard FLRW observer to evaluate a measurable, scale-dependent distance functional between her idealized FLRW past light cone and the actual physical past light cone. From the point of view of the FLRW observer, gathering data from sources at cosmological redshift $\widehat{z}$, this functional generates a geometry–structure–growth contribution ${\Omega_\Lambda(\widehat{z})}$ to the FLRW cosmological constant ${\widehat\Omega_\Lambda}$. This redshift–dependent contribution erodes the interpretation of ${\widehat\Omega_\Lambda}$ as representing constant dark energy. In particular, ${\Omega_\Lambda(\widehat{z})}$ becomes significantly large at very low $\widehat{z}$, where structures dominate the cosmological landscape. At the pivotal galaxy cluster scale, where cosmological expansion decouples from the local gravitation dynamics, we get ${\Omega_\Lambda(\widehat{z})/\widehat\Omega_\Lambda}\,=\,\mathscr{O}(1)$, showing that late–epoch structures provide an effective field contribution to the FLRW cosmological constant that is of the same order of magnitude as its assumed value. We prove that ${\Omega_\Lambda(\widehat{z})}$ is generated by a scale-dependent effective field governed by structure formation and related to the comparison between the idealized FLRW past light cone and the actual physical past light cone. These results are naturally framed in the mainstream FLRW cosmology; they do not require exotic fields and provide a natural setting for analyzing the coincidence problem, leading to an interpretative shift in the current understanding of constant dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02099" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possible $ν$ Source Class: 3-sigma Detection of High-Energy Neutrinos from Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidates</a><span class="id">[2512.02099]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Identifying the sources of high-energy (TeV-PeV) astrophysical neutrinos is crucial for studies in both astrophysics and particle physics. Despite extensive searches for more than a decade, which revealed several individual potential sources and only one potential source class, the origins of these neutrinos remain largely unresolved; thus, more source classes should be investigated. In this work, we conduct the first search for high-energy neutrino emission from a new source class, supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are also theoretically motivated. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis on our constructed catalog of 693 SMBHB candidates and 10 years of IceCube public data. Our results show positive correlations, with higher significance in more physically motivated scenarios and the highest significance at 3.0$\sigma$. In addition, we also study potential connections between SMBHBs' high-energy neutrino and nano-Hz gravitational-wave emissions, the latter being the main target of pulsar timing arrays. Our results provide the first evidence of SMBHBs being high-energy neutrino emitters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dependence of Earth Milankovitch Cycles on Martian Mass</a><span class="id">[2512.02108]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Milankovitch cycles of Earth result from gravitational interactions with other bodies in the Solar System. These interactions lead to slow changes in the orbit and angular momentum vector of Earth, and correspondingly influence Earth's climate evolution. Several studies have shown that Mars may play a significant role in these Milankovitch cycles, such as the 2.4 Myr eccentricity cycle related to perihelion precession dynamics. Here we provide the results of a detailed dynamical analysis that explores the Earth Milankovitch cycles as a function of the Martian mass to quantify the extent that Mars influences variations in Earth's orbital eccentricity, the longitude of perihelion, the longitude of the ascending node, and obliquity (axial tilt). Our results show that, although the 405 kyr long-eccentricity metronome driven by $g_2$ (Venus) and $g_5$ (Jupiter) persists at all Mars masses, the $\sim$100 kyr short-eccentricity bands driven by $g_4$ (Mars) lengthen and gain power as Mars becomes more massive, consistent with enhanced coupling among inner-planet $g$-modes. The 2.4 Myr grand cycle is absent when Mars approaches zero mass, reflecting the movement of $g_4$ with the Martian mass. Meanwhile, Earth's obliquity cycles driven by $s_3$ (Earth) and $s_4$ (Mars) lengthen from the canonical $\sim$41 kyr with increasing Mars mass, relocating to a dominant 45–55 kyr band when the mass of Mars is an order of magnitude larger than its present value. These results establish how Mars' mass controls the architecture of Earth's climate-forcing spectrum and that the Milankovitch spectrum of an Earth-like planet is a sensitive, interpretable probe of its planetary neighborhood.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic chronometers with galaxy clusters: a new avenue for multi-probe cosmology</a><span class="id">[2512.02109]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We provide a new measurement of the expansion history of the Universe at $z=0.54$ with the cosmic chronometers (CC) method, exploiting the high-quality spectroscopic VLT/MUSE data for three galaxy clusters in close-by redshift bins: SDSS J2222+2745 ($z=0.49$), MACS J1149.5+2223 ($z=0.54$), and SDSS J1029+2623 ($z=0.59$). The central one, MACS J1149.5+2223, hosts the well-known supernova 'Refsdal', which allowed for $H_0$ measurements via time delay cosmography (TDC). This represents the first step for a self-consistent probe combination, where different methods are applied to the same data sample. After selecting the most passive and massive cluster members (38 CCs), we derive their age and physical parameters via full spectrum fitting. We use the code Bagpipes, specifically modified to remove the cosmological prior on ages. On average, the CC sample shows super-solar metallicities $Z/Z_{\odot} = 1.3 \pm 0.7$, low dust extinction $A_{\rm{V}} = 0.3 \pm 0.3$ mag and to have formed in short bursts $\tau = 0.6 \pm 0.2$ Gyr. We also observe both an ageing trend in redshift and a mass-downsizing pattern. From the age-redshift trend, implementing the CC method through a bootstrap approach, we derive a new $H(z)$ measurement: $H$($z$=0.542) = $66_{-29}^{+81}$ (stat) $\pm$13 (syst) km/s/Mpc. We also simulate the impact of increased statistics and extended redshift coverage, finding that $H$($z$) uncertainties can be reduced by up to a factor of 4 with $\sim$100 CCs and a slightly broader redshift range (d$z\sim$0.2).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OASIS Survey Direct Imaging and Astrometric Discovery of HIP 71618 B: A Substellar Companion Suitable for the Roman Coronagraph Technology Demonstration</a><span class="id">[2512.02126]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the OASIS survey program discovery of a substellar companion orbiting the young A1V star HIP 71618, detected using precision astrometry from \textit{Gaia and Hipparcos} and high-contrast imaging with SCExAO/CHARIS and Keck/NIRC2. Atmospheric modeling favors a spectral type of M5–M8 and a temperature of $\sim$2700 $\pm$ 100 $K$. Dynamical modeling constrains HIP 71618 B's mass to be ${60}_{-21}^{+27}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ or ${65}_{-29}^{+54}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, depending on the adopted companion mass prior. It has a nearly edge-on, 11 au-orbit with a high eccentricity. HIP 71618 B will be located within Roman Coronagraph's dark hole region during the instrument's technological demonstration phase. A high signal-to-noise ratio detection of HIP 71618 B at 575 nm would demonstrate a 5-$\sigma$ contrast of 10$^{-7}$ or better. The system is also located within or very close to Roman's Continuous Viewing Zone – near multiple candidate reference stars for dark-hole digging – and its primary is bright ($V$ $\approx$ 5). The suitability of HIP 71618 as one potential Roman Coronagraph target for demonstrating the instrument's core requirement (TTR5) should motivate the timely, deep vetting of candidate reference stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02129" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamo and Jet interconnections in GRMHD simulations of black hole accretion disks</a><span class="id">[2512.02129]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present global 3D GRMHD simulations of black hole (BH) accretion disks designed to investigate how MRI-driven dynamo action regulates jet formation and evolution. Unlike standard SANE/MAD setups that impose a coherent large-scale poloidal loop, our &quot;sub-SANE&quot; initial conditions use multiple same-polarity small-scale magnetic loops. Rapid reconnection erases magnetic memory and enables large-scale dynamo to emerge early from MRI turbulence. We perform two such sub-SANE simulations at different BH spins ($a = 0.5, 0.9375$) and compare them with conventional SANE runs. The sub-SANE disks show regular large-scale dynamo cycles with periods of about ten orbits. Decomposition of the induction equation shows that the turbulent dynamo term is stronger in 3D compared to 2.5D and balances advection in the saturated state, confirming sustained large-scale field generation. These dynamo-generated fields are advected inward with minimal time lag, producing correlated peaks in both poloidal and toroidal field strengths from $r_{\rm max}$ to the horizon. Early in the evolution, these peaks imprint directly onto the jet's electromagnetic energy flux, indicating that the jet mirrors the dynamo wave. Though jets form at early times, the sub-SANE runs eventually undergo jet shutdown. We show that this occurs when the magnetic field at the horizon loses coherence, as quantified by a decline in the signed-to-unsigned flux ratio $\mathcal{C}_{\rm BH}$ below $\approx 0.6$. In contrast, the SANE reference case with similar accretion rate and horizon magnetic flux maintains high magnetic coherence because its initial large-scale field persists, allowing its jet to survive. Our results show that both dynamo-driven field evolution and horizon magnetic-field coherence critically regulate jet longevity, establishing a direct dynamo-jet connection in GRMHD disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Occurrence of ZLK-Induced White Dwarf Pollution with Dissipative Precession</a><span class="id">[2512.02135]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations, induced by bound, perturbative companions to white dwarfs, have been suggested as a dynamical mechanism that may contribute to white dwarf pollution. To trigger ZLK oscillations, however, a 3-body system must reach a sufficiently large mutual inclination between orbits. The occurrence of these high-mutual-inclination configurations can be curtailed by dissipative precession at the protoplanetary disk stage, which pushes exoplanet-hosting close binary systems toward preferential orbit-orbit alignment. In this work, we constrain the fraction of white dwarfs with binary companions that can undergo ZLK-driven pollution given the effects of dissipative precession. To accrete pollution via ZLK oscillations, a white dwarf binary system must be sufficiently inclined and the characteristic timescale of the oscillations must be sufficiently short to perturb material within the white dwarf's cooling age. Considering a sample of 4400 known white dwarf/main sequence binaries, we find that $50-70\%$ have favorable parameters for ZLK pollution, depending on the orbital separation of the polluting body. While the conditions for oscillations are favorable, the tendency for ZLK to result in massive but more infrequent polluters likely restricts the rates of ZLK-induced pollution among the observed population. In general, dissipative precession is a limiting factor in pollution rates for more closely separated binaries (initial separations $&lt;500-800$ au), while ZLK timescale constraints are most limiting for wider binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inefficient Circularization, Delayed Stream-Disk Interaction and Reprocessing: A Five-Stage Model for the Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Tidal Disruption Event EP240222a</a><span class="id">[2512.02147]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>EP240222a is the first intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) tidal disruption event (TDE) captured in real-time with multi-wavelength observations and spectroscopic confirmation. However, its light curves deviate substantially from previous theoretical expectations. Motivated by these unique features, we have developed a novel model that successfully reproduces its peculiar evolution. Our model delineates five stages: (1) Initial Stage of inefficient circularization; (2) Slow-Rising Stage with a faint X-ray precursor disk fed by successive self-crossings; (3) Fast-Rising Stage, where delayed stream-disk interaction at momentum flux matching drives a sharp luminosity rise; (4) Plateau Stage with super-Eddington accretion, outflow, reprocessing, and a clear polar line-of-sight; and (5) Decline Stage of sub-Eddington accretion and ongoing reprocessing. Our fit indicates the disruption of a $M_* \approx 0.4~M_\odot$ main-sequence (MS) star with a penetration factor $\beta \approx 1.0$. Our model, which incorporates key TDE processes, establishes EP240222a-like light curves as typical IMBH-TDE signatures. The distinctive identifier is a slow rise in X-rays and a corresponding slow rise/quasi-plateau in the UV/optical, followed by a brighter, super-Eddington plateau in both bands, though other forms exist, such as the rapid rise from white dwarf (WD) disruptions over minutes to days.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Nuclear Reaction Rate Uncertainties on Type I X-ray Burst Nucleosynthesis: A Monte Carlo Study</a><span class="id">[2512.02167]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To investigate the impact of nuclear reaction rate uncertainties on type I X-ray burst nucleosynthesis, comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations are performed with temperature-independent and -dependent variations in reaction rates using the REACLIB and STARLIB libraries, respectively. A total of 1,711 $(p, \gamma)$, $(p, \alpha)$, $(\alpha, p)$, and $(\alpha, \gamma)$ reactions are varied simultaneously, along with their inverse reactions, via detailed balance. For the first time, it is found that Monte Carlo sampling with larger perturbations to these reaction rates may lead to multi-peaked abundance distributions for some isotopes. These multi-peak structures arise not only from coupled reactions but also, in some cases, from single reactions. Our study also confirmed previously identified key reactions and provides more robust lists. These reactions deserve priority consideration in future study.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Energy Extractions from Horizonless Compact Objects</a><span class="id">[2512.02171]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-energy astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei, quasars, X-ray binaries, and gamma-ray bursts are powered by mechanisms that convert gravitational or rotational energy into radiation, jets, and relativistic outflows. Understanding the physics of these processes remains a major challenge. Black holes have traditionally served as the central engines behind such phenomena, with well established energy extraction mechanisms including the Penrose process, the Blandford-Znajek process, and the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. However, studies in general relativity indicate that, under certain conditions, gravitational collapse may lead to the formation of naked singularities or other horizonless compact objects, which could in principle allow more efficient energy extraction than classical black holes. This brief review summarizes recent progress on energy extraction mechanisms in naked singularity spacetimes. We examine the roles of rotation, electromagnetic fields, and particle interactions in shaping extraction efficiency and dynamics. Particular attention is given to negative energy orbits and ergoregion physics, which enable Penrose type and magnetic Penrose mechanisms without an event horizon. We also discuss collisional Penrose processes and particle acceleration near the singularity, emphasizing their potential astrophysical implications. By comparing extraction efficiencies and physical conditions in black holes and naked singularities, we highlight how the absence of a horizon fundamentally alters the dynamics of energy release. These results suggest that naked singularities may serve as natural laboratories for strong field gravity and as alternative engines for high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the era of multi-messenger observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamics of Streamers and Pseudostreamers and Implications for the Solar Wind</a><span class="id">[2512.02173]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of the Sun's slow wind and its inherent variability remain unknown, but there is increasing evidence that interaction between closed and open magnetic flux in the corona plays a role. This paper studies the dynamic evolution of streamers and pseudostreamers with a particular focus on the release of plasma from the closed to the open field region. We employ a global magnetohydrodynamic model that extends from the solar chromosphere to 30 solar radii, and that extends previous interchange magnetic reconnection modelling by including self-consistent thermodynamics. We find that at both the helmet streamer and pseudostreamer there is a continual dynamic interaction between closed and open flux. At the helmet streamer, this takes the form of a ”breathing” cycle in which the closed flux contracts and expands, and plasmoids are released along the heliospheric current sheet. The pseudostreamer exhibits a back-and-forth motion, driving interchange reconnection alternately on its opposite flanks. The resulting release of hot, dense plasma leads to density fluctuations in the open field that are significantly larger above the helmet streamer due to the persistence of the plasmoids there. Our model demonstrates that plasma is continually being released into the heliosphere from both streamers and pseudostreamers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Convective Heat Transport Asymptotic Law in an $α^2$ dynamo model</a><span class="id">[2512.02219]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar activity and planetary magnetospheres are powered by an underlying dynamo mechanism generated by magnetoconvection coupled with rotation. In astrophysical contexts, magnetoconvection typically occurs in parameter regimes that are currently inaccessible to direct numerical simulations (DNS). We investigate convective heat transfer in a magneto-convection and dynamo model under extreme parameter conditions, specifically high Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers, in a plasma flow with maximum kinetic helicity compatible with fast-rotating objects. Our approach to studying magneto-convection and dynamo mechanisms employs a simplified thermally driven shell model. Magnetic polarity reversals are obtained by including a pitchfork bifurcation term in the large-scale magnetic field equation, while nonlinear dynamics are described by a shell model formulation. The low computational cost of the model allows us to explore the asymptotic behavior of convective heat transfer in regimes beyond those reached by current DNS. Our results reveal that the Nusselt number $Nu$ – a dimensionless measure of convective heat transport– generally increases with turbulence, following a power-law scaling and showing a strong correlation with Ra and Pr. This relationship appears to be more pronounced than that observed in non-magnetized fluids, suggesting that magnetic fields may significantly enhance convective heat transfer. Despite the assumption to neglect spatial information such as density stratification – an assumption that is necessary in the shell model approach – our model captures the gross dynamical features of turbulent magnetoconvection in asymptotic regimes. It allows for a broad exploration of parameter space, indicating that magnetic fields may play a central role in modulating heat transport in stellar and planetary interiors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02237" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of the Accretion Rate of Young Intermediate Mass Stars: Implications for Disk Evolution and Planet Formation</a><span class="id">[2512.02237]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work presents a study of the evolution of the stellar accretion rates of pre-main-sequence intermediate-mass stars. We compare the accretion rate of the younger intermediate-mass T Tauri stars (IMTTSs) with the older Herbig stars into which they evolve. We find that the median accretion rate of IMTTSs (1.2$\times$10$^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is significantly lower than that of Herbig stars (1.9$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). This increase stands in stark contrast with canonical models of disk evolution that predict that the stellar accretion rate declines with age. We put forward a physically plausible scenario that accounts for the systematic increase of stellar accretion based on the increase of the effective temperature of the stars as they evolve towards the zero-age main sequence. For example, the temperature of a 2M$_{\odot}$ star will increase from 4900 K in the IMTTS phase to 9100 K during the Herbig phase. Thus, the luminosity of the far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation will increase by orders of magnitude. We propose that this increase drives a higher stellar accretion rate. The scenario we propose to account for the increase in the stellar accretion rate solves the lifetime problem for Herbig disks because the increasing stellar accretion rates require lower initial disk masses to account for present-day disk masses. This work highlights the importance of the role FUV radiation has in driving the accretion rate, predicts a large population of pre-main-sequence non-accreting A stars, and has implications for interpreting disk morphologies that may serve as signposts of embedded gas giant planets in Herbig disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02269" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The SPHINX M dwarf Spectral Grid. II. New Model Atmospheres and Spectra to Derive Fundamental Properties of mid-to-late type M-dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2512.02269]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>M-dwarfs are the most dominant stars in the Galaxy. Their interiors and atmospheres exhibit complex processes including dust condensation, convective feedback, and magnetic activity-driven heterogeneity. Standard stellar characterization methods often struggle to capture these coupled effects. Part I of this series introduced SPHINX I, a validated grid of self-consistent radiative-convective model atmospheres and spectra for M-dwarfs with up-to-date molecular opacities suitable for early-to-mid M-dwarfs. Here, we present SPHINX II, which extends the model grid to cover mid-to-late type M-dwarfs, including both gray and physically motivated condensate cloud treatments and shorter convective mixing lengths. We validate SPHINX II using 39 benchmark FGK+M binary systems observed with SpeX IRTF (Mann et al. 2014) and apply it to 32 mid-to-late-type M-dwarfs from the SpeX Prism Library. SPHINX II yields improved fits that are statistically consistent with empirical benchmarks, achieving precisions of 0.078 dex in metallicity and 0.13 dex in C/O. Across the model grid, condensate cloud mass peaks between 2100-2400 K, decreasing sharply toward both cooler and hotter temperatures. We find the onset of the cloud-free regime around 2900 K, and below 2100 K, we see formation of deep/buried clouds. As a case study, we also model Trappist-1 and show that even mass-limited silicate grains subtly modify its emergent spectrum, suppressing near-infrared flux and reddening the mid-infrared slope via shallow cloud formation near 1e-2 bar. In sum, SPHINX II provides an improved framework for constraining the fundamental properties of mid-to-late M-dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solitary Alfvén Waves</a><span class="id">[2512.02292]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a three-dimensional numerical model of a solitary spherically polarized Alfvén wave packet – an Alfvénon, characterized by open field-line topology and magnetic field reversals, resembling the switchbacks observed by Parker Solar Probe to be a nearly ubiquitous feature of turbulence in the inner heliosphere.

While magnetic flux emergence and cancellation are widely recognized as key contributors to jet formation, the mechanisms behind repeated magnetic reconnection remain poorly understood. In this letter, we report a sequence of nine recurrent jets originating from active region AR 12715 during its decay phase, where the jet activity was associated with a complex distribution of fragmented magnetic flux. Non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations reveal the presence of low-lying, current-carrying loops beneath overarching open magnetic fields near the jet footpoints. These magnetic structures were perturbed by (i) emerging flux elements and (ii) interactions between oppositely polarized moving magnetic features (MMFs). To interpret these observations, we compare them with 3D radiative MHD simulation from the Bifrost model, which reproduce jet formation driven by interacting bipolar MMFs, leading to subsequent flux cancellation in the photosphere. Our results emphasize the critical role of MMF-driven flux interactions in initiating and sustaining recurrent jet activity in active regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02296" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observing binary neutron star subpopulations with the Einstein Telescope</a><span class="id">[2512.02296]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formation channels of binary neutron stars (BNSs) remain uncertain. The detection of GW190425 by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) suggests a subpopulation of massive BNSs, possibly formed through unstable &quot;case BB&quot; mass transfer with short merger delays. We investigate whether next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) can identify and characterise such subpopulations. Using the latest LVK constraints on the BNS merger rate, we generate mock ET catalogues containing a mixture of light and heavy subpopulations. The redshift distribution of each subpopulation is modeled as the convolution of the cosmic star formation rate with a time-delay distribution: heavy BNSs have fixed short delays, while light BNSs follow power-law delays with indices -0.5,-1,-1.5. Hierarchical Bayesian analyses are then performed on catalogues of 100-5,000 events. With hundreds of detections from ET, we will be able to establish that the total mass distribution is bimodal. A few thousand events are sufficient to disentangle the redshift distributions of the two subpopulations for moderate time-delay indices (-0.5 or -1). For steeper indices (-1.5), the differences are more subtle, requiring larger catalogues, beyond what we could explore given our computational resources.

However, this requires an integration along the line-of-sight, which is time-consuming. In this work, we derive an analytical approximation formula for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$ for flat, $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM universes. We show that our approximation works well for the ranges $0.01 \leq z \leq 2$, $0.2 \leq \Omega_m \leq 1.0$ and $-3.0 \leq w \leq -0.5$, with relative fractional error to a numerically evaluated ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$ always smaller than $3.5\ \%$, in the worst case scenario, and in most cases smaller than $0.5\ \%$. Moreover, the approximation is more than $15$ ($2$) times faster than the numerical solution of $\Lambda$CDM ($w$CDM). Therefore, we hope that it could be a useful tool for the FRB community.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02360" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The first extragalactic ultra-compact X-ray binary : a candidate black hole-white dwarf system</a><span class="id">[2512.02360]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>M31 UCXB-1 is one of the brightest X-ray point sources in the bulge of M31, with a peak X-ray luminosity $ L_{\mathrm{0.5-10 \: keV}} = 2.9^{+0.2}_{-0.2} \times 10^{38} \: \mathrm{erg} \: \mathrm{s}^{-1} $. Both XMM-Newton and Chandra observations have detected an eclipsing signal with a period of about 465 seconds from this source, and we note that the periodic signal is detected exclusively during the source's high-luminosity states. This signal probably originates from its orbital motion, therefore it is an ultra-compact X-ray binary (UCXB) candidate with the highest X-ray luminosity. Our theoretical analyses show that M31 UCXB-1 is in good agreement with the luminosity-orbital period relation ($ L_{\mathrm{2-10 \: keV}}-P_{\mathrm{orb}} $) of the black hole/neutron star–white dwarf (BH/NS–WD) UCXB system. Moreover, our spectral analyses indicate that the primary in M31 UCXB-1 is more likely to be a BH rather than an NS. The results show that M31 UCXB-1 is a BH–WD system, with the shortest orbital period, the possibly strongest gravitational wave emission, and the most massive white dwarf among the known UCXBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The exotic black hole-neutron star binaries in our Galaxy</a><span class="id">[2512.02434]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It has been suggested that there are $\sim 10^5$ black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries in our Galaxy. However, despite the effort of intensive radio search for decades, none of these binaries has been found to date. These binaries are regarded as a holy grail of astronomy because they can greatly improve our understanding about relativistic systems of compact objects and fundamental physics. In this article, we propose the existence of exotic BH-NS binaries which can open a new way in searching the missing BH-NS binaries in our Galaxy. By considering the possible dark matter density spikes formed around the primordial black holes in the BH-NS binaries, we show that extremely high temperature ($\sim 10^6$ K) could be maintained on the surface of the neutron stars due to effective dark matter capture. This interesting feature can also help reveal the nature of dark matter and possibly further improve the upper limit of dark matter scattering cross section well below $10^{-47}$ cm$^2$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02526" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Updates on dipolar anisotropy in local measurements of the Hubble constant from Cosmicflows-4</a><span class="id">[2512.02526]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations show a persistent tension in the Hubble constant $H_0$, suggesting an incomplete understanding of cosmic expansion and local dynamics. Using the Cosmicflows-4 catalogue, we mapped the angular and radial variations of $H_0$ in radial shells with a distance modulus $\mu \in [29,36]$ (approximately corresponding to $[20,100]$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc) and equal-area sky patches, applied adaptive weighing, and fitted spherical harmonics up to the octupole. Our results reveal a clear, distance-decreasing dipole that remains coherent across shells, with subdominant higher-order multipoles, and the octupole fit capturing the main anisotropic features except in sparsely sampled or SDSS-dominated shells. The direction and amplitude of the dipole depend on whether the observed radial recessional velocities are corrected for peculiar velocities or not. If the correction is not applied, the dipole aligns with the major gravitational structures in the local universe. If it is applied, a global dipole still seems to be present, but the signal is much weaker and with much lower statistical significance. This decrease in the amplitude of the dipole supports the idea of a differential expansion rate in our universe, but does not clarify whether the origin is astrophysical or cosmological. Finally, we verify that, while this anisotropy could influence local measurements of the Hubble constant, its effect on the large-scale Hubble tension appears to be limited, as the distribution of galaxies hosting SNeIa, both used as calibrators to constrain $H_0$ and in the Hubble-flow, does not show a strong correlation with the dipole signal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The near-Sun Heliospheric Current Sheet, fluid and kinetic properties</a><span class="id">[2512.02572]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The heliospheric current sheet (HCS) is an important large-scale structure of the heliosphere, and, for the first time, the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission enables us to study its properties statistically close to the Sun. We visually identify the 39 HCS crossings measured by PSP below 50 \Rs during encounters 6 to 21, and investigate the occurrence and properties of magnetic reconnection, the behavior of the spectral properties of the turbulent energy cascade, and the occurrence of kinetic instabilities at the HCS. We find that 82\% of HCS crossings present signatures of reconnection jets, showing that the HCS is continuously reconnecting close to the Sun. The proportion of inward/outward jets depends on heliocentric distance, and the main HCS reconnection X-line has a higher probability of being located close to the Alfvén surface. We also observe a radial asymmetry in jet acceleration, where inward jets do not reach the local Alfvén speed, contrary to outward jets. We find that turbulence levels are enhanced in the ion kinetic range, consistent with the triggering of an inverse cascade by magnetic reconnection. Finally, we highlight the ubiquity of magnetic hole trains in the high $\beta$ environment of the HCS, showing that the mirror mode instability plays a key role in regulating the ion temperature anisotropy in HCS reconnection. Our findings shed new light on the properties of magnetic reconnection in the high $\beta$ plasma environment of the HCS, its interplay with the turbulent cascade and the role of the mirror mode instability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling Particle Acceleration and MWL Emission of a PeVatron Microquasar V4641 Sgr</a><span class="id">[2512.02574]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has recently reported five Galactic microquasars as Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) $\gamma$-ray emitters (&gt; 100 TeV). Among these sources, the microquasar V4641 Sgr exhibits $\gamma$-ray emission up to $\sim$0.8 PeV, requiring the acceleration of particles to multi-PeV energies, as well as the hardest UHE spectrum. The mechanisms behind particle acceleration to such energies are not well understood. Furthermore, the limited multi-wavelength (MWL) information on this source appears contradictory, further complicating interpretation and suggesting that V4641 Sgr may represent a particularly unusual case. In this work, we present a detailed physical model of V4641 Sgr that combines first-principles simulations of stochastic (turbulent) particle acceleration with MWL emission modeling. We adopt a leptonic scenario in which electrons are accelerated via the second-order Fermi process driven by relativistic strong turbulence ($\delta B/B \sim 1$). The particle energization is simulated using a dedicated Monte Carlo framework STRIPE that incorporates the effects of intermittent energy gains and radiative losses. The resulting accelerated electrons produce UHE $\gamma$-rays through inverse Compton scattering on both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the interstellar radiation fields (ISRF). Our model is capable of reproducing key observational characteristics of the system, including particle acceleration to energies of tens of PeV, as well as the TeV-PeV $\gamma$-ray spectrum and the hard spectral index measured by LHAASO. Nonetheless, several aspects remain unresolved, highlighting the need for deeper observational coverage and further theoretical refinement.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantification of abundance uncertainties in chemical models of exoplanet atmospheres</a><span class="id">[2512.02587]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Chemical models are routinely used to predict the atmospheric composition of exoplanets and compare it with the composition retrieved from observations, but little is known about the reliability of the calculated composition.

We found that the abundance uncertainties in the observable atmosphere are relatively small, below one order of magnitude and in many cases below a factor of two, where vertical mixing is a comparable or even larger source of uncertainty than (photo)chemical kinetics. In general, planets with a composition close to chemical equilibrium have smaller abundance uncertainties than planets whose composition is dominated by photochemistry. Some molecules, such as H2O, CO, CO2, and SiO, show low abundance uncertainties, while others such as HCN, SO2, PH3, and TiO have more uncertain abundances. We identified several critical albeit poorly constrained processes involving S-, P-, Si-, and Ti-bearing species whose better characterization should lead to a global improvement in the accuracy of models.

They are mostly of extragalactic origin, but the progenitors, trigger mechanisms and radiation processes are still largely unknown. Here we present a comprehensive analysis on 415 non-repeating FRBs detected by CHIME, applying manual filtering to ensure sample completeness. It is found that the distribution of fluence can be approximated by a three-segment power-law function, with the power-law indices being $-3.76 \pm 1.61$, $0.20 \pm 0.68$ and $2.06 \pm 0.90$ in the low, middle, and high fluence segments, respectively. Both the total dispersion measure (\text{DM}) and the extragalactic \text{DM} follow a smoothly broken power-law distribution, with characteristic break DM values of $\sim 703$ pc $\rm cm^{-3}$ and $\sim 639$ pc $\rm cm^{-3}$, respectively. The redshifts are estimated from the extragalactic \text{DM} by using the Macquart relation, which are found to peak at $ z \sim 0.6$. The isotropic energy release ($E_{\text{iso}}$) is also derived for each burst. Two-Gaussian components are revealed in the distribution of $E_{\text{iso}}$, with the major population narrowly clustered at $\sim 2.3 \times 10^{40} {\rm erg}$. The minor population have a characteristic energy of $\sim 1.6 \times 10^{39}$ erg and span approximately one order of magnitude. The distribution hints a near-uniform energy release mechanism for the dominant population as expected from some catastrophic channels, whereas the lower-energy component (potentially including repeat-capable sources) may reflect a broader diversity in FRB origins, emission mechanisms and evolutionary stages.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio, X-ray, and EUV signatures of internal and external reconnection of an erupting flux rope</a><span class="id">[2512.02594]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyse imaging (EUV, X-ray) and spectral (radio, X-ray) data obtained by ground based and space instruments on board space missions both on Earth (Fermi, Hinode, Solar Dynamics Observatory) and solar orbit (Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A), which provide a multi-directional view on the same event. The combination of EUV and X-ray images and X-ray spectra allowed us to identify hot loops in the vicinity of the filament before its eruption. We interpreted their interaction with the rising filament as a signature of an arcade-to-rope reconnection geometry. The subsequent EUV brightening within the filament revealed helical structure of the erupting rope. We explained co-temporal radio slowly positively drifting bursts as a result of beam acceleration within the magnetic rope and propagation along the helical structure. Corresponding X-ray spectra were consistent with a thermal origin. The filament rising was accompanied by co-temporal normal and reverse drift type III radio bursts. We interpreted them as a signature of a reconnection event and estimated electron density at the reconnection site. Further untwisting of the helical structure led to formation of a quasi-circular EUV structure seen from Earth and STEREO-A. Its occurrence was co-temporal with a unique tangle of radio U- and inverse U-bursts. We proposed that several accelerated beams propagate within that complex structure and generate the burst tangle. During the start of the flare hard X-ray emission was concentrated near the filament leg only suggesting predominant propagation of the beams towards its rooting. We collected multi-wavelength observations indicating interaction of the erupting magnetic flux rope with the overlying arcade and internal magnetic reconnection inside the rising flux rope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar chemistry and planet size: insights from GALAH DR4</a><span class="id">[2512.02601]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The well-known correlation between stellar metallicity and planet occurrence is strongest for giant planets, but weaker for smaller planets, suggesting that detailed elemental patterns beyond [Fe/H] may be relevant. Using abundances from the fourth data release of the GALAH spectroscopic survey, we analyzed 104 host stars with 141 confirmed transiting planets. We divide planets at 2.6 Earth radii, the theoretical threshold radius above which planets are unlikely to be pure-water worlds. We find that large-planet hosts are enriched by approximately 0.2 dex in iron and show a possible excess of highly volatile elements (C, N, O), though these measurements are affected by observational limitations, whereas small-planet hosts exhibit an enhanced contribution of the classical rock-forming elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) relative to iron, corresponding to a modest [Rock/Fe] offset of 0.06 dex, which is statistically significant, with a p value of 10^{-4}. These offsets remain significant for alternative radius cuts. A matched control sample of non-planet-host stars shows only weak and mostly statistically insignificant similar trends, confirming that the stronger chemical signatures are linked to the planetary characteristics. As our study relies on transiting planets, it mainly probes short-period systems (periods shorter than 100 days). These results refine the planet-metallicity relation, highlighting the role of the relative balance between iron, volatiles, and rock-forming elements in planet formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranger Things: A Grid-based Survey of Strange Modes in Post-Main Sequence Models</a><span class="id">[2512.02614]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a systematic survey of strange mode pulsations in Cepheids using MESA and for the linear stability analysis, MESA RSP. Our model grid spans $2-15\,M_\odot$ in mass and [Fe/H] $= -0.95$-$0.17$ ($Z = 0.0015$-$0.0200$) in metallicity, with four convective overshoot prescriptions. Strange modes were identified in a relatively small fraction ($5-12.5$ %) of models, occurring at $n_\mathrm{pg} = 5-9$, with $n_\mathrm{pg} = 6$-$7$ as the most frequent radial modes. No unstable solutions were identified beyond $n_\mathrm{pg} = 9$, in contrast to earlier studies reporting strange modes at $n_\mathrm{pg} = 10-12$. We quantified the duration of the instability crossing phase ($\tau_\mathrm{IS}$), the strange mode phase ($\tau_\mathrm{s}$), and their ratio $\mathcal{P}_\mathrm{s} = \tau_\mathrm{s} / \tau_\mathrm{IS}$. Toward higher masses, both $\tau_\mathrm{IS}$ and $\tau_\mathrm{s}$ decrease, yet their ratio shows no systematic trend with mass in models that include convective core overshoot. The absolute timescales for strange modes remain short, typically $\tau_\mathrm{s} \sim 10^{4.5}$-$10^{6}$ years, while $\tau_\mathrm{IS}$ is often an order of magnitude shorter, implying that these stars may spend a larger fraction of their life in the strange mode phase than in the instability strip itself. The extended duration of the strange mode phase may enhance the detectability of strange mode pulsators, provided that observational precision is sufficient to capture their low-amplitude variability. The predicted periods ($0.6-6.3$ days) are well covered by a single $27-$day TESS sector, making strange mode pulsators potentially detectable with current space-based photometry, although blending with nearby sources may pose challenges.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KM3NeT/ARCA stacking search for high-energy neutrinos from blazars</a><span class="id">[2512.02656]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Blazars are promising targets for neutrino astronomy, as highlighted by IceCube's identification of TXS 0506+056 as a cosmic neutrino source candidate.

A popular scenario is the interaction of the SN ejecta and O-rich circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., Circumstellar Interaction (CSI). Uncovering the progenitor system of SNe Ic-CSM plays a critical role in understanding the final evolution of a massive star to a bare C+O star. In this Letter, we present observations of SN 2022esa which we show is an SN Ic-CSM. Surprisingly, a stable periodicity of  32 days is found in its light-curve evolution with a hint of a slowly increasing period over  200 days. We argue that the main power source is likely the interaction of the SN ejecta and O-rich CSM, while the energy input by the post-SN eccentric binary interaction within the SN ejecta is another possibility. In either case, we propose a massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) star as the progenitor, in a WR-WR or WR-BH (black hole) binary that will eventually evolve to a BH-BH binary. Specifically, in the CSI scenario, the progenitor system is an eccentric binary system with an orbital period of about a year, leading to the observed periodicity through the modulation in the CSM density structure. We also show that some other objects, superluminous SN I 2018ibb (a pair-instability SN candidate) and peculiar SN Ic 2022jli (the first example showing stable periodic modulation), show observational similarities to SNe Ic-CSM and may be categorized as SN Ic-CSM variants. Complemented with a large diversity in their light-curve evolution, we propose that SNe Ic-CSM (potentially linked to SNe Ibn/Icn) are a mixture of multiple channels that cover a range of properties in the progenitor star, the binary companion, and the binary orbit.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02693" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for persistent radio emission towards selected localised Fast Radio Burst positions using the MeerKAT Telescope</a><span class="id">[2512.02693]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio pulses originating from cosmological distances, as indicated by their large dispersion measures.

We analysed spectropolarimetric data collected for 15 G-M type stars with Neo-Narval, HARPSpol, and SPIRou to assess the detectability of the large-scale magnetic field. For three stars we reconstructed the magnetic field topology and its temporal evolution via Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). Such reconstructions were then used to perform 3D MHD simulations of the stellar wind and environment impinging on the hosted exoplanets. We detected the magnetic field of six stars. Of these, we performed ZDI reconstructions for the first time of TOI-1860 and DS Tuc A, and for the second time of HD 63433, providing temporal information of its large-scale magnetic field. Consistently with previous results on young ($\rm\sim 50-100~Myr$) solar-like stars, the large-scale magnetic field is moderately strong (30-60 G on average) and complex, with a significant fraction of magnetic energy in the toroidal component and high-order poloidal components. We found the orbit of TOI-1860 b to be almost completely sub-Alfvénic, the orbits of DS Tuc A b and HD 63433 d to be trans-Alfvénic, and the orbits of HD 63433 b and c to be super-Alfvénic. We obtained marginal detections of the magnetic field for TOI-836 and TOI-2076, and detections for TOI-1136, but the number of observations is not sufficient for magnetic mapping. A magnetic star-planet connection can occur for most of TOI-1860 b's orbit. This can happen more sporadically for DS Tuc A b and HD 63433 c given the lower fraction of their orbit in the sub-Alfvénic regime. The orbit of HD 63433 c is nevertheless more sub-Alfvénic than previously simulated owing to the temporal evolution of the stellar magnetic field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VHE FSRQs with Fermi-LAT: VHE and even brighter states in high-z FSRQs due to an HBL-like component?</a><span class="id">[2512.02839]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Very high-energy (VHE) detected flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) are relatively few despite being the most persistent bright MeV-GeV sources. Focusing on VHE emission, we investigated the spectral and temporal properties of VHE-detected FSRQs using 14-year Fermi-LAT data. All are highly variable (flux-amplitude$&gt;$100) with VHE detection associated with brighter flux states and relatively harder spectra. Above a flux limit, flux anti-correlates with spectral index, exhibiting a bluer-when-brighter trend. The low-flux state spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all resembles a power-law, while high-flux and VHE-associated states resemble a log-parabola, accompanied by an almost nil (PKS0736+017, PKS1510-089) to marginal (4C+21.35, 3C279) to significant (B21420+32, TON0599, PKS1441+25, S30218+35, PKS0346-27, OP313) MeV-GeV peak-upshift – more prominent in high-redshift sources. For no/marginal peak-upshift, the VHE emission is consistent with external Comptonization of infrared photons (EC-IR) driven primarily by a power-law continuation of the particle spectrum to higher energies. For those with a significant MeV-GeV peak-upshift, PKS0346-27 and OP313 shows peak-upshift in the synchrotron spectrum, and thus VHE is EC-IR origin, while for others without synchrotron-peak upshift, we attribute the VHE to an HBL-like component with a Compton-Dominance (CD) like FSRQs, with VHE driven primarily by particle spectrum continuation. In some, even high-state SEDs seem to require an HBL-like component. Thus, VHE activities in FSRQs mainly result from particle spectrum continuation, aided by spectral transition or a new HBL-like component with FSRQ-like CD. Such spectral changes naturally brighten the GeV-VHE flux, overcoming extragalactic background light absorption without requiring extraordinary brightening under the traditional EC-IR scenario than normally exhibited.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02880" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights into Extragalactic Background Light constraints with MAGIC archival data</a><span class="id">[2512.02880]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) is the accumulated light emitted throughout the history of the universe, spanning the UV, optical, and IR spectral ranges. Stars and dust in galaxies are expected to be the main source of the EBL. However, recent direct measurements performed beyond Pluto's orbit (less affected by foregrounds than those performed from the Earth) hint at an EBL level in the optical band larger than the one expected from the integrated contribution of known galaxy populations. One approach that could solve this controversy uses Very High Energy (VHE) photons coming from sources at cosmological distances. These photons can interact with the EBL producing electron-positron pairs, a process that leaves an imprint on the observed VHE spectrum. This technique, however, requires assumptions on the intrinsic spectrum of the source, which can compromise the robustness of EBL constraints. In this contribution, we used Monte Carlo simulations and archival data of the MAGIC telescopes to study the impact that the assumptions adopted in the literature have on the estimate of the EBL density, and how using more generic ones would modify the results. Our results show how the EBL density constraints obtained highly depend on the intrinsic spectral shape assumed for the source. We have studied two different methods to reduce the assumptions on the intrinsic spectral shape to get more robust results.

We constrain the impact of baryon feedback on the matter power spectrum by jointly analysing X-ray gas mass fractions from the eROSITA and HSC-XXL samples and SDSS/DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect profiles; the samples are characterised with galaxy-galaxy lensing and together span group and cluster masses at $0&lt;z&lt;1$. Using the baryonification framework, our joint eROSITA and kSZ model gives precise constraints on the suppression of the matter power spectrum: $10 \pm 2\%$ at $k=1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The inferred gas profiles are more extended and the power suppression is stronger than predicted by the fiducial models of recent hydrodynamical simulation suites, including FLAMINGO and BAHAMAS. The HSC-XXL gas mass fractions, which the fiducial simulations were calibrated to reproduce, prefer more moderate power suppression than the kSZ and eROSITA data: $5 \pm 4\%$ at $k=1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. With a simulated LSST Year 1 weak lensing analysis, we demonstrate a framework for next-generation surveys: calibrating feedback models with multi-wavelength gas observables to recover the small-scale statistical power of cosmic shear.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linearly Polarized Gravitational Waves from Bubble Collisions</a><span class="id">[2512.02137]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Physics beyond the Standard Model may give rise to first-order phase transitions proceeding via the nucleation of vacuum bubbles, whose subsequent collisions generate gravitational waves (GWs).

Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington–Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev–Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $\beta$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $\beta$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $\omega_R$ and the damping rate $-\omega_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $\beta$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($\omega_R \approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02847" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflationary assessment of $F(\mathcal{R},\tilde{\mathcal{R}})$ Einstein-Cartan models</a><span class="id">[2512.02847]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the framework of $F(\mathcal{R},\tilde{\mathcal{R}})$ Einstein-Cartan gravity with an action depending both of the Ricci scalar and the so-called Holst-invariant curvature we consider models that include cubic terms of the latter in the action and study their inflationary behavior.

The simplest versions of $\alpha$-attractors, T- and E-models, originate from theories with non-singular potentials. In canonical variables, these potentials have a plateau that is approached exponentially fast at large values of the inflaton field $\varphi$. In a closely related class of polynomial $\alpha$-attractors, or P-models, the potential is not singular, but its derivative is singular at the boundary. The resulting inflaton potential also has a plateau, but it is approached polynomially. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of potentials, which can be singular at the boundary of the moduli space, S-models. These potentials may have a short plateau, after which the potential may grow polynomially or exponentially at large values of the inflaton field. We will show that this class of models may provide a simple solution to the initial conditions problem for $\alpha$-attractors and may account for a very broad range of possible values of $n_{s}$ matching the recent ACT, SPT, and DESI data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Topological Shell Structures in Neutron Stars: Effects on Equilibrium, Oscillations, and Gravitational-Wave Signatures</a><span class="id">[2512.03016]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the structural and dynamical consequences of introducing a distributional density profile inside a neutron star, representing a massless, topological shell located at an arbitrary radius.

We begin by clarifying under what conditions standard simplifications -such as the coincident gauge or General Relativity (GR)-like connections- inadvertently lead to GR behavior, even in non-trivial $f(\mathbb{Q})$ models. Building on previous work in black hole (BH) spacetimes, we adapt the formalism to NS and extend it to non-vacuum configurations. Focusing on two representative models, $f(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q} + \alpha \mathbb{Q}^2$ and $f(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q}^\beta$, our analysis suggests that, under standard regularity assumptions, solutions with Maclaurin/Laurent-type series recover GR dynamics, pointing to more intricate structures as the likely seat of beyond-GR effects, and reflecting the constraints imposed by the connection's dynamics on the asymptotic behavior of genuinely beyond-GR solutions. We then formulate the problem as a boundary value problem (BVP) and highlight the numerical pathologies that may arise, together with possible strategies to prevent them. This work aims to provide a concrete framework for future numerical studies and outlines the theoretical consistency conditions required to construct physically meaningful beyond-GR NS solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WASP-39b: exo-Saturn with patchy cloud composition, moderate metallicity, and underdepleted S/O</a><span class="id">[2301.08492]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>WASP-39b is one of the first extrasolar giant gas planets that has been observed within the JWST ERS program. Fundamental properties that may enable the link to exoplanet formation differ amongst retrieval methods, for example metallicity and mineral ratios. In this work, the formation of clouds in the atmosphere of WASP-39b is explored to investigate how inhomogeneous cloud properties (particle sizes, material composition, opacity) may be for this intermediately warm gaseous exoplanet. WASP-39b's atmosphere has a comparable day-night temperature median with sufficiently low temperatures that clouds may form globally. The presence of clouds on WASP-39b can explain observations without resorting to a high (&gt; 100x solar) metallicity atmosphere for a reduced vertical mixing efficiency. The assessment of mineral ratios shows an under-depletion of S/O due to condensation compared to C/O, Mg/O, Si/O, Fe/O ratios. Vertical patchiness due to heterogeneous cloud composition challenges simple cloud models. An equal mixture of silicates and metal oxides is expected to characterise the cloud top. Further, optical properties of Fe and Mg silicates in the mid-infrared differ significantly which will impact the interpretation of JWST observations. We conclude that WASP-39b's atmosphere contains clouds and the underdepletion of S/O by atmospheric condensation processes suggest the use of sulphur gas species as a possible link to primordial element abundances. Over-simplified cloud models do not capture the complex nature of mixed-condensate clouds in exoplanet atmospheres. The clouds in the observable upper atmosphere of WASP-39b are a mixture of different silicates and metal oxides. The use of constant particles sizes and/or one-material cloud particles alone to interpret spectra may not be sufficient to capture the full complexity available through JWST observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extremely luminous optical afterglow of an energetic gamma-ray burst GRB 230204B</a><span class="id">[2412.18152]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Robotic telescope networks play an important role in capturing early and bright optical afterglows, providing critical insights into the energetics and emission mechanisms of GRBs.

Time-resolved spectral analysis reveals a transition in the prompt emission from hard (sub-photospheric dominated) spectra during early pulses to softer (synchrotron radiation dominated) spectra in later pulses, indicative of a hybrid jet composition. We report the discovery and characterization of the optical afterglow using the MASTER and BOOTES robotic telescope networks, which enabled rapid follow-up observations starting at $\sim$1.3 ks post-burst. The optical luminosity at this time was exceptionally high, surpassing that of many other optically bright GRBs, such as GRB 990123, GRB 080319B, etc. This places the burst among the most luminous optical GRBs observed to date. Long-term radio observations extending to 335 days post-burst were conducted with the ATCA. Multi-wavelength modeling was conducted using an external ISM forward-shock top-hat jet model with \sw{afterglowpy}. The results reveal a narrow and highly collimated jet with a circumburst density of $n_{0} \sim$ 28.12 cm$^{-3}$, kinetic energy $E_{\rm K} \sim$ 4.18 $\times 10^{55}$ erg, and a relatively low value of $\epsilon_{B}$ = 2.14 $\times 10^{-6}$, indicating shock-compression of magnetic field in the surrounding interstellar medium.

These can be measured with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), respectively. Here, we use recent DESI DR1, Pantheon+, SH0ES and DES-SN5YR data to test this fundamental relation. We employ a parametrised approach and also use model-independent Generic Algorithms (GA), which are a machine learning method where functions evolve loosely based on biological evolution. When we use DESI and Pantheon+ data without Cepheid calibration or big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), there is a $2\sigma$ violation of the DDR in the parametrised approach. Then, we add high-redshift BBN data and the low-redshift SH0ES Cepheid calibration. This reflects the Hubble tension since both data sets are in tension in the standard cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM. In this case, we find a significant violation of the DDR in the parametrised case at $6\sigma$. Replacing the Pantheon+ SNe Ia data by DES-SN5YR, we find similar results. For the model-independent approach, we find no deviation in the uncalibrated case and a small deviation with BBN and Cepheids which remains at 1$\sigma$. This shows the importance of considering model-independent approaches for the DDR.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time-resolved spectro-polarimetric analysis of extremely bright GRB 230307A: Possible Evidence of evolution from photospheric to synchrotron dominated emission</a><span class="id">[2504.05038]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The radiation mechanisms powering Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their physical processes remain one of the unresolved questions in high-energy astrophysics.

GRB 230307A, the second-brightest long-duration GRB ever detected, exhibits a rare association with a Kilonova, offering a unique and rare probe into the emission processes of GRBs originating from compact object mergers. We present a comprehensive time-averaged and time-resolved spectro-polarimetric analysis of GRB 230307A using joint observations from the $AstroSat$ Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI), the $Fermi$ Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and $Konus$-Wind. Spectral analysis reveals a temporal evolution in the low-energy photon index, $\alpha$, transitioning from a hard to a softer state over the burst duration. Time-averaged polarimetric measurements yield a low polarization fraction ($&lt;$ 12.7 %), whereas time-resolved polarization analysis unveils a marked increase in polarization fractions ($&gt;$ 49 %) in the later stages of the emission episode. This spectro-polarimetric evolution suggests a transition in the dominant radiative mechanism: the initial phase, possibly characterized by thermal-dominated photospheric emission (unpolarized or weakly polarized), gives way to a regime dominated by non-thermal synchrotron emission (highly polarized).

The complexity of their progenitor systems, explosion physics and intrinsic diversity poses not only challenges for their understanding as astrophysical objects, but also for their standardization and use as cosmological probes. Near-infrared (NIR) observations offer a promising avenue for studying the physics of SNeIa and for reducing systematic uncertainties in distance estimations, as they exhibit lower dust extinction and smaller dispersion in peak luminosity than optical bands. Here, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to a sample of SNeIa with well-sampled NIR (YJH-band) light curves to identify the dominant components of their variability and constrain physical underlying properties. The theoretical models of Kasen2006 are used for the physical interpretation of the PCA components, where we found the 56Ni mass to describe the dominant variability. Other factors, such as mixing and metallicity, were found to contribute significantly as well. However, some differences are found between the components of the NIR bands which may be attributed to differences in the explosion aspects they each trace. Additionally, the PCA components are compared to various light-curve parameters, identifying strong correlations between some components and peak brightness in both the NIR and optical bands, particularly in the Y band. When applying PCA to NIR color curves, we found interesting correlations with the host-galaxy mass, where SNeIa with redder NIR colors are predominantly found in less massive galaxies. We also investigate the potential for improved standardization in the Y band by incorporating PCA coefficients as correction parameters, leading to a reduction in the scatter of the intrinsic luminosity of SNeIa.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarization Angle Orthogonal Jumps in Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2504.07449]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, polarization angle (PA) orthogonal jumps over millisecond timescales were discovered from three bursts of a repeating fast radio burst source FRB 20201124A by the FAST telescope. In general, PA jumps can arise from the coherent or incoherent superposition of two electromagnetic waves, with total polarization fraction remains constant in the former and not in the latter. The observations seem to be more consistent with incoherent superposition. The amplitudes of the two orthogonal modes are required to be comparable when jumps occur. We provide general constraints on FRB emission and propagation mechanisms based on the data. Physically, it is difficult to produce PA jumps through switching the dominance of the two orthogonal modes within millisecond timescales, and a geometric effect due to the source rotation is more plausible. This requires that the emission region be within the magnetosphere of a spinning central engine, likely a magnetar. The two orthogonal modes in different directions can arise when the source rotation brings two independent emission regions with different dominant modes successively into the line-of-sight, either due to intrinsic radiation mechanisms or the O-mode undergoing a delayed transparency because of the Alfvén-O-mode conversion. Splitting of emission directions for the two modes due to plasma birefringence is not easy to achieve when the plasma is moving relativistically. For intrinsic radiation mechanisms, curvature radiation always predicts $|E_{\rm X}/E_{\rm O}|\gtrsim1$, and is difficult to produce jumps; whereas inverse Compton scattering can achieve the conversion amplitude ratio $|E_{\rm X}/E_{\rm O}|=1$ to allow jumps to occur under special geometric configurations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of magnetic field gradients on the development of the MRI: Applications to binary neutron star mergers and proto-planetary disks</a><span class="id">[2505.01208]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is widely believed to play a central role in generating large-scale, poloidal magnetic fields during binary neutron star mergers. However, the few simulations that begin with a weak seed magnetic field and capture its growth until saturation predominantly show the effects of small-scale turbulence and winding, but lack convincing evidence of MRI activity. In this work, we investigate how the MRI is affected by the complex magnetic field topologies characteristic of the post-merger phase, aiming to assess the actual feasibility of MRI in such environments. We first derive the MRI instability criterion, as well as expressions for the characteristic wavelength and growth timescale of the fastest-growing modes, under conditions that include significant magnetic field gradients. Our analysis reveals that strong radial magnetic field gradients can impact significantly on the MRI, slowing its growth or suppressing it entirely if large enough. We then apply this extended framework to both idealized analytical disk models and data from a numerical relativity simulation of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant. We find that conditions favourable to MRI growth on astrophysically relevant timescales may occur only in limited regions of the post-merger disk, and only at late times $t\gtrsim 100$ ms after the merger. These results suggest that the MRI plays a limited role in amplifying poloidal magnetic fields in post-merger environments during the first $\mathcal{O}(100)$ms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20824" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planck Constraints on Axion-Like Particles through Isotropic Cosmic Birefringence</a><span class="id">[2506.20824]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present constraints on isotropic cosmic birefringence induced by axion-like particles (ALPs), derived from the analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization measurements obtained with the high-frequency channels of Planck.

In order to observationally distinguish well-motivated and physical parametrisations from unphysical ones, it is crucial to understand the theoretical priors that physical parametrisations place on the phenomenology of dark energy. To this end we discuss a range of theoretical priors that can be imposed on general dark energy parametrisations, and their effect on the constraints on the phenomenology of dynamical dark energy. More specifically, we investigate both the phenomenological $\{\mu,\Sigma\}$ parametrisation as well as effective field theory (EFT) inspired approaches to model dark energy interactions.

We demonstrate that for specific combinations of energy and angular momentum, global shock solutions naturally emerge between multiple sonic points. These shocks are sustained in both corotating and counter-rotating cases, and their locations depend on specific energy, angular momentum, and the spin of the black hole which is in good agreement with analytical solutions. In magnetized flows, weak magnetic fields preserve the shock structure, whereas strong fields suppress it, enhancing turbulence and driving powerful, magnetically dominated jets/outflows. The strength and structure of the outflow also depend on a black hole spin and magnetization, with higher black hole spin parameters leading to faster jets.

Gas is detected both in $^{12}$CO (2-1) emission through ALMA Band 6 observations and in absorption in Ca II K and H, seen with high-resolution UVES spectroscopy. $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O (2-1) are not detected. The star exhibits a 12 $\mu$m fractional excess of $7.86^{+0.11}_{-2.27}$, placing it in the transition stage between protoplanetary and debris discs. Our detection of 1.3 mm emission yields the dust mass of 0.019$\pm$0.009 $M_{\oplus}$ assuming 115 K temperature. The $^{13}$CO non-detection places an upper limit on CO gas mass of $\sim$10$^{-2}$ $M_{\oplus}$. The $^{12}$CO detection yields a CO gas mass of (7.86$\pm$2.05)$\times$10$^{-5}$ $M_{\oplus}$ or (1.62$\pm$0.17)$\times$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\oplus}$ assuming a gas temperature of 20 K or 50 K, respectively. These should be considered as lower limits since $^{12}$CO emission may be optically thick. With UVES, we find variability in Ca II K and H lines, which can be interpreted by transiting circumstellar gas, ruling out interstellar absorption as their origin. Both the dust mass, which is within an order of magnitude of HD 141569, and the gas mass derived here indicate a late gas dispersal stage of the protoplanetary disc. Through our analysis we deem the alternative age of 800 Myr unlikely.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Macromodel-free flux-ratio prediction in quadruply imaged quasars with local constraints from lensed arcs</a><span class="id">[2509.05416]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful cosmological probe, providing a direct tool to unveil the properties of dark matter (DM) on sub-galactic scales. In particular, flux-ratio anomalies in quadruply imaged quasars (&quot;quads&quot;) can reveal the presence of dark substructure, such that population-level statistics can be used to constrain the particle nature of DM. Current methods, however, rely on globally parametrized models (&quot;macromodels&quot;) of the lens mass distribution, which impose rigid physical assumptions on the deflection field. Given the high stakes, it is important to develop complementary methods that do not require the assumption of a macromodel. One promising avenue consists of modeling the resolved emission from the quasar host galaxy (lensed arcs) using a local lensing formalism like the Curved Arc Basis (CAB) description. In this paper, we test the ability of CAB models to predict flux ratios from mock imaging data. We find that CAB model-predicted flux ratios accurately reproduce the expected values, with a typical precision of $\sim 3-5\%$. While a macromodel-based approach yields smaller uncertainties, as expected, the CAB method permits a more flexible, local description of the deflection field, thus being more robust to angular structure in the main deflector mass profile, in particular avoiding false-positive detections of flux-ratio anomalies that can arise with overly simplistic parametrizations. On the other hand, by injecting individual DM halos near quasar images, we demonstrate that CAB models do not absorb the local lensing perturbations from DM substructure, and can therefore distinguish flux-ratio anomalies caused by DM substructure from other sources of small-scale perturbation. We conclude that CAB models can be used to infer DM properties from flux-ratio anomaly statistics with minimal assumptions, complementing the traditional macromodel based approach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25695" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiative hydrodynamic simulations of FIP fractionation in solar flares</a><span class="id">[2509.25695]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Elemental abundances in solar flares are observed to vary both spatially and temporally, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. There is an interplay between advection and the preferential acceleration of low first ionization potential (FIP) elements that likely shapes the observed abundance distributions. Models of the FIP effect predict enhancements near loop footpoints that diffuse upward over time. We simulate strong evaporation events that advect this low-FIP enhancement into the corona. When the enhancement is sharply peaked, the corona does not become fractionated, exhibiting only a localized abundance peak near the loop apex that facilitates coronal rain formation. In contrast, a broad enhancement with relatively weak heating yields a uniformly fractionated corona, which is not sufficient for coronal rain formation. As the heating rate increases, the low-FIP enhanced plasma is increasingly compressed toward the loop apex, and rain is able to form. These results suggest a potential observational correlation between the presence and amount of coronal rain, the strength of flare heating, and the fractionation process itself.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Low-energy Radio Bursts from Magnetar XTE J1810$-$197: Implications for Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2511.13856]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetars are the leading candidate sources of fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, the observational probes of the connections between magnetars and FRBs are severely limited by the paucity of detection of highly energetic radio events from magnetars – to date, only one radio burst as energetic as FRBs has been detected from a Galactic magnetar. Here, we present a detailed analysis of a large sample of low-energy bursts detected from the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197, and probe their implications for FRB emission from magnetars. We report detection of over 97000 bright radio pulses from 242 observations of the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197 over 4.5 years and two decades in frequency (300 MHz to 6.15 GHz), using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope, after its recent outburst onset in December 2018. We present detailed analysis of the burst fluence distributions and their trends with time as well as frequency, and the waiting time distribution. We show that XTE J1810$-$197 rapidly switches between pulsar-like and giant-pulse-like emission states, and magnetars like XTE J1810$-$197 remain viable and likely emitters of FRBs, in the form of giant-pulses with energies comparable to FRBs. We also demonstrate that the lack of the detection of an underlying periodicity in the bursts from repeating FRBs might be caused by emission across a wide range of spin phases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18939" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the planetary forcing of the Solar dynamo: Evidence from a Lagrangian framework</a><span class="id">[2511.18939]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Whether planetary motions influence the solar magnetic cycle has remained an open question due to the lack of a rigorous physical mechanism. Here we develop a Lagrangian framework based on the Virial theorem to show that planetary orbital angular momentum modulates the Sun's rotation through barycentric dynamics, consistent with angular momentum conservation. Using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) applied to sunspot number (SSN) and terrestrial length-of-day (LOD) records spanning the past 250 years, we identify two non-linear trends plus 11 common pseudo-cycles whose periods match those of planetary resonances (LR$^{*}$). We then demonstrate that a reduced nonlinear $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo model, forced solely by the summed planetary right ascension RA(t), reproduces both the Schwabe cycle and its multi-decadal envelope, including the Dalton Minimum and the Modern Maximum. These results provide strong evidence, based on a physically-grounded model, that the solar dynamo is weakly forced by planetary motion, suggesting that the solar dynamo, classically viewed as autonomous, may in fact behave as a synchronized system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holographic complexity and the Hubble tension: a quantum gravity portrayal for the large scale structure of the cosmos</a><span class="id">[2312.05267]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this letter, we propose a relationship between the so-called Hubble-Lemaître constant $H_{0}$ and holographic complexity related to the emergence of spacetime in quantum gravity.

While the generic nature of inflation in LQC is well-established, the subsequent reheating phase-the process that thermalizes the universe and marks the beginning of the hot big bang has remained unexplored in this quantum gravitational framework. This paper presents the first comprehensive integration of the (generalized) reheating mechanism into the LQC paradigm. Using the Power Law Plateau potential and comparing predictions with the latest Planck 2018 and ACT 2025 data, we demonstrate that the inclusion of a reheating phase with a generic equation of state is fully consistent with the cosmological constraints. In addition, using the observational data for the amplitude and spectral index of the scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, we also constrain the total number of e-folds from the bounce to the present day and find a lower bound, which is less constrained than that obtained previously from the fitting of the high-$l$ CMB temperature power spectrum (TT), the polarization data (TT, TE, EE) and the low-$l$ polarization data (lowP).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15272" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Superheavy dark matter from the natural inflation in light of the highest-energy astroparticle events</a><span class="id">[2504.15272]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Superheavy dark matter has been attractive as a candidate of particle dark matter. We propose a “natural&quot; particle model, in which the dark matter serves as the inflaton in natural inflation, while decaying to high-energy particles at energies of $10^{9}-10^{13} \, \text{GeV}$ from the prediction of the inflation. A scalar field responsible for diluting the dark matter abundance revives the natural inflation either with or without the recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and baryon acoustic oscillation results from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Since the dark matter must be a spin-zero scalar, we carefully study the galactic dark matter 3-body decay into fermions and two body decays into a gluon pair, and point out relevant multi-messenger bounds that constrain these decay modes. Interestingly, the predicted energy scale may coincide with the AMATERASU event and/or the KM3NeT neutrino event, KM3-230213A. We also point out particle models with dark baryon to further alleviate $\gamma$-ray bounds. This scenario yields several testable predictions for the UHECR observations, including the highest-energy neutrons that are unaffected by magnetic fields, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of spectral indices, $\alpha_s\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(0.001)$, and the existence of light new colored particles that could be accessible at future collider experiments. Further measurements of high-energy cosmic rays, including their components and detailed directions, may provide insight into not only the origin of the cosmic rays but also inflation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equation of state and Fermi liquid properties of dense matter based on chiral effective field theory interactions</a><span class="id">[2504.18259]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results for the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter obtained in many-body-perturbation theory (MBPT) up to third order, based on various chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions used in ab initio calculations of nuclei.

However, at the same order in spacetime derivatives as the $R^2$ term, an effective theory of spacetime geometry must also include the Weyl-squared curvature invariant $W^2$. In this paper, we study the inflationary predictions of the gravitational theory with action of the form $R+\alpha R^2 - \beta W^2$, where the coupling constant $\alpha$ sets the scale of inflation, and corrections due to the $W^2$ term are treated self-consistently via reduction of order in an expansion in the coupling constant $\beta$, at the linear order in $\beta/\alpha$. Cosmological perturbations are found to be described by an effective action with a nontrivial speed of sound $c_{\textrm{s}}$ for scalar and $c_{\textrm{t}}$ for tensor modes, satisfying the relation $c_{\textrm{t}}/c_{\textrm{s}} \simeq 1+ \frac{\beta}{6\, \alpha}$ during the inflationary phase. Within this self-consistent framework, we compute several primordial observables up to the next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N3LO). We find the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 3(1-\frac{\beta}{6\alpha})(n_\textrm{s}-1)^2$, the tensor tilt $n_{\textrm{t}}\simeq-\frac{r}{8}$ and the running of the scalar tilt $\mathfrak{a}_{\textrm{s}}\simeq-\frac{1}{2} (n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^2$, all expressed in terms of the observed scalar tilt $n_{\textrm{s}}$. We also provide the corresponding corrections up to N3LO, $\mathcal{O}((n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^3)$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11204" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational scattering of two neutron stars</a><span class="id">[2506.11204]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first numerical relativity simulations of the gravitational scattering of two neutron stars. Constraint-satisfying initial data for two equal-mass nonspinning sequences are constructed at fixed energy and various initial angular momenta (impact parameter) and evolved with Einstein equations through the scattering process. The strong-field scattering dynamics are explored up to scattering angles of $220^\circ$ and the threshold of dynamical captures. The transition to bound orbits is aided by significant mass ejecta up to baryon mass ${\sim}0.1M_\odot$. A quantitative comparison with predictions of the scattering angle from state-of-the-art effective-one-body and post-Minkowskian calculations indicates quantitative agreement for large initial angular momenta although significant discrepancies in the tidal contribution emerge toward the capture threshold. Gravitational waveforms and radiated energy are in qualitative agreement with the analogous black hole problem and state-of-the-art effective-one-body predictions. Toward the capture threshold waveforms from scattering dynamics carry a strong imprint of matter effects, including the stars' $f$-mode excitations during the close encounter. Overall, our simulations open a new avenue to study tidal interactions in the relativistic two-body problem.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Impersonation: $\mathcal{W}$-Solitons as Prototypical Black Hole Microstates</a><span class="id">[2509.18245]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze a new class of static, smooth geometries in five-dimensional supergravity, dubbed $\mathcal{W}$-solitons. They carry the same mass and charges as four-dimensional Reissner-Nordström-like black holes but replace the horizon with a Kaluza-Klein bubble supported by electromagnetic flux. These solutions provide analytically tractable prototypes of black hole microstates in supergravity, including a new, relevant neutral configuration involving a massless axion field. Focusing on photon scattering and scalar perturbations, we compute their key observables, aiming to identify mesoscopic observables. We find that $\mathcal{W}$-solitons feature a single photon sphere, qualitatively similar to that of the black hole but with quantitative differences. They have only short-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs), as black holes, while long-lived echo modes seen in other ultracompact horizonless objects are absent. As a result, the ringdown closely resembles that of a black hole while still showing sizable deviations. The latter are at the ${\mathcal{O}}(10\%)$ level, compatible with the recent measurement of GW250114 and potentially falsifiable in the near future. Finally, we show that $\mathcal{W}$-solitons are stable under scalar perturbations. Our results underscore the qualitative similarities between $\mathcal{W}$-solitons and black holes, reinforcing their relevance as smooth black hole microstate prototypes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaotic Inflation RIDES Again</a><span class="id">[2511.05799]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Following the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) results, we revisit chaotic inflation based on a single complex scalar field with mass term $M^2 |\Phi|^2$, which usually predicts a spectra index $n_s\approx 0.96$ but a too-large tensor to scalar ratio $r\approx 0.16$.
