<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comment on Classical-Gravity–Quantum-Matter Claims About Gravity-Mediated Entanglement</a><span class="id">[2511.20717]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A recent paper by Aziz and Howl (Nature 2025) argues that, once quantum matter is described at the level of quantum field theory and coupled to a classical gravitational field, higher order processes can generate entanglement between two spatially separated masses. A contemporaneous critical note (Marletto, Oppenheim, Vedral, Wilson, arXiv:2511.07348v1 ) shows that, in the actual nonrelativistic limit employed there, the interaction becomes ultra local, the total unitary factorizes, and no entanglement is generated from a product input. In this comment we (i) restate the core point of that critique, (ii) give a channel theoretic reformulation that makes the conclusion model independent, and (iii) clarify the distinction between activation of entanglement in already quantum matter and genuine mediation of entanglement by a classical field. Once these clarifications are in place, the standard BMV inference that observation of gravity mediated entanglement strongly indicates nonclassical gravitational degrees of freedom remains intact.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to be an orthodox quantum mechanic</a><span class="id">[2504.20597]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work sets out to answer a single question: what is the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics? However, we adopt a different approach to that normally used. Rather than surveying physicists, or poring over the precise details of the thoughts of Bohr and Heisenberg, we review a collection of 42 textbooks on quantum mechanics, encompassing the most popular and prominent works of this nature. We then gauge their response to 13 propositions to build up a picture of exactly what is believed by an orthodox quantum mechanic. We demonstrate that this orthodoxy has many aspects of Copenhagen-like viewpoints, but also shows some interesting emerging deviations. Moreover, it is more nuanced than some reductive characterisations that condense the orthodoxy down to the ontological primacy of the quantum state. The revealed orthodoxy has three consistent pillars: measurement inherently disturbs quantum states, these states refer to individual instances, not ensembles, and quantum systems do not have definite properties prior to measurement. More fully, it entails that individual particles exist in wave-like super-positions and present particle behaviours only when forced to by outside influences. The act of measuring such a system inherently induces random changes in its state, manifesting as a form of measurement error that corresponds to the uncertainty principle. This implies that measurement does not reveal underlying values of quantum properties.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual high voltage lab: gamified learning in a safe 3d environment</a><span class="id">[2511.20919]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The integration of immersive technologies has transformed engineering education, particularly in high-risk disciplines like high-voltage engineering, which is essential for urban energy infrastructure. This study presents a 3D virtual laboratory developed using Unreal Engine 5 to support the High Voltage Engineering course for undergraduate students in Power Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Electromechanics. The research investigates how an immersive, gamified virtual laboratory enhances learning outcomes, safety training, and preparedness for urban infrastructure challenges. We hypothesize that VLab-HV significantly improves student engagement, knowledge retention, practical skills, and safety awareness compared to traditional laboratories, contributing to urban energy system resilience. Through ten curriculum-aligned experiments, gamified interactions, and AI-driven pedagogical tools, VLab-HV offers a risk-free environment for mastering HV concepts. Evaluation via usability testing, engagement metrics, and surveys confirms superior learning outcomes. The study highlights the role of VLab-HV in training engineers and professionals for urban energy challenges, with planned expansions for multiplayer and virtual reality integration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Particle Builder A Board Game for the Teaching of the Standard Model of Particle Physics at a Secondary Level</a><span class="id">[2511.21116]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Particle Builder, an online board game which teaches students about concepts from the Standard Model of Particle Physics at a high school level. This short activity resulted in a gain of 0.16, indicating that students learned a significant amount of particle physics knowledge. Students found the activity was more engaging and less difficult than a normal classroom lesson.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Making sense of quantum teleportation: An intervention study on students' conceptions using a diagrammatic approach</a><span class="id">[2511.21443]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quantum physics education at the upper-secondary level traditionally follows a historical approach, rarely extending beyond early 20th-century ideas, leaving students unprepared for comprehending modern quantum technologies central to everyday life and many facets of modern industry. To address this gap, we investigated how upper-secondary students and pre-service teachers understand quantum teleportation when taught with a simplified diagrammatic formalism based on the ZX-calculus, which represents quantum processes as diagrams of wires and boxes. Through phenomenographic analysis of video-recorded group work sessions, written responses to exercises, and a group interview, with a total of n=21 participants, we identified an outcome space consisting of four qualitatively different, hierarchically ordered categories of description encapsulating the different ways of experiencing quantum teleportation. The categories revealed that a conceptual progression depends on how one understands the temporality in quantum processes, the role of entanglement in quantum teleportation, the active nature of quantum measurements, and interpretations of mathematical operations in the diagrams. Our findings demonstrate that while a simplified diagrammatic formalism for teaching quantum physics provides an accessible entry point at the upper-secondary level, it does not automatically resolve fundamental conceptual challenges, and requires careful consideration in terms of developing teaching and learning sequences. Finally, these results provide educators with a deeper understanding of conceptual affordances and challenges for designing and improving instruction, whilst also highlighting the need for further exploring how students and teachers alike understand quantum phenomena.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Striving for Equity in Canadian Physics</a><span class="id">[2511.21525]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We discuss a number of new initiatives and events since 2020 which we hope will contribute to advancement of equity issues within the physics community in Canada. A recent analysis of high-school data shows that men are still over-represented in high-school physics courses, and the fraction has not changed in over a decade. Results from a national survey show that despite improvements over the years, the percentage of women and gender diverse physicists drops by around 35% between undergraduate students to those in a physics career. This decline is even more notable among Black, Indigenous, and people of colour (BIPOC) women and gender diverse physicists, whose representation drops by almost 60%. Several programs from the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) have been implemented in order to improve equity, diversity, and accessibility in STEM on a national level, most notably the Chairs for Women in Sciences and Engineering (CSWE) and Chairs for Inclusion in Sciences and Engineering (CISE) initiatives. It is crucial to maintain data collection and support existing as well as new EDI projects in future years as we work to build a more inclusive community of physicists in Canada.</p></div></details></article></body>
