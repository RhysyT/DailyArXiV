Here we bridge these scales by embedding a first-principles, GRMHD-informed prescription for black hole accretion and feedback–derived from multi-zone simulations that self-consistently connect inflows and outflows from the horizon to the Bondi radius–within cosmological magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of $\sim10^{14}\,M_\odot$ halos. These GRMHD results predict a &quot;suppressed Bondi&quot; regime in which magnetic stresses and relativistic winds strongly reduce effective accretion rates in a spin-dependent manner. We find that black holes cannot grow efficiently by accretion until they exceed $\sim10^{7}\,M_\odot$, regardless of the feedback strength. Beyond this threshold, systems bifurcate: low-spin ($\eta\!\sim\!0.02$) black holes continue to accrete without quenching star formation, while high-spin ($\eta\!\gtrsim\!0.3$) black holes quench effectively but become starved of further growth. Early, massive seeding partially alleviates this tension through merger-driven assembly, yet an additional cold or super-Eddington accretion mode appears essential to reproduce the observed SMBH population and the empirical black hole–galaxy scaling relations. Our results demonstrate that GRMHD-informed feedback models can account for the maintenance-mode behavior of low-luminosity AGN like M87*, but cannot by themselves explain the full buildup of SMBH mass across cosmic time. A unified, multi-regime framework is required to capture the evolving interplay between spin-dependent feedback, cold inflows, and mergers in driving co-evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08671" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST/NIRSpec Reveals a Small Population of Dominant Dust-Obscured Ionizing Sources in Galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3</a><span class="id">[2511.08671]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rest-frame optical emission line diagnostics are often used to help classify ionizing sources within galaxies. However, rest-frame optical tracers can miss sources with high dust attenuation, leading to misclassification of the dominant ionizing source. Longer wavelength tracers, such as those in the near-infrared, carry the power to diagnose ionizing sources while being more robust than optical tracers to the presence of dust. The diagnostics used in this work employ the ratios of bright near-infrared emission lines [S III] 9530, [Fe II] 12566 and [Fe II] 16443 to Paschen lines in publicly-available JWST/NIRSpec MSA medium-resolution spectroscopy of 55 galaxies at z &lt; 3. We compare the rest-frame near-infrared and rest-frame optical diagnostics and find that  90% of our sample have consistent classifications across wavelengths (49/55), while the remaining sources can be explained through ionizing radiation obscured by dust and/or elevated N/Fe abundances. We identify three objects classified as star-forming in the rest frame optical and as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the rest-frame near-infrared, which we interpret as obscured AGN. We also identify three objects which are classified as AGN in the rest-frame optical and star forming in the rest-frame near-infrared. We interpret two of these objects as AGN with obscured star formation and the other with elevated N/Fe. We discuss how future spatially-resolved and/or mid-infrared spectroscopy can test the relative contributions of AGN and stars to the ionizing photon budgets of these disagreeing sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08672" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An almost NIRCam-dark dusty star-forming galaxy at z=6.63</a><span class="id">[2511.08672]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present AC-2168, an almost NIRCam-dark, millimetre-bright galaxy in the COSMOS field. The source was identified blindly in ALMA Band-4 continuum data and remains undetected in the COSMOS-Web DR1 NIRCam catalogue. We spectroscopically confirm a redshift of $z_{\rm spec}=6.631$ from [CII] 158 $\mu$m and four tentatively detected CO lines in NOEMA and ALMA data. SED fitting to near-IR to millimetre photometry yields $\rm L_{IR}=1.6\times10^{12}\,L_\odot$, an SFR of $\rm 244\,M_\odot/yr$, heavy dust attenuation $\rm A_V=5.4$ mag, and a stellar mass $\rm M_\star=3.7\times10^{10}\,M_\odot$. From the millimetre continuum and [CII] emission, we infer a warm ISM with $\rm T_{\rm dust}=60K$, $\rm M_{dust}=3.0\times10^{8}\,M_\odot$ and $\rm M_{gas}=4.1\times10^{10}\,M_\odot$. AC-2168 has a gas fraction ($f_{\rm gas}=M_{\rm gas}/(M_\star+M_{\rm gas})$) of $\sim52\%$, a short depletion time of $\rm \sim170Myr$, a compact ($\rm \sim1kpc$) dust-continuum size, and an SFR consistent with the star-forming main sequence at its mass. These properties match expectations for progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies at the peak of their assembly, as implied by NIRSpec-based SFHs of $z\sim4-5$ systems. Using the blind detection, we estimate a space density of $\rm 7.8^{+18.0}_{-6.5}\times10^{-6}\,cMpc^{-3}$ for AC-2168-like NIRCam-dark galaxies at $z\sim6-7$, $\sim42\%$ of the abundance of massive quiescent galaxies at $z\sim4-5$. No overdensity of Ly$\alpha$ emitters or Lyman-break galaxies is found nearby, suggesting AC-2168 does not lie in a prominent protocluster and highlighting the importance of unbiased blind surveys for this population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Where Giants Dwell: Probing the Environments of Early Massive Quiescent Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.08674]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the environments of massive quiescent galaxies at 3 &lt; z &lt; 5 using the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) theoretical model. We select galaxies with stellar mass  10^10.8 Msun and specific star formation rate below 0.3x t_Hubble, yielding in a sample of about 5,000 galaxies within a simulated volume of  685 Mpc. These galaxies have formation times that cover well the range inferred from recent observational data, including a few rare objects with very short formation time-scales and early formation epochs. Model high-z quiescent galaxies are alpha-enhanced and exhibit a wide range of stellar metallicity, in broad agreement with current observational estimates. Massive high-z quiescent galaxies in our model occupy a wide range of environments, from void-like regions to dense knots at the intersections of filaments. Quiescent galaxies in underdense regions typically reside in halos that collapsed early and grew rapidly at high redshift, though this trend becomes difficult to identify observationally due to large intrinsic scatter in star formation histories. The descendants of high-z massive quiescent galaxies display a broad distribution in mass and environment by z=0, reflecting the stochastic nature of mergers. About one-third of these systems remain permanently quenched, while most rejuvenation events are merger-driven and more common in overdense regions. Our results highlight the diversity of early quiescent galaxies and caution against assuming that all such systems trace the progenitors of present day most massive clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08676" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for in-situ acceleration of relativistic particles in the wings of X-shaped radio galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.08676]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report evidence for in-situ acceleration/re-acceleration of relativistic particles in 11 radio wings out of a total of 68 wings sufficiently well-resolved for spectral mapping, which belong to our sample of 40 X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs). This representative XRG sample includes 15 XRGs newly reported here, which we selected from the LOTSS-DR2 survey, following well-defined criteria. The evidence for in-situ particle acceleration comes from the observed cessation of steepening, or even flattening (i.e., gradient reversal) of the spectral index profile along the lobe into the associated wing, as determined here by combining the LoTSS-DR2 (144 MHz) and FIRST (1.4 GHz) maps. Interestingly, the afore-mentioned trends in spectral gradient, indicative of in-situ particle acceleration, are mostly found to set in near the region where the lobe plasma stream bends to connect to the wing. Such a spatial coincidence with bending of radio lobe/tail has been noticed in recent years for just a couple of radio galaxies. The large increase in such examples, as reported here, is expected to give a fillip to observational, theoretical and numerical simulation follow-up investigations of this important clue about the occurrence of in-situ particle acceleration in lobes of radio galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Highly Efficient Identification of Extreme Emission Line Galaxies in the Local Universe: &gt;8000 New Green Pea Candidates at 0.12 &lt; z &lt; 0.36</a><span class="id">[2511.08678]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The currently known compact extreme emission-line galaxies (the &quot;Green Peas&quot;, GPs) in SDSS are rare and were mostly found among serendipitous spectroscopic targets, thus leaving open the possibility that a substantial population of GPs is missed. A significantly larger number of identified GPs in the Local Universe might provide a better characterization of their high-redshift analogs and Lyman continuum escape. In this paper, we confront the challenges of robustly identifying GPs without spectroscopic information, a needed approach considering the incompleteness of spectroscopic surveys for compact sources. The principal difficulty stems from a significant contamination of photometric candidates by stars and quasars of similar color. To solve this, we introduce an SED matching method, which separates candidate GPs from contaminants on the basis of SDSS and WISE photometry of spectroscopically confirmed stars, quasars and galaxies. The method has an effectiveness of 85%, and a contamination rate of  10%. With it we identify  9600 GP candidates expected to lie in the 0.12 &lt; z &lt; 0.36 range - a tenfold increase over what would be selected using SDSS DR18 spectra. Some of the new GPs are as bright as r 19, and 1200 are predicted to have [OIII]5007 equivalent widths in excess of 500 A. The new population contains many &quot;Extended Peas&quot;, which are absent among known GPs and possibly represent merging systems. We provide catalogs containing 8313 newly identified GP candidates, as well as 917 GPs confirmed using SDSS spectroscopy and 521 GPs with spectroscopic redshifts from LAMOST and other sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08683" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bridging scales: Modeling suppressed Bondi accretion on black holes and its impact on galaxy growth</a><span class="id">[2511.08683]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The accretion and feedback processes governing supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth span an enormous range of spatial scales, from the Event Horizon to the circumgalactic medium. Recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations demonstrate that strong magnetic fields can substantially suppress Bondi accretion by creating magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states, reducing inflow rates by up to two orders of magnitude relative to classical Bondi predictions. We incorporate this magnetic suppression prescription from Cho et al. (2023, 2024) into the Dark Sage semi-analytic model (SAM), which tracks SMBH and galaxy co-evolution within hierarchical merger trees derived from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. Implementing the suppression across different Eddington-ratio regimes, we explore its impact on black hole mass functions (BHMFs), stellar mass functions (SMFs), and AGN luminosity functions. Restricting suppression to sub-Eddington accretors ($f_{\rm Edd} &lt; 3 \times 10^{-3}$) and rescaling AGN feedback efficiencies gives simultaneous agreement with observed $z = 0$ SMFs and BHMFs, as illustrated by Case D in this work. At $z &gt; 6$, super-Eddington growth episodes dominate in the SAM, reproducing JWST-inferred luminous AGN number densities. Our results highlight the critical sensitivity of galaxy assembly to the coupling between small-scale accretion physics and large-scale feedback regulation. Magnetic suppression of hot gas accretion can reconcile low-redshift constraints while preserving the rapid black hole growth required at early cosmic epochs, thereby providing a physically motivated bridge between horizon-scale GRMHD simulations and cosmological galaxy-formation models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08685" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinematic scaling relations of disc galaxies from ionised gas at $z\sim~1$ and their connection with dark matter halos</a><span class="id">[2511.08685]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive the Tully-Fisher (TFR, $M_\ast-V_{\rm circ, f}$) and Fall (FR, $j_\ast-M_\ast$) relations at redshift $z = 0.9$ using a sample of 43 main-sequence disc galaxies with H$\alpha$ IFU data and JWST/HST imaging. The strength of our analysis lies in the use of state-of-the-art 3D kinematic models to infer galaxy rotation curves, the inclusion and morphological modelling of NIR bands, and the use of SED modelling applied to our photometry measurements to estimate stellar masses. After correcting the inferred H$\alpha$ velocities for asymmetric drift, we find a TFR of the form $\log(M_\ast / M_\odot) = a \log(V_{\rm circ,f} / 150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}) + b$, with $a=3.82^{+0.55}_{-0.40}$ and $b=10.27^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, as well as a FR of the form $\log(j_\ast / \mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}) = a \log(M_\ast / 10^{10.5} M_\odot) + b$, with $a=0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ and $b=2.86^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$. When compared to their $z=0$ counterparts, we find moderate evolution in the TFR and strong evolution in the FR over the past $8$ Gyr. We interpret our findings in the context of the galaxy-to-halo scaling parameters $f_{\rm M}=M_\ast/M_{\rm vir}$ and $f_{\rm j}=j_\ast/j_{\rm vir}$. We infer that at $z=0.9$ both $f_{\rm M}$ and $f_{\rm j}$ are higher and less mass-dependent than at $z=0$. We speculate that the evolution of $f_{\rm j}$ can be driven by more efficient and centrally concentrated stellar feedback at $z=0.9$, or by an appreciable dry merger history. We also show that assuming the galaxies populating our $z=0.9$ relations evolve into those populating the $z=0$ relations leads to an apparent discrepancy with the hierarchical growth of dark matter halos. To solve this issue, one needs to evoke a progenitor bias scenario, unknown systematics affecting our and previous measurements, or consider the possibility that H$\alpha$ kinematics is not a reliable dynamical tracer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08693" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravity-Selected Galaxy Clusters: a Tight Mass-Richness relation and an unclear Compton $Y$-richness trend</a><span class="id">[2511.08693]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper, the third in a series, investigates the scaling relations between optical richness, weak-lensing mass, and Compton $Y$ for a sample of galaxy clusters selected purely by the effect of their gravitational potential on the shapes of background galaxies. This selection method is uncommon, as most cluster samples in the literature are selected based on signals originating from cluster baryons. We analize a complete sample of 13 gravity-selected clusters at intermediate redshifts (with $0.12 \leq z_{phot} \leq 0.40$) with weak-lensing signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 7. We measured cluster richness by counting red-sequence galaxies, identifying two cases of line-of-sight projections in the process, later confirmed by spectroscopic data. Both clusters are sufficiently separated in redshift that contamination in richness can be straighforwardly dealt because the two red sequences do not blend each other. We find an exceptionally tight richness–mass relation using our red-sequence-based richness estimator, with a scatter of just $\sim0.05$ dex, smaller than the intrinsic scatter of Compton Y with mass for the same sample. The lower scatter highlights the effectiveness of richness compared to Compton $Y$. No outliers are found in the richness-mass scaling, whether or not one cluster with a mass likely affected by projection effects is included in the sample. In the Compton $Y$-richness plane, the data do not delineate a clear trend. The limited sample size is not the sole reason for the unclear relation between Compton $Y$ and richness, since the same sample, with identical richness values, exhibits a highly significant and tight mass-richness correlation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identification of Candidate Halos Hosting Massive Black Hole Seeds in the \textit{Renaissance} Simulations with Support Vector Machines</a><span class="id">[2511.08706]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nature of the origins of supermassive black holes remains uncertain. Multiple possible seeding pathways have been proposed across a variety of mass scales, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. One such channel is a direct collapse black hole (DCBH), thought to form from the deaths of supermassive stars in pristine atomic cooling halos in the early universe. In this work, we investigate the ability to identify halos likely to form a DCBH based on their properties using a support vector machine (SVM). We implement multiple methods to improve the accuracy of the model, including selecting subsets of critical features and optimizing SVM hyperparameters. We find that our best model requires quantities relevant to star formation, such as the metallicity, incident flux of Lyman-Werner radiation, and halo stellar mass. The SVMs produced from this work can serve as probabilistic and holistic seeding prescriptions for DCBHs in cosmological simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08790" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Molecular Hearts of Extreme Bipolar Planetary Nebulae with ALMA</a><span class="id">[2511.08790]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from a program of Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm (Band 6) molecular line mapping of a sample of nearby, bipolar/pinched-waist, molecule-rich PNe (NGC 6302, Hubble 5, NGC 2440, NGC 6445, NGC 2899, and NGC 2818). Maps of $^{12}$CO(2$-$1) and $^{13}$CO(2$-$1) emission as well as emission lines of HCN, HNC, HCO$^+$, CN, and CS $-$ many of these detected in these PNe for the first time $-$ reveal the molecular mass distributions, compositions, and velocity fields of the equatorial and, in some cases, polar regions of the sample PNe. In each case, the bulk of the molecular gas traces an expanding equatorial torus, with torus expansion velocities ranging from $\sim$15 to $\sim$50 km s$^{-1}$ and molecular masses from $\sim$0.002 to $\sim$0.1 $M_\odot$. The inferred molecular torus dynamical ages, which span the range $\sim$500 yr (Hb 5) to $\sim$11000 yr (NGC 2818), provide support for a model wherein molecular torus ejection precedes bipolar lobe formation. Collectively, these ALMA survey results provide insight into the rapid structural evolution as well as the zones of irradiated molecular gas within bipolar PNe that are descended from relatively massive progenitors, likely residing in interacting binary systems, over $\sim$10 kyr of the post-AGB evolution of such systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Model of super-Alfvénic MHD turbulence and structure functions of polarization</a><span class="id">[2511.08800]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>MHD turbulence driven at velocities higher than the Alfvén velocity, i.e., super-Alfvénic turbulence, is widely spread in astrophysical environments, including galaxy clusters and molecular clouds. For statistical studies of such turbulence, we explore the utility of the polarization angle structure functions $D^\phi(R)= \left\langle\sin^2(\phi_1-\phi_2) \right\rangle$, where $\phi$ denotes the polarization angle measured at points separated by a projected distance $\mathbf{R}$ on the plane of the sky. Lazarian, Yuen and Pogosyan, 2022, showed that in the case of super-Alfvénic turbulence, the spectral slope of $D^\phi(\mathbf{R})$ differs from that of the underlying magnetic fluctuations, limiting its applicability for field strength estimation with known techniques. In this work, we provide an analytical framework that explains the modification of the $D^\phi(R)$ spectral slope in super-Alfvénic turbulence and validate our predictions with numerical simulations. We demonstrate that for super-Alfvénic turbulence, the structure function $D^\phi (R)$ gets shallower with the increase of $M_A$. Our study makes $D^\phi (R)$ a valuable diagnostic of super-Alfvénic turbulence and opens a way to obtain $M_A$ from observations. We also explore numerically the structure function of the polarization degree and the spectrum of the polarization directions, the latter being the Fourier transform of $D^\phi$. We discuss the implications of our findings for turbulence and magnetic field studies in the intracluster and interstellar media.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08814" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinetic Theory and the Mechanics of Isothermal Gas Spheres: Derivation of the Classical Emden–Chandrasekhar Equation via the Vlasov–Poisson Formalism</a><span class="id">[2511.08814]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a derivation of the mechanics of isothermal gas spheres directly from the Vlasov–Poisson equation. By extremising the Boltzmann entropy, we obtain the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for a self-gravitating isothermal Newtonian gas, which is a stationary solution of the Vlasov–Poisson system. From this distribution, the corresponding Poisson–Boltzmann equation for the gravitational potential is deduced. The second variation of entropy reproduces the classical Antonov instability criterion: the critical energy is $E_c \simeq -0.335\,\frac{G M^2}{R}$, below which no local entropy maximum exists and the configuration becomes unstable (the so-called &quot;gravothermal catastrophe&quot;). In this work, we assume $E&gt;E_c$, so all equilibria lie on the stable branch, and the Antonov instability does not affect the analysis. Specializing to spherical symmetry, we recover the classical equation for the isothermal gas sphere, as originally studied by Chandrasekhar, which has applications to the formation of red giant stars. We also derive the fundamental equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, the energy integral and the virial theorem directly from the stationary Vlasov–Poisson solution, demonstrating also that an isothermal gas exhibits negative specific heat. Furthermore, we show that an isothermal gas sphere of strictly constant density is an impossibility. This exposition emphasizes some of the deep connections and self-consistency between kinetic theory, statistical mechanics, and stellar structure, while highlighting some formal aspects of classical astrophysical models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Populations with MaNGA: Iron Kink and Nitrogen Fuzz</a><span class="id">[2511.08827]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent analysis of 2968 MaNGA early type galaxies has yielded two notable trends with velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) not previously discussed in the literature. First, Fe abundance rises with $\sigma$, but only until $\sigma\approx100$ km s$^{-1}$, after which it falls. This kink is reproduced by TNG100 simulations, implying that hierarchical merger processes might explain it. Second, astrophysical scatter in N is high for galaxies with $\sigma &lt; 100$ km s$^{-1}$. Due to the restricted list of nucleosynthetic sources for N, it is likely that asymptotic giant branch stars provide most of this N. A varied star formation history (compared to that of massive galaxies) along with variable retention and recycling of N-enriched gas might explain the fuzz of N abundance in low-$\sigma$ galaxies. Because a timescale argument seems necessary to explain the nitrogen fuzz, and an initial mass function argument is ruled out, similar timescale arguments for the [Mg/Fe] trend as a function of velocity dispersion are supported.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gas excitation of post-starburst galaxies at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.3</a><span class="id">[2511.08829]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Molecular gas traces both the fuel for star formation and the processes that regulate it. Observing its physical state (e.g., excitation) reveals when and why galaxies stop forming stars. We observed the CO(5-4) emission of 8 post-starburst galaxies at z   0.6-1.3. To our knowledge, this is the first time that high-J transitions are probed for quiescent galaxies beyond the local Universe. All targets are detected in CO(2-1) or CO(3-2) and have molecular gas fractions up to 20%. Using the ratio R52=L'CO(5-4)/L'CO(2-1) as a proxy for gas excitation, we test how quenching occurs. Low R52 values would indicate suppressed fractions of dense/warm gas relative to cold and diffuse gas, while ratios typical of main-sequence galaxies would imply that quenching is still ongoing and that star formation may exhaust the remaining gas. On average our post-starbursts have R52 = 0.31, comparable to high-redshift galaxies. However, CO(5-4) non-detections, corresponding to galaxies without signs of interaction, yield R52&lt;0.11, 2 times lower than local star-forming galaxies. The average CO Spectral Line Energy Distribution (SLED) peaks at J = 3, similar to the Milky Way. Three galaxies show signs of ongoing mergers and have R52 = 0.49 and CO SLEDs peaking at J &gt; 4-5, similar to high-redshift galaxies. At least one requires additional mechanisms (AGN, shocks) to explain the rise of the SLED up to J=5. CO excitation helps distinguishing among mechanisms driving the low star formation efficiency (SFE) of post-starburst galaxies. The low SFE might be due to high kinetic temperatures and low gas densities yielding high excitation, or due to low gas densities implying low excitation.

We estimate the ensemble variability structure function (SF) for subsamples categorized by various AGN properties, such as black hole mass, AGN luminosity ($L$), and Eddington ratio, to investigate how AGN variability depends on these parameters. We found that the SFs are strongly correlated with $L$, Eddington ratio, and rest-frame wavelength ($\lambda$). The analysis, with each parameter held fixed, reveals that SFs depend primarily on $L$ and $\lambda$, but not on the Eddington ratio. Consequently, under the assumption that AGNs follow a universal SF, we found that the variability timescale ($\tau$) is proportional to both $L$ and $\lambda$, expressed as $\tau \propto L^{0.62\pm0.07} \lambda^{1.74\pm0.23}$. This result is broadly consistent with predictions from the standard accretion disk model ($\tau \propto L^{0.5} \lambda^{2}$). However, when considering only shorter wavelengths ($\lambda \leq 3050$ Å) to minimize contamination from the host galaxy and the Balmer continuum, the power-law index for $\lambda$ drops significantly to $1.12 \pm 0.24$. This value is lower than predicted by approximately $3-$4\ \sigma$, suggesting that the radial temperature profile may be systematically steeper than that predicted by the standard disk model, although other mechanisms may also contribute to this discrepancy. These findings highlight the power of temporal spectroscopic data in probing AGN variability, as they allow robust estimation of continuum fluxes without interference from strong emission lines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08960" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for host galaxies of unlocalized Fast Radio Bursts in the SDSS IV catalog</a><span class="id">[2511.08960]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This theoretical work investigates different models to predict the redshift of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) from their observed dispersion measure (DM) and other reported properties. We performed an extensive revision of the FRBs with confirmed galaxy hosts in the literature and compiled an updated catalog. With this sample of FRBs, composed of 117 unique transients, we explore four physically motivated models that relate the DM and redshift ($z$): a linear trend (inspired by the Macquart relation), a log-parabolic function, a power-law, and a combined model from the above. We assess the success of these theoretical proposals by implementing different statistical metrics and ranking them. The DM-$z$ relations are also tested using 100 realizations of 500 simulated FRBs, which follow the observed DM trends. Relying on our theoretical modeling, we establish the probability of $\sim$1000 FRBs with unknown $z$ (from the latest CHIME data release) to be hosted by galaxies in the SDSS archival dataset. Our validation scheme allows us to predict the FRBs with a probability threshold of $\geq$0.95 to originate in these galaxies, using their 2D angular position in the sky, magnitude in the r-band, and redshift. This statistical proposal will be tested with upcoming data releases from DESI and new generations of galaxy surveys, such as Euclid, and it opens brilliant possibilities to localize these transients in an automatic pipeline.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dawn of Gravitational Wave Astronomy at Light-year Wavelengths: Insights from Pulsar Timing Arrays</a><span class="id">[2511.08966]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Arrays of precisely-timed millisecond pulsars are used to search for gravitational waves with periods of months to decades. Gravitational waves affect the path of radio pulses propagating from a pulsar to Earth, causing the arrival times of those pulses to deviate from expectations based on the physical characteristics of the pulsar system. By correlating these timing residuals in a pulsar timing array (PTA), one can search for a statistically isotropic background of gravitational waves by revealing evidence for a distinctive pattern predicted by General Relativity, known as the Hellings &amp; Downs curve. On June 29 2023, five regional PTA collaborations announced the first evidence for GWs at light-year wavelengths, predicated on support for this correlation pattern with statistical significances ranging from $\sim\!2-4\sigma$. The amplitude and shape of the recovered GW spectrum has also allowed many investigations of the expected source characteristics, ranging from a cosmic population of supermassive binary black holes to numerous processes in the early Universe. In the future, we expect to resolve signals from individual binary systems of supermassive black holes, and probe fundamental assumptions about the background, including its polarization, anisotropy, Gaussianity, and stationarity, all of which will aid efforts to discriminate its origin. In tandem with new facilities like DSA-2000 and the SKA, fueling further observations by regional PTAs and the International Pulsar Timing Array, PTAs have extraordinary potential to be engines of nanohertz GW discovery.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J-PAS: A Neural Network Approach to Single Stellar Population Characterization</a><span class="id">[2511.09081]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>J-PAS (Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey) will present a groundbreaking photometric survey covering 8500 deg$^2$ of the visible sky from Javalambre, capturing data in 56 narrow band filters. This survey promises to revolutionize galaxy evolution studies by observing $\sim$10$^8$ galaxies with low spectral resolution. A crucial aspect of this analysis involves predicting stellar population parameters from the observed galaxy photometry. In this study, we combine the exquisite J-PAS photometry with state-of-the-art single stellar population (SSP) libraries to accurately predict stellar age, metallicity, and dust attenuation with a neural network (NN) model. The NN is trained on synthetic J-PAS photometry from different SSP librares (E-MILES, Charlot &amp; Bruzual, XSL), to enhance the robustness of our predictions against individual SSP model variations and limitations. To create mock samples with varying observed magnitudes we add artificial noise in the form of random Gaussian variations within typical observational uncertainties in each band. Our results indicate that the NN can accurately estimate stellar parameters for SSP models without evident degeneracies, surpassing a bayesian SED-fitting method on the same test set. We obtain median bias, scatter and percentage of outliers $\mu$ = (0.01 dex, 0.00 dex, 0.00 mag), $\sigma_{NMAD}$ = (0.23 dex, 0.29 dex, 0.04 mag), f$_{o}$ = (17 %, 24 %, 1 %) at $ i \sim$17 mag for age, metallicity and dust attenuation, respectively.

The growing sample of systems with highly unequal masses, such as GW190814 with $m_1=23.2\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_2=2.59\,M_{\odot}$ – corresponding to a mass ratio $q=0.112$ – cannot be readily explained by isolated binary evolution and may originate through dynamical assembly in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We investigate AGN discs capable of producing GW190814-like mergers using \texttt{pAGN} to model self-consistent AGN torques, coupled with \texttt{TSUNAMI}, a regularised N-body code including post-Newtonian terms up to 3.5 order. Suites of N-body simulations reveal possible outcomes of binary capture and merger, mean-motion resonance interactions, and other novel dynamical pathways. We develop analytical models linking the branching ratios of captures and mergers to local disc properties, applicable to black hole populations across all mass ratios. Capture probability is primarily governed by $\mathscr{B}$, the ratio of libration time to resonance-width crossing, and is well-described by a log-Gaussian, $P(\rm{capture}|\mathscr{B}) = A \exp[-(\ln \mathscr{B}-\mu)^2/2\sigma^2]$, with $A = 0.41^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, $\mu = 1.09^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$, $\sigma = 1.05^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$. This fit, while an upper limit, is useful for simplified population synthesis. Finally, we explore the mass ratio AGN luminosity parameter space and find that GW190814 may be formed in a low luminosity AGN of $L_{\rm AGN}\approx 10^{43.5}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$. A more systematic parameter space exploration and future population studies will further test our predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emission-Line and Continuum Reverberation Mapping of the NLS1 Galaxy WPVS 48</a><span class="id">[2511.09153]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>WPVS 48 is a nearby narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy without previous analysis of the broad-line region (BLR) by means of optical spectroscopic reverberation mapping. By studying the continuum and emission line variability of WPVS 48, we aim to infer the BLR size as well as the mass of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We analyse data from a dedicated optical spectroscopic reverberation mapping campaign of WPVS 48 taken with the 10 m Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) at 24 epochs over a period of 7 months between December 2013 and June 2014. WPVS 48 shows variability throughout the campaign. We find a stratified BLR, where the variability amplitude of the integrated emission lines decreases with distance to the ionizing continuum source. Specifically, the variable emission of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, He I $\lambda5876$ originates at distances of $16.0^{+4.0}_{-2.0}$, $15.0^{+4.5}_{-1.9}$, $12.5^{+3.5}_{-2.5}$ and $14.0^{+2.5}_{-2.1}$ light-days, respectively, to the optical continuum at 5100 A. The He II $\lambda 4686$ lag is $\lesssim 5$ days. Based on the high S/N spectra, we identify variable emission of N III $\lambda4640$ and C IV $\lambda4658$ in the line complex with He II $\lambda 4686$. We derive interband continuum delays increasing with wavelength up to $\sim 8$ days. These delays are consistent with an additional diffuse continuum originating at the same distance as the variable Balmer emission. We derive a central black hole mass of $(1.3_{-0.6}^{+1.1})\times10^7M_{\odot}$ based on the integrated line-widths and distances of the BLR and discuss corrections for the inclination angle. This gives an Eddington ratio $L/L_{\text{Edd}}\approx 0.39$ without correction for inclination.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interstellar medium phases and abundances in the central parsec: A JWST MIRI/MRS view of the Galactic center</a><span class="id">[2511.09198]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We used newly obtained observations from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) equipped with the Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to extract spectra covering the entire spectral range from 5 to 27 $\mu$m in the CND and in the CC. We used the photoionization code CLOUDY to generate synthetic spectra with the same spectral range and resolution, simulating a wide range of gas phases and abundances. We then determined the contribution of each phase to the spectra. Once the abundances and contribution from each phase of the gas were determined, we identified four dominant phases and performed a spatial analysis to determine their contribution to each spaxel of the datacubes. We find that in both the CND and the CC, the bulk of the emission originates from warm ionized gas with temperatures of between $10^4$ and $10^{4.8}$ K. In the CND, molecular gas contributes significantly to the flux and is spatially structured, while the CC shows minimal molecular gas content, as is expected from these regions. Coronal gas is detected in both regions at the interface between molecular and warm ionized gas. The observed abundance pattern (enhanced CNO and $\alpha$ elements with suppressed Fe) indicates a chemically young environment, recently enriched by core-collapse supernovae and stellar winds, with a limited contribution from older Type Ia supernovae. This favors a scenario of massive, recent star formation rather than cumulative long-term enrichment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Little red dots as embryos of active galactic nuclei</a><span class="id">[2511.09278]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As an unprecedented large population in the early universe, the JWST-discovered little red dots (LRDs) have garnered much attention for formation of massive black holes and galaxies, but their nature remains a mystery. The LRDs appearing as “Chimeras&quot; like both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and galaxies have stimulated renewed interest in the roadmap of central massive black hole (cMBH) formation in AGNs. In this paper, we suggest that the LRDs contain $M_{\bullet}\lesssim 10^6\,M_{\odot}$ cMBHs as demonstrated by the Sołtan argument and there is a large population of stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs with total mass of $\mathscr{M}_{m_{\bullet}}$) embedded inside cMBH accretion disks (cMBH-disk) as motivated by anomalous reverberations of broad H$\beta$ line in local AGNs. This embryo structure of LRDs ($M_{\bullet}&lt;\mathscr{M}_{m_{\bullet}}$) is formed as a consequence of gravitational collapse of primordial clouds. In this Chimera, accretion onto sMBHs powers the rest-frame optical continuum of the LRDs but the UV continuum is jointly contributed by slim parts of the cMBH-disks and nuclear starbursts in the core of collapsing clouds governing the appearance of the observed V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Outflowing clumped-envelopes are unavoidably formed by radiation pressure leading to absorption features of the Balmer lines. The present model works very well for LRDs' SEDs and avoids the issues of overly massive cMBHs. Evolution of LRDs is briefly discussed including gravitational waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variability of optical spectral index to support a central sub-parsec binary black hole system in quasar SDSS J001224-102226.51</a><span class="id">[2511.09304]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this manuscript, variations in optical spectral index $\alpha_{5100}$ are applied for detecting central sub-parsec binary black hole systems (sub-pc BBHs) in broad line active galactic nuclei (BLAGN), due to apparent effects of obscurations on central two BH accreting systems. For sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN, two main characteristics on $\alpha_{5100}$ can be expected. First, if a BLAGN harbours a central sub-pc BBH, the expected unique variability in $\alpha_{5100}$ should lead the BLAGN to be an outlier in the space of $\alpha_{5100}$ versus continuum luminosity $L_{5100}$ determined from normal BLAGN. Second, BLAGN harbouring central sub-pc BBHs could lead to periodic variations in $\alpha_{5100}$. Here, after checking the two-epoch SDSS spectra of quasar SDSS J0012-1022 reported as a candidate of sub-pc BBH by large velocity offset between narrow and broad Balmer emission lines, unique variability of $\alpha_{5100}$ can be explained by effects of obscurations related to an assumed central sub-pc BBH. In the near future, to detect and report periodic variations of $\alpha_{5100}$ for sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN should be our main objective.

The method favors the widely used on-the-fly emission–absorption approximation, which is state of the art in many production hydro codes when scattering is isotropic. Ray-trax vectorizes across rays and sources, supports arbitrarily many frequency bins without architectural changes, and exposes end-to-end gradients, making it straightforward to couple with differentiable hydro solvers while preserving differentiability.

Using an observation of Jupiter to calibrate detector gains and pointing offsets, we process the Sgr A observation in a purpose-built pipeline that removes correlated noise through common-mode subtraction with correlation-weighted scaling, and uses map-domain principal component analysis to identify further systematic errors. The resulting frequency-resolved maps recover strong 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission, and a continuum component whose spectral index discriminates free-free emission in the circumnuclear disk (CND) versus thermal dust emission in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds. Broadband continuum flux comparisons with the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) show agreement to within $\sim$5% in high-SNR molecular clouds in the Sgr A region. From the CO line detections, we estimate a molecular hydrogen mass of between $5.4 \times 10^5 M_\odot$ and $5.7 \times 10^5 M_\odot$, consistent with prior studies.

Numerical or analytical models generally consider that the mass, momentum, and energy injections result from bursts in a nuclear star formation region. However, star formation bursts have recently been observed in ring-like regions in the nuclear part of the galaxies. One example is NGC 253, which has shown a central toroidal burst and an asymmetric galactic wind observed in thermal X-ray emission. The general aim of this work is to study the effect of mechanical energy injection from stellar winds and supernova explosions in star-forming bursts distributed in rings around the nucleus of the galaxy NGC 253. Additionally, these partial objectives allow us to analyze the asymmetry of the outflows due to the bursts position as well as to study the formation of filaments with optical emission and make comparisons with recent observations of galaxies with these types of star-forming bursts. We used the hydrodynamic code AMRVAC to simulate galactic wind ejection coming from a central ring-like starburst located at different vertical positions. We showed that including a ring-shaped starburst (RSS) generates a more complex structured wind than what would be expected for a spherical starburst injection. Besides the interaction between the wind generated by the RSS and the host galaxy, it can generate dense filamentary structures with H alpha emission. The mass flux analysis of our models shows that the variation in the vertical position of the starburst can generate a variation in the mass flux of each lobe of the wind up to an order of magnitude. However, this difference is sustained only for a short period, with the flux tending to be symmetrical once it enters into a free-wind solution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09518" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warped Disk Galaxies: Statistical Properties from DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR8</a><span class="id">[2511.09518]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Warped structures are often observed in disk galaxies, yet their physical origin is still under investigation.

Earlier analyses indicated that the axisymmetric magnetic field (azimuthal Fourier mode $m=0$) is sufficient to fit the observed polarization angles in a wide range of galactocentric distances ($r$). We apply a Bayesian inference approach to new, more sensitive radio continuum data at $\lambda \lambda3.59$, $6.18$, and $11.33$ cm and the earlier data at $\lambda 20.46$ cm to reveal sub-dominant contributions from the modes $m=1$, 2, and 3 along with a dominant axisymmetric mode. Magnetic lines of the axisymmetric mode are close to trailing logarithmic spirals which are significantly more open than the spiral arms detectable in the interstellar dust and neutral hydrogen. The form of the $m=0$ mode is consistent with galactic dynamo theory. Both the amplitudes and the pitch angles of the higher azimuthal modes ($m&gt;1$) vary irregularly with $r$ reflecting local variations in the magnetic field structure. The maximum strength of the mean magnetic field of $1.8-2.7 \mu$G (for the axisymmetric part of the field) occurs at $10-14$ kpc but we find that its strength varies strongly along the azimuth; this variation gives rise to the $m=1$ mode. We suggest a procedure of Bayesian inference which is independent of the specific nature of the depolarization and applies when the magneto-ionic layer observable in polarized emission is not symmetric along the line of sight because emission from its far side is completely depolarized.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNIONS Optical Identifications for VLASS Radio Sources in the Euclid Sky (UNVEIL) I.

In this work, we present NIRSpec/IFS high-resolution observations of two low-mass ($M_* &lt; 10^9 \ M_\odot$), low-metallicity ($[12 + \log(\text{O/H})] &lt; 8$) galaxies at $z \sim 7.66$, one of which we identify as hosting a Type-II AGN. We measure flat strong-line metallicity gradients, suggestive of ISM redistribution by outflows or past merging, but also identify tension with the direct-$T_\text{e}$ metallicity gradient in one galaxy. We measure $v_\text{rot}/\sigma &lt; 1$ in both galaxies, consistent with observations of lower rotational support at early cosmic times. We identify broad kinematical components decoupled from galactic rotation with velocities of $\sim 250 - 500 \ \text{km} \ \text{s}^{-1}$ and argue these components trace outflows, for which we infer outflow rates of $\sim 8 - 14 \ M_\odot \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ with $v_\text{out}/v_\text{esc} \sim 1$. We compare our findings to results from the new large-volume AESOPICA simulations, which fully incorporate different models of black hole growth and AGN feedback. We find that our observational results of $v_\text{out}/v_\text{esc}$ are consistent with the simulated dwarf AGN population, hinting AGN-driven feedback may contribute to quenching both in our systems and in a wider population of low-mass galaxies in the early Universe. This novel study illustrates the necessity of deep IFU observations to decompose the complex kinematics and morphology of high-$z$ galaxies, trace outflows, and constrain the effect of feedback in the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond Extreme Burstiness: Evolving Star Formation Efficiency as the Key to Early Galaxy Abundance</a><span class="id">[2507.20606]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST observations have revealed an overabundance of bright galaxies at $z \geq 9$, creating apparent tensions with theoretical predictions within standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We address this challenge using a semi-empirical approach that connects dark matter halos to observed UV luminosity through physically motivated double power-law star formation efficiency (SFE) model as a function of halo mass, redshift and perform joint Bayesian analysis of luminosity functions spanning $z = 4 - 16$ using combined HST and JWST data. Through systematic model comparison using information criteria (AIC, BIC, DIC), we identify the optimal framework requiring redshift evolution only in the low-mass slope parameter $\alpha(z)$ while maintaining other SFE parameters constant. Our best-fitting model achieves excellent agreement with observations using modest, constant UV scatter $\sigma_{\rm UV} = 0.32$ dex, significantly lower than the $\gtrsim 1.3$ dex values suggested by previous studies for $z &gt; 13$. This reduced scatter requirement is compensated by strongly evolving star formation efficiency, with $\alpha$ increasing toward higher redshifts, indicating enhanced star formation in low-mass halos during cosmic dawn. The model also successfully reproduces another important observational diagnostic such as effective galaxy bias and cosmic Star Formation Density (SFRD) consistently across the full redshift range. Furthermore, model predictions are consistent up to a redshift of $z\sim 20$. Our results demonstrate that JWST's early galaxy observations can be reconciled with standard cosmology through the interplay of modest stochasticity and evolving star formation physics, without invoking extreme burstiness or exotic mechanisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine learning analysis of Photometric data from the Dark Energy Survey</a><span class="id">[2508.10191]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In order to retrieve cosmological parameters from photometric surveys, we need to estimate the distribution of the photometric redshift in the sky with excellent accuracy.

We compare these different techniques applied to training data obtained from the VIPERS survey. To deal with the incompleteness of the VIPERS catalogue, we use a space-partitioning data structure (K-d Tree) to estimate the reliability of the obtained photometric redshifts. We build a catalogue which is robust to the lack of training data in certain regions of colour space. We use the photometric data to create maps of overdensity as a function of the redshift distribution for more than 500 million galaxies. These maps split the sky into several onion-like redshift slices, which can be readily used for cosmological parameter estimation. On each angular slice, we create and present maps of the angular distribution of galaxies in that slice as well as an estimate of the redshift distribution, $n(z)$, related to the galaxy distribution of that slice, which is recovered from the redshift estimation methods. We achieve a sub-sample of DES galaxies, which are well matched to the VIPERS sample with an accuracy of the photometric redshifts with a $\sigma_{68}\sim0.035$ and a catastrophic outlier rate of the order of 3 per cent.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17447" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C–MetaLL) survey: VII.

Our goal is to derive updated period–Wesenheit–metallicity (PWZ) relations using the largest and most homogeneous metallicity sample ever used for such analyses, covering a range of $-1.3&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;+0.3$ dex. We computed several optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitudes using 275 DCEPs with reliable parallaxes, by applying a robust photometric parallax technique, which simultaneously fits all parameters – including the global Gaia parallax counter-correction – and handles outliers without data rejection. We find a stronger metallicity dependence ($\gamma \approx -0.5$ mag/dex in optical, $-0.4$ mag/dex in NIR) than recent literature reports. Gaia parallax zero-point conter-corrections ($\epsilon$) vary smoothly across bands, with an average value of $\sim$10 $\mu$as, aligning with previous determinations. Applying our PWZ relations to LMC Cepheids yields distances generally consistent within $1\sigma$ with geometric estimates. The choice of reddening law has a negligible impact, while using only fundamental-mode pulsators significantly increases the uncertainties. Including $\alpha$-element corrections increases $|\gamma|$ and reduces $\epsilon$. However, we find statistically consistent $\gamma$ values with the literature, particularly for the key Wesenheit magnitude in the HST bands, by restricting the sample to the brighter (i.e. closer) objects, or by including only pulsators with $-0.7&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;$0.2 dex. Our results hint at a large $\gamma$ or a non-linear dependence on metallicity of DCEP luminosities at the metal-poor end, which is difficult to quantify with the precision of parallaxes of the present dataset.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06773" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disentangling Milky Way halo populations at low metallicities using [Al/Fe]</a><span class="id">[2509.06773]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Differentiating between in-situ and accreted populations in the Milky Way halo is a challenging task. Various kinematic spaces are often used to identify distinct accreted populations from the in-situ Milky Way halo. However, this approach has limitations, especially at low orbital energies. To overcome this ambiguity, elemental abundances are typically used to distinguish between the populations. Yet, for many elemental abundance ratios, it remains difficult to make this distinction at low metallicities. Aluminium abundances, on the other hand, have been empirically found to be an effective discriminator, allowing for the separation of accreted and in-situ populations in the Milky Way halo even at low metallicities and low orbital energies. We aim to test the discriminating power of [Al/Fe] using a well-studied sample of high-velocity stars in the solar vicinity with high-quality spectra. With these stars, we explore the [Al/Fe] ability to separate the in-situ from accreted stars and test its limitations. We derived aluminium abundances from the Al I 3944 and 3961 {\rm Å} lines for 45 stars observed in two ESO programmes, along with 11 stars with archival spectra. Aluminium abundances were determined using 1D LTE and 1D NLTE spectral synthesis and line profile fitting. We confirm that the low-$\alpha$ population systematically has lower [Al/Fe] compared to high-$\alpha$ stars. Aluminium abundances, when carefully measured and NLTE effects taken into account, are effective tracers of the chemical history of halo stars. They provide an independent constraint on origin, complementing $\alpha$-element abundances trends, and help us to disentangle subpopulations within the accreted halo, especially in the metal-poor regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Witnessing downsizing in the making: quiescent and breathing galaxies at the dawn of the Universe</a><span class="id">[2509.09764]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>[Shortened for arXiv] We conduct a systematic search for $\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 9.5$ quiescent galaxies at $z &gt; 3$ in six extragalactic deep fields observed with NIRCam, with the goal of extracting their physical and statistical features in a uniform and self-consistent manner. We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional forms of star formation history and the $\chi^2$ probabilities of the solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as &quot;gold&quot;. According to the best-fit models, 79\% of the massive ($\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 10.5$) quiescent galaxies at $3 &lt; z &lt; 5$ stopped forming stars at least 150 Myr before the time of observation, while 89\% of low-mass sources have been quenched for less than 150 Myr. The abundance of low-mass old quiescent systems does not increase significantly with time from $z = 5$ to 3: low-mass objects seem to be experiencing a short episode of quenching followed by rejuvenation (“breathing”), consistent with a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. We also find an abrupt drop in the density of massive quiescent candidates at $z &gt; 5$. We derive estimates for the number density of early passive galaxies up to $z = 10$ and compare them against various models: tensions with data remain in the modeling of the observed bimodality of time passed since quenching as a function of mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18961" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Both Stellar Mass and Gravitational Potential Shape the Gas-Phase Metallicity</a><span class="id">[2509.18961]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The relation between metallicity and galaxy mass (the so-called mass-metallicity relation) is the strongest and most prominent among scaling relations between chemical enrichment and galactic properties. However, it is unclear whether this relation primarily traces metal retention or the integrated production of metals, as past studies have obtained contrasting results. We investigate this issue through an extensive Random Forest and Partial Correlations analysis of spectral cubes of 4,500 galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We find that stellar mass ($\rm M_*$) and baryonic gravitational potential ($\rm \Phi_* = M_*/R_e$) are the two most important quantities determining gas metallicity in galaxies. However, their relative roles strongly depend on the galactocentric radius – the metallicity within 0.7 $\rm R_e$ depends primarily on the stellar mass, while the metallicity at radii beyond 0.9 $\rm R_e$ depends primarily on the gravitational potential. This finding can be interpreted in terms of metals in the central region ($\rm R\leq 0.7~R_e$) being mostly bound, regardless of the global gravitational potential and, therefore, the metallicity is determined primarily by the cumulative production of metals (hence the integrated star formation history, i.e. $\rm M_*$); by contrast, in the galactic peripheries the retention of metals depends more critically on the gravitational potential, hence the stronger dependence of the metallicity on $\rm \Phi_*$ at large radii. Our finding reconciles apparent discrepancies between previous results. Finally, we find that the Star Formation Rate is the third most important parameter (after $\rm M_*$ and $\rm \Phi_*$) in determining the metallicity, as expected from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ionization Sources of the Local Interstellar Clouds: Two B-stars, Three White Dwarfs, and the Local Hot Bubble</a><span class="id">[2510.05263]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dominant sources of photoionizing radiation in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) incident on the exterior of the local interstellar clouds include two nearby early B-type stars, $\epsilon$ CMa ($124\pm2$ pc) and $\beta$ CMa ($151\pm5$ pc), three hot dwarfs, and the local hot bubble (LHB). Line emission (170-912A) from highly ionized metals (Fe, Ne, Mg) in million-degree LHB plasma may be responsible for the elevated ionization fractions of helium ($n_{\rm HeII}/n_{\rm He} \approx 0.4$) compared to hydrogen ($n_{\rm HII} / n_{\rm H} \approx 0.2$) in the local clouds. We update the stellar parameters and ionizing flux for $\beta$ CMa, after correcting the EUV spectra for intervening HI column density, $N_{\rm HI} = 1.9\pm0.1\times10^{18}~{\rm cm}^{-2}$, and its hotter effective temperature, $T_{\rm eff} \approx 25,000$K vs. 21,000K for $\epsilon$ CMa. These two stars produce a combined H-ionizing photon flux $\Phi_{\rm H} \approx 6800\pm1400$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at the external surface of the local clouds. The hot bubble could produce comparable fluxes, $\Phi_{\rm H} =$ 2000-9000 cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, depending on the amount of metal depletion into dust grains that survive sputtering. The radial velocities and proper motions of $\beta$ CMa and $\epsilon$ CMa indicate that both stars passed within $10\pm1$ pc of the Sun $4.4\pm0.1$ Myr ago, with 100-200 times higher local ionizing fluxes. At that time, the local clouds were likely farther from the Sun, owing to their transverse motion. Over the last few Myr, EUV radiation from these two stars left a wake of highly ionized gas in a hot, low-density cavity produced by past supernova explosions in the Sco-Cen OB association and connected with the LHB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26625" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The chemical DNA of the Magellanic Clouds IV.

We measure [Eu/Fe] abundance ratios in 209 giant stars that are confirmed members of the SMC, providing the first extensive dataset of Eu abundances in this galaxy across its full metallicity range, spanning more than 1.5 dex. We compare Eu abundances with those of Mg and Ba to evaluate the efficiency of the r-process relative to $\alpha$-capture and s-process nucleosynthesis. The SMC shows enhanced [Eu/Fe] values at all metallicities (comparable with the values measured in the Milky Way), with a clear decline as [Fe/H] increases (from $\sim$ -1.75 dex to $\sim$ -0.5 dex), consistent with the onset of Type Ia supernovae. In contrast, [Eu/Mg] is enhanced by about +0.5 dex at all [Fe/H], significantly above the values observed in Milky Way stars, where [Eu/Mg] remains close to solar, reflecting comparable production of r-process and $\alpha$-capture elements. Moreover, [Ba/Eu] increases with metallicity, beginning at [Fe/H] $\approx$ -1.5 dex, namely at a lower metallicity with respect to the Milky Way, where [Ba/Eu] starts to increase around [Fe/H] $\approx$ -1 dex. Our findings suggest the SMC has a higher production of Eu (with respect to the $\alpha$-elements) than the Milky Way but in line with what observed in other dwarf systems within the Local Group. We confirm that galaxies with star formation efficiencies lower than the Milky Way have high [Eu/$\alpha$], probably indicating a stronger efficiency of the delayed sources of r-process at low metallicities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST provides a new view of cosmic dawn: latest developments in studies of early galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.04843]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Studies of the distant Universe are providing key insights into our understanding of the formation of galaxies.

A central challenge in this endeavor is to quantify the information content carried by these summary statistics in cosmic fields. In particular, how should we assess which statistics are more informative than others and assess the exact degree of complementarity of the information from each statistic? Here, we introduce mutual information (MI) that provides, from an information-theoretic perspective, a natural framework for assessing the sufficiency and complementarity of summary statistics in cosmological data. We demonstrate how MI can be applied to typical inference tasks to make information-theoretic evaluations, using two representative examples: the cosmic microwave background map, from which the power spectrum extracts almost all information as is expected for a Gaussian random field, and the 21 cm brightness temperature map, from which the scattering transform extracts the most non-Gaussian information but is complementary to power spectrum and bispectrum. Our results suggest that MI offers a robust theoretical foundation for evaluating and improving summaries, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of cosmic fields from an information-theoretic perspective.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WATSON-Net: Vetting, Validation, and Analysis of Transits from Space Observations with Neural Networks</a><span class="id">[2511.08768]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context.

In this work, we present WATSON-Net, a new open-source neural network classifier and data preparation package designed to compete with current state-of-the-art tools for vetting and validation of transiting exoplanet signals from space-based missions. Methods. Trained on Kepler Q1-Q17 DR25 data using 10-fold cross-validation, WATSON-Net produces ten independent models, each evaluated on dedicated validation and test sets. The ten models are calibrated and prepared to be extensible for TESS data by standardizing the input pipeline, allowing for performance assessment across different space missions. Results. For Kepler targets, WATSON-Net achieves a recall-at-precision of 0.99 (R@P0.99) of 0.903, ranking second, with only the ExoMiner network performing better (R@P0.99 = 0.936). For TESS signals, WATSON-Net emerges as the best-performing non-fine-tuned machine learning classifier, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.76 on a test set comprising confirmed planets and false positives.

The nominal Roman Coronagraph observing plan involves alternating observations of a science target and a bright, nearby reference star. High contrast is achieved using wavefront sensing and control, also known as &quot;digging a dark hole&quot;, where performance depends on the properties of the reference star, requiring V&lt;3, a resolved stellar diameter &lt;2 mas, and no stellar multiplicity. The imposed brightness and diameter criteria limit the sample of reference star candidates to high-mass main sequence and post-main sequence objects, where multiplicity rates are high. A future HWO coronagraph may have similarly restrictive criteria in reference star selection. From an exhaustive literature review of 95 stars, we identify an initial list of 40 primary and 18 reserve reference star candidates relevant to both the Roman Coronagraph and HWO. We present results from an initial survey of these candidates with high-resolution adaptive optics imaging and speckle interferometry and identify no new companions.

This model simulates complex instrumental features including dark current, charge transfer efficiency, clock-induced charge, multiplication noise factor, and various readout effects like striping and drift.

To achieve these goals, three groups of superconducting lumped-element on-chip low-pass/band-pass filter-banks were designed to hierarchically sum the superconducting, broadband, non-resonant, slot-dipole antenna arrays and band-pass filter the trans-mm light before outputting it on microstripline to detectors (KIDs in the case of NEW-MUSIC).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of the radio source position uncertainties in radio astrometric catalogs over the past three decades</a><span class="id">[2511.09027]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, progress in improving the coordinates uncertainty of extragalactic radio sources derived from astrometric and geodetic VLBI observations is investigated. For this purpose, 30 catalogs of radio source positions computed in 1997-2025 were analyzed. Over these years, the median source position uncertainty represented by the semi-major axis of the error ellipse for 467 sources in common to all catalogs improved by one order of magnitude: from 0.156 mas to 0.015 mas. It was also found that the improvement in the position uncertainty over time follows a power law with high accuracy. The number of observations used for determination of the coordinates of the common sources in the input catalogs increased over time from 1.3 to 14.4 million, also following a power law. A discussion of the results led us to the conclusion that the number of observations is the primary factor in improving the source positions uncertainty compared to the number of sessions in which the source was observed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: HSTDM–Synthetic Data Generation</a><span class="id">[2511.09074]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The High Sensitivity Terahertz Detection Module (HSTDM), a key component of the backend modules on board the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), will offer great opportunities for the discovery of Terahertz Astronomy, with implications that extend well beyond China to the global astronomical this http URL is imperative that the raw data collected by HSTDM undergoes meticulous calibration and processing through the HSTDM data processing pipeline (HSTDM pipeline for short) to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the final science data to be archived for further this http URL process necessitates that the HSTDM pipeline address instrumental artifacts and effects as well as the coordination of data flow of the scheduled observing sequences under all observing modes of HSTDM within the CSST automated processing this http URL the understanding of CSST HSTDM data processing develops during the pipeline development stage, it becomes essential to assess the accuracy, the robustness and the performance of the HSTDM pipeline under all observing modes of HSTDM so that components of the HSTDM pipeline be rationally added, removed, amended or extended within the modular this http URL this paper, we develop practical simulation methods to facilitate this need.

To address this challenge, we develop a deep learning framework based on a residual one-dimensional convolutional neural network for lensed GW identification under multiband observations. The model directly processes multiband waveforms from binary neutron star systems, covering the early inspiral observed by the DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and the late inspiral observed by the Einstein Telescope (ET), corresponding approximately to the wave-optics and geometrical-optics regimes, respectively. It enables end-to-end classification of five classes: pure noise, unlensed GWs, and three representative lensed GWs corresponding to singular isothermal sphere (SIS), cored isothermal sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. A dataset of 10^6 simulated samples was constructed with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 5 to 100. The deep learning model with multiband observations achieves an accuracy of 97.0% and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.97, significantly exceeding the single-detector performance, where DECIGO and ET reach 72.8% and 62.3%, respectively. Even in the low-SNR regime (SNR &lt; 20), the model maintains an accuracy above 63%, while in the high-SNR regime (SNR &gt; 80), its accuracy approaches 99.8%. These results demonstrate that multiband GW observations effectively enhance the detection of lensed GWs within complex noise environments, providing a robust and efficient pathway for the automated identification of lensed GWs in future multiband observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09419" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">POLAR-2 - Latest Developments of the Next Generation GRB Polarimeter</a><span class="id">[2511.09419]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the Universe. Despite over 50 years of research and measurements their prompt emission remains poorly understood, with key questions surrounding the structure of relativistic jets, magnetic field configurations, and dominant radiation mechanisms. Polarization measurements are critical in resolving these uncertainties. The POLAR mission, operational in 2016-2017 on Tiangong-2, provided the most statistically significant GRB polarization data. Its results indicated low time-averaged polarization with hints of temporal evolution. However, POLAR's limited sensitivity, small effective area, and restricted energy range prevented more detailed time- and energy-resolved analyses in addition to a larger sample of GRB polarization measurements. POLAR-2 is designed to address these limitations by offering a fourfold increase in effective area (at least) and an extended energy range of 30-800 keV by utilizing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and an updated module design, enabling the differentiation of competing GRB emission models. The instrument comprises of 100 polarimeter modules (each with 64 plastic scintillator bars), wherein the polarization angle is extracted through Compton Scattering of the gammas. The polarimeter module design was validated during an ESRF beam test campaign in 2023. The instrument was developed by a joint effort of Switzerland, China, Poland and Germany and is planned for launch in 2027. Currently, POLAR-2 is in its production phase with the first module targets being produced. We will provide an overview of the current status of the development.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comprehensive Study of the Lunar Energetic Particle Environment with LunPAN</a><span class="id">[2511.09429]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>LunPAN (Lunar Particle Analyzer Network) is a three-year mission proposal designed to comprehensively map the particle spectra in the lunar radiation field.

Characterization can be challenging in the field, particularly in the decentered and tightly packed optical configurations that are employed for many astronomical millimeter-wave cameras. In this paper, we present the design and performance of a lightweight and reconfigurable beam mapper, consisting of a bank of thermal sources positioned by a planar cable-driven robot. We describe how the measurement requirements and mechanical constraints of the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME) optical relay drive the design of the mapper. To quantify the positioning performance, we predict the beam patterns at each surface to derive requirements and use a non-contact computer-vision based method built on OpenCV to track the payload position with an accuracy better than 1.0 mm. We achieve an in-plane absolute payload position error of 2.7 mm (RMSE) over a $\sim$400 mm $\times$ 400 mm workspace and an in-plane repeatability of 0.81 mm, offering substantial improvements in accuracy and speed over traditional handheld techniques.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09503" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Time-Dependent Physics with Phase-Folding CMB Maps</a><span class="id">[2511.09503]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Time-resolved observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer a powerful probe of time-dependent cosmological signals, such as a stochastic gravitational wave background passing through Earth, which imprints a time-varying deflection on the CMB, and time-dependent cosmic birefringence, which induces an oscillating polarization rotation. However, analyses based on time-division CMB maps are fundamentally limited by the mapmaking cadence, restricting sensitivity to frequencies below $\sim 10^{-5}$ Hz. In this paper we develop a phase-folding mapmaking framework to enable targeted searches of such periodic cosmological signals with frequencies up to the detector sampling rate of $O(100)$ Hz. We demonstrate the power of this framework with two cosmological applications: (1) constraining a stochastic gravitational wave background via its time-dependent lensing signature, and (2) the search for an oscillating polarization rotation from axion-like particles. We show that this technique transforms CMB experiments into broadband probes of the oscillating sky, extending their constraining power from the microhertz regime up to $O(100)$ Hz-an expansion of over seven orders of magnitude in frequency. This provides a new observational window, complementary to other approaches by probing under-explored frequency ranges for gravitational waves and axion-like particles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Progress on the ALETHEIA project and new approaches to events overlap mitigation</a><span class="id">[2511.08954]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ALETHEIA project aims to search for low-mass dark matter using liquid helium (LHe)-filled time projection chambers (TPCs).

Launched in 2020, our project has made significant progress since then. These advancements have convinced us that a single-phase LHe TPC is technologically feasible. Compared to liquid xenon and liquid argon TPCs, one of the unique challenges for LHe TPCs is event overlap caused by the 13-second lifetime scintillation. We will demonstrate that this overlap can be entirely mitigated when the LHe temperature is maintained near 1.0 K.

By investigating its learning process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First, from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and different dominant physical processes.

Yet their capabilities in scientific imaging, especially on unfamiliar and potentially previously unseen data distributions, remain poorly understood. In this work, we assess whether generic VLMs, presumed to lack exposure to astronomical corpora, can perform morphology-based classification of radio galaxies using the MiraBest FR-I/FR-II dataset. We explore prompting strategies using natural language and schematic diagrams, and, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce visual in-context examples within prompts in astronomy. Additionally, we evaluate lightweight supervised adaptation via LoRA fine-tuning. Our findings reveal three trends: (i) even prompt-based approaches can achieve good performance, suggesting that VLMs encode useful priors for unfamiliar scientific domains; (ii) however, outputs are highly unstable, i.e. varying sharply with superficial prompt changes such as layout, ordering, or decoding temperature, even when semantic content is held constant; and (iii) with just 15M trainable parameters and no astronomy-specific pretraining, fine-tuned Qwen-VL achieves near state-of-the-art performance (3% Error rate), rivaling domain-specific models. These results suggest that the apparent &quot;reasoning&quot; of VLMs often reflects prompt sensitivity rather than genuine inference, raising caution for their use in scientific domains. At the same time, with minimal adaptation, generic VLMs can rival specialized models, offering a promising but fragile tool for scientific discovery.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Photometric Classifier for Tidal Disruption Events in Rubin LSST</a><span class="id">[2509.25902]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are astrophysical phenomena arising when stars are disrupted by supermassive black holes. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), with its unprecedented depth and cadence, will detect thousands of TDEs, motivating the need for robust photometric classifiers capable of efficiently distinguishing these events from other extragalactic transients. We aim to develop and validate a machine learning pipeline for photometric TDE identification in LSST-scale datasets. Our classifier is designed to provide high precision and recall, enabling the construction of reliable TDE catalogs for multi-messenger follow-up and statistical studies. Using the second Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC2) dataset, we fit Gaussian Processes (GP) to light curves for feature extraction (e.g., color, rise/fade times, GP length scales). We then train and tune boosted decision-tree models (XGBoost) with a custom scoring function emphasizing high-precision recovery of TDEs. Our pipeline is tested on a diverse simulation of transient and variable events, including supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and superluminous supernovae. We achieve high precision (up to 95%) while maintaining competitive recall (about 72%) for TDEs, with minimal contamination from non-TDE classes. Key predictive features include post-peak colors and GP hyperparameters, reflecting characteristic timescales and spectral behaviors of TDEs. Our photometric classifier provides a practical and scalable approach to identifying TDEs in forthcoming LSST data. By capturing essential color and temporal properties through GP-based feature extraction, it enables efficient construction of clean TDE candidate samples.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlowLensing: Simulating Gravitational Lensing with Flow Matching</a><span class="id">[2510.07878]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful probes of dark matter, yet creating high-fidelity lensed images at scale remains a bottleneck.

Widely considered to be the sources of gravitational waves, binaries are expected to form as a natural consequence of galactic mergers and determining the processes that drive their evolution is essential for understanding cosmological evolution. In this work, we evaluate the prospects of using ground and spaceborne Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to observe supermassive black hole binaries and estimate their orbital parameters. The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is considered as the primary case study. Achieving unprecedented resolution, BHEX will provide access to a new volume of binary parameter space, potentially enabling the first, confident detection of an SMBHB. A binary toy model using a post-Newtonian orbit propagation is developed and simulated observations by BHEX and a ground array of telescopes are performed. An orbit fitting approach using Bayesian dynamic nested sampling is presented and its efficacy is demonstrated on the simulated observational data for a set of example binary systems. It is found that for BHEX, binary detection requires a total flux density of 0.04 Jy with a minimum separation of  2 $\mu$as and an observable mass ratio dependent on the total flux. With three annual observations, BHEX could constrain semi-major axis and eccentricity of binaries with orbital periods $\leq$10 years to within 13% of the true values. A curved trajectory could confidently be detected in binaries with period $\leq$23 years. Proposals for how candidate sources could be identified in time for the BHEX mission are also provided. Finally, we constrain the requirements of a future spaceborne VLBI system, capable of performing a statistically significant survey of supermassive black hole binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayesian network 3D event reconstruction in the Cygno optical TPC for dark matter direct detection</a><span class="id">[2506.04973]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The CYGNO experiment is developing a high-resolution gaseous Time Projection Chamber with optical readout for directional dark matter searches.

We present a computational statistical well-posed solution for this problem. The backbone of DCM is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the least squares fit is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM can not fail because this simple time series analysis method computes a massive number of linear least squares fits. Hence, the data spacing, even or uneven, is irrelevant. We use the Fisher-test to identify the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. This best model must also pass our Predictivity-test. Our analyses of simulated complex data sets expose the weaknesses of DFT and the efficiency of DCM. The DFT and DCM are frequency-domain parametric methods. There are many other similar parametric methods. Just like DFT, those other methods suffer from their own particular application limitations. The list of those limitations is long. DCM suffers from none of those limitations. The performance of DCM depends only on the data set size and accuracy. DCM is an ideal forecasting method because the data set time span $(\Delta T)$ is irrelevant. It does not matter how long $(\Delta T)$ and/or complex the data set is because DCM will inevitably detect the signal(-s) and the trend when the data set size $(n)$ and/or accuracy $(\sigma)$ become adequate.</p></div></details></article></body>
