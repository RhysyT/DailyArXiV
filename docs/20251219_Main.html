By 2027, the SO Small Aperture Telescope (SAT) complement will be doubled from three to six telescopes, including a doubling of the detector count in the 93 GHz and 145 GHz channels to 48,160 detectors. Combined with a planned extension of the survey duration to 2035, this expansion will significantly enhance SO's search for a $B$-mode signal in the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background, a potential signature of gravitational waves produced in the very early Universe. Assuming a $1/f$ noise model with knee multipole $\ell_{\rm knee} = 50$ and a moderately complex model for Galactic foregrounds, we forecast a $1\sigma$ (or 68% confidence level) constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of $\sigma_r = 1.2\times10^{-3}$, assuming no primordial $B$-modes are present. This forecast assumes that 70% of the $B$-mode lensing signal can ultimately be removed using high resolution observations from the SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) and overlapping large-scale structure surveys. For more optimistic assumptions regarding foregrounds and noise, and assuming the same level of delensing, this forecast constraint improves to $\sigma_r = 7\times10^{-4}$. These forecasts represent a major improvement in SO's constraining power, being a factor of around 2.5 times better than what could be achieved with the originally planned campaign, which assumed the existing three SATs would conduct a five-year survey.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A JWST Transmission Spectrum of the Temperate Sub-Neptune TOI-732 c</a><span class="id">[2512.15844]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In recent years, JWST has facilitated detections of carbon-bearing molecules in the atmospheres of temperate sub-Neptunes orbiting M dwarfs, ushering in a new era in the characterization of this intriguing planetary regime. We report the transmission spectrum of the temperate sub-Neptune TOI-732 c, observed with JWST NIRISS, NIRSpec G395H and MIRI LRS between 0.9-12 $\mu$m. The observations provide evidence for methane (CH$_4$) in a H$_2$-rich atmosphere, at a volume mixing ratio of $\sim$1\%, and non-detection of NH$_3$ and HCN, along with nominal constraints on other prominent molecules H$_2$O, CO and CO$_2$, which are typically expected in H$_2$-rich atmospheres. We conduct a comprehensive survey of 250 chemical species and find moderate to strong evidence (up to $\ln B\sim 5.9$, $3.9\sigma$) for additional absorption due to one or more complex molecules including higher-order hydrocarbons and/or sulfur-bearing molecules. The spectral features are strongly degenerate among these molecules and with methane, which we find at $\ln B=3.2-8.8$ (up to $3.0-4.6$$\sigma$) significance. Two complex molecules are preferred with at least moderate evidence ($\ln B \gtrsim 2.5$) in both the near- and mid-infrared, while several others show such evidence in at least one of the two wavelength ranges. The preferred molecules are found in trace quantities on Earth, with no significant sources identified in other planetary atmospheres, requiring future work to assess their physical plausibility in this planet. Future observations are required to resolve the degeneracies and place more robust constraints on these species. We highlight the need for further theoretical and experimental work to robustly characterize the atmospheric and internal composition of TOI-732 c and similar sub-Neptunes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15847" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self-confinement of relativistic pair beams in magnetized interstellar plasmas: the case of pulsar X-ray filaments</a><span class="id">[2512.15847]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The observation of filamentary X-ray structures near bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) – such as the Guitar, Lighthouse, and PSR J2030$+$4415 nebulae – and of slow-diffusion regions around pulsars like Geminga, Monogem, and PSR J0622$+$3749, challenges the standard picture of cosmic-ray transport in the interstellar medium, implying a diffusion coefficient two orders of magnitude smaller than the Galactic average. The suppressed diffusion can be attributed to self-generated magnetic turbulence, driven – via the non-resonant streaming instability – by electron–positron pairs escaping the PWNe. This instability requires a net current, yet the beam of escaping pairs is expected to be charge-neutral. We show that a charge-neutral pair beam propagating through an electron–proton plasma can spontaneously generate a net current. Using fully kinetic two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with realistic mass ratio, we find that beam electrons get focused into self-generated magnetic filaments produced by the nonlinear evolution of the Weibel instability, while beam positrons remain unconfined. The resulting net (positron) current drives the non-resonant streaming instability, further amplifying the magnetic field. This mechanism provides a pathway for the onset of charge asymmetries in initially charge-neutral pair beams and for the growth of magnetic fluctuations that efficiently scatter the beam particles, with implications for the formation of X-ray filaments and, more broadly, for particle self-confinement in TeV halos around PWNe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing Callisto's Near Subsurface Thermophysical Properties with ALMA Calibration Data</a><span class="id">[2512.15850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thermal images at different wavelengths probe varying subsurface depths of planetary bodies, and therefore can inform us about their compositions, thermophysical properties, and impact histories. We identified six archival observations of Callisto obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) between 2012 July 17 and 2012 November 4 at wavelengths of 0.43-0.47 mm (701.9-641.5 GHz). These wavelengths are shorter than those of nearly all other Callisto ALMA data and are sensitive to subsurface emission at depths (the upper  cm) between those sounded by millimeter and infrared observations. We estimate the disk-averaged brightness temperature as 133$\pm$15 K, and use a thermophysical mixture model to find that Callisto's thermal emission is best fit by a  50-50% two-component thermal inertia mixture of $\Gamma_{\text{low}}$ 15-40 and $\Gamma_{\text{high}}$ 1200-2000 J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$, consistent with recent ALMA observations of Callisto at longer wavelengths. Finally, we present several previously unpublished Galileo Photopolarimeter-Radiometer (PPR) observations of Callisto and derive thermal inertia and spectral emissivity maps using the same model. Altogether, these ALMA and PPR maps improve our understanding of the thermal properties and spatial distribution of Callisto's shallow subsurface regolith, and demonstrate the value of ALMA flux density calibrator data for extending frequency coverage of existing science data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The AIDA-TNG project: 3D halo shapes</a><span class="id">[2512.15856]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. The shapes of dark matter halos can be used to constrain the fundamental properties of dark matter. In standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmologies, halos are typically triaxial, with a preference for prolate configurations, particularly at low masses and high redshift. Aims. We focus on the characterization of total matter 3D shape in alternative dark matter models, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM). These scenarios predict different structural properties due to collisional effects or the suppression of small-scale power. Methods. We measure the different halo component shapes - dark matter, stars and gas - at various radii from the center in the AIDA-TNG (Alternative Interacting Dark Matter and Astrophysics - TNG), which is a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations built upon the IllustrisTNG framework. The intent is to systematically study how different dark matter models - specifically, SIDM and WDM - affect galaxy formation and the structure of dark matter halos, when realistic baryonic physics is also included. Results. SIDM models tend to produce rounder and more isotropic halos, especially in the inner regions, as a result of momentum exchange between dark matter particles. WDM halos are also slightly more spherical than their CDM counterparts, and are typically less concentrated. In all cases, the inclusion of self-consistent baryonic physics makes the central regions of all halos rounder, while still revealing clear distinctions among the various dark matter models. Conclusions. The general framework presented in this work, based on the 3D halo shape, can be useful to interpret multi-wavelength data analyses of galaxies and clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A second planetesimal collision in the Fomalhaut system</a><span class="id">[2512.15861]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nearby star Fomalhaut is orbited by a compact source, Fomalhaut b, which has previously been interpreted as either a dust-enshrouded exoplanet or a dust cloud generated by the collision of two planetesimals. Such collisions are rarely observed but their debris can appear in direct imaging. We report Hubble Space Telescope observations that show the appearance in 2023 of a second point source around Fomalhaut, resembling the appearance of Fomalhaut b twenty years earlier. We interpret this additional source as a dust cloud produced by a recent impact between two planetesimals. The positions and motion of two impact-generated dust clouds over twenty years provide constraints on the collisional dynamics in the debris belt.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15870" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Acoustic Oscillations as an Early-Universe Explanation of the DESI Anomaly</a><span class="id">[2512.15870]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>DESI DR2 data have been widely interpreted as evidence for late-time evolving dark energy (DE) with an apparent phantom crossing. Here we investigate an alternative explanation, based on early-Universe physics. If dark acoustic oscillations (DAO) are close in scale to baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), they can bias the extraction of the BAO scale from the peak in the galaxy correlation function. This leads to an apparent shift in the inferred distance if the superposition of BAO and DAO features is misinterpreted as being due to BAO only. Taking this shift into account, we find that a DAO with percent-level amplitude can reconcile DESI DR2 with Planck 2018 as well as Pantheon+ supernovae data, with fit improvement at a similar level as compared to evolving DE. Notably, a DAO feature with the required properties has been predicted in a previously proposed scenario that resolves the Hubble tension via a pre-recombination decoupling of dark matter and dark radiation (DRMD). The presence of a DAO feature close to the BAO peak can be scrutinized with future full-shape galaxy clustering data from DESI and Euclid.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In-plane Black-hole Spin Measurements Suggest Most Gravitational-wave Mergers Form in Triples</a><span class="id">[2512.15873]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The spin-orbit tilt angles $\theta_{1(2)}$ of merging stellar-mass black holes provide key insights into their astrophysical origin. The LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA Collaborations (2025a, arXiv:2508.18083 ) report that the spin-orbit tilt distribution of mergers in the latest Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0 exhibits a global peak at near-perpendicular directions $\cos\theta_{1(2)}\approx0$. Here, we recover this feature using hierarchical Bayesian inference with parametric models that are tailored to enhance the diagnostic power about astrophysical formation channels. We find that the spin distribution of the low-mass bulk of the binary black hole merger population $(m_1\lesssim 44.3^{+8.7}_{-4.6}\,\rm M_\odot)$ can be well-modelled by a dominant Gaussian component that peaks at $\cos\theta_{1(2)}\approx0$, possibly mixed with a subdominant isotropic component. Models that include a component with spins preferentially aligned with the orbit are disfavoured by current data (with Bayes factors $|\Delta\ln\mathcal{B}|\approx1$ to $3$) and constrain its contribution to be small ($\xi\sim\mathcal{O}(1)\,\%$). If these findings are reinforced by more detections, they would challenge any major contribution from the traditional isolated-binary formation scenario yielding closely aligned spins. Instead, the dominant component with near-perpendicular spins qualitatively matches expectations from the evolution of isolated massive stellar triples in the galactic field, where the Lidov-Kozai effect naturally produces a unique overabundance of mergers with $\cos\theta_{1(2)}\approx0$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15874" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bright Long Secondary Period Stars for Follow-up Observations</a><span class="id">[2512.15874]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long secondary period (LSP) variable stars are a subclass of long-period variables (LPV) that exhibit additional long-term variability alongside pulsations. Despite being observed in over 30% of LPVs, the reason behind the LSP phenomenon is still debated. The most favoured explanation, supported by recent growing evidence, is binarity, where the pulsating giant star has a substellar-mass companion. To further test this hypothesis, it is important to identify bright LSP variables, for which high-quality spectroscopic and interferometric observations can be obtained more easily. Motivated by the absence of a catalog of bright nearby LSPs, we searched the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) data in the $V$-band magnitude range 5.5-14 mag, and for declinations $&lt; +28^\circ$. The resulting catalog contains 23 LSPs, 13 of which are new discoveries. We compare our catalog with the LSP lists available in the literature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2D or not 2D? Exploring 3D relativistic magnetic reconnection dynamics with highly accurate numerical simulations</a><span class="id">[2512.15954]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast reconnection in magnetically dominated plasmas is widely invoked in models of dissipation in pulsar winds, gamma-ray flares in the Crab nebula, and to explain the radio nanoshots of pulsars. When current sheets evolve reaching a critical inverse aspect ratio, scaling as $S^{-1/3}$ with the plasma Lundquist number, the so-called \textit{ideal} tearing instability sets in, with modes growing, independently of $S$, extremely rapidly on timescales of only a few light-crossing times of the sheet length. We present the first set of fully 3D simulations of current-sheet disruption triggered by the ideal tearing instability within the resistive relativistic MHD approximation, as appropriate in situations where the Alfvén velocity approaches the speed of light. We compare 3D setups with different initial conditions with their 2D counterparts, and we assess the impact of dimensionality and of the magnetic field topology on the onset, evolution, and efficiency of reconnection. In force-free configurations, 3D runs develop ideal tearing, secondary instabilities, and a thick, turbulent current layer, sustaining dissipation of magnetic energy longer than in 2D. In pressure-balanced current sheets with a null guide field, 2D reference runs show the familiar reconnection dynamics, whereas in 3D tearing dynamics is quenched after the linear phase, as pressure-driven modes growing on forming plasmoids outcompete plasmoid coalescence and suppress fast dissipation of magnetic energy. Taken together, these results suggest that the evolution and efficiency of reconnection depend sensitively on the local plasma conditions and current-sheet configuration, and can be properly captured only in fully 3D simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15960" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESI-DR1 $3 \times 2$-pt analysis: consistent cosmology across weak lensing surveys</a><span class="id">[2512.15960]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a joint cosmological analysis of projected galaxy clustering observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1), and overlapping weak gravitational lensing observations from three datasets: the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), the Dark Energy Survey (DES-Y3), and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC-Y3). This combination of large-scale structure probes allows us to measure a set of $3 \times 2$-pt correlation functions, breaking the degeneracies between parameters in cosmological fits to individual observables. We obtain mutually-consistent constraints on the parameter $S_8 = \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.786^{+0.022}_{-0.019}$ from the combination of DESI-DR1 and DES-Y3, $S_8 = 0.760^{+0.020}_{-0.018}$ from KiDS-1000, and $S_8 = 0.771^{+0.026}_{-0.027}$ from HSC-Y3. These parameter determinations are consistent with fits to the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background dataset, albeit with $1.5-2\sigma$ lower values in the $S_8-\Omega_{\rm m}$ plane. We perform our analysis with a unified pipeline tailored to the requirements of each cosmic shear survey, which self-consistently determines cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We generate an analytical covariance matrix for the correlation data including all cross-covariances between probes, and we design a new blinding procedure to safeguard our analysis against confirmation bias, whilst leaving goodness-of-fit statistics unchanged. Our study is part of a suite of papers that present joint cosmological analyses of DESI-DR1 and weak gravitational lensing datasets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15961" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joint cosmological fits to DESI-DR1 full-shape clustering and weak gravitational lensing in configuration space</a><span class="id">[2512.15961]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a joint $3\times2$-pt cosmological analysis of auto- and cross-correlations between the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1) Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) samples and overlapping shear measurements from the KiDS-1000, DES-Y3 and HSC-Y3 weak lensing surveys. We perform our analysis in configuration space and, in addition to the cosmic shear correlation functions for each weak lensing dataset, we fit the tangential shear of the weak lensing source galaxies around DESI lens galaxies. Finally, we make use of the anisotropic BGS and LRG clustering information by fitting the full shape of the two-point correlation function multipoles measured over the full DESI-DR1 footprint, presenting the first full-shape analysis of DESI measurements in configuration space. We find that the addition of weak lensing information serves to improve, with respect to the clustering-only case, the measurements of the power spectrum amplitude parameters $\ln(10^{10}A_{\rm{s}})$ and $\sigma_{12}$ by $15\%$ and $36\%$, respectively. It also improves measurements of the linear bias of the lens galaxies by $15-20\%$, depending on the tracer. Our results show excellent consistency, regardless of the weak lensing survey considered, and are furthermore consistent with a companion analysis that fits $3\times2$-pt correlations including DESI projected clustering measurements, as well as the results published by the weak lensing collaborations themselves. Our measured values for weak lensing amplitude are $S_{8}^{\mathrm{DESI\times HSC}}=0.787\pm0.020$, $S_{8}^{\mathrm{DESI\times DES}}=0.791\pm0.016$, $S_{8}^{\mathrm{DESI\times KiDS}}=0.771\pm0.017$, which are $1.9\sigma-2.9\sigma$ below the $S_8$ value preferred by Planck. Finally, our clustering-only results are in good agreement with the Fourier space full-shape analysis of all DESI tracers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15962" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Constraints from Full-Scale Clustering and Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing with DESI DR1</a><span class="id">[2512.15962]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present constraints on cosmic structure growth from the analysis of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing with galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1.

Projected galaxy clustering measurements from DESI are supplemented with lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey around the same targets.

In this paper, we study the potential to calibrate photometric redshift (photo-z) distributions for gravitational lensing using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Since beginning its science operations in 2021, DESI has collected more than 50 million redshifts, adding about one million monthly. In addition to its large-scale structure samples, DESI has also acquired over 256k high-quality spectroscopic redshifts (spec-zs) in the COSMOS and XMM and VVDS fields. This is already a factor of 3 larger than previous spec-z calibration compilations in these two regions. Here, we explore calibrating photo-zs for the subset of KiDS-1000 galaxies that fall into joint self-organizing map (SOM) cells overlapping the DESI COSMOS footprint using the DESI COSMOS observations. Estimating the redshift distribution in KiDS-1000 with the new DESI data, we find broad consistency with previously published results while also detecting differences in the mean redshift in some tomographic bins with an average shifts of Delta Mean(z) = -0.028 in the mean and Delta Median(z) = +0.011 in the median across tomographic bins. However, we also find that incompleteness per SOM cell, i.e., groups of galaxies with similar colors and magnitudes, can modify n(z) distributions. Finally, we comment on the fact that larger photometric catalogs, aligned with the DESI COSMOS and DESI XMM and VVDS footprints, would be needed to fully exploit the DESI dataset and would extend the coverage to nearly eight times the area of existing 9-band photometry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sesquinary Catastrophe on Deimos can reconcile its excited past with its dynamically cool present</a><span class="id">[2512.15976]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origins of the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos are highly debated, and hypotheses include formation from an impact-generated circum-Martian disk or from capture of asteroids. With the impact scenario, Deimos (or its precursors) were formed or were pushed out beyond the synchronous orbit of Mars. Moons interior to the synchronous orbit, including Phobos (or its precursors), would tidally evolve and resonances between these moons could potentially excite Deimos' orbit. This contradicts Deimos' present-day orbit of low eccentricity ($0.00027$) and moderate inclination ($1.8^\circ$ to the Laplace plane). Tidal dissipation within Deimos is too inefficient for eccentricity damping, and without alternative mechanisms, Deimos' present-day orbit places strong constraints on the evolution of any inner moons. We propose that a runaway collisional cascade called the &quot;sesquinary catastrophe” acts as a natural barrier that prevents Deimos from having a more excited orbit. Using N-body simulations with collisional fragmentation, we show that if Deimos was more excited, it would undergo a sesquinary catastrophe and break apart into a Roche-exterior debris disk. Using a measure of sesquinary orbital excitation called $q$, our simulations and previous works suggest that breakup occurs for $q \gtrsim 8$ on timescales of $\sim 10^{3-4}$ years. If Deimos was destroyed in a sesquinary catastrophe and re-accreted from a (likely collisionally) damped debris disk, it should be a porous sand-pile moon, consistent with its smooth surface. The sesquinary catastrophe can be applied to other Deimos-like planetary moons at $q \gtrsim 8$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HEGS : Revisiting a decade of H.E.S.S. extragalactic observations</a><span class="id">[2512.16005]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During its first phase, from 2004 up to the end of 2012, the H.E.S.S.

Consequently, inviscid solar wind models require special treatment of the solution near the sonic points, and this has proven to be a significant impediment to efficient modeling of the solar wind. In this paper we revisit the governing hydrodynamic equations for the expanding solar wind, with the inclusion of the classical (Newtonian) viscous stress , and we show how this inclusion eliminates the singularities that emerge from the inviscid equations. This result has been previously reported and used to generate solar wind profiles from initial conditions in the asymptotic limit; however, those studies did not include realistic treatments of the inner corona, and generally rejected the prospect of extrapolating solutions outward from the Sun into the heliosphere. Here, we expand this method to include external heating and optically thin radiative losses and show that solutions can be computed from initial conditions near the solar surface, thereby capturing the entire range of scales from below the transition region to the outer heliosphere in a single solution. Our approach is to cast the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations as a system of five coupled, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which we solve using conventional methods, without any special treatment of the governing equations in the vicinity of the sonic point. The representative solutions that we present here demonstrate the utility and efficiency of this extrapolation method, which is considerably more realistic than commonly used analytical or empirical models. This method provides a direct approach to generating accurate solar wind profiles subject to observationally motivated initial conditions near the solar surface, at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable relaxation-based models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16091" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axisymmetric Modeling of DSHARP Dusty Disks: Asymmetric Structures and Inner-Disk Dispersal</a><span class="id">[2512.16091]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-resolution observations of Class II protoplanetary disks frequently reveal annular structures that may indicate the presence of embedded planets. In this study, we model brightness profiles and geometries for 16 dusty disks in the DSHARP observations to identify asymmetric substructures, including possible planet-induced signatures. We find no compelling evidence for circumplanetary emission in these systems. We identify a possible one-armed spiral in Elias 27; while previous studies report an $m=2$ spiral, the morphology of the newly identified spiral agrees with a spiral for a possible protoplanet. Although non-detection of circumplanetary emission is consistent with low expected luminosities, the absence of additional dust spirals except for Elias 27 may constrain properties of potential embedded planets given their theoretical detectability. The analyses further suggest that spiral amplitudes and phases correlated with gap and ring locations in WaOph 6 and IM Lup, appearing as deflections of spirals in images. Five disks exhibit strong residual asymmetries attributable to the vertical extent of their dust layers. We find that the brightness temperature of inner disks ($1$-$5$ au) declines with stellar age on a $\sim 3$ Myr timescale, while the total flux shows no clear decreasing trend. This trend is consistent with the presence of pressure bumps that retain large dust grains at outer radii, while allowing the inner disks to disperse. The universality of disk dispersal timescale at millimeter wavelengths, observed in both the extended DSHARP disks and the compact disks from previous demographic surveys, may constrain timing of planet formation, including habitable planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inferring the Intrinsic Energy Function of FRB 20220912A</a><span class="id">[2512.16122]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The statistical analysis of fast radio burst (FRB) samples from repeaters may suffer from a band-limited selection effect, which can bias the observed distribution. We investigated the impact of this selection bias on the energy function through simulations and then applied our analysis to the particular case of FRB 20220912A. Our simulations show that, in the sample of bursts observed by the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), assuming a unimodal intrinsic energy distribution, the band selection effect alone is insufficient to produce a bimodal energy distribution; only the bimodal central frequency distribution can achieve this. The bursts' energy of FRB 20220912A that primarily fell within the observing band showed no significant correlation with the central frequency. In contrast, bursts with higher central frequency tend to exhibit narrower bandwidth and longer duration. The distribution of the intrinsic energy can be modeled as a log-normal distribution with a characteristic energy of $8.13 \times 10^{37}$ erg, and a power-law function with the index of $1.011 \pm 0.028$. In contrast to the initial energy function reported by \cite{2023ApJ...955..142Z}, the low-energy peak vanishes, and the high-energy decline becomes steeper, which implies the low-energy peak is an observational effect. The bimodality of the energy distribution seems to originate from the intrinsic radiation mechanism.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galactic Centre Pulsars with the SKAO</a><span class="id">[2512.16155]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of a pulsar closely orbiting our Galaxy's supermassive black hole - Sagittarius A* - is one of the ultimate prizes in pulsar astrophysics.

The Bayesian inference is performed on the quantity $\log_{10}S^{*}(E)$ rather than on $S^{*}(E)$ itself, which naturally accommodates the wide dynamic range of the data and leads to approximately Gaussian uncertainties. The logarithm of the astrophysical factor is parametrized by a quadratic polynomial in energy, and the posterior distribution of the fit coefficients is determined using a weighted Bayesian regression. From this posterior, a global median $S^{*}(E)$ curve is constructed, and the associated covariance matrix is used to define a low/medium/high (LO/MED/HI) band corresponding to a $68\%$ credible interval. Particular emphasis is placed on the extrapolation below $E_{\mathrm{cm}}=2~\mathrm{MeV}$, where the fusion reaction rate is most relevant for stellar carbon burning. At $E_{\mathrm{cm}}=1.5~\mathrm{MeV}$, the posterior distribution yields $S_{\mathrm{global}}^{*}(1.5~\mathrm{MeV})= \left(2.13^{+0.01}_{-0.01}\right)\times10^{16}\,\mathrm{keV\,b}, $ corresponding to a $68\%$ credible interval.

Trained under varying solar wind conditions, including B_IMF, P_SW, and {\theta}_cone, the data-driven model accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and its variability in response to upstream solar wind drivers. Based on the PINN results, we identify key dependencies of magnetic field configuration on solar wind parameters, including the hemispheric asymmetries of the draped field line strength in the Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates.

However, the existence of post-red giant and post-asymptotic giant branch binaries with separations of 100 to 800 Rsun challenges this standard picture, as these systems appear to have experienced strong interactions without undergoing a classic CE inspiral. In this work, we investigate the effect of high mass ratio, q = M2/M1, on the CE inspiral using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations performed with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code PHANTOM. The primary is a 0.88 Msun, 90 Rsun red giant branch star, while the companion masses span q = 0.68 to 1.5. Higher mass ratios lead to wider post-CE separations, with a maximum of approximately 40 Rsun. The pre-CE mass transfer phase is longer for larger companion masses, and for q greater than or equal to 1 the inspiral becomes significantly more stable, broadly consistent with analytical expectations. This phase is not fully converged with respect to numerical resolution, and higher resolution simulations are expected to further increase its duration and stability. Although higher q systems show enhanced mass loss through the L2 and L3 Lagrange points, we find that circumbinary discs are more likely to form from fallback of bound envelope material. Fallback times are short, of order a few hundred years, and fallback radii lie well outside the binary, between 0.5 and 5 au, where discs are expected to spread efficiently through viscous torques. While high mass ratio systems produce wider post-interaction separations, these remain smaller than those observed. In contrast, fallback-formed discs have properties consistent with observed circumbinary discs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16289" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astrophysical Implications of Eccentricity in Gravitational Waves from Neutron Star-Black Hole Binaries</a><span class="id">[2512.16289]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The gravitational-wave signal from the neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger GW200105 is consistent with this binary having significant orbital eccentricity close to merger. This raises the question of how an eccentric NSBH might form. Compact object binaries that form via isolated binary star evolution should radiate away any orbital eccentricity long before their gravitational-wave signal enters the sensitive frequency range of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network. Meanwhile, dynamical environments – which can be conducive to mergers on eccentric orbits – produce very few NSBHs. We estimate the minimum measurable eccentricity of NSBHs at 10 Hz orbit-averaged gravitational-wave frequency, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$, finding that for GW200105, GW200115, and GW230529-like systems, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ is O(0.01). For a GW190814-like unequal-mass binary with significant higher-order mode content, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}=0.003$; this is an order of magnitude lower than when higher-order modes are not present. For dominant-mode signals from eccentric binaries with $m_2=1.5$ M$_\odot$ and a range of total masses from $3\,{\rm M_\odot} \leq M \leq50\,\rm M_\odot$, we find $0.008\leq e_{\mathrm{min},10}\leq0.022$. The relationship between $M$ and $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ is linear when the binaries are non-spinning. When the binaries are maximally spin-precessing, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ decreases as mass ratio becomes more unequal. We estimate the sensitivity of a quasi-circular templated search to a population of NSBHs from field triples, finding that we recover only 27% of our simulated population. Finally, we show that if  1/3 of present NSBH detections are measurably eccentric, then all of them are consistent with an isolated field triple origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16296" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-Energy Proton Events and Geomagnetic Storms in Solar Cycles 23 and 24</a><span class="id">[2512.16296]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar energetic protons (SEPs) in different energy channels from 10 to above 100 MeV are analyzed and their relationship to solar and geomagnetic activity is investigated.

We detect striking changes in the large-scale magnetic field strength and geometry over the course of just a few stellar rotations, a level of short-term global magnetic field evolution rarely reported in M dwarfs. We modeled the temporal variation of the longitudinal magnetic field using a Gaussian regression process, which allowed us to robustly determine the stellar rotation period and quantify the evolution timescale of the magnetic field. Independent Zeeman Doppler Imaging reconstructions of the two epochs confirm a significant reconfiguration of the star's global magnetic strength and topology. The detection of a weaker, complex, axisymmetric magnetic field (mean $|B| \sim 201$ G), which changes into a stronger, non-axisymmetric, dipole-dominated field (mean $|B| \sim 276$ G) over a few rotation cycles, is in contrast to results from similar fully convective M-dwarf stars. YZ Cet is known to exhibit polarized radio bursts potentially driven by auroral radio emission from star–planet interaction (SPI). By combining our magnetic maps with recent radio observations, we refine the constraints on the magnetic field strength of the innermost planet, YZ Cet b.

We study the accretion onto a star via an accretion disk, which launches jets that remove the high-entropy outer layers of the inflated envelope. This is the `jetted mass removal accretion scenario.' By manually removing the entire hydrogen-rich envelope from a red supergiant, we build a hydrogen-deficient WR stellar model with a mass of 6.03Mo and a radius of 0.67Ro. We then accrete mass onto it at a high rate. We mimic the real process of simultaneous mass addition near the equatorial plane and jet-induced mass removal from the outer envelope by dividing the accretion period into hundreds of pulses: in the first half of each pulse, we add mass, and in the second, we remove a fraction of this mass. The removal of tens of percent from the added mass decreases the stellar expansion by a factor of about 2-5. Our results show that WR stars can maintain a deep potential well and not expand much while accreting mass at high rates. This allows the formation of an accretion disk and the liberation of large amounts of gravitational energy. Our results strengthen models of intermediate-luminosity optical transients, such as luminous red novae, in which a non-degenerate star accretes at high rates and launches jets that power the transient event.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding the chemistry of temperate exoplanets atmospheres through experimental and numerical simulations</a><span class="id">[2512.16421]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Characterizing temperate exoplanet atmospheres remains challenging due to their small size and low temperatures. Recent JWST observations provide valuable data, but their interpretation has led to diverging conclusions. Complementary approaches combining laboratory experiments and photochemical modeling are essential for constraining atmospheric chemistry and interpreting observations. We aim to identify chemical pathways governing the formation and evolution of neutral species and to assess their sensitivity to key parameters such as C/O ratio and metallicity. Our approach combines experimental and numerical simulations on H2-rich gas mixtures representative of sub-Neptune atmospheres, spanning a wide range of CH4, CO, and CO2 mixing ratios. A cold plasma reactor simulates out-of-equilibrium upper-atmospheric chemistry. A 0D photochemical model reproduces reactor conditions, guiding interpretation of key pathways and abundance trends. We observe the formation of both reduced and oxidized organic compounds. In CH4-rich mixtures, hydrocarbons form efficiently through methane chemistry, correlating with CH4 concentration and agreeing with models. In more oxidizing environments, particularly CO2-rich mixtures, hydrocarbon formation is inhibited by complex reaction networks and oxidative losses. Oxygen incorporation enhances chemical diversity and promotes formation of oxidized organic compounds of prebiotic interest (H2CO, CH3OH, CH3CHO), especially in atmospheres containing both CH4 and CO2. Atmospheres containing CH4 and CO, which balance carbon and oxygen supply without excessive oxidative destruction, favor efficient production of hydrocarbons and oxidized compounds. Out-of-equilibrium chemistry plays a key role in the diversification and organic complexification of temperate exoplanet atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Classification of the equation of state of neutron stars via sparse dictionary learning</a><span class="id">[2512.16441]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The post-merger phase of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers encodes valuable information about the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear matter. Extracting this information from the analysis of the post-merger waveforms remains challenging due to the high-frequency limitations of current detectors. Future third-generation observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and NEMO, will have the sensitivity required to resolve post-merger signals with high fidelity. In this work, we apply CLAWDIA, our recently developed sparse dictionary learning (SDL) framework, to classify different EOS models using only the post-merger gravitational-wave emission of simulated BNS mergers available in the CoRe database. Our dataset comprises five EOS models representative of a broad range of neutron star properties. The SDL framework is optimised under realistic detection conditions by injecting signals into simulated noise matching the sensitivity curves of ET and NEMO. Our results show that classification is primarily driven by the dominant post-merger frequency, $f_2$, which encodes EOS-dependent information. At a modest signal-to-noise ratio of 5, our method achieves $F_1$ scores of $0.76$ for ET and $0.70$ for NEMO, with performance improving for higher signal-to-noise ratios. The reliability and generalisation capabilities of the model are assessed with additional tests, including the classification of an EOS not included in the training dataset and the analysis of detector-specific biases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How massive neutrinos reshape the cosmic web</a><span class="id">[2512.16517]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the effects of massive neutrinos on the cosmic web using the FLAMINGO simulations. We classify the cosmic web into voids, sheets, filaments, and clusters, and find that massive neutrinos affect the environment by decreasing the volume occupied by clusters and voids. We find that increasing the neutrino mass shifts the volume-weighted density distribution towards higher densities and leads to a more narrow density distribution, which we interpret as neutrinos delaying structure formation. We construct the minimum spanning tree (MST) graph from the subhaloes, adopting a number density chosen to match that expected for DESI-like observations. We show that most MST edges lie in filaments, approximately 70% throughout different simulations, which we link to its sensitivity to neutrino mass. We also link the MST's edge length signal at different scales to different cosmic web environments, with clusters dominating the signal at small scales, voids at longer scales, and filaments at intermediate scales. The strong correlation between MST edges and cosmic web environments reinforces the MST's potential to be used as a classifier for large-scale structure in galaxy surveys. We compare the effects of baryonic physics and massive neutrinos and find that each produces distinct signatures in MST edge lengths. This analysis is performed in 3D space, using the true positions of subhaloes and not accounting for redshift space distortions.

We aim at understanding the properties of ULX winds and their link with the source spectral and temporal behavior. We performed high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the variable source NGC 55 ULX-1 to resolve emission and absorption lines as observed with XMM-Newton at different epochs. Optically-thin plasma models are used to characterise the wind. We confirmed and thoroughly strengthened previous evidence of outflows in NGC 55 ULX-1. The presence of radiative recombination signatures and the ratios between the fluxes of the emission lines favours photoionisation balance and low-to-moderate densities, which confirm that the lines originate from classical XRB disc winds. An in-depth parameter space exploration shows line emission from a slowly moving, cool, and variable plasma perhaps associated with a thermal wind. Mildly-relativistic Doppler shifts (about -0.15c) associated with the absorption lines confirm, at higher confidence, the presence of powerful, radiatively-driven, winds. The comparison between results obtained at different epochs revealed that the wind responds to the variability of the underlying continuum and these variations may be used to understand the actual accretion regime and the nature of the source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16526" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsar B1237+25 at 111 MHz: average profile, mode switching, nullings, microstructure</a><span class="id">[2512.16526]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The observations of B1237+25 at a frequency of 111 MHz were analyzed. For the first time in the normal radiation mode a new component in the central region in the average profile was detected. This component is manifested in all modes of pulsar emission: quiet-normal (QN), flare-normal (FN) and in the abnormal mode (AB). The subpulse drift is observed in the QN mode only in the first and last components of the average profile. The normal mode is interrupted by nullings and transitions into the abnormal AB mode. In the AB mode, the structure at the edge of the outer cone is destroyed, the distance between the inner and outer cones is almost doubled, and the distance between the inner cone and the central region is this http URL of our data has shown that the components of the outer and inner cones of the average profile are formed by an ordinary mode of radio emission (O-mode) and form a single cone radiation of the pulsar. The central components of the average profile (wide and narrow) are formed by an extraordinary mode (X-mode). Estimates of the height of the radiation output from the central region (X-mode) and the cone radiation (O-mode) are obtained: 80 km and 370 km, respectively. A microstructure with a time scale of $\tau_\mu\le0.5$ $\mu s$ has been detected. This time scale corresponds well to the time of the development of a spark discharge in the polar cap. For this value $\tau_\mu$, the height of the vacuum gap should be $h_p\le750$ cm. Based on the steepness of the individual pulse's trailing edge at the longitude of the first component, a limit was obtained on the value of the $\gamma$ factor of the relativistic secondary plasma: $\gamma\ge$260. The dependence of the distance between the components of the outer and inner cone of radiation on the frequency is the same and corresponds to a power law with an exponent of -0.16.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16550" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warm Jupiter Tidal Migration Can Spare Inner Planets; Hot Jupiter Tidal Migration May Not</a><span class="id">[2512.16550]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we investigate the dynamical survival of short-period inner planets during the high-eccentricity tidal migration of companion exterior giant planets. Using a combination of analytic arguments and N-body simulations including equilibrium tides and general relativistic precession, we find the boundary in parameter space where an inner companion can remain dynamically stable. We find that survival requires a periastron separation exceeding roughly 14 mutual Hill radii at closest approach. Below this threshold, secular eccentricity exchange, orbit crossing, and/or tidal evolution can lead to the destruction of the inner planet. We apply our methodology to the current exoplanet sample and find that none of the known systems containing a short-period giant and an inner companion could have assembled via high-eccentricity tidal migration. However, warm Jupiters with larger periastron distances ($q_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 0.05-0.08$ AU, corresponding to final observed semi-major axis values $a_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 0.10-0.16$ AU) can allow the survival of short-period inner planets while potentially also circularizing on $\lesssim 1$ Gyr timescales.

Using the latest redshift-space distortion data, including DESI DR2 Full-Shape measurements, we constrain $M$ and $\sigma_8$ across three representative backgrounds: $\Lambda$CDM, an $H_0$-tension-reducing model, and a DESI-motivated dynamical dark energy scenario. In all cases, the square-root correction suppresses growth and can reconcile $\sigma_8$ with Planck at the $1\sigma$ level, with the strongest improvement occurring in the $H_0$-tension-oriented background.

During the first week, the larger spherical shell, the S-shell, forms the photosphere. As the shell expands and becomes increasingly transparent, the photosphere moves inward along the mass coordinate, although it grows in size. When the photosphere reaches the long axis of the elongated inner shell, the E-shell begins to contribute to the photosphere, ultimately comprising the entire photosphere. The simple toy model explains the transition of Rph(t) from being concave (decreasing slope) to convex (increasing slope). A single-shell model predicts only concave behavior. The structure of a spherical shell with an inner elongated shell is motivated by the morphologies of several CCSN remnants whose structures have been attributed to multiple pairs of jets in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The deduced multiple-shell ejecta of SN 2024ggi in this study, and of SN 2023ixf in an earlier study, as well as studies of the polarization of SN 2024ggi, are better compatible with the JJEM than with the neutrino-driven mechanism.

Here we present a comprehensive analysis of follow-up observations of high-energy neutrino events observed by the four IACTs between September 2017 (after the IceCube-170922A event) and January 2021.

Previous studies of directly imaged Earth-like planets have mainly examined the signatures of atmospheric composition, often using one-dimensional models, while the effect of horizontal temperature gradients has received limited attention. Because a pronounced horizontal temperature gradient may signal the absence of a global ocean, we investigate its detectability through thermal-emission direct imaging. Adopting Teegarden's Star b (zero-albedo equilibrium temperature $\sim 280$ K) as a benchmark, we compute three-dimensional atmospheric structures with and without a global ocean using the ROCKE-3D general circulation model and simulate geometry-dependent thermal emission spectra. We show that the temperature gradients that disfavor a global-ocean scenario manifest in both orbital phase variation and spectral shape of the snapshot spectra. The phase variation is more readily detectable: one-day integrations with LIFE at two orbital phases would reveal flux variations in no-ocean cases with 1-10 bar atmospheres, depending on background atmospheric composition. Shapshot spectra provide complementary diagnostics of global temperature contrast, the running brightness temperature of the continuum and detailed absorption band shapes, but require integration a few times longer. These three-dimensional effects, if neglected, can bias interpretations based on one-dimensional models. We also assess their detectability for other nearby exoplanets. Our results highlight the need to incorporate three-dimensional atmospheric structures when characterizing rocky exoplanets, both to constrain surface conditions and to avoid misinterpretation of spectral data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An effective $\boldsymbolΛ$-Szekeres modelling of the local Universe with Cosmicflows-4</a><span class="id">[2512.16591]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop an effective description of the local cosmic environment, namely, for redshift $z \lesssim 0.1$, to quantify the bias induced by local structure on cosmological observables.

Whilst 4D spatial and temporal variations of Earth as an exoplanet are below spectroscopic detection limits, such variability is planet-specific. We investigate LIFE's ability to detect 4D variability in the atmospheres of tidally locked exoplanets. We create daily synthetic LIFE observations of Proxima Centauri b in a 1:1 and an eccentric 3:2 spin-orbit resonance (SOR), using LIFEsim on spectra from daily 3D climate-chemistry model output of an aquaplanet with Earth-like composition. Hemispheric distributions of temperature, clouds, and chemical species determine spectral signatures and variability with orbital phase angle. Such variability dictates the extent to which parameters can be reliably inferred from snapshot spectra at arbitrary viewing geometries. In the 1:1 SOR, MIR spectra vary significantly with viewing geometry and indirectly probe atmospheric circulation. Nightside temperature inversions generate O3, CO2, and H2O emission features, though these lie below LIFE's detection threshold, and instead O3 features disappear at certain phase angles. In contrast, the 3:2 SOR yields a more homogeneous atmosphere with weaker phase variability but enhanced bolometric flux due to eccentric heating. Phase-resolved LIFE observations confidently distinguish between the SORs and capture seasonal O3 variability for golden targets like Proxima Centauri b. In case of abiotic O2/O3 build-up, the O3 variability presents a potential false positive scenario. Hence, LIFE can disentangle different spin-orbit states and resolve 4D atmospheric variability, enabling daily characterisation of the 4D physical and chemical state of nearby terrestrial worlds. Importantly, this characterisation requires phase-resolved rather than snapshot spectra.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cygnus X-3: A variable petaelectronvolt gamma-ray source</a><span class="id">[2512.16638]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of variable $\gamma$-rays up to petaelectronvolt from Cygnus X-3, an iconic X-ray this http URL $\gamma$-ray signal was detected with a statistical significance of approximately 10 $\sigma$ by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO).Its intrinsic spectral energy distribution (SED), extending from 0.06 to 3.7 PeV, shows a pronounced rise toward 1 PeV after accounting for absorption by the cosmic microwave background this http URL detected month-scale variability,together with a 3.2$\sigma$ evidence for orbital modulation, suggests that the PeV $\gamma$-rays originate within, or in close proximity to, the binary system this http URL observed energy spectrum and temporal modulation can be naturally explained by $\gamma$-ray production through photomeson processes in the innermost region of the relativistic jet, where protons need to be accelerated to tens of PeV energies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16679" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Einstein Probe Discovery of an X-ray Flare from K-type Star PM J23221-0301</a><span class="id">[2512.16679]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar flares are an intense stellar activity that can significantly impact the atmospheric composition of the surrounding planets and even the possible existence of life. During such events, the radiative energy of the star is primarily concentrated in the optical and X-ray bands, with the X-ray flux potentially increasing by tens or even hundreds of times. Einstein Probe (EP) detected a new X-ray transient EP J2322.1-0301 on 27 September 2024. Its spatial localization shows a high positional coincidence with the nearby high proper motion K-type star PM J23221-0301. Follow-up X-ray observations confirmed the flux enhancement of the source, while optical spectroscopic monitoring revealed time-variable features, particularly the disappearance of the H-alpha emission line. This X-ray flare is consistent with a characteristic fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) light curve, with a rise timescale of 1.4 ks, a decay timescale of 5.7 ks, and a total duration of about 7.1 ks. The peak luminosity in the 0.5-4.0 keV energy band reached about 1.3 x 10^31 erg s^-1, with a total energy release of about 9.1 x 10^34 erg, consistent with the empirical energy correlations observed in magnetic-reconnection-driven stellar flares, as inferred from the multitemperature plasma structure and H-alpha-X-ray energy correlation.

This study compares three General Circulation Models (GCMs) of the Venusian atmosphere up to the exosphere: the Venus Planetary Climate Model (Venus PCM), the Venus Thermospheric Global Model (VTGCM) and the Tohoku University GCM (TUGCM), focusing on their nominal simulations (e.g. composition, thermal structure and heating/cooling rates). Similarities and discrepancies among them are discussed in this paper, together with data-models comparison. The nominal simulations analyzed in this study fail to accurately reproduce the daytime observations of Pioneer Venus, notably overestimating the exospheric temperature. This is linked to an underestimation of the atomic oxygen (O) abundance in the three GCMs, and suggests the need of additional O production in the thermosphere. The selection of solar spectrum is also the main reason for the discrepancies between the models in terms of temperature dependence on solar activity. A list of recommendations is proposed aiming at improving the modeling of Venus' upper atmosphere, among them: 1. Standardize the EUV-UV solar spectrum input. 2. Update the near-infrared heating scheme with Venus Express-Era data. 3. Reassess Radiative cooling schemes. 4. Investigate the underestimated atomic Oxygen abundance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of two new millisecond pulsars towards the Galactic bulge</a><span class="id">[2512.16699]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The mysterious Galactic Center Excess of gamma rays could be explained by a large population of millisecond pulsars hiding in the Galactic bulge, too faint to be detected as individual high-energy point sources by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, as well as too fast and too dispersed to be detected in shallow radio pulsation surveys.

The same solar analog was used for both observations to remove one source of inconsistency.

While most studies on terrestrial planet formation assume planar configurations, wide binaries likely feature random inclinations, potentially disrupting planet-forming disks. This study explores the evolution of embryo-planetesimal disks in S-type motion in misaligned binary systems, focusing on the stage after the gas phase when terrestrial planet formation begins and gravitational interactions dominate. Using our GPU-accelerated N-body code GANBISS, we simulate disks with 2,000 planetesimals and 25 planetary embryos, studying the influence of the planetesimals on the evolution of the embryos and tracking their growth through collisions. After the simulations, we analyse collision outcomes with an analytical model. Moreover, for certain inclined binary configurations, we compare dynamically excited (perturbed by the secondary star) with cold disks in inclined configurations, as the distribution after the gas phase in misaligned binaries remains unclear. Our simulations reveal two key outcomes: (i) embryos migrate slightly inward in misaligned systems, and (ii) The initial large oscillations in embryos' inclinations and nodes around the respective values of the secondary star dampen over time. Collision analysis shows distinct differences: planar systems favour accretive collisions, while inclined configurations exhibit more destructive events. These findings underscore the sensitivity of planet formation dynamics to binary star alignment and initial disk conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark energy and neutrinos along the cosmic expansion history</a><span class="id">[2512.16781]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent cosmological measurements are hinting that dark energy may evolve, with its equation of state, $w_\mathrm{DE}$, even showing oscillatory patterns.

This is independent of potential shape or kinetic structure and rules out broad classes of canonical and non canonical models, leaving only near Lambda CDM behavior or fully decoupled fields as viable late time scalar dark energy, thereby leaving cosmological constant and minimally coupled scalar field models as the most consistent dark energy regimes.

(..) We focused our search on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), X-ray flashes (XRFs), X-ray flares from high-mass X-ray binaries and stellar flares, while Type-I and II X-ray bursts from Galactic neutron stars were excluded. 149 such fast transient events were detected. 63 of these are new to the literature. 38 flares are identified with 22 nearby stars. Three stars have never been seen flaring before in X-rays or optical (NLTT 51688, GR Dra and UCAC4 255-003783). We find that the MeV transient GRO J1753+57 is most likely the same object as GR Dra rather than an AGN as previously thought. Eleven flares were detected from known high-mass X-ray binaries with irregular wind accretion (four of which are of the subclass of supergiant fast X-ray transients). 100 GRBs were identified of which 24 have not been published before. We classify 37% of the X-ray detected GRBs as XRFs with relatively large X-ray to gamma-ray flux ratio, gamma-rays being measured with the BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor. The duration/spectral hardness distribution of all FXTs is bimodal, separating the group roughly in transients shorter and longer than 1 ksec and with relatively hard and soft spectra, respectively. We identify the 'short' FXTs as GRBs and XRFs and the `long' FXTs as flares from nearby late-type stars and X-ray binaries. The BeppoSAX-WFC FXT sample is found to be consistent with the one observed by Einstein Probe, when the sensitivity of the two instruments is taken into account.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Radio Search for Star-Planet Interaction in TOI-540 and SPECULOOS-3</a><span class="id">[2512.16852]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first targeted centimeter-band radio observations of two recently-discovered exoplanet systems that are prime candidates for magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI): TOI-540 and SPECULOOS-3.

This is computationally prohibitive with standard GW parameter estimation methods. We build on top of state-of-the-art neural posterior algorithms to accelerate the lensed inference from CPU days to minutes with DINGO-lensing. We showcase its capabilities by reanalyzing GW231123, the most promising lensed candidate so far, and find that its statistical significance cannot exceed 4$\sigma$. We observe that 8% of GW231123-like nonlensed simulations favor lensing, which could be explained by the self-similarity of short-duration signals. Still, 58% of GW231123-like lensed simulations have larger support for lensing, showing that higher detection statistics are possible.

In this paper, we consider this realistic situation and compute the strain, power, torque and the pulsar spin-down rate due to multiple mountains supported by the stellar crust.

In this work, we search for the resulting X-ray signatures from both of these channels summing over the $\textit{cosmological}$ NS population. We compare the predicted axion-induced X-ray signal to the cosmic X-ray background today as measured by a number of instruments such as NuSTAR, HEAO, Swift, and INTEGRAL. We model the axion-induced signal using NS cooling simulations and magnetic field evolution models. We find no evidence for axions and derive strong constraints for both ultralight and heavy axion scenarios, covering new parameter space for the axion-photon and axion-nucleon couplings.

This particle production acts as a source of thermal friction on the field that can make it difficult to distinguish whether dark energy is due to a radiating field rolling down a steep potential, a purely self-interacting field moving down a flatter potential, or a cosmological constant. By reducing the acceleration of the scalar field, thermal friction increases the amount of accelerated expansion and can cause a sizable bump in the quintessence equation of state. We take special interest in the case where a steep potential rapidly changes from positive to negative as the field evolves, resulting in the end of cosmic expansion and the beginning of contraction. Even in this case, we find that thermal friction lengthens the period of accelerated expansion and consequently delays the end of cosmic expansion, making it challenging to detect the impending transition to contraction using conventional cosmological tests. However, particle production can also provide alternative avenues for detection by generating a background of thermal dark radiation, partly comprised of neutrinos or other particles, whose energy density exceeds the remnant photon energy density.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kination and the Inert Doublet Model</a><span class="id">[2512.15864]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The inert doublet model is a two-Higgs-doublet extension of the standard model that provides a minimal and versatile framework for frozen-out dark matter.

It is fruitful to devise parameterizations of these distortions with only a few parameters which depend on the physical system considered. A method proposed by Stebbins consists in describing a distorted spectrum as a sum of thermalized spectra with a distribution of temperatures, the moments of which are the parameters of interest. After revisiting and extending this approach by working at the level of the number density distribution instead of the standard spectrum, we build another method which consists in describing the distorted spectrum by a polynomial modulating a reference thermalized spectrum. The distortion parameters are then the coefficients of a decomposition on a suitable orthonormal polynomial basis. We advocate that the latter is computationally easier and allows to describe a wide range of distortions. With this formalism, we efficiently describe the standard distortions of the cosmological backgrounds of neutrinos and photons, and we obtain model-independent constraints on nonstandard distortions of these cosmological relics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unraveling the anomaly in the production of $^{60}$Fe nucleus in massive stars</a><span class="id">[2512.16130]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The production of $^{60}$Fe is crucial for nucleosynthesis in massive stars and supernovae. In this work, by using the microscopic EP+IPM (exact pairing plus the independent-particle model) for the nuclear level density (NLD) and extended EP+PDM (exact pairing plus phonon damping model) for the $\gamma$-ray strength function (gSF), we re-evaluate the substantial enhancement of $^{60}$Fe production recently reported in {\it A. Spyrou et al., Nat. Comm. {\bf 15}, 9608 (2024)}, which was attributed to an unexpectedly large Maxwellian-averaged cross section (MACS). Our analysis demonstrates that this enhancement indeed originates from the choice of NLD, which, despite being constrained to reproduce the total NLD and gSF data, lacks a reliable spin dependence, a critical input for Hauser-Feshbach calculations of nuclear reaction rate. In contrast, our predictions yield a significantly lower MACS, calling the claimed enhancement into question. In particular, our approach highlights the microscopic nature of the low-energy enhancement of the gSF, the so-called upbend resonance, which arises from strong particle-particle ($pp$) and hole-hole ($hh$) excitations that emerge only at finite temperature, thereby further reinsisting on the invalidity of the Brink-Axel hypothesis in this low-energy region. Overall, our study reopens the question on the long-standing problem of $^{60}$Fe production in massive stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays propagation using the input from Configuration Interaction Shell Model</a><span class="id">[2512.16329]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dipole response of a nuclear system, characterized by its photon strength function (PSF), is a key ingredient of many applications of nuclear structure, ranging from nuclear reactor design and nuclear waste transmutation to astrophysical models of nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution.

Thus, systematic knowledge of the photoabsorption cross sections in light nuclei and of their subsequent particle decay is required. The purpose of this work is to enhance the database of available theoretical evaluations of PSF of light nuclei that are necessary in the studies of UHECR propagation. We employ the Configuration Interaction Shell Model (CI-SM) approach to provide predictions of $E1$ dipole response for $p$ and $sd$-shell nuclei, with mass number $A$ between 7 and 40.

We search for strongly lensed events in the newly acquired data by (1) searching for an overall phase shift present in an image formed at a saddle point of the lens potential, (2) looking for pairs of detected candidates with consistent frequency evolution, and (3) identifying sub-threshold counterpart candidates to the detected signals.

This leads to a characteristic suppression signature of the gravitational-wave signal at high frequencies, which may become observable in the frequency range of future interferometric gravitational-wave observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple Axions in Laboratory Experiments</a><span class="id">[2512.16837]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axions and axion-like particles generically appear in extensions of the Standard Model. While many searches assume only a single axion species, there may exist a whole spectrum of multiple such fields. We develop general formulas for axion-photon oscillations in the presence of multiple axions and analyze the implications for experimental searches, including light-shining-through-a-wall experiments, helioscopes and haloscopes. We demonstrate that axion multiplicity can qualitatively alter observational signatures, particularly through coherence and interference effects. Multiple axions can not only enhance signals compared to single axion scenarios, but also suppress them. We show that variations of experimental parameters and searches allow identifying contributions of multiple axions and obtaining information about their properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Binary Black Hole Mergers: Spin and mass ratio effects on gravitational waveforms</a><span class="id">[2304.09396]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive parameter-space study of binary black hole (BBH) mergers using the SEOBNRv4\_opt waveform model. Our analysis spans $\sim 10^6$ simulated waveforms across a broad range of mass ratios \( q = \frac{m_1}{m_2} \in [1.0, 2.0] \) and aligned spin configurations. We investigate the influence of these parameters on remnant properties, including final spin ($\chi_f$), fractional mass loss ($M_{\mathrm{FL}}$), and peak gravitational-wave strain ($h_{\max}$). By systematically analyzing the trends across four distinct spin alignments (PP, PN, BP, BN), we identify non-monotonic behaviors and turning points in $M_{\mathrm{FL}}$ and $\chi_f$ as functions of $q$, highlighting subtle dynamical effects that are not explicitly emphasized in commonly used remnant fitting formulae. While confirming known correlations from numerical relativity, our results offer new insights into parameter interactions and waveform morphology, with implications for BBH population studies and remnant characterization. Across all configurations studied, the fractional mass loss due to gravitational-wave emission ranges between 2\% and 9.5\%, depending on the mass ratio and spin alignment. This work may also aid in understanding the spin and mass distributions of the more massive black holes formed post-merger, thereby contributing to future remnant-based astrophysical inference.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inferring and Interpreting the Visual Geometric Albedo and Phase Function of Earth</a><span class="id">[2507.22258]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding reflectance-related quantities for worlds enables effective comparative planetology and strengthens mission planning and execution. Measurements of these properties for Earth, especially its geometric albedo and phase function, have been difficult to achieve due to our Terrestrial situation – it is challenging to obtain planetary-scale brightness measurements for the world we stand on. Using a curated dataset of visual (0.4–0.7 um) phase-dependent, disk-averaged observations of Earth taken from the ground and spacecraft, alongside a physical-statistical model, this work arrives at a definitive value for the visual geometric albedo of our planet: $0.242^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$. This albedo constraint is up 30–40% smaller than earlier, widely-quoted values. The physical-statistical model enables retrieval-like inferences to be performed on phase curves, and includes contributions from optically thick clouds, optically thin aerosols, Rayleigh scattering, ocean glint, gas absorption, and Lambertian surface reflectance. Detailed application of this inverse model to Earth's phase curve quantifies contributions of these different processes to the phase-dependent brightness of the Pale Blue Dot. Model selection identifies a scenario where aerosol forward scattering results in a false negative for surface habitability detection, which implies that aerosol forward scattering can effectively mimic an ocean glint signature in broadband visual phase curves. Observations of phase curves for Earth at redder-optical or near-infrared wavelengths could disentangle ocean glint effects from aerosol forward scattering. Finally, a review of albedos and planetary photometry is provided as well as a simple two-parameter fit to Earth's visual phase curve to ease adoption into other tools.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13765" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations</a><span class="id">[2508.13765]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with { varying resolutions and box sizes}, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts – emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice – not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Spatial Gap in the Sky Distribution of Fast Radio Burst Detections Coinciding with Galactic Plasma Overdensities</a><span class="id">[2509.06721]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the positional and morphological properties of about 3600 unique fast radio burst (FRB) sources reported in the second FRB catalog generated by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope. We find a two-dimensional dependence of FRB detections on sky position, and identify a significant absence of detections in a roughly circular region centered at Galactic coordinates (77.7$^\circ$, 0.9$^\circ$), spanning an area of 213.6 deg$^2$. This detection gap spatially coincides with the Cygnus X region $--$ a plasma-rich star-forming region in the Milky Way. This feature is most likely the result of increased sky temperature and strong multi-path scattering by turbulent ionized plasma, which broadens the FRB signals beyond detectability in the CHIME band. Our simulations yield a mean of 6 expected FRB detections within the gap when accounting for the elevated sky temperature in the direction of the detection gap. We infer that a lower limit of the maximum scattering timescale $\tau_{\rm sc,\, 1\,GHz} \geq 5.59$ ms, obtained without assuming a model of the Galactic electron distribution, is sufficient to suppress the brightness of all coincident FRBs. A similar suppression is seen in Catalog 2 along other high-emission measure (EM) sightlines (i.e., EM$\geq$2900 pc cm$^{-6}$), further supporting a broader trend of suppression due to Galactic scattering. Future very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) measurements of scattering disks with CHIME Outriggers could help confirm our interpretation. Our work highlights the notion that FRBs can serve as new, model-independent tracers of the warm ionized medium within our Milky Way Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2024aecx: a fast-evolving Type IIb supernova with a prominent shock-cooling peak</a><span class="id">[2509.12343]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>SN 2024aecx is a nearby ($\sim$11 Mpc) Type IIb SN discovered within $\sim$1 d after explosion. In this paper we report high-cadence photometric (typically 0.5$\sim$1 day) and spectroscopic follow-up observations, conducted from as early as 0.27 d post discovery out to the nebular phase at 158.4 d. We analyze the environment of SN 2024aecx and derive a new distance (11.3$\pm$1.1 Mpc), metallicity and host extinction. The light curve exhibits a hot and luminous shock-cooling peak at the first few days, followed by a main peak with very rapid post-maximum decline. The earliest spectra are blue and featureless, while from 2.3 d after discovery prominent P-Cygni profiles emerge. At nebular phase, the emission lines exhibit asymmetric and double-peaked profiles, indicating asphericity and/or early dust formation in the ejecta. Nebular spectral modelling indicates a blueshifted O-rich clump moving toward observer, and the $[\text{OI}]/[\text{CaII}]$ line ratio suggests an intermediate-mass progenitor. We simulated the progenitor and explosion using a two-component model of shock cooling and radioactive $^{56}$Ni heating; our model favors an extended, low-mass H-rich envelope with $M_{\mathrm{e}} = 0.04\pm{0.01} M_{\odot}$ and a low ejecta mass of$M_{\mathrm{ej}} = 1.55^{+0.18}_{-0.14} M_{\odot}$. And the nebular-phase spectra and light-curve modelling both suggest that it most likely originated from an intermediate-mass binary progenitor system. The comprehensive monitoring of SN 2024aecx, coupled with the detailed characterization of its local environment, establishes it as a benchmark event for probing the progenitors and explosion mechanisms of Type IIb SNe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">89.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST occultation reveals unforeseen complexity in Chariklo's ring system</a><span class="id">[2510.06366]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ring systems have been discovered around several small bodies in the outer Solar System through stellar occultations. While such measurements provide key information about ring geometry and dynamical interactions, little is known about their origins, lifetimes, evolutionary pathways, or compositions. Here we report near-infrared observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of a stellar occultation by (10199) Chariklo, a Centaur known to host a double-ring system. Our JWST measurements show that Chariklo's inner dense ring has become significantly more opaque than in previous observations, pointing to ongoing replenishment processes or dynamical restructuring. In contrast, the outer ring exhibits a much weaker near-infrared occultation signature than seen in earlier visible-light detections. This discrepancy may reflect material loss, suggesting that the outer ring could be transient, or may arise from wavelength-dependent opacity. These scenarios, which are not mutually exclusive, point to an unprecedented level of complexity in small-body ring systems, distinct from those observed around any other minor bodies in the Solar System.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">90.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eclipsing Stellar Flare on the Demon Star Algol Binary System Observed during the MAXI-NICER Follow-up Campaign in 2018</a><span class="id">[2510.14587]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Algol is a well-known eclipsing binary hosting an active and variable star that exhibits frequent stellar flares. Here, we report our pre-planned and coordinated rapid X-ray follow-up observations of an eclipsing flare on Algol. The Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) detected a flare on Algol at 05:52 UT on 2018 July 4. Subsequently, we carried out a prompt X-ray monitoring with the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) starting at 19:45 UT on the same day, and the observation ended at 06:02 UT on 2018 July 6. During the decaying phase of the flare, we successfully detected a 5.8-hour-long eclipse, corresponding to the secondary eclipse in which Algol A blocks the line of sight to Algol B. During the eclipse, the 2-10 keV X-ray flux is decreased to 20% level from $1.9\times10^{-10}~ \mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1} }$ to $4.5\times10^{-11}~ \mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1} }$. We found a configuration of the flare size and location to explain the X-ray observations; e.g., the flare occurred at the latitude 45°S of the Algol B surface with a flare height of $1.9\times10^{11}~\mathrm{cm}$, corresponding to 0.8 times the stellar radius of Algol B, giving 80% obscuration of the flare loop by Algol A. The apparent absorption increase before the eclipse might originate from coronal mass ejection (CME) in the line of sight ejected during the flare.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A volcanic chronosequence as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to study the cosmic-ray flux in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene</a><span class="id">[2510.23126]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a phenomenological study demonstrating the feasibility of using olivine xenoliths from the Chaîne des Puys as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to probe the cosmic-ray flux over the last 40,000 years. This volcanic region provides a unique chronosequence of samples brought to the surface by well-dated eruptions. By modeling the expected density of nuclear recoil tracks induced by cosmic-ray muons in olivine, we show that the signal is detectable and above backgrounds from natural radioactivity. We demonstrate that by analyzing samples with different exposure ages, it is possible to construct a time-differential measurement of the cosmic-ray flux. This method shows sensitivity to historical variations, such as the enhanced flux expected during the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion ($\sim$41 kyr) and the potential contribution from nearby supernovae, for which we use the Antlia supernova remnant precursor as a benchmark.

Utilizing the latest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, BAO), Pantheon+ (Type Ia Supernovae, SNIa), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data (including lensing) from \textit{Planck} and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), we report three key findings. First, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the combined data consistently aligns with early-universe measurements across all models, indicating a persistent Hubble tension. Second, we find compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy: early-universe (CMB) constraints favor a phantom phase (with an equation-of-state parameter $w &lt; -1$), while late-universe (BAO/SNIa) data prefer quintessence ($w &gt; -1$).

HD 61005 is known to harbor large amounts of circumstellar dust in a dense ecliptic plane full of mm-sized particles plus attached, extended wing like structures full of micron sized particles, which are evidence for a strong LISM-dust disk interaction. These properties aided our ability to resolve the 220 au wide astrosphere of HD61005, the first ever observed for a main sequence G-star. The observed x-ray emission morphology is roughly spherical, as expected for an astrospheric structure dominated by the host star. The Chandra spectrum of HD 61005 is a combination of a hard stellar coronal emission (T=8 MK) at Lx = 6 x10e29 erg per sec, plus an extended halo contribution at Lx = 1x10e29 erg per sec dominated by charge exchange (CXE) lines, such as those of OVIII and NeIX. The Chandra CXE x-ray morphology does not track the planar dust morphology but does extend out roughly to where the base of the dust wings begins. We present a toy model of x-ray emission produced by stellar wind (SW)-LISM CXE interactions, similar to the state of the young Sun when it was approximately 100 Myrs old (Guinan and Engle 2007), and transiting through an approximately 1000 times denser part of the interstellar medium (ISM) such as a Giant Molecular Cloud (Stern 2003, Opher and Loeb 2024).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">94.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultralight Dark Matter Constraints from NanoHertz Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2512.15292]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) on the mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background.

This increases the drag experienced by binary SMBH, decreasing merger times and potentially suppressing gravitational radiation from the binary at low frequencies. We develop semi-analytic models for the decay of SMBH binaries in ULDM halos and use current pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements to constrain the ULDM particle mass and its fractional contribution to the dark matter content of the universe. We find a median ULDM particle mass of $7. \times 10^{-22}$ eV and show that scaling relations suggest that the drag remains effective at relatively low ULDM fractions, which are consistent with all other constraints on the model. Consequently, future pulsar timing measurements will be a sensitive probe of any ULDM contribution to the overall dark matter content of the universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">95.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST NIRSpec finds no clear signs of an atmosphere on TOI-1685 b</a><span class="id">[2512.15338]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Determining the prevalence of atmospheres on terrestrial planets is a core objective in exoplanetary science. While M dwarf systems offer a promising opportunity, conclusive observations of terrestrial atmospheres have remained elusive, with many yielding flat transmission spectra. We observe four transits of the hot terrestrial planet TOI-1685 b using JWST's NIRSpec G395H instrument. Combining this with the transit from the previously-observed phase curve of the planet with the same instrument, we perform a detailed analysis to determine the possibility of an atmosphere on TOI-1685 b. From our retrievals, the Bayesian evidence favours a simple flat line model, indicating no evidence for an atmosphere on TOI-1685 b, in line with results from the phase curve analysis. Our results show that hydrogen-dominated atmospheres can be confidently ruled out. For heavier, secondary atmospheres we find a lower limit on the mean molecular weight of  10, at a significance of  5 sigma. Pure CO2, SO2, H2O, and CH4 atmospheres, or a mixed secondary atmosphere (CO+CO2+SO2) could explain the data (Delta lnZ &lt; 3). However, pure CH4 atmospheres may be physically unlikely, and the pure H2O and CO2 cases require a high-altitude cloud, which could also be interpreted as a thin cloud-free atmosphere. We discuss the theoretical possibility for different types of atmosphere on this planet, and consider the effects of atmospheric escape and stellar activity on the system.
