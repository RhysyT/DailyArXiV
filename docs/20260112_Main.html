In particular, current models predict strong iron hydride (FeH) absorption due to the Wing-Ford bands at 0.99$\mu$m, yet this spectral feature is only weakly present in TRAPPIST-1 and other mid-to-late M dwarf stars. Additionally, the shape of the continuum between the water bands in the near-infrared does not match between models and observations. Here, we show that assumptions about pressure broadening, specifically van der Waals broadening, have a dramatic effect on modeled broadband spectral features. We use Merged Parallelized Simplified-ATLAS to generate synthetic spectra over a range of van der Waals broadening strengths, adopting 1D PHOENIX temperature-pressure structures. We find that minimal broadening best matches the observed FeH profile at 0.99$\mu$m and in the pseudocontinuum between the large water bands. These results suggest that broadening prescriptions derived for Sun-like stars are not valid for lower-mass stars and that pressure broadening for molecular lines in cool stellar atmospheres must be reevaluated. Refining pressure broadening treatments will improve the accuracy of M dwarf spectral models, enabling more reliable determinations of stellar properties and atmospheric compositions of planets orbiting M dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The fate of the failed supernova candidate M31-2014-DS1</a><span class="id">[2601.05317]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fate of massive stars above 20M$_{\odot}$ remains uncertain. Debate persists about whether they die as supernovae (SNe), or if they collapse directly into black holes (BHs) with little or no optical outburst – so-called “failed supernovae”. The source M31-2014-DS1 experienced an optical outburst in 2014 and has remained faint at visual wavelengths since then. Due to its persistent faintness, it has been proposed as a failed SN candidate. We present new observations of this candidate obtained using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Submillimeter Array (SMA), and Chandra. The JWST observations demonstrate that a luminous mid-infrared source persists at the same location a decade after the star faded at visual wavelengths. We model its current spectral energy distribution (SED) as a dust-enshrouded star. No X-ray emission is detected, disfavoring the hypothesis that the late-time luminosity is powered by accretion onto a BH. We find that the remaining source is highly obscured by an asymmetric distribution of circumstellar dust, making it difficult to quantify its physical properties using spherically symmetric radiative transfer codes. The dust geometry requires that the inferred bolometric luminosity is only a lower limit, as a significant fraction of the central source's radiation may escape without being reprocessed by dust. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of failed SN models and consider the potential overlap with signatures expected from a stellar merger, which also seems to provide a plausible explanation of this source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion disc winds in X-ray binaries</a><span class="id">[2601.05319]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Despite early theoretical expectations that large-scale, massive outflows would be triggered by accretion onto black holes and neutron stars, their presence was not firmly established until the 2000s. Since then, they have been recognised as a common, perhaps ubiquitous, feature of accretion discs in X-ray binaries. Over the past two decades, our understanding of these outflows has expanded significantly, with their associated phenomenology now observed across the X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared regimes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the observational properties of both low- and high-ionisation winds, treating each separately as well as part of a broader phenomenon, and place these findings in the context of current theoretical modelling. We discuss their close connection with disc atmospheres, their impact on the accretion process, and their role within the broader framework that includes the radio jet and the different accretion flow configurations and states. We also address current challenges and outline some of the anticipated developments, particularly those linked to upcoming observational facilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing General Relativity on Cosmological Scales in the 2040s</a><span class="id">[2601.05320]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>General relativity is exquisitely tested in strong-field regimes, yet its validity on cosmological scales remains largely unexplored. Upcoming wide and deep large-scale structure surveys will access the ultra-large, linear scales where relativistic effects - Doppler terms, gravitational redshift, lensing magnification, and potential evolution - leave significant imprints in the clustering of galaxies. These signatures represent unique probes of spacetime that are inaccessible to standard Newtonian analyses but increasingly important as survey volumes grow. We outline the scientific potential of next-generation facilities, such as those envisioned within ESO's Expanding Horizons programme, to deliver the first robust measurements of relativistic effects in large-scale structure through multi-tracer power spectra and the single-tracer bispectrum of high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies. Detecting these contributions would open a new window on gravity, enabling precision tests of general relativity and its alternatives on cosmological scales in the 2040s.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the gravitational stratification of multi-fluid-multi-species plasma</a><span class="id">[2601.05321]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. The solar atmosphere is gravitationally stratified and consists of several layers at temperatures different by orders of magnitude. Consequently, the solar atmospheric plasma changes from weakly ionized in the photosphere, partially ionized in the chromosphere, to eventually fully ionized in the corona. However, it is still not trivial to integrate ionization and recombination processes into multi-fluid solar plasma models with gravitational stratification. Aims. We intend to provide a method for constructing multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratification that satisfies ionization equilibrium and hydrostatic equilibrium at the same time, avoiding causing non-physical disturbances and numerical instability due to initial in-equilibria. Methods. We assume that collisional interactions between fluids are sufficient for coupling all fluids when there is no high-frequency external driving force imposed. Ionization fractions can be (I) calculated assuming ionization in statistical equilibrium at any given temperature, or (II) extracted from other atmospheric models. A simple numerical integration routine is then designed and used to construct multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratifications. Results. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present numerical integration routine can be in hydrostatic equilibrium with any given ionization fractions of multi-species plasmas. Meanwhile, without any dynamic driving force, fluid decoupling appears in the transition region of the constructed stratification, while the total velocity of all fluids remains zero. Conclusions. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present routine can be used in multi-fluid-multi-species models to study specific dynamics without being affected by initial in-equilibria.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinematic lensing with high-resolution spectroscopic surveys. A unique opportunity for transformative cosmology at high redshifts in the 2040s</a><span class="id">[2601.05322]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a science case to perform high-redshift cosmic shear surveys for cosmology with next-generation spectroscopic instruments, such as the proposed MegaMapper and Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope. We argue that by using the novel technique called 'kinematic lensing' (KL) it will be possible to obtain shear catalogues at redshifts between 2 and 5. We show that the signal-to-noise ratio of KL at such high redshifts is on average twice as much that expected from current weak lensing (WL) surveys such as Euclid or LSST, and several times that of the previous generation of WL surveys like DES and KiDS, even with very conservative assumptions about the fraction of spectroscopically-detected sources for which KL shear estimates will be available. This will allow cosmologists to perform joint galaxy clustering-cosmic shear analyses over unprecedented cosmic volumes and to probe the growth of structures deep in the matter-dominated era and across the onset of dark-energy domination, offering a unique opportunity to unveil the mystery of cosmic acceleration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dispersive Properties of MHD Waves in the Expanding Solar Wind for a Parker Spiral Geometry</a><span class="id">[2601.05357]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we quantify the effects of solar wind expansion on the dispersive properties of the three normal modes of ideal MHD using the Expanding Box Model, under a background magnetic field that follows the Parker spiral geometry. From the linearized MHD-EBM equations, we construct the dispersion tensor and derive analytical expressions for the eigenfrequencies $\omega(k,R)$, magnetic compressibility $C_B$, and the ratio of the parallel electric field to the perpendicular magnetic field $|\delta E_\parallel|/|\delta B_\perp|$ of the magnetosonic modes to quantify how radial solar wind expansion reshapes the character of compressive fluctuations in the solar wind. Magnetic compressibility increases with heliocentric distance, and this trend shows a better alignment with in-situ observations when expansion is included from the MHD-EBM framework. $C_B$ shows a well-defined minimum at small radii and then increases linearly with distance, which naturally reproduces the observed transition from Alfvénic to compressive fluctuations between $\sim$0.3-1 AU. The ratio $|\delta E_\parallel|/|\delta B_\perp|$ reveals opposite behaviors for the fast and slow modes: while the fast mode becomes more electrostatic with increasing distance, the slow mode evolves to a more magnetically dominated character. Expansion reduces the growth of their electromagnetic/compressive balance at large radii. Our results demonstrate that solar wind expansion actively redistributes energy between magnetically compressive modes and purely transverse fluctuations with respect to the background magnetic field, playing a major role in shaping the radial evolution of wave dynamics throughout the inner heliosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05363" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Superluminous supernovae: diverse rise times explain diverse spectra</a><span class="id">[2601.05363]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a diverse class of exceptionally bright massive star explosions, which typically exhibit absorption from ionised oxygen in their early spectra. While their photometric properties (luminosity and duration) both span an order of magnitude, population studies suggest that these distributions are continuous. However, spectroscopic samples have shown some indications of distinct sub-types, either through similarity to certain prototype objects, or in terms of their velocity evolution. Here we show that a well-observed SLSN, PTF12dam, completely changes its O II absorption profile as it rises to maximum light, moving from one proposed sub-type to another. This supports an interpretation where spectroscopic diversity is driven by the ejecta temperature at maximum light, rather than fundamental differences in the explosion or progenitor. Motivated by this, we develop a new diagnostic, the Brightness-Timescale-Temperature-Radius diagram, and a simple toy model for the evolution of the photospheric velocity, to show that diversity in the light curve rise time (likely due to differences in ejected mass) naturally explains why SLSNe with broader light curves generally have weaker O II lines, lower photospheric velocities after maximum, and slower changes in photospheric velocity over time. We show that the velocity distribution of the known SLSN population favours a relatively flat ejecta density profile, consistent with a hot bubble inflated by a central engine.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of the 2021 Arid Meteor Shower on Maunakea, Hawai'i</a><span class="id">[2601.05412]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the successful detection of the &quot;Arid&quot; Meteor Shower (IAU\#1130 ARD), predicted to emerge for the first time in 2021, using a publicly accessible YouTube live camera developed by us. This live camera, installed on the Subaru Telescope dome in the summit region of Maunakea, Hawai'i, features a wide field of view (70 deg by 40 deg) and high sensitivity, capable of observing stars fainter than 6th magnitude. Meteor detection was performed in two ways: visual inspection by citizen viewers and subsequent validation through automated detection. As a result, we confirmed that the number of meteors appearing from near the predicted radiant increased by more than six times ( 9 sigma) compared to the preceding and following days. Our observation time was 4-5 hours after the predicted peak (solar longitude = 193.9 deg), providing clear data indicating that the activity had not yet declined. Optical observations at this time from the Northern Hemisphere are extremely limited and unique, making our observation point valuable. The meteors are characterized as slow and faint appearance, but several brighter meteors with wakes were also observed. Simulations tracing the dust trails from the parent body, Comet 15P/Finlay, suggest that our detection can be explained by either the dust trails released in 2008 or 2014, both requiring high ejection velocities. However, during the comet's 2008 return, its activity was exceptionally quiet, making a high-velocity dust ejection questionable. On the other hand, multiple large outbursts were observed during the 2014 return, at which time a certain amount of high-velocity dust release is expected. We conclude that the dust source of the meteor shower detected in Hawai'i this time is likely attributable to high-velocity ( 67 m s-1) dust ejected during the 2014 outburst.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05435" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cosmic-ray Knee as a Local Signature of Nearby PeVatrons</a><span class="id">[2601.05435]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A &quot;knee&quot; in the cosmic-ray spectrum, characterized by a sudden steepening of the spectral shape at $\sim 4$ PeV, may be interpreted either as a global feature of Galactic cosmic rays or as a local signature. In the former scenario, cosmic-ray spectra throughout the Galaxy would be similar to that observed in the solar neighborhood, and the knee would be a common feature of the cosmic-ray sea. In the latter scenario, the PeV cosmic-ray flux varies across the Galactic disk, and the knee is dominantly contributed by a small number of nearby sources. By simulating cosmic-ray propagation in the Galactic magnetic field and interstellar medium, we show that the two scenarios correspond to different regimes of the birth rate of PeV proton accelerators and depend on the presence of powerful nearby sources. By comparison with both cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observations, we find that a local knee would be best explained by sources located at distances of order $\sim1$ kpc and with ages in the range 0.1-1 Myr, with the Cygnus Cocoon being a particularly promising candidate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Structural Tilting and Depth-Dependent Behavior of Equatorial Rossby Waves</a><span class="id">[2601.05443]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the past decade, solar equatorial Rossby waves have been unambiguously identified and are considered potential diagnostics of solar interior dynamics. We investigate their inclined structure and temporal evolution in the solar interior across multiple depths using approximately 14.5 yr of ring-diagram (RD) and time-distance (TD) helioseismology data from SDO/HMI. Normalized phase differences and cross power are computed from filtered spherical harmonic coefficients of radial vorticity to probe the structural tilt and power of Rossby waves. We find a systematic and robust depth-dependent phase behavior that shows no clear significant correlation with the solar cycle, while the depth-dependent cross power exhibits a positive correlation with the solar cycle for both datasets. Our results show that deeper depths lead in phase over shallower ones, with increasing negative phases with depth. We infer that Rossby waves exhibit a retrograde tilt relative to the Sun's rotation that is stable throughout the solar cycle. Analogous small tilts have been noted in planetary atmospheres and in magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the Sun, indicating that this behavior is not uncommon in rotating, stratified bodies and has implications for angular momentum and energy transport in the solar interior.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar control on atmospheric carbon chemistry, CO runaway, and organic synthesis on lifeless Earth-like planets</a><span class="id">[2601.05480]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The abundances of atmospheric carbon species–carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4)–exert fundamental controls on the climate, redox state, and prebiotic environment of terrestrial planets. As exoplanet atmospheric characterization advances, it is essential to understand how these species are regulated on habitable terrestrial planets across a wide range of stellar and planetary conditions. Here, we develop an integrated numerical model that couples atmospheric chemistry, climate, and the long-term carbon cycle to investigate the atmospheric compositions of lifeless, Earth-like planets orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars. Our simulations demonstrate that CO2, CO, and CH4 generally increase with orbital distance, and that planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone may undergo CO runaway–a photochemical instability driven by severe depletion of OH radicals. The threshold for CO runaway depends strongly on stellar spectral type and is most easily triggered around cooler, lower-mass stars. In contrast, the atmospheric production of formaldehyde (H2CO)–a key precursor for prebiotic organic chemistry–peaks around planets orbiting more massive, UV-luminous stars and is maximized at orbital distances just interior to the CO-runaway threshold. These results establish a quantitative framework linking observable system properties–stellar type and orbital distance–and the atmospheric carbon chemistry of lifeless Earth-like planets, providing new context for interpreting future spectroscopic observations and for evaluating the potential of such planets to sustain prebiotic chemistry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Empirical study of the Pantheon SNeIa Catalog within power-law cosmology and varying speed of light</a><span class="id">[2601.05512]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we investigate the kinematics of late-time acceleration within Dolgov's power-law cosmology $a=\left(t/t_{0}\right)^{\mu}$ [Phys. Rev. D 55, 5881 (1997)] and Barrow's varying speed of light $c=c_{0}\,a^{-\zeta}$ [Phys. Rev. D 59, 043515 (1999)]. In this cosmology, light traveling through an expanding universe undergoes an additional refraction caused by the varying $c$ along its path, resulting in a modified Lemaitre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-(1+\zeta)}$. The model achieves a high-quality fit to the Pantheon Catalog of Type Ia supernovae and exhibits a notable degeneracy along the locus $(1+\zeta)\,\mu=1$. This empirical relation indicates that $c=\mu^{-1}c_{0}\,t_{0}\,\frac{da}{dt}$, a characteristic that is not present in the $\Lambda$CDM model. We will discuss the implications of these findings in the context of (i) late-time acceleration; (ii) the horizon problem; (iii) Kolb's coasting universe model [Astrophys. J. 344, 543 (1989)]; (iv) a generalization of the cosmological principle to the time domain; and (v) the emergence of a novel conformally flat metric applicable to cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analysis of Solar Flare and Sunspots on 4th Jan 2025 and Their Effects on Space Weather</a><span class="id">[2601.05591]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are among the most energetic phenomena in the solar system, often impacting space weather and terrestrial technologies.

Recent observations have linked a few tidal disruption events (TDEs) to the production of high-energy neutrino emission, all of which display dust-reprocessed infrared flares, indicating a dust- and gas-rich environment. By cross-matching the neutrino events and a sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies with transient radio flares, we uncover an optically obscured TDE candidate, SDSS J151345.75 $+$ 311125.2, which shows both spatial and temporal coincidence with the sub-PeV neutrino event IC170514B. Using a standard equipartition analysis of the synchrotron spectral evolution spanning 605 days post mid-infrared discovery, we find a little evolution in the radio-emitting region, with a kinetic energy up to $10^{51}$ erg, depending on the outflow geometry and shock acceleration efficiency assumed. High-resolution European VLBI Network imaging reveals a compact radio emission that is unresolved at a scale of $&lt;$ 2.1 pc, with a brightness temperature of $T_b&gt;5\times10^6$ K, suggesting that the observed late-time radio emission might originate from the interaction between a decelerating outflow and a dense circumnuclear medium. If the association is genuine, the neutrino production is possibly related to the acceleration of protons through pp collisions during the outflow expanding process, implying that the outflow-cloud interaction could provide a physical site with a high-density environment for producing the sub-PeV neutrinos. Such a scenario can be tested with future identifications of radio transients coincident with high-energy neutrinos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A microphysically inspired approach to dark matter-dark energy interactions: first bounds on dark-sector scattering cross sections</a><span class="id">[2601.05646]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The observational tension regarding the value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) has motivated the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios, including Interacting Dark Energy models. However, the majority of IDE models studied in the literature rely on phenomenological interaction terms proportional to the Hubble parameter (e.g., $Q\propto H\rho$), which lack a clear microphysical justification and often suffer from large-scale instabilities. In this work, we propose and investigate a &quot;bottom-up&quot; IDE model where the interaction is formulated directly from particle physics collision processes, taking the form $Q\propto\rho^2$. This interaction represents a reversible annihilation/creation process between Dark Matter and Dark Energy, motivated by the Boltzmann equation. We test this model against a combination of background cosmological data, Pantheon Plus, Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2, and CMB distance priors from Planck18. We find that the model is consistent with the data, yielding a Hubble constant of $H_0=67.71\pm0.65$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for the combined analysis. The dimensionless interaction rate coefficients are constrained to be small, with upper limits of $A &lt; 7.586\times10^{-25}$ (for Dark Matter self annihilation) and $B &lt; 0.048$ (for Dark Energy self annihilation) at 95\% confidence level. Since the interaction model is parameterized by the expansion rate, these bounds on $H_0$, $A$, and $B$ directly translate into a strict limit on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section per unit of mass. The constraints on the coupling $A$ imply that, if such a collisional interaction exists, the effective dark-matter annihilation cross section per unit mass is highly suppressed relative to the cosmological expansion rate. In contrast, the corresponding dark-energy contribution, governed by $B$, is only constrained at the level of a few percent in dimensionless units.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05672" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Newly Measured Nuclear Reaction Rates on $^{26}$Al Ejected Yields from Massive Stars</a><span class="id">[2601.05672]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the last three years, the rates of all the main nuclear reactions involving the destruction and production of $^{26}$Al in stars ($^{26}$Al(n, p)$^{26}$Mg, $^{26}$Al(n, $\alpha$)$^{23}$Na, $^{26}$Al(p, $\gamma$)$^{27}$Si and $^{25}$Mg(p, $\gamma$)$^{26}$Al) have been re-evaluated thanks to new high-precision experimental measurements of their cross sections at energies of astrophysical interest, considerably reducing the uncertainties in the nuclear physics affecting their nucleosynthesis. We computed the nucleosynthetic yields ejected by the explosion of a high-mass star (20 Msun, Z = 0.0134) using the FRANEC stellar code, considering two explosion energies, 1.2 10$^{51}$ erg and 3 10$^{51}$ erg. We quantify the change in the ejected amount of $^{26}$Al and other key species that is predicted when the new rate selection is adopted instead of the reaction rates from the STARLIB nuclear library. Additionally, the ratio of our ejected yields of 26Al to those of 14 other short-lived radionuclides (36Cl, 41Ca, 53Mn, 60Fe, 92Nb, 97Tc, 98Tc, 107Pd, 126Sn, 129I, 36Cs, 146Sm, 182Hf, 205Pb) are compared to early solar system isotopic ratios, inferred from meteorite measurements. The total ejected 26Al yields vary by a factor of  3 when adopting the new rates or the STARLIB rates. Additionally, the new nuclear reaction rates also impact the predicted abundances of short-lived radionuclides in the early solar system relative to $^{26}$Al. However, it is not possible to reproduce all the short-lived radionuclide isotopic ratios with our massive star model alone, unless a second stellar source could be invoked, which must have been active in polluting the pristine solar nebula at a similar time of a core-collapse supernova.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05720" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energy Bounds from Relative Magnetic Helicity in Spherical Shells</a><span class="id">[2601.05720]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Relative magnetic helicity is commonly used in solar physics to avoid the well known gauge ambiguity of standard magnetic helicity in magnetically open domains. But its physical interpretation is difficult owing to the invocation of a reference field. For the specific case of spherical shell domains (with potential reference field), relative helicity may be written intrinsically in terms of the magnetic field alone, without the need to calculate the reference field or its vector potential. We use this intrinsic expression to prove that non-zero relative helicity implies lower bounds for both magnetic energy and free magnetic energy, generalizing the important Arnol'd inequality known for closed-field magnetic helicity. Further, we derive a stronger energy bound by spatially decomposing the relative helicity over a magnetic partition of the domain to obtain a new ideal invariant which we call unsigned helicity. The bounds are illustrated with analytical linear force-free fields (that maximize relative helicity for given boundary conditions) as well as a non-potential data-driven model of the solar corona. These bounds confirm that both relative helicity and the unsigned helicity can influence the dynamics in the solar corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The NuGrid AGB Evolution and Nucleosynthesis Data Set</a><span class="id">[2601.05723]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars play a key role in the chemical evolution of galaxies. These stars are the fundamental stellar site for the production of light elements such as C, N and F, and half of the elements heavier than Fe via the slow neutron capture process (s-process). Hence, detailed computational models of AGB stars' evolution and nucleosynthesis are essential for galactic chemical evolution. In this work, we discuss the progress in updating the NuGrid data set of AGB stellar models and abundance yields. All stellar models have been computed using the MESA stellar evolution code, coupled with the post-processing mppnp code to calculate the full nucleosynthesis. The final data set will include the initial masses Mini/Msun = 1, 1.65, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 for initial metallicities Z = 0.0001, 0.001, 0.006, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03. Observed s-process abundances on the surfaces of evolved stars as well as the typical light elements in the composition of H-deficient post-AGB stars are reproduced. A key short-term goal is to complete and expand the AGB stars data set for the full metallicity range. Chemical yield tables are provided for the available models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the CME Core–Prominence Relation Using Inner Coronal Observations</a><span class="id">[2601.05768]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) often exhibit a three-part structure consisting of a bright inner core, an outer leading edge, and an intervening dark cavity. While the core has traditionally been attributed to prominence material, an alternative interpretation suggests it may arise from the projection effects of a twisted flux rope. We focused on limb CME events to reassess the connection between CME cores and their associated prominences in the inner corona. The CME cores were analyzed using white-light observations from the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) K-Coronagraph (K-Cor), while the corresponding prominence eruptions were examined using H$\alpha$ data from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) and 304 Å images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). Our results show a strong spatial correspondence between H$\alpha$ prominences and CME cores in white light, with an average image correlation of $\sim$0.7, while correlations between white light and AIA 304 Å are comparatively weaker ($\sim$0.5). Several events could be continuously traced into the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO/C2) field of view, confirming the persistence of prominence material into the outer corona. We find back-extrapolating LASCO/C2 CME cores under constant-velocity, linear-trajectory assumptions can introduce large errors – up to 40$^\circ$ in inferred position angle and $\sim$140 minutes in eruption time relative to their true values – underscoring the importance of inner-coronal observations for accurately constraining CME dynamics. Overall, our findings suggest that in prominence-associated CMEs, the bright cores are predominantly composed of prominence material.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Catalog of 45,206 Hα Emission-line Stars from LAMOST MRS DR7</a><span class="id">[2601.05779]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stars that exhibit prominent emission lines in their spectra are referred to as emission-line stars, encompassing a wide range of stellar types and indicative of intriguing physical properties. The Large Sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) has released millions of spectra from its Medium-Resolution Survey (MRS). A small fraction of these spectra exhibit emission lines, yet they remain undiscovered and unanalyzed due to being buried in the vast dataset. We have developed a method based on Derivative Spectroscopy (DS), which provides a novel approach for detecting and identifying emission-line stars by extracting signals from complex backgrounds and estimating spectral line profiles. Applying this method to the $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ spectral line profiles from the LAMOST-MRS Data Release 7 (DR7), we compiled a catalog of emission-line stars using the second- and third-derivative spectra for automated peak detection. This approach also facilitates the classification of $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ emission-line morphologies through a simplified scheme. The catalog comprises 56 649 spectra with relatively prominent $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ emission lines from 45 206 unique stars, with each emission-line component accompanied by approximate estimates of its wavelength, amplitude, and width. All $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ spectral lines were classified into three morphological classes under a unified classification scheme: single emission peak (83.0 \%), double emission peaks (5.6 \%), and P Cygni-type profiles (11.5 \%), which encompass both P Cygni and inverse P Cygni features. Through cross-referencing with SIMBAD, 39 497 stars represent new emission-line sources discovered in our research.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two temperate Earth- and Neptune-sized planets orbiting fully convective M dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2601.05799]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As the diversity of exoplanets continues to grow, it is important to revisit assumptions about habitability and classical HZ definitions.

We validate these planets with multi-band ground-based photometric observations, high-resolution imaging and statistical analyses. We find these planets to have instellation fluxes close to the inner (hotter) edge of the temperate zone, with $4.4\pm1.1\,\mathrm{S}_\oplus$ and $4.9\pm1.1\,\mathrm{S}_\oplus$ for TOI-6716 b and TOI-7384 b respectively.

Compared to the peak in the correlation function, it is more robust to late-time nonlinear effects at the percent level. In light of improved simulations and high quality data, we revisit the robustness of the linear point and use it as an alternative to template-based fitting approaches typically used in BAO analyses. We present the linear point measurements on galaxy samples from the first and second data releases (DR1 and DR2) of the DESI survey. We convert the linear point into a dimensionless parameter $\alpha_{iso,LP}$, defined as the ratio of the linear point in the fiducial cosmology and the observed value, analogous to the isotropic BAO scaling parameter $\alpha_{iso}$ used in previous BAO measurements. Using the 2nd generation of AbacusSummit mock catalogs, we find that linear point measurements are more precise when calculated in the post-reconstruction regime with 15-60% smaller uncertainties than those pre-reconstruction. We find a systematic shift in the linear point measurements compared against the isotropic BAO measurements in mocks; we attribute this to the isotropic damping parameter responsible for smearing the linear point in the nonlinear regime. We propose a sample-dependent correction that mitigates the impact of late-time nonlinear effects. While this introduces a cosmology dependence in an otherwise model-independent measurement, this is necessary given the sub-percent precision dictated by current cosmological surveys. Comparing $\alpha_{iso,LP}$ with isotropic BAO measurements made on the DESI DR1 and DR2 galaxy samples, we find excellent agreement after applying this correction, particularly post-reconstruction. We discuss future scope regarding cosmological inference with linear point measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feasibility of event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables and supervised machine learning</a><span class="id">[2601.05969]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we investigate the feasibility of event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables only. Although the analysis does not require an explicit reconstruction of the shower maximum ($X_{max}$), the discrimination power still arises from the sensitivity of the radio observables to the longitudinal development of the extensive air shower (EAS). Such radio-based approaches could be particularly relevant for radio-only experiments, such as GRAND. To assess this feasibility, we obtained conservative upper limits for the discrimination accuracy using a supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithm, namely a random forest (RF). The input features used were the peak electric fields and the spectral slopes, which have complementary discrimination power, along with the antenna distances to the shower axis. The RF was trained and tested using large event sets generated by the fast radio emission simulation and simplified detector response implemented in the RDSim framework. We obtained discrimination accuracies between 81\% and 96\% over the studied zenith range, even after normalizing each shower by its own electromagnetic energy. Since the analysis includes deliberately conservative choices, such as a large 10\% uncertainty on the reconstructed EM energy, these quoted values should be interpreted as conservative upper limits suitable for a feasibility assessment. Our results demonstrate that event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables is, in principle, feasible.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distinct Rotational Evolution of Giant Planets and Brown Dwarf Companions</a><span class="id">[2601.05976]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a rotational velocity (vsini) survey of 32 stellar/substellar objects and giant planets using Keck/KPIC high-resolution spectroscopy, including 6 giant planets (2-7 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) and 25 substellar/stellar companions (12-88 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$). Adding companions with spin measurements from the literature, we construct a curated spin sample for 43 benchmark stellar/substellar companions and giant planets and 54 free-floating brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects. We compare their spins, parameterized as fractional breakup velocities at 10 Myr, assuming constant angular momentum evolution. We find the first clear evidence that giant planets exhibit distinct spins versus low-mass brown dwarf companions (10 to 40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) at 4-4.5 $\sigma$ significance assuming inclinations aligned with their orbits, while under randomly oriented inclinations the significance is at 1.6-2.1 $\sigma$. Our findings hold when considering various assumptions about planets, and the mass ratio below 0.8% gives a clean cut for rotation between giant planets and brown dwarf companions. The higher fractional breakup velocities of planets can be interpreted as less angular momentum loss through circumplanetary disk braking during the planet formation phase. Brown dwarf companions exhibit evidence of slower rotation compared to isolated brown dwarfs, while planets and planetary mass objects show similar spins. Finally, our analysis of specific angular momentum versus age of 221 stellar/substellar objects below 0.1 MSun with spin measurements in the literature indicates that the substellar objects of 5-40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ retain much higher angular momenta compared to stellar and substellar objects of 40-100 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ after 10 Myr, when their initial angular momenta were set.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05980" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radial differential rotation leading to dipole collapse in pre-main-sequence stars</a><span class="id">[2601.05980]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Despite progress in the observations of stellar magnetic fields, their physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. During the pre-main sequence (PMS) phase, the inner layers of stars contract and a radiative core gradually develops. In contrast, the convective envelope is gradually braked through magnetic interactions with the accretion disk and winds. With developing differential rotation inside the star, PMS phase is thus a critical period for magnetic properties of stars when strong initial dipoles can get perturbed, leading to the observed diversity in the magnetism on the main sequence (MS). In this work, we study the impact of differential rotation on such fields. We perform three-dimensional anelastic convective dynamo simulations of rotating spherical shells with an imposed differential rotation (shear) between the boundaries. Density, gravity profiles and convective zone thicknesses were set close to those predicted in PMS low-mass stars by one-dimensional stellar evolution code Cesam2k20. Our results show that radial differential rotation can induce dipole collapse leading to weaker, oscillatory magnetic fields. Differential rotation seems to perturb $\alpha^2$ dynamo mechanism, responsible for dipolar magnetic fields, by shearing poloidal field lines and by affecting turbulent magnetic transport processes. This collapse is moderated by the relative importance of shear compared to the vigor of convective motions, with exact stability criterion depending on the field strength and the size of the radiative core. Applying DNS-based stability criterion in PMS stellar evolution models, we qualitatively reproduce the trends observed in the magnetic topologies of low-mass stars when assuming an efficient internal angular momentum redistribution. This suggests that stellar magnetic properties are intimately related to the PMS angular momentum evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Setting up the physical principles of resilience in a model of the Earth System</a><span class="id">[2601.05994]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Resilience is a property of social, ecological, social-ecological and biophysical systems. It describes the capacity of a system to cope with, adapt to and innovate in response to a changing surrounding. Given the current climate change crisis, ensuring conditions for a sustainable future for the habitability on the planet is fundamentally dependent on Earth System (ES) resilience. It is thus particularly relevant to establish a model that captures and frames resilience of the ES, most particularly in physical terms that can be influenced by human policy\footnote{See page 4 for examples of strategies}. In this work we propose that resilience can serve as a theoretical foundation when unpacking and describing metastable states of equilibrium and energy dissipation in any dynamic description of the variables that characterise the ES. Since the impact of the human activities can be suitably gauged by the planetary boundaries (PBs) and the planet's temperature is the net result of the multiple PB variables, such as $\text{CO}_2$ concentration and radiative forcing, atmospheric aerosol loading, atmospheric ozone depletion, etc, then resilience features arise once conditions to avoid an ES runaway to a state where the average temperature is much higher than the current one. Our model shows that this runaway can be prevented by the presence of metastable states and dynamic friction built out of the interaction among the PB variables once suitable conditions are satisfied. In this work these conditions are specified. As humanity moves away from Holocene conditions, we argue that resilience features arising from metastable states might be crucial for the ES to follow sustainable trajectories in the Anthropocene that prevent it run into a much hotter potential equilibrium state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating Active Galactic Nuclei variability with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</a><span class="id">[2601.05995]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Blazars, a type of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with relativistic jets pointed at the observer, exhibit flux variability across the electromagnetic spectrum due to particle acceleration in their jets.

Current second-generation ground-based detectors have established the existence of compact-binary mergers and enabled GW multi-messenger astronomy, but they remain limited in sensitivity, redshift reach, frequency coverage, and duty cycle. These limitations prevent them from addressing many fundamental open questions in cosmology. By the 2040s, wide-field electromagnetic surveys will have mapped the luminous Universe with unprecedented depth and accuracy. Nevertheless, key problems including the nature of dark matter, the physical origin of cosmic acceleration, the properties of gravity on cosmological scales, and the physical conditions of the earliest moments after the Big Bang will remain only partially constrained by electromagnetic observations alone. Progress on these fronts requires access to physical processes and epochs that do not emit light. Gravitational waves provide a unique and complementary observational channel: they propagate over cosmological distances largely unaffected by intervening matter, probe extreme astrophysical environments, and respond directly to the geometry of spacetime. In this context, next-generation GW observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) will be transformative for European astronomy. Operating at sensitivities and frequencies beyond existing detectors, ET will observe binary black holes and neutron stars out to previously inaccessible redshifts, enable continuous high signal-to-noise monitoring of compact sources, and detect gravitational-wave backgrounds of astrophysical and cosmological origin. Together with space-based detectors, ET will play a central role in advancing our understanding of cosmic evolution and fundamental physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weak lensing of bright standard sirens: prospects for $σ_8$</a><span class="id">[2601.06023]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave events with electromagnetic counterparts provide direct measurements of the Hubble diagram.

At 5 final mass ($M_\mathrm{f}$) after the merger, the evidence for these nonlinear modes reaches a Bayes factor of 74. To single out these contributions, we employ recent theoretical progress to compute the waveforms and subtract the corresponding nonlinear modes from a numerical relativity surrogate waveform. Our data analysis uses a novel method that incorporates inspiral-merger inference results as a highly constraining prior for the ringdown inference. We further perform a test allowing for phenomenological deviations for the theoretically predicted amplitudes of the quadratic modes. The results show that an amplitude of zero is excluded at $3.0~\sigma$ significance level, while the theoretical expectation is consistent with the inference.

A common strategy is to divide the domain into several regions (patches) and simplify the equation in each region. When approximate analytic solutions can be obtained in each patch, they are then matched at the interfaces to construct a global solution. However, this patching procedure can fail to reproduce the correct solution, since the approximate forms may break down near the matching boundaries. In this work, we propose a learning framework in which the integration constants of asymptotic analytic solutions are promoted to scale-dependent functions. By constraining these coefficient functions with the original differential equation over the domain, the network learns a globally valid solution that smoothly interpolates between asymptotic regimes, eliminating the need for arbitrary boundary matching.

Moreover, the presence of light $\nu_R$s gives rise to an additional contribution to the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta{N}_{\rm eff}$, providing complementary constraints from current and upcoming CMB observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mimetic Dark Matter from Inflation</a><span class="id">[2601.05931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the coupling of mimetic dark matter to the Gauss-Bonnet topological term in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert action.

PBHs in the asteroid-mass range $10^{17} \, {\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$ could serve as all or most of the dark matter today, but are particularly difficult to detect due to their modest rates of Hawking emission and sub-micron Schwarzschild radii. We consider whether the steep gradients of a PBH's gravitational field could generate tidal forces strong enough to disrupt atoms and nuclei. Such phenomena may yield new observables that could uniquely distinguish a PBH from a macroscopic object of the same mass. We first consider the gravitational ionization of ambient neutral hydrogen and evaluate prospects for detecting photon radiation from the recombination of ionized atoms. During the present epoch, this effect would be swamped by Hawking radiation – which would itself be difficult to detect for PBHs at the upper end of the asteroid-mass window. We then consider the gravitational ionization and heating of neutral hydrogen immediately following recombination at $z\simeq1090$, and identify a broad class of PBH distributions with typical mass $5\times10^{21}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23}\, {\rm g}$ within which gravitational interactions would have been the dominant form of energy deposition to the medium. We also identify conditions under which tidal forces from a transiting PBH could overcome the strong nuclear force, either by dissociating deuterons, which would be relevant during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), or by inducing fission of heavy nuclei. We find that gravitational dissociation of deuterons dominates photodissociation rates due to Hawking radiation for PBHs with masses $10^{14}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$. We additionally identify the phenomenon of gravitationally induced fission of heavy nuclei via tidal deformation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mass models on a 3D mesh: V.

By extending the traditional Skyrme EDF ansatz with central terms containing up to four gradients, we are able to combine an excellent global description of nuclear ground state properties with a stiff equation of state for pure neutron matter that is consistent with all astronomical observations of neutron stars. More precisely, the new model matches the accuracy of earlier BSkG models but with two parameters less: we achieve root-mean-square deviations of 0.649 MeV for 2457 atomic masses, 0.0267 fm for 810 charge radii, and 0.43 MeV for 45 primary fission barriers of actinide nuclei.

The EOS, in turn, depends on microscopic nuclear interactions that are described by nuclear Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians are commonly derived within chiral effective field theory (EFT). Ideally, multi-messenger observations of NSs could be used to directly inform our understanding of EFT interactions, but such a direct inference necessitates millions of model evaluations. This is computationally prohibitive because each evaluation requires us to calculate the EOS from a Hamiltonian by solving the quantum many-body problem with methods such as auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC), which provides very accurate and precise solutions but at a significant computational cost. Additionally, we need to solve the stellar structure equations for each EOS which further slows down each model evaluation by a few seconds. In this work, we combine emulators for AFDMC calculations of neutron matter, built using parametric matrix models, and for the stellar structure equations, built using multilayer perceptron neural networks, with the \texttt{PyCBC} data-analysis framework to enable a direct inference of coupling constants in an EFT Hamiltonian using multi-messenger observations of NSs. We find that astrophysical data can provide informative constraints on two-nucleon couplings despite the high densities probed in NS interiors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13154" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling the Solar System I: Characterization Limits from Analytic Timing Variations</a><span class="id">[2407.13154]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planetary systems with multiple transiting planets are beneficial for understanding planet occurrence rates and system architectures.

In this work, we simulate transit timing observations of our system based on the actual orbital motions of Venus and the Earth+Moon (EM) – influenced by the other solar system objects – and retrieve the system's dynamical parameters for varying noise levels and observing durations. Using an approximate coplanar N-body model for transit-time variations, we consider test configurations with 2, 3, and 4 planets. For various observing baselines, we can robustly retrieve the masses and orbits of Venus and EM; detect Jupiter at high significance (for &lt; 90-second timing error and baseline $\leq$ 15 yrs); and detect Mars at 5 $\sigma$ confidence (with &lt; 20-second timing error and baseline $\geq$ 27 yrs) using TTVFaster. We also find that the 3-planet model is generally preferred, and provide equations to estimate the mass precision of Venus/Earth/Jupiter-analogues. The addition of Mars – which is near a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Earth – improves our retrieval of Jupiter's parameters, suggesting that unseen terrestrials could interfere in the characterization of multi-planetary systems. Our findings are comparable to theoretical limits based upon stellar variability and may eventually be possible.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A solution to the S8 tension through neutrino-dark matter interactions</a><span class="id">[2501.13785]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutrinos and dark matter (DM) are two of the least understood components of the Universe, yet both play crucial roles in cosmic evolution. Clues about their fundamental properties may emerge from discrepancies in cosmological measurements across different epochs of cosmic history. Possible interactions between them could leave distinctive imprints on cosmological observables, offering a rare window into dark sector physics beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework. We present compelling evidence that DM-neutrino interactions can resolve the persistent structure growth parameter discrepancy, $S_8 = \sigma_8\,\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, between early and late universe observations. By incorporating cosmic shear measurements from current Weak Lensing surveys, we demonstrate that an interaction strength of $u \sim 10^{-4}$ not only provides a coherent explanation for the high-multipole observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (\texttt{ACT}), but also alleviates the $S_8$ discrepancy. Combining early universe constraints with \texttt{DES Y3 cosmic shear} data yields a nearly $3\sigma$ preference for non-zero DM neutrino interactions. This strengthens previous observational claims and provides a clear path toward a significant breakthrough in cosmological research. Our findings challenge the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm and highlight the potential of future large-scale structure surveys, which can rigorously test this interaction and unveil the fundamental properties of DM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmology with second and third-order shear statistics for the Dark Energy Survey: Methods and simulated analysis</a><span class="id">[2503.03964]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new pipeline designed for the robust inference of cosmological parameters using both second- and third-order shear statistics.

Current mitigation methods correct the galaxy density fluctuations caused by imaging systematics assuming that all galaxies in a sample have the same galaxy density fluctuations. Under this assumption, the corrected sample cannot perfectly recover the true correlation function. We name this effect sub-sample systematics. For a galaxy sample, even if its overall sample statistics (redshift distribution n(z), galaxy bias b(z)), are accurately measured, n(z), b(z) can still vary across the observed footprint. It makes the correlation function amplitude of galaxy clustering higher, while correlation functions for galaxy-galaxy lensing and cosmic shear do not have noticeable change. Such a combination could potentially degenerate with physical signals on small angular scales, such as the amplitude of galaxy clustering, the impact of neutrino mass on the matter power spectrum, etc. Sub-sample systematics cannot be corrected using imaging systematics mitigation approaches that rely on the cross-correlation signal between imaging systematics maps and the observed galaxy density field. In this paper, we derive formulated expressions of sub-sample systematics, demonstrating its fundamental difference with other imaging systematics. We also provide several toy models to visualize this effect. Finally, we discuss a potential method to estimate and mitigate sub-sample systematics by forward modeling its behavior using Synthetic Source Injection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Close-in planet induces flares on its host star</a><span class="id">[2507.00791]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the past decade, hundreds of exoplanets have been discovered in extremely short orbits below 10 days. Unlike in the Solar System, planets in these systems orbit their host stars close enough to disturb the stellar magnetic field lines. The interaction can enhance the star's magnetic activity, such as its chromospheric and radio emission, or flaring. So far, the search for magnetic star-planet interactions has remained inconclusive. Here, we report the first detection of planet-induced flares on HIP 67522, a 17 million-year-old G dwarf star with two known close-in planets. Combining space-borne photometry from TESS and dedicated CHEOPS observations over a span of 5 years, we find that the 15 flares in HIP 67522 cluster near the innermost planet's transit phase, indicating persistent magnetic star-planet interaction in the system. The stability of interaction implies that the innermost planet is continuously self-inflicting a six time higher flare rate than it would experience without interaction. The subsequent flux of energetic radiation and particles bombarding HIP 67522 b may explain the planet's remarkably extended atmosphere, recently detected with the James Webb Space Telescope. HIP 67522 is therefore an archetype to understand the impact of magnetic star-planet interaction on the atmospheres of nascent exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Results: Cosmological constraints from second and third-order shear statistics</a><span class="id">[2508.14018]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a cosmological analysis of the third-order aperture mass statistic using Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) data.

Building upon our companion methodology paper, we apply a pipeline that combines the two-point function $\xi_{\pm}$ with the mass aperture skewness statistic $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$, which is an efficient compression of the full shear three-point function. We use a suite of simulated shear maps to obtain a joint covariance matrix. By jointly analyzing $\xi_\pm$ and $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ measured from DES Y3 data with a $\Lambda$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.780\pm0.015$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.266^{+0.039}_{-0.040}$, yielding 111% of figure-of-merit improvement in $\Omega_m$-$S_8$ plane relative to $\xi_{\pm}$ alone, consistent with expectations from simulated likelihood analyses. With a $w$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.749^{+0.027}_{-0.026}$ and $w_0=-1.39\pm 0.31$, which gives an improvement of $22\%$ on the joint $S_8$-$w_0$ constraint. Our results are consistent with $w_0=-1$. Our new constraints are compared to CMB data from the Planck satellite, and we find that with the inclusion of $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ the existing tension between the data sets is at the level of $2.3\sigma$. We show that the third-order statistic enables us to self-calibrate the mean photometric redshift uncertainty parameter of the highest redshift bin with little degradation in the figure of merit.

To better understand halo assembly, we introduce a new estimator defined by an integral over redshifts and compare its performance to $z_{50}$, the commonly used redshift at which half of the final halo mass is formed.

The Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization – a widely used two-parameter model for the dark energy equation of state – displays marked early-time phantom behavior and a recent crossing of the phantom divide. These features suggest the convenience to check observationally the robustness of such evolution. To address this, we design two alternative families of two-parameter dark energy parametrizations which remain close to the original CPL but aim to soften its phantom character. Specifically, these models reproduce CPL-like behavior at low redshift but mitigate early phantom behavior through the use of smooth sigmoid transitions, yielding a more gradual evolution. By combining recent DESI data with constraints from the cosmic microwave background and Type Ia supernovae, we assess the viability of these models. Our analysis shows that CPL remains a strong and competitive parametrization, with the proposed alternatives only marginally favored or disfavored. We conclude that current observational data lack the statistical precision to decisively distinguish between CPL and similarly constructed parametrizations across the redshift range probed by late-time observables.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Violent mergers revisited: The origin of the fastest stars in the Galaxy</a><span class="id">[2510.11781]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binary systems of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are one of the most promising candidates for the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae. Violent mergers, where the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary white dwarf smashes onto it while being disrupted on its last orbit, were the first proposed double degenerate merger scenario that ignites dynamically. However, violent mergers likely contribute only a few per cent to the total Type Ia supernova rate and do not yield normal Type Ia supernova light curves. Here we revisit the scenario, simulating a violent merger with better methods, and in particular a more accurate treatment of the detonation. We find good agreement with previous simulations, with one critical difference. The secondary white dwarf, being disrupted and accelerated towards the primary white dwarf, and impacted by its explosion, does not fully burn. Its core survives as a bound object. The explosion leaves behind a $0.16\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ carbon-oxygen white dwarf travelling $2800\,\mathrm{km/s}$, making it an excellent (and so far the only) candidate to explain the origin of the fastest observed hyper-velocity white dwarfs. We also show that before the explosion, $5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ of material consisting predominantly of helium, carbon, and oxygen has already been ejected at velocities above $1000\,\mathrm{km/s}$. Finally, we argue that if a violent merger made D6-1 and D6-3, and violent mergers require the most massive primary white dwarfs in binaries of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, there has to be a much larger population of white dwarf mergers with slightly lower-mass primary white dwarfs. Because of its size, this population can essentially only give rise to normal Type Ia supernovae, likely exploding via the quadruple detonation channel and leaving no bound object behind.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23345" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First detection of ultra-high energy emission from gamma-ray binary LS I +61 303</a><span class="id">[2510.23345]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the first detection of gamma-ray emission up to ultra-high-energy (UHE; $&gt;$100 TeV) emission from the prototypical gamma-ray binary system LS I +61 303 using data from the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO).

We present the results of the 400-day observing campaign following the afterglow of the long-duration (collapsar) GRB 230815A, the first one detected through this program. Typically, GRB 230815A would not otherwise receive traditional radio follow-up, given it has no known redshift and lacks comprehensive multi-wavelength follow-up due to its high line-of-sight extinction with $A_V=2.3$. We found its early X-ray jet break at ${\sim}0.1$ days post-burst to be at odds with the evolution of the multi-frequency radio light curves that were traced over an unusually long duration of $400$ days. The radio light curves approximately evolved (with minor deviations) according to the standard self-similar expansion for a relativistic blast wave in a homogeneous environment prior to the jet break, showing no evidence for evolutions of the microphysical parameters describing the electron acceleration processes. We reconcile these features by proposing a two-component jet: the early X-ray break originates from a narrow component with a half-opening angle ${\sim}2.1^{\circ}$, while the evolution of the radio afterglow stems from a wider component with a half-opening angle of $\gtrapprox 35^{\circ}$.

The shapes of dark matter halos can be used to constrain the fundamental properties of dark matter. In standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmologies, halos are typically triaxial, with a preference for prolate configurations, particularly at low masses and high redshift. Aims. We focus on the characterization of total matter 3D shape in alternative dark matter models, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM). These scenarios predict different structural properties due to collisional effects or the suppression of small-scale power. Methods. We measure the different halo component shapes - dark matter, stars and gas - at various radii from the center in the AIDA-TNG (Alternative Interacting Dark Matter and Astrophysics - TNG), which is a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations built upon the IllustrisTNG framework. The intent is to systematically study how different dark matter models - specifically, SIDM and WDM - affect galaxy formation and the structure of dark matter halos, when realistic baryonic physics is also included. Results. SIDM models tend to produce rounder and more isotropic halos, especially in the inner regions, as a result of momentum exchange between dark matter particles. WDM halos are also slightly more spherical than their CDM counterparts, and are typically less concentrated. In all cases, the inclusion of self-consistent baryonic physics makes the central regions of all halos rounder, while still revealing clear distinctions among the various dark matter models. Conclusions. The general framework presented in this work, based on the 3D halo shape, can be useful to interpret multi-wavelength data analyses of galaxies and clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21406" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Cooling of Compact Stars in Light of the HESS J1731-347 Remnant</a><span class="id">[2512.21406]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent analyses on the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant reported not only surprising structural properties (mass $M$ and radius $R$), but also an interesting thermal evolution.

In the present work, we conduct an in-depth investigation on the possible nature (hadronic, hybrid, quark) of this compact object by attempting to not only explain its mass and radius but also the corresponding estimations for its temperature and age. In the case of hybrid stars we also examine possible effects of the symmetry energy on the activation of different neutrino emitting process, and hence on the resulting cooling curves. We found that the reported temperature and age may be compatible to hadronic stellar configurations regardless of whether pairing effects are included. In the scenario of hybrid stars, we found that the strange quark matter core has to be in a superconducting state in order to reach an agreement with the observational constraints. In addition, the hadronic phase must be soft enough so that the direct Urca process is not activated. Furthermore, we have shown that the considered cooling constraints can be reconciled within the framework of strange stars. However, quark matter has to be in a superconducting state and the quark direct Urca process needs to be blocked.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17226" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A universal bound on the duration of a kination era</a><span class="id">[2501.17226]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that primordial adiabatic curvature fluctuations generate an instability of the scalar field sourcing a kination era.

To identify the host galaxy of a GW source, PTAs require significantly improved angular resolution beyond the typical range of 100-1000 square degrees achieved by recent continuous GW searches. In this study, we investigate how precise pulsar distance measurements can enhance the localization of a single GW source. Accurate distance information, comparable to or better than the GW wavelength (typically 1 pc) can refine GW source localization. In the near future, with the advent of Square Kilometre Array (SKA), such high-precision distance measurements will be feasible for a few nearby pulsars. We focus on the relatively nearby pulsars J0437-4715 (156 pc) and J0030+0451 (331 pc), incorporating their actual distance uncertainties based on current VLBI measurements and the anticipated precision of the SKA-era. By simulating 87 pulsars with the GW signal and Gaussian white noise in the timing residuals, we assess the impact of the pulsar distance information on GW source localization. Our results show that without precise distance information, localization remains insufficient to identify host galaxies under 10 ns noise. However, incorporating SKA-era distance precision for nearby pulsars J0437-4715 and J0030+0451 can reduce localization uncertainties to the required level of $10^{-3}$ $\rm deg^{2}$. Localization accuracy strongly depends on the geometric configuration of pulsars with well-measured distances and improves notably near and between such pulsars. The improvement of the localization will greatly aid in identifying the host galaxy of a GW source and constructing an SMBHB catalog. It will further enable follow-up electromagnetic observations to investigate the SMBHB in greater detail.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational baryogenesis in $f(T,L_m)$ gravity</a><span class="id">[2509.17218]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. In this work, we explore gravitational baryogenesis within the framework of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian depends on both the torsion scalar $T$ and the matter Lagrangian $L_m$. We consider three representative models and examine their ability to generate the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio. Our analysis shows that couplings involving both torsion and the matter Lagrangian, $\partial_\mu(-T-\frac{L_m}{L_0})$, can successfully account for the baryon asymmetry for decoupling temperatures in the range $10^{12}$-$10^{14}\,\text{GeV}$, while remaining consistent with small deviations from General Relativity. These results highlight the capacity of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity to provide novel mechanisms for baryogenesis, demonstrating that the interplay between torsion and matter-sector contributions can naturally generate the observed asymmetry. The framework also remains compatible with late-time cosmological evolution, offering a unified setting for early- and late-time dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20457" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A relativistic treatment of accretion disk torques on extreme mass-ratio inspirals around non-spinning black holes</a><span class="id">[2509.20457]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a relativistically accurate formalism to model the interaction between stellar mass compact objects embedded in thin accretion disks around a non-spinning supermassive black hole, using tools from self-force theory and Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We then apply this formalism to analyze the evolution of a compact object on a nearly circular and equatorial orbit interacting with a thin equatorial disk. We provide analytic and relativistically-accurate expressions for the rates of energy and angular momentum exchanged during interactions due to Lindblad and corotation resonances. Our results show that relativistic corrections can enhance the magnitude of the torque by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to purely Newtonian expressions when the orbit of the compact object is smaller than $10$ Schwarzschild radii of the supermassive black hole. We also demonstrate that strong relativistic shifts the inner Lindblad resonances closer to the compact object than the outer Lindblad resonances when the compact object is closer than 4 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole, potentially leading to a reversal in the direction of the torque acting on the compact object. Finally, we provide a dephasing estimate and show that using the relativistic torque formula is crucial to obtain reliable estimates for extreme mass ratio inspirals in orbits closer than 5 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the importance of using relativistically-accurate models of environmental interactions in extreme mass-ratio inspirals close to a supermassive black hole.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$\mathbb Z_2$-Stable Dark Matter via Broken $\text{SU}(5)$ Gauge Bosons</a><span class="id">[2511.19462]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$.

Here, the focus was on reactions with protons or $\alpha$ particles as required for nucleosynthesis in proton-rich matter. For completeness, also neutron-induced reactions are provided for the same set of targets. Some comments on dependencies of rates on various nuclear properties and on the appropriate way to compare to experiments are given. The new rate set for charged-particle induced reactions provides a better description of experimental data than previously widely used rates, especially for reactions involving $\alpha$ particles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00980" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graviton-Photon Mixing by a Kerr-Newman Black Hole with Worldline EFT</a><span class="id">[2601.00980]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In black hole perturbation theory, the difficulty in separating electromagnetic and gravitational sectors of the coupled Teukolsky equations has prevented a general treatment of scattering processes involving both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves in presence of a Kerr-Newman black hole. We present the first computation of the gauge-invariant, low-frequency scattering amplitude for graviton photoproduction by a Kerr-Newman black hole at tree level up to $\mathcal{O}\big((\omega/m)^2\big)$ or $\mathcal{O}(S^2)$ and linear in $\kappa$, using the worldline effective field theory. The relevant Wilson coefficients are determined by matching the graviton and photon one-point functions to the Kerr-Newman solution. We obtain the full angular dependence of the conversion cross section in the presence of spin and comment on the factorization relation between the graviton photoproduction amplitude and the photon Compton amplitude for a classical spinning source. The result provides a benchmark for future analyses of coupled gravitoelectromagnetic scattering in spinning charged compact object backgrounds.</p></div></details></article></body>
