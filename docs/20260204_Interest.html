<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03244" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A third law of thermodynamics is an unnecessary complexity</a><span class="id">[2602.03244]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper elaborates on the implications of the relationship between the Second and Third Laws and provides a comprehensive formal and historical justification for the logical redundancy of the Nernst heat theorem. By revisiting the Nernst-Einstein debate, the underlying hypotheses that lead to the traditional view of the Third Law as an independent postulate are examined. It is argued that the historical rejection of Nernst's proof – motivated by Einstein's insistence on the practical non-performability of cycles at absolute zero – overlooks the fact that a universal Second Law already precludes such cycles, rendering an independent Third Law an unnecessary complexity. Ultimately, the Nernst theorem is shown to be an essential consistency regulator rather than an independent physical discovery.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02667" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probabilistic inference in very large universes</a><span class="id">[2602.02667]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>[Abridged] Some cosmological theories propose that the observable universe is a small part of a much larger universe in which parameters describing the low-energy laws of physics vary from region to region. How can we reasonably assess a theory that describes such a mostly unobservable universe? We propose a Bayesian method based on theory-generated probability distributions for our observations. We focus on basic principles, leaving aside concerns about practicality. (We also leave aside the measure problem, to discuss other issues.) We argue that cosmological theories can be tested by standard Bayesian updating, but we need to use theoretical predictions for &quot;first-person&quot; probabilities – i.e., probabilities for our observations, accounting for all relevant selection effects. These selection effects can depend on the observer, and on time, so in principle first-person probabilities are defined for each observer-instant – an observer at an instant of time. First-person probabilities should take into account everything the observer believes about herself and her surroundings – i.e., her &quot;subjective state&quot;. We advocate a &quot;Principle of Self-Locating Indifference&quot; (PSLI), asserting that any real observer should make predictions as if she were chosen randomly from the theoretically predicted observer-instants that share her subjective state. We believe the PSLI is intuitively very reasonable, but also argue that it maximizes the expected fraction of observers who will make correct predictions. Cosmological theories will in general predict a set of possible universes, each with a probability. To calculate first-person probabilities, we argue that each possible universe should be weighted by the number of observer-instants in the specified subjective state that it contains. We also discuss Boltzmann brains, the humans/Jovians parable of Hartle and Srednicki, and the use of &quot;old evidence&quot;.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Logical Structure of Physical Laws: A Fixed Point Reconstruction</a><span class="id">[2512.25057]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We formalise the self-referential definition of physical laws using monotone operators on a lattice of theories, resolving the pathologies of naive set-theoretic formulations. By invoking Tarski fixed point theorem, we identify physical theories as the least fixed points of admissibility constraints derived from Galois connections. We demonstrate that QED and GR can be represented in such a logical structure with respect to their symmetry and locality principles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond Point Particles – Extended Structural Dynamics and the H Theorem</a><span class="id">[2505.09650]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose an extended structural dynamics framework that enriches classical mechanics by treating particle orientation and internal structure as fundamental phase-space coordinates. This extension preserves Hamiltonian structure and Liouville invariance while revealing two distinct mechanisms for entropy production: (i) collisional randomization through orientation-dependent scattering (generalizing Boltzmann), and (ii) continuous geometric instability arising from rotational-deformational coupling. We argue this dual-mechanism structure provides a dynamical justification for the molecular chaos assumption central to Boltzmann-Lanford derivations, particularly in regimes (dense systems, few bodies, structured particles) where classical point-particle theory fails. Recent mathematical advances (Deng, Hani &amp; Ma 2024) extend Lanford's theorem to arbitrary times but still require molecular chaos as input and apply only to dilute gases. This extended structural framework addresses the complementary philosophical question: how can molecular chaos itself emerge from deterministic dynamics? We show that geometric instability in extended phase space makes entropy-decreasing trajectories dynamically unstable, offering a structural explanation for the Second Law. This reframes thermodynamic irreversibility as a geometric property of structured motion rather than a purely statistical postulate.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00643" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Block Diagrams to Bloch Spheres: Graphical Quantum Circuit Simulation in LabVIEW</a><span class="id">[2602.00643]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As quantum computing transitions from theoretical physics to engineering applications, there is a growing need for accessible simulation tools that bridge the gap between abstract linear algebra and practical implementation. While text-based frameworks (like Qiskit or Cirq) are standard, they often present a steep learning curve for students and engineers accustomed to graphical system design. This paper introduces QuVI (Quantum Virtual Instrument), an open-source quantum circuit toolkit developed natively within the NI LabVIEW environment. Moving beyond initial proof-of-concept models, QuVI establishes a robust framework that leverages LabVIEW's &quot;dataflow&quot; paradigm, in which wires represent data and nodes represent operations, to provide an intuitive, visual analog to standard quantum circuit notation while enabling the seamless integration of classical control structures like loops and conditionals. The toolkit's capabilities are demonstrated by constructing and visualizing fundamental quantum algorithms and verifying results against theoretical predictions. By translating &quot;Block Diagrams&quot; directly into quantum state evolutions (&quot;Bloch Spheres&quot;), QuVI offers educators and researchers a powerful platform for prototyping quantum logic without leaving the graphical engineering workspace.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02580" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles: getting a bit more exotic</a><span class="id">[2602.02580]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, numerical examples of stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles have been presented. The geometry of these clusters is based on the Platonic solids whose vertices have valence $3$ (in order to fulfill Plateau's laws): the tetrahedron, the cube, the dodecahedron. The clusters respectively contain a bubble of genus $3, 5, 11$. The construction is quite generic and can be used with any convex polyhedron. If stable, the cluster obtained using a polyhedron with $n$ faces has $3n+2$ bubbles and one of these bubbles has genus $n-1$. We propose here to show that is it possible to get stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles using a geometry based on prisms and Archimedean solids as well.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R{é}flexions sur la puissance motrice du Soleil</a><span class="id">[2602.02609]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A quintessential source of heat, the Sun radiates toward the Earth a power ten thousand times greater than humanity's energy needs. Harnessing this energy bounty, however, requires capturing and converting sunlight. Today, this conversion can be achieved through several families of technologies at varying stages of maturity: photovoltaic solar, thermal, concentrated solar power, and more. While their applications differ, all these technologies must meet common fundamental constraints, and as Carnot proposed, one can 'consider in all its generality the principle of producing motion through heat' from the Sun. However, unlike traditional 'heat engines,' the coupling with the hot source here is radiative, introducing specific constraints that must be accounted for. In this presentation dedicated to radiative machines, you will encounter familiar terms as well as particular expressions that will provide the keys to understanding solar technologies</p></div></details></article></body>
