[ arXiv:2310.12859 ] claimed strong evidence for the statistical anisotropy of the universe. The claim is based on a joint analysis of four different anomaly tests of the cosmic microwave background data, each of which is known to be anomalous, with a lower level of significance. They reported a combined $p$-value of about $3\times 10^{-8}$, which is more than a $5\sigma$ level of significance. We observe that statistical anisotropy is not even relevant for two of the four considered tests, which seems sufficient to invalidate the authors' claim. Furthermore, even if one reinterprets the claim as evidence against $\Lambda$CDM rather than statistical anisotropy, we argue that this result significantly suffers from the look-elsewhere effect. Assuming a set of independent (i.e., uncorrelated) tests, we show that if the four tests with the smallest $p$-values are cherry-picked from 10 independent tests, the $p$-value reported by Jones et al. corresponds to only $3\sigma$ significance. If there are 27 independent tests, the significance falls to $2\sigma$. These numbers, however, overstate our argument, since the four tests used by Jones et al. are slightly correlated. Determining the correlation of Jones et al.'s tests by comparing their joint $p$-value with the product of the four separate $p$-values, we find that about 16 or 50 tests are sufficient to reduce the significance of Jones et al.'s results to 3$\sigma$ or 2$\sigma$ significance, respectively. We also provide a list of anomaly tests discussed in the literature (and propose a few generalizations), suggesting that very plausibly 16 (or even 50) independent tests have been published, and possibly many more have been considered but not published. We conclude that the current data is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model and, in particular, with statistical isotropy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern tidal interaction models for rapid binary population synthesis: I. Methods</a><span class="id">[2602.10187]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we present an updated prescription of contemporary tidal dissipation theory adapted for rapid binary population synthesis. Our simplified expressions encode the dependence of tidal dissipation on stellar structure, stratification, and tidal forcing frequency, while remaining computationally efficient. We implement these prescriptions in the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS, and demonstrate the self-consistent coupling of tides with stellar evolution and binary properties such as orbital periods, spins, and eccentricities for several representative binary systems. When compared with commonly used tidal prescriptions, our equilibrium tidal dissipation efficiencies can be stronger by 1-2 orders of magnitude for low mass main sequence and giant type stars, and dynamical tides can be stronger by 1-7 orders of magnitude due to the explicit dependence on internal stellar structure and the presence of inertial wave dissipation. Despite our simplistic approach, our models agree with detailed stellar simulations to within an order of magnitude across tidal dissipation mechanisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $ρ$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU) II: Two Young Bound Companions to Ophiuchus Stars</a><span class="id">[2602.10198]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the second set of discoveries from Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $\rho$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU), an adaptive optics survey of young stars in the Taurus and $\rho$ Oph star-forming regions using Keck/NIRC2 in conjunction with the Keck infrared pyramid wavefront sensor. We have discovered two faint comoving companions to young stars ISO-Oph 96 and 2MASS J16262785-2625152. The companion to ISO-Oph 96, KOINTREAU-3b, is at a projected separation of 340 au (2.49&quot;). Using our NIRC2 photometry and evolutionary models, and assuming that the companion has the same extinction as its host star, we infer that KOINTREAU-3b has a mass of $3.4\pm0.7$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. The companion to 2MASS J16262785-2625152, KOINTREAU-4b, has a projected separation of 180 au (1.25&quot;) and could have a mass of either $11.5^{+1.2}_{-1.6}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$ or $15.3^{+0.7}_{-0.8}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, depending on whether the host star is a member of $\rho$ Oph or Upper Sco.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10199" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Deep Radio Continuum Imaging Still Indicates a Large Reservoir of Undiscovered Millisecond Pulsars in Terzan 5</a><span class="id">[2602.10199]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the deepest and highest-resolution radio continuum imaging of the Galactic globular cluster Terzan 5, one of the most crowded locations in the radio sky. In these new 2$-$4 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array images, we detect 38 of the 49 confirmed pulsars, including extensive multi-frequency eclipse mapping of the luminous redback Ter5A. Nonetheless, there is still a large amount of diffuse residual flux from pulsars that are fainter than our 2.5 GHz continuum detection limit of $\sim 11\,\mu$Jy. Using a range of approaches including image-based simulations, we model the fluxes of the detected pulsars together with the residual flux. We find a minimum total population of $N\sim250$ detectable pulsars in Terzan 5 and perhaps substantially more, though the luminosity function remains very uncertain. Consideration of the $\gamma$-ray properties of the cluster, though also not unambiguous to interpret, leads to consistent conclusions. These pulsar population estimates are larger than inferred from previous work and highlight Terzan 5 as a keystone target for next-generation radio facilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Landscape of Unstable Mass Transfer in Interacting Binaries and Its Imprint on the Population of Luminous Red Novae</a><span class="id">[2602.10211]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A common-envelope (CE) phase occurs when a star engulfs its companion and is widely considered the primary channel for producing Luminous Red Novae (LRNe). In this study, we combine binary-population synthesis with stellar-evolution calculations to systematically estimate the mass, velocity, and launching radius of ejecta produced during coalescence across a range of binary configurations. Our aim is to quantify how unstable mass-transfer dynamics in binaries at various evolutionary stages shape CE outcomes, enabling a predictive framework for modeling the LRN luminosity function. We find a bimodal distribution of plateau luminosities with significant implications for binary mass stability criteria that can be tested with forthcoming LSST observations. This bimodality emerges from differing mass-ejection outcomes during common-envelope interactions, which can lead either to stellar mergers, often accompanied by tidal disruption of the companion, or to successful envelope ejection. Although our predicted plateau luminosities and timescales broadly match existing observations, the models underpredict the number of LRNe with long-duration plateaus ($t_p \gtrsim 100\, \text{d}$) by about a third. We propose that these long-duration events arise from highly extended progenitors whose envelopes are ejected over multiple orbits (i.e., non-impulsively), producing relatively faint, long-lived transients. By constraining ejecta properties and incorporating pre-outburst progenitor imaging, we show how our models can clarify the physical processes that drive unstable mass transfer in these events. Finally, we argue that common-envelope interactions involving white-dwarf accretors can yield exotic outcomes, including red giants containing embedded white dwarfs that resemble Thorne-Żytków objects (TŻOs), along with calcium-rich supernovae that preserve hydrogen envelopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Expected Orbitally-modulated TeV Signatures of Spider Binaries: The Effect of Intrabinary Shock Geometry</a><span class="id">[2602.10213]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>'Spider' binary systems - black widow and redback compact binaries differentiated by their companion's mass and nature - are an important type of pulsar system exhibiting a rich empirical phenomenology, including radio eclipses, optical light curves from a heated companion, as well as non-thermal X-ray and GeV orbital light curves and spectra. Multi-wavelength observations have now resulted in the detection of &gt; 50 of these systems in which a millisecond pulsar heats and ablates its low-mass companion via its intense pulsar wind. Broadband observations have established the presence of relativistic leptons that have been accelerated in the pulsar magnetosphere and near the intrabinary shock, as well as a hot companion, presenting an ideal environment for the creation of orbitally-modulated inverse Compton fluxes that should be within reach of current and future Cherenkov telescopes. We have included an updated synchrotron kernel, different parametric injection spectral shapes, and several intrabinary shock geometries in our emission code to improve our predictions of the expected TeV signatures from spider binaries. Our updated phase-dependent spectral and energy-dependent light curve outputs may aid in constraining particle energetics, wind properties, shock geometry, and system inclination of several spider binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linking Solar Magnetism, Extreme Solar Particle Events and Stellar Superflares</a><span class="id">[2602.10243]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The magnetic field of the Sun drives a wide range of eruptive phenomena, from small-scale nanoflares to large flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). While direct observations of solar activity cover only the past few decades, indirect evidence indicates that the Sun can occasionally produce events orders of magnitude stronger than any recorded ones in the modern era. Two complementary lines of evidence exist. First, extreme solar particle events (ESPEs) have been inferred from prominent spikes in cosmogenic isotope concentrations preserved in precisely dated natural archives such as tree rings and ice cores over the past 15 millennia. Second, high-precision space-borne photometry has revealed superflares on thousands of stars similar to the Sun. Whether these solar and stellar extremes are physically related remains an open question. We summarise the present state of understanding and discuss physical mechanisms that may link them. Although superflares and ESPEs are both extremely energetic manifestations of magnetic energy storage and release, their relationship does not appear to be one-to-one. Their occurrence and energetics likely depend on how magnetic flux and topology govern the partitioning of released energy between radiation, mass ejection, and particle acceleration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long-Term Evolution of Close-in Sub-Neptunes and Outer Planetary Embryos: Atmospheric Mass Loss and Origin of Planets Inside and Outside the Radius Gap</a><span class="id">[2602.10245]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As a byproduct of sub-Neptune formation, planetary embryos with high eccentricity can remain in outer orbits, near 1 au from the star. In this work, we investigate the long-term evolution of systems consisting of close-in sub-Neptunes (SNs) and outer high-eccentricity embryos. Our analysis focuses on collisions between SNs and embryos, particularly their atmospheric mass loss. We performed N-body simulations for various initial eccentricities and numbers of embryos. We analyzed the impact-induced atmospheric loss using post-processing methods, finding that the embryos and SNs collide at high speeds on timescales of several million years, leading to the loss of the SNs' atmospheres. Depending on the embryos' eccentricity and the orbital radius of the SNs, the impact velocity can be quite high, ranging from 2 to 5 times the escape velocity. On average, about 15%-30% of the atmosphere is dissipated per collision, so after 3-6 collisions, the atmospheric mass of an SN is reduced to about 1/3 of its initial value. Collisions between SNs and embryos can thus explain the presence of planets within the radius gap. Depending upon the initial eccentricity and the number of remaining embryos, additional collisions can occur, potentially accounting for the formation of the radius gap. This study also indicates that collisions between remaining embryos and SNs may help to explain the observed rarity of SNs with atmospheric mass fractions greater than 10%, commonly termed the &quot;radius cliff.&quot;</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cold and eccentric: a high-spectral resolution view of 51 Eri b with VLT/HiRISE</a><span class="id">[2602.10260]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Discovered almost 10 years ago, the giant planet 51 Eridani b is one of the least separated (0.2 arcsec) and faintest (J = 19.74 mag) directly imaged exoplanets known to date. Its atmospheric properties have been thoroughly investigated through low- and medium-resolution spectroscopic observations, enabling robust characterization of the planet's bulk parameters. However, the planet's intrinsically high contrast renders high-resolution spectroscopic observations difficult, despite their potential to yield key measurements essential for a more comprehensive characterization. This study seeks to constrain the planet's radial velocity, enabling a full 3D orbital solution when integrated with previous measurements. We have obtained 4 high-contrast high-resolution (R = 140000) spectroscopic datasets of the planet, collected over a two-year interval with the HiRISE visitor instrument at the VLT to derive the planet's radial velocity. Using self-consistent models of atmosphere, we were able to derive the radial velocity of the planet at each of the 4 epochs. These radial velocity measurements were then used in combination with all existing relative astrometry in order to constrain the orbit of the planet. Our radial velocity measurements allow us to break the degeneracy along the line of sight, making it now possible the unambiguous interpretation of the phase curve of the companion. We further constrain the orbital parameters, particularly the eccentricity, for which we derive e = 0.55 (-0.07, +0.03). The relatively high eccentricity indicates that the system has experienced dynamical interactions induced by an external perturber. We place constraints on the mass and semi-major axis of a hypothetical, unseen outer planet capable of producing the observed high eccentricities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar Wind Heating Near the Sun: A Radial Evolution Approach</a><span class="id">[2602.10275]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Characterizing the plasma state in the near-Sun environment is essential to constrain the mechanisms that heat and accelerate the solar wind. In this study, we use Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations from Encounters 1 through 24 to investigate the radial evolution of solar wind plasma and magnetic field properties in this region. Using intervals with high field-of-view ($&gt;85\%$) coverage, we derive the radial profiles of magnetic field strength ($|B|$), proton density ($N$), bulk speed ($V$), total proton temperature ($T$), parallel ($T_\parallel$) and perpendicular ($T_\perp$) temperatures, temperature anisotropy ($T_\perp/T_\parallel$), plasma beta ($\beta$), Alfvén Mach number ($M_A$), and magnetic field fluctuations ($\delta B/B$) for sub and super-Alfvénic regions. In super-Alfvénic regions, power-law of $|B|$, $N$, $V$, and $T$ as a function of heliocentric distance are broadly consistent with previous \textit{Helios} results at $&gt;0.3$ AU. The radial evolution of the components of the temperature tensor reveals distinct behavior: $T_\perp$ decreases monotonically with distance, whereas $T_\parallel$ exhibits a non-monotonic trend – decreasing in the sub-Alfvénic region, increasing just beyond the Alfvén surface. We interpret the increase in $T_\parallel$ as a proxy for proton beam occurrence. We further examine the evolution of magnetic field fluctuations, finding decreasing radial/parallel fluctuations but enhanced tangential/normal/perpendicular fluctuations in sunward direction. These fluctuations may provide free energy for beam generation and particle heating via wave-particle interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence that SOL2012-06-03 Late Phase $γ$ Rays are Produced by $&gt;$300 MeV Protons from CME-Shock Acceleration of Suprathermals from the Flare</a><span class="id">[2602.10284]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A recent paper on SOL2012-06-03 reported the detection for the first time of two distinct phases of $&gt;$100 MeV $\gamma$-radiation indicating separate acceleration processes. But such two-phase emission has been seen before and was first observed in SOL1982-06-03. The second phase is known as Late Phase Gamma-Ray Emission (LPGRE) and was cataloged for $&gt;$40 solar eruptions, including SOL2012-06-03. Here we provide evidence that the second SOL2012-06-03 $\pi$-decay peak is the onset of LPGRE that lasted for $&gt;$8 min. Its delay from the impulsive X-ray peak is consistent with the time it would take flare-produced suprathermal protons to overtake the expanding CME and be accelerated by its shock. The high accelerated ion-to-electron ratio in SOL2012-06-03 and other LPGRE events is consistent with the ratio observed in gradual SEP events produced by shocks and is inconsistent with ratios typically found in impulsive flares and solar energetic particle events produced by reconnection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for radio emission from stellar wind-magnetosphere interaction or co-rotation breakdown in brown dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2602.10333]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the improvements in radio interferometry sensitivity, the quest for coherent radio emission from exoplanets and ultra-cool dwarfs, which is indicative of their magnetic fields, has gained significant momentum in recent years. We investigated the relatively unexplored possibility of radio emission from wide-orbit brown dwarf companions, which may radiate through rapid rotation, as in isolated ultra-cool dwarfs, or via interactions between their extended magnetospheres and the host star's wind. We analysed $\sim 60$ hours of Upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array data for a set of well-characterized systems previously unobserved at 0.3-2 GHz. The targets include companions orbiting the G-type stars HD 26161 and BD-004475, the K-type HD 153557A and $\nu$ Oph, and the M dwarfs GJ 3626 and 2MJ01225093-2439505. No detections were obtained with 3$\sigma$ upper limits down to $\sim 25\,\mu$Jy/beam in Stokes V in the best cases. The light-curve analysis also revealed no evidence of short ($\gtrsim$ minutes), intense ($\gtrsim$ mJy) radio bursts. The upper limits provide tentative constraints on model parameters. However, the effects of model uncertainties, limited observational coverage, and intrinsic variability or beaming of the emission must be considered. The improvement in sensitivity of the next-generation radio interferometers will likely allow to go below the expected flux range over a much larger range of free parameters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10369" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Not Earth-like Yet Temperate? More Generic Climate Feedback Configurations Still Allow Temperate Climates in Habitable Zone Exo-Earth Candidates</a><span class="id">[2602.10369]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Earth's climate is influenced by over a dozen feedbacks, but only three dominate its long-term climate behavior. Models of the exoplanet habitable zone (HZ) assume that this is similar for other Earth-like planets. We used dynamical simulations to study Earth-like planets with a fourth, (potentially strong) generalized climate feedback. Across over 20,000 climate simulations, we find that the addition of the fourth feedback produces novel behaviors, including runaway and chaotic climate trajectories, that are more diverse than one would expect based on Earth's climate configuration. Non-negligible fourth feedbacks – if negative – would not lessen the probability of planets with temperate climates. However, positive fourth feedbacks decrease the fraction of exo-Earth candidates that are long-term habitable. Therefore, strong fourth feedbacks will alter (and mostly shrink) the boundaries of the classical habitable zone. When combined with occurrence rates of Earth-sized planets around sun-like stars, our results imply that the fraction of stars hosting rocky planets with temperate climates may be substantially lower than classical estimates under Earth-like climate assumptions. Our results are subject to the validity of the model assumptions and not intended to represent conclusive predictions about exoplanet populations but rather to demonstrate the potential climate diversity that emerges from non-Earth-like model configurations. Our conclusions provide context on sample sizes and science questions for next-generation exoplanet surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10477" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data-driven Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of the Initiation of a Coronal Mass Ejection with Multiple Stages</a><span class="id">[2602.10477]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the primary drivers of adverse space-weather events, yet their initiation and onset prediction remain insufficiently understood due to the complexity of the magnetic topology and physical processes in real solar source regions. Here, based on fully observational-data-driven magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we successfully reproduce the initiation of a CME originating from the super active region AR 13663, with only a one-minute time lag between the flare peak in observations and the velocity peak of the rising flux rope in the simulation. Moreover, the eruptive structure exhibits a multi-stage kinematic evolution: an initial slow acceleration, a plateau at a nearly stationary height, and a subsequent impulsive acceleration. These stages correspond to torus instability, the downward tension force exerted by the overlying toroidal field, and fast magnetic reconnection, respectively. Our results highlight the inherently multistage nature of CME initiation in real events. In configurations with strong overlying toroidal fields, the downward toroidal-field-induced tension force can suppress the rise of the flux rope and produce a plateau phase at a nearly stable height, even when torus instability occurs. In contrast, the subsequent fast magnetic reconnection beneath the flux rope can drive the impulsive eruption more effectively. The close agreement between the observed and simulated peak times over one minute demonstrates the strong potential of our data-driven model for predicting CME onset.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A 682-second X-ray Periodicity in CH Cygni: Evidence for a Magnetic White Dwarf</a><span class="id">[2602.10511]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Symbiotic stars are interacting binaries consisting of a red giant and typically a white dwarf, important as potential Type Ia supernova progenitors.

This detection is characterized by a recent GeV $\gamma$-ray flare identified in Fermi-LAT data during MJD 60032.6–60132.6, with a $\gamma$-ray source detected at a significance level of $\sim6.2\sigma$. The average 0.1–300 GeV flux is measured to be $(1.6 \pm 0.6)\times10^{-8}\,\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$, with a photon spectral index of $\Gamma = 2.15 \pm 0.185$. We find that a radiative model of the radio lobes significantly underestimates the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. The strong flux and short-term variability over $\sim$100 days suggest that the emission likely originates from newly launched sub-kiloparsec-scale jets at the core. This detection provides a unique window into the extreme environments and early-stage jet activity of young radio galaxies, offering insights into their initial evolution and the formation of relativistic jets in the earliest phases of galaxy growth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linking {\it Fermi} blazars and radio galaxies through accretion and jet radiation mechanisms</a><span class="id">[2602.10653]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Based on the classical unification, blazars, namely BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) and flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), are believed to correspond with radio galaxies when observed at small jet viewing angles. In this paper, we aim to compile a sample of Fermi blazars and radio galaxies to provide new insights towards a unified accretion and ejection scenario between aligned and misaligned radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs), by considering their optical emission-line classifications (low- and high-excitation radio galaxies, LERGs, HERGs), which are more representative of their accretion states. We adopted statistical analyses of accretion properties and high-energy beaming patterns for both Fermi blazars and radio galaxies to investigate a unified accretion-ejection scenario. In the gamma-ray luminosity-photon index plane, HERGs populate the region of higher luminosities and softer photon indices, akin to FSRQs, whereas LERGs fill lower luminosities with harder photon indices, analogous to BL Lacs. This parallel segregation indicates that LERGs and HERGs represent the misaligned counterparts of BL Lacs and FSRQs, respectively. The unified picture is further supported by the Compton dominance-photon index diagram, where FSRQs and HERGs dominated by external Compton (EC) emissions are distinctly separated from BL Lacs and LERGs governed by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emissions. Similarly, the diagram of accretion rate versus gamma-ray photon index reveals two distinct accretion-ejection states: a low-accretion-rate branch (BL Lacs and LERGs) is associated with the SSC model, and a high-accretion-rate branch (FSRQs and HERGs) is linked to the EC model. These results strongly strengthen the idea of a unified accretion and ejection paradigm between blazars and radio galaxies into two distinct states.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distance Estimation and Sky Localization of Eccentric Double White Dwarf Binaries from Gravitational Wave Observations inside Globular Clusters</a><span class="id">[2602.10664]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmic distance scale is built on multiple different techniques for estimating distances in space that are often connected and dependent on multiple measurements and assumptions. Double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) are common objects and are expected to produce gravitational wave (GW) signals that can be observed with space-based detectors such as LISA. By analyzing these signals we should be able to estimate the distance and sky location of the source. Previous studies have done this for circular binaries which, while they are abundant, have, in general, weaker signals than eccentric binaries and it is not possible to differentiate whether a circular binary is in the field or in a dense environment such as a globular cluster (GC). In this paper we used eccentric binaries from MOCCA GC simulations, simulated the GW signal from each binary at locations related to GCs in the Milky Way and estimated the precision on the distance and the sky location of the source. We find that distances can be estimated with higher precision than current day methods even with low eccentricity binaries and higher eccentricity further increases this precision. Although the probability of finding a tight and eccentric DWD is far lower than a circular one, we can expect to find at least a few in the dense environments of the Milky Way, such as GCs. These estimations would be independent measurements with high precision to objects inside dense environments, such as GCs inside the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The role of detailed gas and dust opacities in shaping the evolution of the inner disc edge subject to episodic accretion</a><span class="id">[2602.10674]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the effects of different dust and gas opacity descriptions on the structure and evolution of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs. The influence on the episodic instability of the inner rim is hereby of central interest. 2D axisymmetric radiation hydrodynamic models are employed to simulate the evolution of the inner disc over several thousand years. Our simulations greatly expand on previous models by implementing detailed opacity descriptions in terms of their mean and frequency-dependent values, allowing us to also consider binned frequency-dependent irradiation. The adaptive opacity description significantly affects the structure of the inner disc rim, with gas opacities exerting the greatest influence. The resulting effects include shifts in the position of both the dust sublimation front and the dead zone inner edge, a significantly altered temperature in the dust-free region and the manifestation of an equilibrium temperature degeneracy as a sharp temperature transition. The episodic instability due to MRI activation in the dead zone still occurs, but at lower inner disc densities. While the gas opacities set the initial conditions for the instability, the evolution of the outburst itself is mainly governed by the dust opacities. The analysis of criteria for non-axisymmetric instabilities reveals possible breaking of the density peaks produced by the burst. However, due to the periodicity of the instability, the inner edge itself may remain stable throughout quiescent phases according to linear criteria. Although the thermal structure of the inner disc is crucially affected by different opacity descriptions, the mechanism of the periodic instability of the DZIE remains active and is only marginally influenced by gas opacities. The observational consequences of the severely altered temperatures may be significant and require further investigation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chemistry in the High expansion-velocity C-rich evolved star AFGL2233. Isotopic ratios, peculiarities and evolutionary status</a><span class="id">[2602.10846]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High expansion velocity carbon stars (HVCs) are a rare class of evolved stars whose circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) combine C-rich chemistry with unusually high expansion velocities typical of O-rich massive evolved stars. AFGL2233 has been proposed as a high-mass evolved object that exhausted hot-bottom burning. Studying its chemistry is essential to understand the nature and evolution of these objects. We characterize the chemical composition and isotopic ratios of the CSE of AFGL2233 and investigate chemical peculiarities, including the presence of N- and O-bearing species in a C-rich environment. We carried out a complete line survey at 3 mm and 1 mm using the IRAM 30m telescope, complemented by Herschel/HIFI FIR observations and interferometric maps of SiO, C2H, and HCN. Molecular emission was analyzed using rotational diagrams and radiative transfer modeling under the LVG approximation. Column densities and fractional abundances were derived for more than 30 molecular species, including isotopologues, and compared with other evolved stars. The Gaia DR3 distance of 1.236 kpc implies a luminosity of  2 Lsun, consistent with an initial mass of 4.5-9 Msun. The molecular inventory confirms C-rich chemistry but reveals unusually high abundances of NH3, H2O, and SiN. The isotopic ratios vary among species, with 12C/13C ranging from 7 to 55. The C2H/C4H ratio is abnormally high compared with C-rich AGB stars. The presence of SiN and high NH3 may indicate N-enrichment or the influence of a companion. AFGL2233 is likely a high-mass AGB or super-AGB star with a complex evolutionary history involving nucleosynthesis, shocks, and possible binary interaction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GECAM discovery of the second FRB-associated Magnetar X-ray Burst from SGR J1935+2154</a><span class="id">[2602.10895]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio burst (FRB) is mysterious phenomenon with millisecond-duration radio pulses observed mostly from cosmological distance. The association between FRB 200428 and a magnetar X-ray burst (MXB) from SGR J1935+2154 has significantly advanced the understanding of FRB and magnetar bursts. However, it is uncertain whether this association between MXB and FRB (i.e. MXB/FRB 200428) is genuine or just coincidental only based on this single event. Here we report the discovery of a bright ($\rm\sim7.6\times10^{-7}\,erg \cdot cm^{-2}$ in 1-250 keV) magnetar X-ray burst detected by GECAM on October 14th, 2022 (dubbed as MXB 221014) from SGR J1935+2154, which is associated with a FRB detected by CHIME and GBT. We conducted a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of MXB 221014 with GECAM data and find that it is a bright and typical ($T_{90}\sim$250 ms) X-ray burst from this magnetar. Interestingly, we find two narrow X-ray pulses in the MXB, one of which temporally aligns with the main pulse of the FRB 221014 $\sim5.70$ ms latter than the peak time of FRB 221014), resembling the feature found in MXB/FRB 200428. Furthermore, we did comprehensive comparison between MXB/FRB 221014 and MXB/FRB 200428, and find that while the two events share several common features, they also exhibit distinct differences, highlighting the variety of the MXB-FRB association morphology. This finding not only confirms the association between MXB and FRB but also provides new insights into the mechanism of and the relationship between FRB and MXB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reevaluating thermal instability in a uniform plasma: an extended analysis of instability domains</a><span class="id">[2602.10902]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thermal instability plays a crucial role in the dynamics of astrophysical plasmas. Building upon the foundational work of Field (1965) and the subsequent analysis by Waters and Proga (2019), this study revisits the characteristics of thermal instability in a uniform, non-magnetic medium. Our primary aim is to reevaluate and expand the understanding of instability domains, focusing on the classification and characteristics of thermal and acoustic modes in the presence of heating, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction. Except for Spitzers expression for parallel thermal conductivity, the heating and cooling processes are unspecified. Additionally, we investigate the existence of isobaric and isochoric thermal modes across the extreme limits of very short and very long wavelengths, as well as at intermediate wavelengths. We perform an in-depth analysis of the dispersion relation for an infinite, uniform hydrodynamic medium, as initially derived by Field (1965). This approach enables the generation of growth-rate and dispersion diagrams, providing insight into the behaviour of thermal instability across different wavelength ranges. With the inclusion of thermal conduction, our study refines the classification of the seven instability regions previously outlined by Waters and Proga (2019). Our findings confirm that their classification holds when the Field length is smaller than or comparable to the thermal wavelength. For larger Field lengths, a simplified classification becomes impractical. Furthermore, we discuss the potential implications of the catastrophic cooling instability (Waters and Stricklan 2025) in the context of cool coronal rain formation. Our work not only validates certain classifications, but also proposes new insights into complex instability behaviours, thereby enhancing the theoretical framework established by Field and others.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HD 164604 c: a second giant planet on a 15-yr orbit and the constraint of the planet-planet mutual inclination</a><span class="id">[2602.10919]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of a new massive giant planet, HD 164604 c ($a_c = 5.556_{-0.10}^{+0.093}$ au, $e_c = 0.196_{-0.078}^{+0.078}$ and $m_c = 9.5_{-1.25}^{+1.2}$ or $7.6_{-1.0}^{+1.0}\,M_{\rm Jup}$), orbiting a K3.5 dwarf, The result is based on the combined analysis of high-precision radial-velocity data, Hipparcos, and Gaia DR2 and DR3 astrometry. We refine the orbital parameters of the inner planet HD 164604 b to $a_b = 1.362_{-0.012}^{+0.012}$ au, $e_b = 0.479_{-0.021}^{+0.027}$, and $m_b = 13.2_{-1.5}^{+1.8}\,M_{\rm Jup}$ (or $8.8_{-1.5}^{+1.9}\,M_{\rm Jup}$). Depending on the two possible orbital orientations of HD 164604 c, the true mutual inclination between the two planets is $\psi_{bc}=5.0^{+3.7}_{-2.2}$$^\circ$ (prograde) or $162.1^{+7.1}_{-4.7}$$^\circ$ (retrograde). Long-term N-body integrations show that most orbits with the retrograde configuration remain dynamically stable for at least 10 Myr, while orbits with the prograde motion might rapidly evolve into chaos or lead to ejection. The retrograde architecture points to a violent dynamical history, possibly involving von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles or three-body scattering, while the prograde scenario might be consistent with coplanar and mild disk migration. Future Gaia DR4 astrometry will break the inclination degeneracy and distinguish between prograde and retrograde orbits for HD 164604 c.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A search for new symbiotic stars in the Milky Way: Using machine learning techniques applied to photometric databases</a><span class="id">[2602.10945]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Symbiotic stars (SySts) are interacting binaries composed of a red giant transferring material to a hot compact star, typically a white dwarf.

Distinguishing between competing models that make similar predictions yet rely on fundamentally different principles, therefore requires suitably diverse physical tests. Observational constraints on spacetime variations of fundamental constants fill this need. The fine-structure constant, $\alpha = e^2/\hbar c$, can be measured using absorption systems towards bright quasars using the Many Multiplet method, and using atomic doublets from line emitting gas in galaxies. A spectroscopic facility such as the WST could produce more than 100,000 new measurements of $\alpha$ from quasars together with a million measurements from galaxies.

Previous studies have suggested a positive connection between these two populations, particularly around metal-rich stars, and proposed that nearly all CJ-hosting stars may also harbor inner SEs. In this work, we use TESS transits to investigate the occurrence of hot SEs in systems with known CJs detected by radial velocity (RV). Out of a statistical sample of 132 CJ systems, we identify five transiting hot super-Earths ($1$-$4R_\oplus$, $P&lt;10\mathrm{d}$) around four stars, including one new candidate (TOI-6965.01) around HD 50554. To enable statistical analysis, we first validate the two candidates around HD 50554 using TESS photometry, archival RV measurements, and Gaia astrometry. After accounting for detection sensitivity and geometric transit probability, we find that the presence of CJs enhances the occurrence rate of hot super-Earths by a factor of $8.1^{+4.3}_{-3.2}$ relative to field stars, with the case of no enhancement ruled out at the 99.9% confidence level. Taking into account the average multiplicity of hot SEs, we find that about 87% of CJ systems host at least one hot SE. Our results provide strong supporting evidence for a positive SE-CJ correlation. We also briefly explore the correlation around metal-poor hosts and for specific sub-populations (e.g., warm super-Earths or cold super-Jupiters).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Population Properties of Binary Black Holes with Eccentricity</a><span class="id">[2602.11030]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The improved sensitivity of Gravitational-Wave detectors and the development of eccentric waveform models enable us to explore the growing catalog of gravitational-wave events with measurable eccentricity. This opens new opportunities to gain insight into the formation channels and evolutionary pathways of compact binary systems using eccentricity. However, most recent population analyses have been limited to quasi-circular binaries, primarily due to constraints in waveform modeling and sensitivity estimates. We are now entering an era where both of these limitations are being addressed, allowing for a more comprehensive investigation of eccentric binary populations. In this work, we perform the first population inference analysis that simultaneously fits the mass, spin, redshift, and eccentricity distribution. Specifically, we use source-parameter estimation provided by the Rapid Iterative FiTting (RIFT) framework using the SEOBNRv5EHM waveform model, and a default O4a population model extended to include eccentricity. We find population properties broadly consistent with conclusions obtained in previous analyses assuming quasi-circular binaries. Consistent with our conclusions about each event, we bound the branching ratio for eccentric events to be below $0.0239$ at $90\%$ confidence with our fiducial eccentricity mixture models. Using four different parametric population models for eccentricity, we point out that the rate of eccentric events is weakly constrained by observations and highly model-dependent.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11093" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New constraints on cosmic anisotropy from galaxy clusters using an improved dipole fitting method</a><span class="id">[2602.11093]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we attempted to apply the dipole fitting (DF) method to galaxy clusters to search for cosmic anisotropic signals, and to construct a statistical isotropic analysis scheme for them. Compared to Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia), the galaxy clusters offer a significant advantage in terms of spatial distribution. This advantage makes the anisotropic signals obtained from them more reliable. From 313 galaxy clusters (Chandra + XMM-Newton), we find two preferred directions (l, b) = (${257.82^{\circ}}_{-52.88}^{+58.01}$, $-31.30{^{\circ}}_{-39.46}^{+35.92}$) and ($80.89{^{\circ}}_{-52.46}^{+60.97}$, $31.75{^{\circ}}_{-40.16}^{+35.19}$). The former to a direction where the universe is expanding at a faster rate than the surrounding area, while the latter to a slower rate of expansion. The corresponding magnitude of anisotropy is $|A|$ = 5.2 $\sim$ 5.4 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$. The results of statistical isotropy analyses give $\sim$1.0$\sigma$ confidence level. From the reanalyses based on the subsamples including Chandra, XMM-Newton, low reshift (LR, $z &lt; 0.10$), high redshift (HR, $z &gt; 0.10$) datasets, we find that the observation equipment and sample redshift can affect the preferred direction, anisotropic magnitude, and statistical significance of anisotropy. The XMM-Newton dataset gives a statistical significance of 2.26$\sigma$ (Mock) and 2.86$\sigma$ (Iso) which are much higher than that from Chandra and the total datasets. The magnitude of anisotropy $|A|$ from HR dataset is larger than that from LR dataset. Overall, our results indicate the presence of anisotropic signals in galaxy clusters, which must be taken seriously.

In this work, we examine whether non-thermal X-ray emission powered by magnetic reconnection could obscure or modify this thermal X-ray drop. We construct semi-analytic models for both the thermal X-ray emission from minidiscs and the non-thermal synchrotron emission produced by reconnection in magnetically dominated black hole magnetospheres. Evaluating these models across the MBHB mass range relevant for LISA, we find that for physically motivated magnetic field strengths and accretion rates, the non-thermal X-ray luminosity remains several orders of magnitude below the thermal component throughout the inspiral. Even under optimistic assumptions that enhance the non-thermal emission, it remains significantly subdominant. We further incorporate the magnetospheric balding framework to model the decay of non-thermal emission near merger, finding that reconnection-powered X-ray emission fades on short, mass-scaled timescales once the external magnetic flux supply is disrupted. Taken together, our results indicate that non-thermal emission is unlikely to mask the disappearing thermal X-ray signature, reinforcing its robustness as an electromagnetic counterpart to MBHB mergers and its potential utility for multi-messenger studies with LISA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unmasking LHAASO J2108+5157: Near Infrared Insights into a Mysterious TeV Source</a><span class="id">[2602.11148]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>LHAASO J2108+5157 is one of the few ultra-high energy gamma-ray sources in the LHAASO catalogue without secure counterpart at longer wavelengths.

In particular, a jump in magnetic field strength, observed by V1 in 2020.4 at 149.3 au from the Sun, was followed by a distinct &quot;hump&quot; and persistently strong magnetic field, both requiring theoretical explanation. This paper offers an interpretation of those observations using a self-consistent, MHD model of the solar wind - LISM interaction driven by the OMNI and interplanetary scintillation data combined with a turbulence analysis of Voyager data. Our simulations convincingly demonstrate that global, solar-cycle-driven compressions, on hitting the heliopause, can reproduce those puzzling V1 observations. They appear to be associated with solar cycle 24, whereas similar interstellar magnetic field structures can occur once per cycle. The turbulence analysis reveals time-dependent magnetic compressibility that persists up to 165 au at scales below 10 days. Turbulence intermittency at scales below 1 hour is mostly confined to specific intervals, possibly associated with a broad foreshock region. The apparent disappearance of intermittency since 2022 reflects the turbulence weakening rather than a fundamental change in VLISM properties. We predict that V1 will record relatively strong magnetic field strengths until $\sim$2030, followed by weaker, infrequent perturbations. At V2, we expect multiple solar-driven compressions before 2026, followed by a major event induced by solar cycle 25 around 2030. New Horizons is expected to cross the termination shock at 80$\pm$ au in 2031.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11053" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collisionless relaxation as the origin of the anisotropic, non-thermal, and multi-temperature momentum distributions observed in space plasmas</a><span class="id">[2602.11053]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Anisotropic, non-thermal, and multi-temperature distributed particle momenta are commonly observed in collisionless space plasmas, such as the solar wind.

In this contribution, we focus on recent studies aimed at quantifying the potential of the early universe to probe the properties and interactions of axions. The discussion is organized around four classes of axion scenarios, ordered from long to short lifetimes: (i) stable or long-lived axions contributing to dark radiation; (ii) stable or long-lived axions produced out-of-equilibrium and constituting dark matter; (iii) metastable axions whose decays inject energy into the primordial plasma and leave observable signatures in the global 21 cm signal; and (iv) very short-lived axions that act only as portals to additional degrees of freedom. Together, these scenarios highlight the interplay between axion phenomenology and early universe cosmology and demonstrate the potential of cosmological data to probe axions over a broad range of masses and lifetimes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First measurement of the correlation between cosmic voids and the Lyman-$α$ forest</a><span class="id">[2203.11045]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the first detection at a median redshift $z = 2.49$ of large-scale matter flows around cosmic voids. Voids are identified within a tomographic map of large-scale Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) transmissions, built from the eBOSS Ly$\alpha$ forest sample in the SDSS Stripe 82 field. We measure the imprint of flows around voids, known as redshift-space distortions (RSD), with a statistical significance of $8\,\sigma$. The observed quadrupole of the void-forest cross-correlation is described by a linear RSD model. The derived RSD parameter of the Ly$\alpha$ forest around voids is $\beta = 1.21 \pm 0.18$. Our model accounts for the tomographic effect induced by the Ly$\alpha$ data being located along parallel quasar lines of sight. This work presents a novel approach to observing the growth of cosmic structures at redshifts currently inaccessible to galaxy surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00162" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crustal lattice pressure as a source of neutron star mountains</a><span class="id">[2407.00162]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The spin frequencies of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries may be limited by the emission of gravitational waves. A candidate for producing such steady emission is a mass asymmetry, or &quot;mountain&quot;, sourced by temperature asymmetries in the star's crust. A number of studies have examined temperature-induced shifts in the crustal capture layers between one nuclear species and another to produce this asymmetry, with the presence of capture layers in the deep crust being needed to produce the required mass asymmetries. However, modern equation of state calculations cast doubt on the existence of such deep capture layers. Motivated by this, we investigated an alternative source of temperature dependence in the equation of state, coming from the pressure supplied by the solid crustal lattice itself. We show that temperature-induced perturbations in this pressure, while small, may be significant. We therefore advocate for more detailed calculations, self-consistently calculating both the temperature asymmetries, the perturbations in crustal lattice pressure, and the consequent mass asymmetries, to establish if this is a viable mechanism for explaining the observed distribution of low-mass X-ray binary spin frequencies. Furthermore, the crustal lattice pressure mechanism does not require accretion, extending the possibility for such thermoelastic mountains to include both accreting and isolated neutron stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A second-scale periodicity in an active repeating fast radio burst source</a><span class="id">[2503.12013]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are fierce radio flashes from the deep sky. Abundant observations have indicated that highly magnetized neutron stars might be involved in these energetic bursts, but the underlying trigger mechanism is still enigmatic. Especially, the widely expected periodicity connected to the spin of the central engine has never been discovered, which leads to further debates on the nature of FRBs. Here we report the first discovery of a $\sim 1.7\,\mathrm{s}$ period in the repeating source of FRB 20201124A. This is an active repeater, from which more than 2800 FRBs have been observed on a total of 49 days. The phase-folding method is adopted to analyze the bursts on each day separately. While no significant periodic signal is found in all other datasets, a clear periodicity does appear on two specific days, i.e. a period of $1.706024(13)\,\mathrm{s}$ on MJD 59310, and a slightly larger period of $1.707968(9)\,\mathrm{s}$ on MJD 59347. A period derivative of $6.11(5)\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{s\,s^{-1}}$ can be derived from these two periods, which further implies a surface magnetic field strength of $1.03\times 10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ and a spin-down age of 44 years for the central engine. A joint analysis on these two days yields a significance of $7.3\sigma$ for the periodicity. It is concluded that FRB 20201124A should be associated with a young magnetar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sagittarius A* near-infrared flares polarization as a probe of space-time I: Non-rotating exotic compact objects</a><span class="id">[2506.23931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The center of our galaxy hosts Sagittarius A*, a supermassive compact object of $\sim 4.3\times 10^6$ solar masses, usually associated with a black hole. Nevertheless, black holes possess a central singularity, considered unphysical, and an event horizon, which leads to loss of unitarity in a quantum description of the system. To address these theoretical inconsistencies, alternative models, collectively known as exotic compact objects, have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the potential detectability of signatures associated with non-rotating exotic compact objects within the Sgr A* polarized flares dataset, as observed through GRAVITY and future instruments. We examine a total of eight distinct metrics, originating from four different categories of static and spherically symmetric compact objects: Black Holes, Boson stars, Fluid spheres, and Gravastars. Our approach involves utilizing a toy model that orbits the compact object in the equatorial plane. Using simulated astrometric and polarimetric data with present GRAVITY and future GRAVITY+ uncertainties, we fit the datasets across all metrics examined. We evaluated the detectability of the metric for each dataset based on the resulting $\chi^2_\mathrm{red}$ and BIC-based Bayes factors. Plunge-through images of ECOs affect polarization and astrometry. With GRAVITY's present uncertainties, none of the metric model is discernible. GRAVITY+'s improved sensitivity allows detection of some exotic compact object models. However, enhancing the astrophysical complexity of the hot spot model diminishes these outcomes. Presently, GRAVITY's uncertainties do not allow us to detect exotic compact object metric. With GRAVITY+'s enhanced sensitivity, we can expect to uncover additional exotic compact object models and use Sgr A* as a laboratory for fundamental physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The pulsar wind nebula around B1853+01 in X-rays</a><span class="id">[2507.13278]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on the results of a comprehensive analysis of X-ray observations with \textit{Chandra}, \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR B1853+01, located inside the W44 supernova remnant (SNR). Previous X-ray observations unveiled the presence of a fast-moving pulsar, PSR B1853+01, at the southern edge of the W44 thermal X-ray emission region, as well as an elongated tail structure trailing the pulsar. Our analysis reveals, in addition, an “outflow” feature ahead of the pulsar extending for about 1\arcmin ($\sim$1.0 pc at a distance of 3.2 kpc). At larger scales, the entire PWN seems to be surrounded by a faint, diffuse X-ray emission structure. The southern part of this structure displays the same unusual morphology as the “outflow” feature and extends along $\sim$6\arcmin ($\sim$5 pc) in the direction of the pulsar proper motion. In this report, a spatially-resolved spectral analysis for different extended regions around PSR B1853+01 is carried out. For an updated value of the column density of $0.65_{-0.42}^{+0.46} \times 10^{22} ~\textrm{cm}^{-2}$, a power-law fit to the “outflow” region yields a spectral index $\Gamma \approx 1.24_{-0.24}^{+0.23}$, which is significantly harder than that of the pulsar ($\Gamma \approx 1.87_{-0.43}^{+0.48}$) and the pulsar tail ($\Gamma \approx 2.01_{-0.38}^{+0.39}$). We argue that both the “outflow” structure and the surrounding halo-like X-ray emission might be produced by high-energy particles escaping the PWN around PSR B1853+01, a scenario recently suggested also for other bow-shock PWNe with jet-like structures and/or TeV halos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10980" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Interpolation Constraint in the RV Analysis of M-Dwarfs Using Empirical Templates</a><span class="id">[2508.10980]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Precise radial velocity (pRV) measurements of M dwarfs in the near-infrared (NIR) rely on empirical templates due to the lack of accurate stellar spectral models in this regime. Templates are assumed to approximate the true spectrum when constructed from many observations or in the high signal-to-noise limit. We develop a numerical simulation that generates SPIRou-like pRV observations from PHOENIX spectra, constructs empirical templates, and estimates radial velocities. This simulation solely considers photon noise and evaluates when empirical templates remain reliable for pRV analysis. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized noise source in templates created from stacking registered observations, establishing a noise floor for such template-based pRV measurements. We find that these templates inherently include distortions in stellar line shapes due to imperfect interpolation at the detector's sampling resolution. The magnitude of this interpolation error depends on sampling resolution and RV content. Consequently, for stars with higher RV content, such as cooler M-dwarfs, interpolation noise has a larger relative impact, making their performance comparable to hotter M-dwarfs when using detectors with low sampling. For a typical M4V star, SPIRou's spectral and sampling resolution imposes an RV uncertainty floor of 0.5-0.8 m/s, independent of the star's magnitude or the telescope's aperture. These findings reveal a limitation of template-based pRV methods, underscoring the need for improved spectral modeling and better-than-Nyquist detector sampling to reach the next level of RV precision.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The stability of propagating plane inertial waves in rotating fluids</a><span class="id">[2509.21430]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inertial waves transport energy and momentum in rotating fluids and are a major contributor to mixing and tidal dissipation in Earth's oceans, gaseous planets, and stellar interiors. However, their stability and breakdown mechanisms are not fully understood. We examine the linear stability and nonlinear breakdown of finite-amplitude propagating plane inertial waves using Floquet theory and direct numerical simulations. The Floquet analysis generalizes previous studies as it is valid for arbitrary perturbation wavelengths and primary wave amplitudes. We find that the wavenumber orientation of the most unstable perturbations depends strongly on the wave frequency and weakly on the wave amplitude. The most unstable perturbations have wavelengths that are small relative to the primary wave wavelength for low wave amplitudes, but become comparable for large wave amplitudes. We then use direct numerical simulations to follow the nonlinear breakdown of the wave and examine how the wave energy is either dissipated in a forward cascade or accumulated into long-lived geostrophic modes. Simulations reveal that the conversion efficiency into geostrophic modes increases with increasing wave amplitude, as expected for pumping of geostrophic modes by nearly-resonant triadic interactions. We also find that the conversion efficiency increases with decreasing primary wave frequency, which may be due to the more efficient coupling of quasi-2D waves to geostrophic modes. These results on the stability and breakdown of single plane inertial waves provides additional foundation for understanding the role of inertial waves in rotating turbulence, transport properties of inertial wave beams, and inertial wave propagation in more complex environments such as those with magnetic fields or shear flows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Prediction from the joint observation of MeerKAT and CSST at $z$ = 0.4 $\sim$ 1.2</a><span class="id">[2509.23343]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cross-correlating neutral hydrogen (HI) 21cm intensity mapping with galaxy surveys provides an effective probe of astrophysical and cosmological information.

Utilizing Jiutian-1G cosmological simulation, we simulate the observational data of MeerKAT and CSST with survey areas from $\sim1600$ to $600$ deg$^2$ at $z=0.5$, 0.7, and 1. The effects of beam pattern, polarization leakage, and different foregrounds in the MeerKAT HI intensity mapping are considered in the simulation. After employing foreground removal with the principal component analysis (PCA) method and performing signal compensation, we derive the cross-power spectra of MeerKAT and CSST. We perform the joint constraint using the CSST galaxy auto-power spectra and MeerKAT-CSST cross-power spectra with the least-squares fitting method. The constraint results show that, in the simulated survey area, the relative accuracy can achieve $6\%\sim 8\%$ for the parameter products $\Omega_{\rm HI}b_{\rm HI}b_{g}r_{\mathrm{HI},g}$ and $\Omega_{\rm HI}b_{\rm HI}r_{\mathrm{HI},g}$ at the three redshifts, which is $3\sim4$ times smaller than the current result.

The basic mechanism by which solar prominences acquire these common structures during their evolution, however, remains an unresolved question. For the first time, our three-dimensional magneto-frictional simulation, driven by supergranular motions, self-consistently replicates the commonly observed multi-arch bridge morphology and its characteristic structures of solar quiescent prominences in a magnetic flux rope. In comparison with traditional views, our simulations demonstrate that the spine, feet, and voids (bubbles) are inherent prominence structures spontaneously forming as the flux rope evolves to a mature state. The voids mainly consist of legs of sheared magnetic loops caused by unbalanced supergranular flows, and prominence feet settle at the bottom of helical field lines piled up from the photosphere to the spine. Similarities between the simulated prominences and observed real prominences by the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer, the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, and NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory suggest the high validity of our model. This work corroborates the pivotal role of photospheric supergranulation as a helicity injection source in the formation and shaping of quiescent prominence structures within the solar atmosphere, thereby paving a new avenue for future investigations into their fine dynamics and stability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accurate cosmological emulator for the probability distribution function of gravitational lensing of point sources</a><span class="id">[2512.01607]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop an accurate and computationally efficient emulator to model the gravitational lensing magnification probability distribution function (PDF), enabling robust cosmological inference of point sources such as supernovae and gravitational-wave observations.

We permit the photon direction to be continuous (as opposed to constraining the analysis to discrete ordinates). The result is a drift-diffusion equation in the lab frame for comoving radiation energy density, with an adiabatic term that matches the standard semi-relativistic diffusion equation.

The absence of TeV gamma-rays from NGC1068 indicates neutrino production in a compact opaque region of gamma-rays. The vicinity of the supermassive black hole, such as the disk-corona, is an ideal region, where the high radiation density leads to efficient neutrino production and gamma-ray attenuation. Disk-corona models predict that the neutrino emission from AGNs correlates with X-ray emission, which traces the coronal activity. In this paper, we assess whether diffuse TeV neutrinos can originate from X-ray-emitting AGNs with Monte Carlo simulations, considering the predicted performance of future neutrino telescopes. We test this hypothesis by searching for spatial correlations between the X-ray AGN population and high-energy neutrinos, assuming that the neutrino flux scales with the AGN X-ray flux. Based on detailed Monte Carlo simulations, we find that an AGN origin of diffuse neutrinos can be tested at a significance of about $3\sigma$ with five years of IceCube-Gen2 observations. With improved angular resolution and sensitivity, a 30km$^{3}$-scale underwater neutrino telescope (such as the High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope) is expected to reach a significance of about $8\sigma$ with one year of exposure. The detection significance decreases if AGNs contribute partially to the total astrophysical neutrino flux. Our results highlight the critical role of angular resolution in diagnosing the AGN origin of diffuse TeV neutrinos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05435" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cosmic-ray Knee as a Local Signature of Nearby PeVatrons</a><span class="id">[2601.05435]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A &quot;knee&quot; in the cosmic-ray spectrum, characterized by a sudden steepening of the spectral shape at $\sim 4$ PeV, may be interpreted either as a global feature of Galactic cosmic rays or as a local signature.

The traditional disturbing function expansion in celestial mechanics shows that, at low eccentricities, $p$:$p-q$ MMRs exhibit a clear hierarchy of strengths, scaling as $e^q$, where $q$ is the order of the resonance. This explains why first-order MMRs (e.g., 3:2 and 4:3) are important, while the infinite number of higher order integer ratios are not. However, this relationship derived from a technical perturbation series expansion provides little physical intuition. In this paper, we provide a simple physical explanation of this result for closely spaced orbits. In this limit, interplanetary interactions are negligible except during close encounters at conjunction, where the planets impart a gravitational &quot;kick&quot; to each other's mean motion. We show that while first-order MMRs involve a single conjunction before the configuration repeats, higher order MMRs involve multiple conjunctions per cycle, whose effects cancel out more precisely the higher the order of the resonance.

Furthermore, the ratio of these two equivalent widths may also vary, with a 7% probability of being constant. Between 2000 and 2025, both Mg and Ca have experienced decreases in accretion rates, of approximately 20 and 60%, respectively, but with individual variation during the interim. These metal abundance decreases are the first empirical corroboration of diffusion theory in white dwarfs, which predict sinking timescales on the order of days for this star. However, the persistent atmospheric metals require a more gradual, circumstellar process, where one possibility is viscous spreading in an ionized disk of metals, consistent with $\alpha\approx0.1$ within that formalism. The combination of optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope detects all the major rock-forming elements (O, Mg, Si, Fe), and demonstrates that Fe dominates the accreted material by mass, and that it is delivered mostly as pure metal from within a differentiated parent body. This inference is consistent with the possibility that chemically-segregated accretion may result from a combination of planetary assembly, fragmentation, disk evolution, and be observed on relatively short timescales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06407" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Hole signatures from femtolensing and spectral fringe of Gamma Ray Bursts</a><span class="id">[2602.06407]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Femtolensing of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are vastly studied to constrain the primordial black hole (PBHs) lighter than $10^{-13}$ solar mass and may close the window for PBH dark matter.

Prominently, the Iax subclass are less energetic and remarkably diverse, raising questions about their progenitor systems. While no progenitor system of a normal SN Ia has ever been detected, a luminous blue star was identified in pre-explosion images of the site of the bright SN Iax SN 2012Z, suggested to be a helium giant companion star acting as a mass donor to a WD SN progenitor. This is in line with models of weak mass accretion of a WD from a binary companion, producing an explosion that does not fully disrupt the star. However, these models fail to explain the properties of the faintest Type Iax explosions, suggesting either they originate from other WD binary systems, or even from massive progenitor stars. Here, we present the faint SN Iax SN 2024vjm - possibly the faintest supernova observed to date. Using a deep pre-explosion image taken by the recently launched Euclid space mission, we show that its progenitor system must be fainter than the helium giant SN Iax progenitor candidate of SN 2012Z, as well as that of the luminous red companion or remnant of the faint SN 2008ha, and may require a subdwarf helium star as a mass donor. The deep image also provides strong arguments against a massive star origin for this faint supernova. Our observations argue that SN 2024vjm is a WD explosion, but we find that remarkably faint SNe Iax fade more slowly than bright ones, i.e., they evolve in an opposite manner from the famous Phillips relation that makes regular SNe Ia cosmological candles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Continuous Gravitational Waves from Supersoft X-ray Sources: Promising Targets for deci-Hz Detectors</a><span class="id">[2602.09124]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) host white dwarfs (WDs) accreting at rates that sustain steady nuclear burning, driving rapid mass growth, radial contraction, and magnetic field amplification. Angular-momentum transfer from the accretion disk naturally spins up the WD, while the amplified internal magnetic field induces a non-axisymmetric deformation in presence of a misaligned rotation. Such WDs emits continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). We model the coupled evolutions of stellar mass, spin, and magnetic structure in accreting WDs in SSSs with MESA, and compute the resulting quadrupolar deformation with the Einstein-Maxwell solver XNS. We show that WDs in SSSs, particularly near the end of thermal timescale mass transfer and close to the Chandrasekhar mass limit, produce CGWs predominantly in the deci-Hz band accessible to planned detectors such as DECIGO, BBO, Deci-Hz, ALIA, and LGWA, and are distinguishable from other Galactic CGW sources such as AM CVn systems, detached double WDs, and isolated WDs. Well studied SSSs such as CAL 83 and RX J0019+2156 can be detectable, enabling targeted CGW measurements that directly probe WD's internal magnetic fields and rotation, while blind searches can reveal hundreds of obscured SSSs otherwise missed in soft X-rays and map the hidden population of accreting, rapidly rotating, magnetized WDs in nearby galaxies. A CGW detection from WDs in SSSs could also identify potential pre-explosion Type Ia progenitors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterisation of starspot structure and differential rotation of Kepler-411</a><span class="id">[2602.09224]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Starspots and their movements on stellar surfaces enable investigating the mechanisms of stellar magnetic activity. Information on the spot distribution and differential rotation provide important constraints for the behaviour of stellar magnetic dynamos. We analyse the Kepler photometry of Kepler-411, a known exoplanet host, to determine the distribution and properties of star spots on the stellar surface with two independent and complementary methods: modelling the photometric effect of rotation of spots on the stellar surface and mapping of spots by transiting planets. By constructing a spot model accounting for geometry, differential rotation and spot evolution, we model the spots of the stellar surface giving rise to the observed brightness variations. We also search for evidence for occultations of starspots in high-cadence photometry. Our spot models reproduce the observed photometric variations well and we are able to obtain information on the distribution and movement of spots on the stellar surface. We do not obtain evidence for differential rotation – the rotational profile is consistent with rigid-body rotation with a period of 10.52$\pm$0.34 days. We detect three occultations of spots by planet c. The positions of these spots coincide well with the positions of larger spot structures identified by our modelling of the rotational modulation of the light curve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kilohertz Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Full Spectrum Analyses and High-density Constraints on Neutron Star Matter</a><span class="id">[2507.06293]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We demonstrate Bayesian analyses of the complete gravitational-wave spectrum of binary neutron star mergers events with the next-generation detector Einstein Telescope. Our mock analyses are performed for 20 different signals using the TEOBResumSPA_NRPMw waveform that models gravitational-waves from the inspiral to the postmerger phase. They are employed to validate a pipeline for neutron star's extreme matter constraints with prospective detections and under minimal hypotheses on the equation of state. The proposed analysis stack delivers inferences for the mass-radius curve, the mass dependence of the quadrupolar tidal polarizability parameter, the neutron star's maximum density, the maximum mass and the relative radius, and the pressure-density relation itself. We show that a single event at a signal-to-noise ratio close to the minimum threshold for postmerger detection is sufficient to tightly constrain all the above relations as well as quantities like the maximum mass (maximum density) to precision of ${\sim}6$% (${\sim}10$%) at 90% credibility level. We also revisit inferences of prompt black hole formation with full spectrum signals and find that the latter can be robustly identified, even when the postmerger is not detectable due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. New results on the impact of the initial signal frequency and of the detector configuration (triangular vs. two-L) on the source's parameters estimation are also reported. An improvement of approximately one order of magnitude in the precision of the chirp mass and mass ratio can be achieved by lowering the initial frequency from 20 Hz to 2 Hz. The two-L configuration shows instead significant improvements on the inference of the source declination, due to geographical separation of the two detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Non-Minimal Dark Sectors via the 21 cm Line at Cosmic Dawn</a><span class="id">[2507.10664]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of the hydrogen hyperfine transition through the 21 cm line near the end of the cosmic dark ages provide unique opportunities to probe new physics. In this work, we investigate the potential of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal to constrain metastable particles produced in the early universe that decay at later times, thereby modifying the thermal and ionization history of the intergalactic medium. The study begins by extending previous analyses of decaying dark matter (DM), incorporating back-reaction effects and tightening photon decay constraints down to DM masses as low as 20.4 eV. The focus then shifts to non-minimal dark sectors with multiple interacting components. The analysis covers two key scenarios: a hybrid setup comprising a stable cold DM component alongside a metastable sub-component, and a two-component dark sector of nearly degenerate states with a metastable heavier partner. A general parameterization based on effective mass spectra and fractional densities allows for a model-independent study. The final part presents two explicit realizations: an axion-like particle coupled to photons, and pseudo-Dirac DM interacting via vector portals or electromagnetic dipoles. These scenarios illustrate how 21 cm cosmology can set leading bounds and probe otherwise inaccessible regions of parameter space.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geodesics and Shadows in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Hole Spacetime</a><span class="id">[2507.22494]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we investigate geodesics and black hole shadows in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime.

Approximate analytical expressions for the photon sphere and the innermost stable circular orbit are derived via perturbative expansions in the magnetic field strength. We further explore the black hole shadow using both numerical and analytical methods, examining the effects of the magnetic field, the observer's inclination angle and radial position. Deviations from the standard Kerr shadow are quantified, and a physical interpretation is provided by introducing asymptotic regimes defined relative to the magnetic field strength.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lepton number crossings are insufficient for flavor instabilities</a><span class="id">[2507.22987]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In dense neutrino environments, the mean field of flavor coherence can develop instabilities. A necessary condition is that the flavor lepton number changes sign as a function of energy and/or angle. Whether such a crossing is also sufficient has been a longstanding question. We construct an explicit counterexample: a spectral crossing without accompanying flavor instability, with an even number of crossings being key. This failure is physically understood as Cherenkov-like emission of flavor waves. If flipped-lepton-number neutrinos never dominate among those kinematically allowed to decay, the waves cannot grow.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effect of noise characterization on the detection of mHz stochastic gravitational waves</a><span class="id">[2601.19741]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar timing arrays' hint for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) leverages the expectations of a future detection in the millihertz band, particularly with the LISA space mission. However, finding an SGWB with a single orbiting detector is challenging: It calls for cautious modelling of instrumental noise, which is also mainly stochastic. It was shown that agnostic noise reconstruction methods provide robustness in the detection process. We build on previous work to include more realistic instrumental simulations and additional degrees of freedom in the noise inference model and analyze the impact of LISA's sensitivity to SGWBs. Particularly, we model the two main types of noise sources with separate transfer functions and power spectral density spline fitting. We assess the detectability bounds and their dependence on the flexibility of the noise model and on the prior probability, allowing us to refine previously reported results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Realization of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2 in Nieh-Yan modified teleparallel gravity</a><span class="id">[2602.00506]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations from the DESI Collaboration indicate a preference for quintom dark energy, i.e., its equation of state evolves across the cosmological constant boundary $w=-1$. It is well known that models with single perfect fluid or single scalar field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity develop perturbative instabilities around the crossing, thereby cannot realize the quintom scenario. In this paper, we propose a method to circumvent the instability problem of these models by considering the coupling of dark energy to the Nieh-Yan density within the framework of teleparallel gravity. We show that with this coupling the background evolution is not affected, but the dark energy perturbation is removed from the menu of dynamical degrees of freedom, thus avoiding the inherent difficulties in the old models. Furthermore, the Nieh-Yan coupling causes parity violation in gravitational waves, and this can be considered as a clear prediction of this mechanism.</p></div></details></article></body>
