However, their stability and breakdown mechanisms are not fully understood. We examine the linear stability and nonlinear breakdown of finite-amplitude propagating plane inertial waves using Floquet theory and direct numerical simulations. The Floquet analysis generalizes previous studies as it is valid for arbitrary perturbation wavelengths and primary wave amplitudes. We find that the wavenumber orientation of the most unstable perturbations depends strongly on the wave frequency and weakly on the wave amplitude. The most unstable perturbations have wavelengths that are small relative to the primary wave wavelength for low wave amplitudes, but become comparable for large wave amplitudes. We then use direct numerical simulations to follow the nonlinear breakdown of the wave and examine how the wave energy is either dissipated in a forward cascade or accumulated into long-lived geostrophic modes. Simulations reveal that the conversion efficiency into geostrophic modes increases with increasing wave amplitude, as expected for pumping of geostrophic modes by nearly-resonant triadic interactions. We also find that the conversion efficiency increases with decreasing primary wave frequency, which may be due to the more efficient coupling of quasi-2D waves to geostrophic modes. These results on the stability and breakdown of single plane inertial waves provides additional foundation for understanding the role of inertial waves in rotating turbulence, transport properties of inertial wave beams, and inertial wave propagation in more complex environments such as those with magnetic fields or shear flows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21437" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of multiple dynamical classes in the Kuiper belt via disk dissipation</a><span class="id">[2509.21437]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planetesimal formation likely lasted for millions of years in the Solar nebula, and the cold classicals in the Kuiper belt are suggested to be the direct products of streaming instability. The presence of minor planetary bodies in the outer Solar System and the exo-Kuiper belts provide key constraints to planet formation models. In this work, we connected dust drift and coagulation, planetesimal formation, N-body gravity, pebble accretion, planet migration, planetary core accretion, gap opening, and internal photoevaporation in one modeling framework. We demonstrate that multiple classes of minor planets, or planetesimals, can form during disk dissipation and remain afterwards, including a scattered group, a resonant group and a dynamically cold group. Significant growth by pebble accretion was prevented by both dynamical heating due to the giant planet in the system and rapid dispersal of the disk towards the end of its lifetime. We also conducted a parameter study which showed that this is not a universal case, where the outcome is determined by the competition for dust between planetesimal formation and pebble accretion. Combining this scenario with sequential planet formation, this model provides a promising pathway towards an outer Solar System formation model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21452" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Pathways to the Misalignment of the VHS 1256-1257 System</a><span class="id">[2509.21452]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Circumbinary planets (CBPs) provide a unique window into planet formation and dynamical evolution in complex gravitational environments. Their orbits are shaped not only by the protoplanetary disk but also by the perturbations from two stellar hosts, making them sensitive probes of both early- and late-stage dynamical processes. In this work, we investigate the unusual architecture of the VHS J125601.92-125723.9 system, where a retrograde, nearly polar tertiary orbits an extremely low-mass substellar binary in a hierarchical triple configuration. We find that triple body dynamics can naturally reproduce the observed high eccentricity of the inner binary and the tertiary's near-polar obliquity. However, this configuration alone cannot account for the observed mutual inclination, which is both near-polar and retrograde. This tension suggests two possible formation pathways: either the planet formed in an aligned, protoplanetary disk-like configuration and was later tilted by an additional, undetected fourth companion (below current Gaia limits), or the system formed close to its current state. Stellar flybys, in contrast, are unlikely due to their long timescales. Our results highlight both the explanatory power and the limitations of triple dynamics, and the potential role of hidden companions in shaping extreme planetary architectures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21461" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stochastic analysis of ultra-high energy cosmic ray interactions</a><span class="id">[2509.21461]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Photonuclear interactions between ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) nuclei and surrounding photon fields are key to understanding the connection between the compositions observed at Earth and those emitted from the sources. These interactions can completely disintegrate a nucleus of iron over trajectory lengths of a few and up to hundreds of megaparsecs, depending on the energy of the UHECR. The stochastic nature of these interactions means that it is not possible to describe them deterministically for a single cosmic ray, and an exact formulation of the probability distributions is not yet available. Current approaches describe these interactions using either Monte Carlo simulations or solving ordinary differential equations that neglect stochasticity. Because of the limitations of these approaches, only partial capture of the process is achieved. This paper presents an analytic probabilistic description of UHECR interactions and the resulting nuclear cascades, establishing their connection to Markov jump processes. The fundamental properties of these cascades are presented, as is the computation of the usual quantities of interest, such as the horizon, spectrum, and composition. The benefits of this description are outlined using astrophysical examples related to extragalactic propagation and UHECR sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining GREA, an alternative theory accounting for the present cosmic acceleration</a><span class="id">[2509.21491]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of the Universe's late-time accelerated expansion remains unknown. The General Relativistic Entropic Acceleration (GREA) theory offers a compelling alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, attributing cosmic acceleration to entropy growth associated with cosmic and black hole horizons, without invoking a cosmological constant. We test GREA against the latest DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), multiple Type Ia supernova compilations (Union3, Pantheon$\texttt{+}$, DES-SN5YR), and cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance measurements. While GREA is not nested within $\Lambda$CDM, it achieves a comparable goodness-of-fit, highlighting its potential as a theoretically motivated framework that circumvents some of the fine-tuning issues of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that the best-fit model features a transient phantom crossing at $z \lesssim 2$, with $w_a\equiv \mathrm{d} w(a=1)/\mathrm{d}a \simeq-0.3$, in good agreement with observations. However, its present-day value $w_0\equiv w(z=0)$ is tightly constrained to be $w_0\simeq-1$. Upcoming low-redshift (i.e. $z &lt; 1$) cosmological probes, from both background and perturbations, will offer promising avenues for further exploring the viability of the GREA theory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterizing Temperatures of Flares on the M Dwarf Wolf 359 from Simultaneous Multiband Optical Observations</a><span class="id">[2509.21505]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a flare temperature study of the highly active M dwarf Wolf 359 using simultaneous multiband ($u$, $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$) photometric observations from the Lulin 1-m and 41-cm telescopes. Twelve flares were detected over five nights, with significant brightness increases in the $u$, $g$, and $r$ bands; only three were seen in $i$, and none in $z$. From broadband SED fitting and $g$/$r$ color ratio, we derive an average flare temperature of $5500 \pm 1600$ K, significantly cooler than the canonical 10000 K. We obtained a power-law relation between FWHM flare temperature and energy in the solar-class flare regime and extrapolated it to higher energies, superflare regime. This power-law is consistent with the trends reported for M-dwarf superflares in previous studies, suggesting a common temperature-energy scaling across several orders of magnitude. However, the scatter in the superflare regime increases, indicating that such energetic events may involve more complex physical mechanisms and limiting the applicability of simple blackbody models at the high energy flares. Using our FWHM flare temperature–TRIPOL $g$ energy relation and the reported flare energy frequency distribution of Wolf 359, we evaluated the potential flare contribution to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the habitable zone. We find that typical solar-class giant flares ($E_{\mathrm{fl,bol}} \sim 9\times10^{31}$ erg, $T_{\mathrm{fl,fwhm}} \sim 6800$ K) are {not frequent enough} to sustain Earth-like net primary productivity. Even under the extreme superflare condition ($\sim$$10^{36}$ erg, $\sim$16500 K), flare activity remains far from meeting the PAR threshold.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The EBLM project XVI. Spin-orbit alignment of the low mass eclipsing binary EBLM J0021-16</a><span class="id">[2509.21517]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thousands of tight ($&lt;1$ AU) main sequence binaries have been discovered, but it is uncertain how they formed. There is likely too much angular momentum in a collapsing, fragmenting protostellar cloud to form such binaries in situ, suggesting some post processing. One probe of a binary's dynamical history is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes – its obliquity. The classical method for determining stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, but to less than a dozen stellar binaries. In this paper, we present the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of EBLM J0021-16, a $0.19M_\odot$ M-dwarf eclipsing a $1.05M_\odot$ G-dwarf on a 5.97 day, almost-circular orbit. We combine CORALIE spectroscopy with TESS photometry of primary and secondary eclipses and star spot modulation. We show that the orbital axis is well-aligned with the primary star's spin axis, with a true 3D obliquity of $\psi=4.01\pm0.54^{\circ}$. EBLM J0021-16 becomes one of only a handful of eclipsing binaries where a true obliquity has been measured. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf's mass and radius to a fractional precision better than 1\%. The radius of the M dwarf is inflated by 6\% ($7.4\sigma$) with respect to stellar models, consistent with many other M-dwarfs in the literature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HR6819: a puffed-up stripped star system challenging stable mass transfer theory</a><span class="id">[2509.21521]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>HR6819 is the first system with a puffed-up low mass stripped star and a classical Be star whose nature has been confirmed by optical interferometry. It shows the most extreme mass ratio (15.7 +/- 1.1), the lowest stripped star mass (0.270 +/- 0.056 Msun), and one of the shortest orbital periods (40.3266 +/- 0.0016 days) among similar post-interaction binaries. These properties make HR6819 a unique test case for binary interaction physics, in particular the efficiency of mass transfer onto the Be progenitor required to reach such an extreme mass ratio. We reconstruct the possible evolutionary history of the system with grids of MESA simulations spanning mass transfer efficiencies from fully to fifty percent conservative. We show that stable Roche lobe overflow cannot simultaneously reproduce the observed orbital period and extreme mass ratio: the maximum ratio achievable is  11.5 at  40 days, even in the fully conservative case. Furthermore, the observed luminosities of both components exceed those expected from their model masses; the luminosity of the stripped star would be consistent with a  0.7 Msun mass, over twice its dynamical mass. Our results demonstrate that the post-interaction properties of HR6819 cannot be explained by stable mass transfer under standard assumptions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Combined TESS and Ground-based Study of Transit Timing Variations in HAT-P-16, TOI-1516 and TOI-2046 Systems</a><span class="id">[2509.21551]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new results for the hot Jupiters HAT-P-16b, TOI-1516b, and TOI-2046b, based on photometric observations collected using both space- and ground-based facilities. Ground-based data were collected in the 2020-2024 time span with the 0.6 m telescope (ADYU60) located at the Adiyaman University Application and Research Center (Adiyaman, Türkiye) and the 1.0 m telescope at the Türkiye National Observatory (TUG, Türkiye). Through a combination of fits to our ground-based data, the mid-transit times data from TESS and additional data taken from the literature, we present an updated linear ephemeris for each system. Transit timing variations (TTVs) were analyzed using linear, orbital decay, and apsidal precession models. The resulting BIC($\Delta$BIC) values indicate that the orbital decay model is statistically favored for HAT-P-16b and TOI-1516b, while the constant period model is preferred for TOI-2046b. False alarm probabilities (FAPs) were computed to assess the significance of any periodic signals. TOI-1516b displays a strong TTV signal with a FAP (of 0.0001) well below the 0.01 threshold, suggesting a likely dynamical origin that warrants further investigation. The higher FAP value (0.0055) for HAT-P-16b suggests that the case of a possible presence of an additional body in the system is less convincing. In contrast, the much higher FAP value (0.0196) for TOI-2046b implies that there are no statistically significant TTVs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21588" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limb Asymmetries on WASP-39b: A Multi-GCM Comparison of Chemistry, Clouds, and Hazes</a><span class="id">[2509.21588]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With JWST, observing separate spectra of the morning and evening limbs of hot Jupiters has finally become a reality. The first such observation was reported for WASP-39b, where the evening terminator was observed to have a larger transit radius by about 400 ppm and a stronger 4.3 $\mu$m CO$_2$ feature than the morning terminator. Multiple factors, including temperature differences, photo/thermochemistry, clouds and hazes, could cause such limb asymmetries. To interpret these new limb asymmetry observations, a detailed understanding of how the relevant processes affect morning and evening spectra grounded in forward models is needed. Focusing on WASP-39b, we compare simulations from five different general circulation models (GCMs), including one simulating disequilibrium thermochemistry and one with cloud radiative feedback, to the recent WASP-39b limb asymmetry observations. We also post-process the temperature structures of all simulations with a 2D photochemical model and one simulation with a cloud microphysics model. Although the temperatures predicted by the different models vary considerably, the models are remarkably consistent in their predicted morning–evening temperature differences. Several equilibrium-chemistry simulations predict strong methane features in the morning spectrum, not seen in the observations. When including disequilibrium processes, horizontal transport homogenizes methane, and these methane features disappear. However, even after including photochemistry and clouds, our models still cannot reproduce the observed ${\sim}2000$ ppm asymmetry in the CO$_2$ feature. A combination of factors, such as varying metallicity and unexplored parameters in cloud models, may explain the discrepancy, emphasizing the need for future models integrating cloud microphysics and feedback across a broader parameter space.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visualizing the mass transfer flow in direct-impact accretion</a><span class="id">[2509.21610]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use a variety of visualization techniques to display the interior and surface flows in a double white dwarf binary undergoing direct-impact mass transfer and evolving dynamically to a merger.

These outputs affected magnetospheric environments of early Earth and young rocky exoplanets. The interaction of the fast solar wind with the slow wind produced strong shocks from Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) that provided high dynamic pressure on the magnetospheres of early Venus, Earth, and Mars. Here, we apply the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), coupled with the Rice Convection Model (RCM) to simulate the response of the magnetospheric environments and associated Joule heating deposited in the upper atmosphere of early Earth as it passed through a CIR shock from the young Sun. The model suggests   40% closer dayside magnetopause standoff distance, and higher negative SYMH, Cross Polar Cap Potentials (CPCP), atmospheric Joule heating, Field Aligned Currents (FAC), electron precipitations, and equatorward polar cap expansions, comparable or exceeding those of recent intense and super geomagnetic storms. The magnetic storm produces dawn-dusk asymmetries in the polar cap boundary arising from the stellar magnetic field By. The proton density enhancements during the CIR event are the dominant factor in the overall dynamic pressure for resulting electron precipitation and Joule heating deposited into the Earth's ionosphere. We discuss implications for the magnetospheric states and associated habitability conditions on early Earth and young rocky exoplanets around magnetically active solar-like stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21686" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adaptive Reconstruction of Cluster Halos (ARCH): Integrating Shear and Flexion for Substructure Detection</a><span class="id">[2509.21686]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present ARCH (Adaptive Reconstruction of Cluster Halos), a new gravitational lensing pipeline for cluster mass reconstruction that applies a joint shear-flexion analysis to JWST imaging. Previous approaches have explored joint shear+flexion reconstructions through forward modeling and Bayesian inference frameworks; in contrast, ARCH adopts a staged optimization strategy that incrementally filters and selects candidate halos rather than requiring a global likelihood model or strong priors. This design makes reconstruction computationally tractable and flexible, enabling systematic tests of multiple signal combinations within a unified framework. ARCH employs staged candidate generation, local optimization, filtering, forward selection, and global strength refinement, with a combined fit metric weighted by per-signal uncertainties. Applies to Abell 2744 and El Gordo, the pipeline recovers convergence maps and subcluster masses consistent with published weak+strong lensing results. In Abell 2744 the central core mass within 300$h^{-1}$ kpc is $2.1\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$, while in El Gordo the northwestern and southeastern clumps are recovered at $2.6\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$ and $2.3\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$. Jackknife resampling indicates typical 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of $10^{12}-10^{13} M_\odot h^{-1}$, with the all signal and shear+$\mathcal{F}$ reconstructions providing the most stable results. These results demonstrate that flexion, when anchored by shear, enhances sensitivity to cluster substructure while maintaining stable cluster-scale mass recovery.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21692" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Disk-Originated 329-day Quasi-Periodic Oscillation in the Seyfert 1 Galaxy J1626+5120</a><span class="id">[2509.21692]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Seyfert 1 galaxy J1626+5120 is estimated to host a $10^8 M_{\odot}$ black hole (BH) accreting at Eddington ratio $\dot{m}_{\text{Edd}} \approx 0.043$. Its long-term multi-band light curve data show flicker-like variations, but in a well-sampled $g$-band light curve, we are able to determine a $\simeq 329$ d quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at a $\sim$4.53$\sigma$ significance. Six optical spectra were obtained for the source, three of which were taken by us. The spectra show that the variations were mainly because of flux changes blueward of 4000 Å. We also analyze X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) data obtained with {\it the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift)}, which targeted the source in the past two years. X-ray and UV emissions of the source show variations correlated with optical. Time lags of four UV bands and four optical bands are determined with respect to the X-ray emission, which are consistent with a continuum reprocessing disk model. These properties point out a disk origin for the QPO, likely due to Lense-Thirring (LT) precession of the accretion flow at $\sim$20 gravitational radii of the BH. This QPO could be a key case linking sub-year long QPOs in jets, which have more cases reported, to LT precession.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) III.

There are several mechanisms that can explain the formation of such depressions and they are associated with collapse due to the removal of subsurface material. Possible origins of pit craters include: volcanic processes (collapse of lava tubes, magmatic chambers, intrusion of dikes), karstic dissolution, extensional faulting or volatile processes. Here, we propose that pit craters are stratigraphically on top of the ice-related landforms and present complex relationships with the gullies. The spatial relationship between the pits and these structures, along with the absence of evidence of present or past volcanic activity and the lack of evidence of any extensional faulting allows us to propose that the origin of the pit craters in the study area might be related to some volatile process. We propose here that these particular pit craters at Hale crater, are morphologically similar to Icelandic depressions located in a glacial environment. We conclude that the landforms found in the area are in close relation with glacial or periglacial conditions and pit craters might be formed by sublimation/melting of ground ice.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weakly model-independent determination of total expansion during inflation</a><span class="id">[2509.21850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study systematically the total expansion experienced by a certain perturbation mode during single-field inflation, not resorting to explicit models of inflation or reheating.

Images in both total intensity and fractional polarization are reconstructed using RML method implemented in the eht-imaging library. The electric vector position angles are found to be mostly aligned with the general jet direction, suggesting a predominantly toroidal magnetic field, in agreement with the presence of a helical magnetic field. Ground-space fringes were detected up to a projected baseline length of $\sim 8$G$\lambda$, achieving the angular resolution of around 26$\mu$as. The fine-scale structure of the relativistic jet is found in our study extending to a projected distance of $\sim 180$ parsec from the radio core. However, the filamentary structure reported by previous RadioAstron observations of 2014 is not detected in our current study.

The optically thick core is observed with a brightness temperature of $ 1.6 \times 10^{12}$ K, consistent with equipartition between the energy densities of the relativistic particles and the magnetic field.

In this paper, we focus on a Kaluza-Klein model with an extra spatial dimension that compactifies at the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) epoch, subject to mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions at fixed points. As a consequence, a set of infrared cutoffs naturally emerges in both the scalar and tensor spectra, leading to observable consequences in the CMB. We examine in detail the possible signatures of such a topology, particularly in relation to the even-odd parity imbalance already reported by the COBE, WMAP and Planck missions in the temperature angular correlations at large scales. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the existing Planck E-mode polarization data, and to the high-precision B-mode polarization measurements expected from the forthcoming LiteBIRD mission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Low-mass companions to nine stars</a><span class="id">[2509.22127]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an independent spectroscopic and radial velocity analysis for nine stars from the Pennsylvania-Toruń Planet Search.

However, because of the signal's weakness, stacking techniques are necessary. We assessed two stacking methods–pair stacking and filament stacking–using the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG simulations. Pair stacking leverages the fact that cosmic filaments serve as the connectors between cosmic web nodes, while filament stacking directly aggregates cosmic filaments identified by galaxy distributions. Our analysis indicates that, although pair stacking is convenient, it faces contamination from massive structures, the signal from filament gets very weak after the contamination is removed. Conversely, HI detection via filament stacking appears more viable. The column density exceeds $10^{17} \,{\rm cm}^{-2}$ even when all halos are masked, and it is nearly 10 times higher than what is achieved with pair stacking. The effectiveness of filament stacking could further increase with a high number density galaxy catalog and better spatial resolution in radio observation intensity mapping. With the advent of new optical and radio data, the future detection of HI filaments looks promising.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Particle Acceleration and Transport in the Large-scale Current Sheet under an Erupting Magnetic Flux Rope</a><span class="id">[2509.22265]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the acceleration and transport of electrons in the highly fine-structured current sheet that develops during magnetic flux rope (MFR) eruptions. Our work combines ultra-resolved MHD simulations of MFR eruption, with test-particle studies performed using the guiding center approximation. Our grid-adaptive, fully three-dimensional, high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations model MFR eruptions that form complex current sheet topologies, serving as background electromagnetic fields for particle acceleration. Within the current sheet, tearing-mode instabilities give rise to mini flux ropes. Electrons become temporarily trapped within these elongated structures, undergoing acceleration and transport processes that significantly differ from those observed in two-dimensional or two-and-a-half-dimensional simulations. Our findings reveal that these fine-scale structures act as efficient particle accelerators, surpassing the acceleration efficiency of single X-line reconnection events, and are capable of energizing electrons to energies exceeding 100 keV. High-energy electrons accelerated in different mini flux ropes follow distinct trajectories due to spatially varying magnetic field connectivity, ultimately precipitating onto opposite sides of flare ribbons. Remarkably, double electron sources at the flare ribbons originate from different small flux rope acceleration regions, rather than from the same reconnecting field line as previously suggested. Distinct small flux ropes possess opposite magnetic helicity to accelerate electrons to source regions with different magnetic polarities, establishing a novel conjugate double source configuration. Furthermore, electrons escaping from the lower regions exhibit a broken power-law energy spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stairway to Axions: the cross-correlation of birefringence and galaxies from NPIPE and Quaia</a><span class="id">[2509.22273]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first measurement of the cross-correlation between anisotropic birefringence and galaxy number counts, utilizing polarization data from Planck NPIPE and the Quaia quasar catalog.

Technologically advanced civilizations may tackle this issue by installing artificial structures – starshades – which can reduce the radiation received by the planet. Starshades, if they exist, are potentially detectable with current or near-future technology. We have simulated phase curve signatures in direct imaging of hypothetical starshades in systems targeted by the upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), which will be tasked with searching for Earth-like exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. The starshade is assumed to be a circular, reflecting surface placed at the inner Lagrange point between the star and the planet. Our results show that the phase curve of a starshade has a distinct shape compared to that of a typical planet. The phase curve signature lies above the expected $1\sigma=10^{-11}$ single-visit precision in contrast ratio of the telescope for 70.8% of the target stars for the expected inner working angle (IWA) of around 60 mas. If the IWA can be reduced to 45 mas, the percentage of stars above the $1\sigma$ limit increases to 96.7%. With a sufficiently small IWA, HWO should be able to detect anomalies in light curves caused by starshades or similar highly-reflective surfaces – which could serve as key indicators for technologically advanced civilizations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22306" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coupled non-canonical scalar field to neutrinos could alleviate the Hubble tension and cross the phantom barrier</a><span class="id">[2509.22306]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study presents an analysis of cosmological parameters, focusing on resolving the Hubble tension and constraining neutrino masses within a coupled quintom model.

The model effectively reduces the Hubble tension, achieving a consistency in $H_0$ measurements of $1.37\sigma$ and $1.24\sigma$ for the CMB + ALL dataset For Planck 2018 and R22 respectively. Additionally, the study refines constraints on the total mass of neutrinos ($\Sigma_{m_{\nu}}$), with a finding of $0.115\,\text{eV}$ for the CMB + ALL dataset. The analysis examines the effective equation of state parameter ($w_{\text{eff}}$), indicating a transition towards a universe dominated by exotic energy forms. The combined datasets refine $w_{\text{eff}}$ to $-1.02\pm0.018$, underscoring the importance of multi-dataset integration in understanding dark energy dynamics. Furthermore, the interaction constant $\beta$ between the quintom scalar field and neutrinos is constrained to $0.65 \pm 0.12$ for the CMB + ALL dataset. The potential parameters $\lambda_{\sigma} = -2.09 \pm 0.082$ and $\lambda_{\phi} = 2.43 \pm 0.12$ are also determined, providing insights into the quintom model's implications for cosmological dynamics.

In the case of Ganymede, the neutral composition is dominated by $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{H_2}$, and $\mathrm{O_2}$. Past observations by Galileo showed that Ganymede hosts an ionosphere and those by Juno revealed the presence of $\mathrm{H_3^+}$, an ion species only stemming from ion-neutral collisions. $\mathrm{H_3^+}$ detection suggests that ions and neutrals might still collide and be the source of new ion species on icy moons. We examine Ganymede's ability to host a more diverse ionosphere in terms of ion composition than previously thought and predict its variety. We upgraded our test-particle code of Ganymede's ionosphere, formerly collisionless, to include ion-neutral collisions in a probabilistic manner. The updated code is applied to three Galileo flybys of Ganymede that were investigated in the absence of chemistry. Both sets of simulations have been compared and the effect of ion-neutral chemistry has been assessed. We show that in the case of an exosphere predominantly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{H_2}$, and $\mathrm{O_2}$, the ionosphere is made not only of their associated cations but also of $\mathrm{H_3^+}$, $\mathrm{H_3O^+}$, and $\mathrm{O_2H^+}$. Simulations reveal that, depending on the location, the contribution of $\mathrm{H_3^+}$ and $\mathrm{H_3O^+}$ to the ion composition may be significant. Strong dayside/nightside and Jovian/anti-Jovian asymmetries in the ion composition are identified. Our findings are key to interpreting Juno and future JUICE ion mass spectrometer datasets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AGN spectral variability across activity states and searches for axion-like particles</a><span class="id">[2509.22344]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axion-like particles (ALPs) are compelling candidates for dark matter and potential portals to new physics beyond the Standard Model. Photons traversing magnetized regions can convert into ALPs, producing characteristic, energy-dependent absorption features in astrophysical spectra. The probability of such conversions depends sensitively on both the photon energy and the properties of the intervening magnetic fields. Most existing searches have focused on individual astrophysical sources, but uncertainties in the structure and strength of cosmic magnetic fields have limited their reach. Recently, we have demonstrated that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through galaxy clusters provide especially promising targets for ALP searches. By stacking multiple AGN-cluster sightlines, one can average over poorly known magnetic field configurations in galaxy clusters and recover a distinctive ALP-induced spectral suppression, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity. In this work, we investigate a possible systematic uncertainty in such analyses: the intrinsic time-variability of AGN spectra. We demonstrate that AGN flux variability is correlated with spectral hardness, and that time-averaging over flaring and quiescent states can potentially mimic the suppression features imprinted by ALP-photon mixing. Our findings imply that the recent constraints remain conservative, and that incorporating detailed spectral variability into stacking analyses can further sharpen the search for axion-like particles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22419" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Choked jets in BSG/RSG as possible sources of high-energy neutrinos</a><span class="id">[2509.22419]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The death of massive stars is accompanied by the formation of central and accreting compact objects and the subsequent launch of relativistic jets.

Unsuccessful jets, also known as choked jets, may still produce radiation at lower frequencies by dissipating the jet energy into a pressurized cocoon. This cocoon expands within the stellar envelope and eventually breaks out as a mildly relativistic outflow. We investigate the plasma physics in the surroundings of massive collapsing stars harboring choked jets via relativistic, non-resistive MHD simulations. As a result, we define the parameter space allowing for jets to remain choked, and we quantify the acceleration rate and efficiency for charged particles in the strong shocks of such astrophysical environments. Preliminary results show that high Mach numbers ($\sim 100$) after 5-10 seconds of constant energy injection characterize the forward shock, possibly allowing for efficient particle acceleration and high-energy neutrino production.

Here we reanalyze the data obtained by a Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) campaign during the 2022 TRS encounter, and find that the TRS may host up to $\sim10^2$ Tunguska-sized objects and up to $\sim10^3$ Chelyabinsk-sized objects, the latter of which agrees the estimate derived from bolide records. This translates to an impact frequency of less than once every 4 million years.

In both general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations as well as simplified models of the black hole magnetosphere, the polarization angle, quantified by the complex observable arg(beta_2), depends strongly and systematically on the black hole spin. This relationship arises from the coupling between spin and the structure of the magnetic field in the emission region, and it can be computed analytically in the force-free limit. To explore this connection further, we develop a semi-analytic inflow framework that solves the time stationary axisymmetric equations of GRMHD in the black hole's equatorial plane; this model can interpolate between the force-free and inertial regimes by varying the magnetization of the inflow. Our model demonstrates how finite inertia modifies the structure of the electromagnetic field and can be used to quantitatively predict the observed polarization pattern. By comparing reduced models, GRMHD simulations, and analytic limits, we show that the observed synchrotron polarization can serve as a robust diagnostic of spin under assumptions about Faraday rotation and the emission geometry. Applied to EHT data, the model disfavors high-spin configurations for both M87* and Sgr A*, highlighting the potential of polarimetric imaging as a probe of both black hole spin and near-horizon plasma physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asymptotics of spherical dynamos exhibiting a small-scale MAC balance</a><span class="id">[2509.21348]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the asymptotic behaviour of numerical dynamo models is critical for extrapolating results to the physical conditions that characterise terrestrial planetary cores. Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrostatic waves in astrophysical Druyvesteyn plasmas: I.

We first improve on the previous forecast by including the impact of CMB component separation and find that, if the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r=0$, we can achieve $\sigma_r\simeq3.6\times10^{-3}$ by combining upcoming experiments, i.e., LiteBIRD, CMB-S4 and the Advanced Simons Observatory. With a more futuristic experiment, we can achieve even tighter constraints on $r$ if improved delensing can be realized. Using a simulated analysis pipeline, we also explore possible biases from higher-order terms in the lensing potential, which were previously not examined in detail. We find that these bias terms are negligible compared to a detectable signal from inflationary gravitational waves. Our simulated results confirm that this new method is capable of obtaining powerful constraints on $r$. The method is immune to Gaussian Galactic foregrounds and has a different response to non-Gaussian Galactic foregrounds than the $B$-mode power spectrum, offering an independent cross-check of $r$ constraints from the standard power spectrum analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21369" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on AvERA Cosmologies from Cosmic Chronometers and Type Ia Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2503.21369]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We constrain AvERA cosmologies in comparison with the flat $\Lambda$CDM model using cosmic chronometer (CC) data and the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia).

For model comparison, we use the Bayesian model evidences and Anderson-Darling tests applied to the normalized residuals to assess consistency with a standard normal distribution. Best-fit parameters are derived within the redshift ranges $z \leq 2$ for CCs and $z \leq 2.3$ for SNe. For the baseline AvERA cosmology, we obtain best-fit values of the Hubble constant of ${H_0=68.32_{-3.27}^{+3.21}~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ from the CC analysis and ${H_0=71.99_{-1.03}^{+1.05}~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ from the SN analysis, each consistent within $1\sigma$ with the corresponding AvERA simulation value of $H(z=0)$. While both the CC and SN datasets yield higher Bayesian evidence for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, they favor the AvERA cosmologies according to the Anderson-Darling test.

If supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are indeed the primary source of this signal, future PTA observations, such as those from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), are expected to simultaneously capture multiple continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) emitted by bright individual SMBH binaries alongside a gravitational wave background (GWB). To address this anticipated scenario in the SKA era, we revisit the F-statistic, a detection method for single source signals in PTA datasets, and introduce a new modeling that accounts for unresolved GWs as a stochastic GWB. Here, we applied this improved F-statistic to the mock datasets that include both CGW and GWB and evaluated how accurately F-statistic can identify the parameters of CGW. As a result, we demonstrate that our approach can successfully improve the estimation of the sky position and the amplitude of CGW, particularly when the GWB is dominant over white noise. This work serves as an initial step toward developing an efficient and robust algorithm based on the F-statistic for future PTA observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power law $α$-Starobinsky inflation</a><span class="id">[2505.16853]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation ($E$-model).

After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically, we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameter $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations.

Unlike previously observed SLSNe II, its light curve suggests an abrupt drop during a solar conjunction between  80 and  180 d after the light-curve peak, possibly analogous to a normal hydrogen-rich supernova (SN). Spectra taken at and before the peak show hydrogen and helium `flash' emission lines attributed to early interaction with a dense confined circumstellar medium (CSM). A well-observed ultraviolet excess appears as these lines disappear, also as a result of CSM interaction. The blackbody photosphere expands roughly at the same velocity throughout the observations, indicating little or no bulk deceleration. This velocity is much higher than what is seen in spectral lines, suggesting asymmetry in the ejecta. The high total radiated energy ($\gtrsim9\times10^{50}$ erg) and aforementioned lack of bulk deceleration in SN 2023gpw are difficult to reconcile with a neutrino-driven SN simply combined with efficient conversion from kinetic energy to emission through interaction. This suggests an additional energy source such as a central engine. While magnetar-powered models qualitatively similar to SN 2023gpw exist, more modeling work is required to determine if they can reproduce the observed properties in combination with early interaction. The required energy might alternatively be provided by accretion onto a black hole created in the collapse of a massive progenitor star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18375" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betel-buddy?

In this paper, we present the results of a far-UV observational campaign using the STIS echelle spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope aimed at detecting spectral signatures of the companion. The four-quadrant tiling pattern and timing of the observations were optimized to isolate the companion, with observations taking place during a period of maximum angular and velocity separation between Betelgeuse and the putative companion. Spectral differencing between quadrants recovers no spectral features at the companion's velocity in excess of the background or Betelgeuse's chromosphere, i.e. a non-detection. Having determined that $\alpha$ Ori B is most likely a Young Stellar Object (YSO) thanks to constraints from a complementary X-ray campaign with the Chandra X-ray Observatory in a companion paper, comparison of our data against canonical spectra from YSOs in the ULLYSES database allows us to confidently exclude masses above $\gtrsim1.5M_\odot$ and companion continuum or line emission in excess of $\approx10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ angstrom$^{-1}$ in the FUV ($\approx1200-1700$ angstroms).

Many of these planetary systems host multiple planets. As we discover more multiplanet systems, notable trends begin to appear in the data. We use kernel density estimation (KDE) to analyze the period ratios of adjacent planet pairs in multiplanet systems in the most recent Kepler, TESS and K2 data, paying particular attention to pairs in first order mean motion resonance (MMR). We compare a recent Kepler catalog with the DR25 data release. We also compare TESS and K2 against this recently released Kepler data. To verify the significance of our findings against selection bias, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of multiplanet systems in the TESS catalog, finding an excess of planet pairs near the 2 (2:1), and 1.5 (3:2) period ratios, both exceeding the 99\% confidence interval. We also find a significant peak at the 2.19 period ratio, which exceeds the 90\% confidence interval. Using a lower limit for period ratios determined by the period of the inner planet proposed in Steffen &amp; Farr (2013), we identify two planet pairs orbiting M dwarf stars in a very tight ratio.

In this paper, we demonstrate that there are small errors introduced by the standard treatment of photon redshift in the OS approximation and provide a simple method to correct these errors. These errors are constant in phase, so this results in a constant absolute reduction in the flux. For PSR J0740+6620, the most rapidly spinning of the pulsars observed by NICER, we estimate the flux errors are less than 1\%, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the uncertainty in the distance, so this does not affect the mass and radius constraints found for this pulsar. The errors for the other pulsars observed by NICER are even smaller. However, this correction should be included when analyzing data for more rapidly rotating X-ray pulsars with spin frequencies near 600 Hz.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05769" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on the diffuse flux of multi-PeV astrophysical neutrinos obtained with the Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector</a><span class="id">[2507.05769]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Various theoretical models predict cosmic neutrinos with multi-PeV energies.

Mock galaxy catalogues were obtained by populating haloes with galaxies using an halo occupation distribution (HOD) model extracted from the Flagship galaxy catalogue provided by Euclid Collaboration. The Geppetto set of 3500 simulated skies was obtained by tiling a 1.2 Gpc/h box to cover a light-cone whose sky footprint is a circle of 30 deg radius, for an area of 2763 deg$^2$ and a minimum halo mass of $1.5\times10^{11}$ Msun/h. The relatively small box size makes this set unfit for measuring very large scales. The EuclidLargeBox set consists of 1000 simulations of 3.38 Gpc/h, with the same mass resolution and a footprint that covers half of the sky, excluding the Milky Way zone of avoidance. From this we produced a set of 1000 EuclidLargeMocks on the 30 deg radius footprint, whose comoving volume is fully contained in the simulation box. We validated the two sets of catalogues by analysing number densities, power spectra, and 2-point correlation functions, showing that the Flagship spectroscopic catalogue is consistent with being one of the realisations of the simulated sets, although we noticed small deviations limited to the quadrupole at k&gt;0.2 h/Mpc.

Newly found companion candidates are being followed up to confirm new planets. Following the detection of a companion candidate around the young ($\sim 15$ Myr) binary star HD 143811, we collected a new observation with SPHERE@VLT (0.95-1.67 $\mu$m) to confirm the presence of the source and to assess its physical bond to the target.

The luminosity of the planet, constrained through the H-band spectrum from GPI, H-band photometry from SPHERE/IRDIS and YJ upper limits from SPHERE/IFS, allows us to place strong constraints on the intrinsic temperature of the planet (T$_{\text{int}} = 1000 \pm 30$K), which corresponds to a mass of $6.1^{+0.7}_{-0.9} ~M_{\text{Jup}}$.

Defining the final survey footprint is critical, as it excludes regions affected by artefacts or suboptimal observing conditions. For galaxy clustering, spatially varying observational systematics, such as seeing, are a leading source of bias. Template maps of contaminants are used to derive spatially dependent corrections, but extreme values may fall outside the applicability range of mitigation methods, compromising correction reliability. The complexity and accuracy of systematics modelling depend on footprint conservativeness, with aggressive masking enabling simpler, robust mitigation. We present a unified approach to define the DES Year 6 joint footprint, integrating observational systematics templates and artefact indicators that degrade mitigation performance. This removes extreme values from an initial seed footprint, leading to the final joint footprint. By evaluating the DES Year 6 lens sample MagLim++ plus plus on this footprint, we enhance the Iterative Systematics Decontamination (ISD) method, detecting non-linear systematic contamination and improving correction accuracy. While the mask's impact on clustering is less significant than systematics decontamination, it remains non-negligible, comparable to statistical uncertainties in certain w(theta) scales and redshift bins. Supporting coherent analyses of galaxy clustering and cosmic shear, the final footprint spans 4031.04 deg2, setting the basis for DES Year 6 1x2pt, 2x2pt, and 3x2pt analyses.

Two out of three XMM-Newton observations conducted after the 2023 outburst confirmed the source to be in a low-luminosity state at a level of $L_{\rm X} \sim 10^{33}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. X-ray pulsations were detected at $\approx$0.277 Hz in both observations with a pulsed fraction exceeding 50%. The power density spectra show no significant low-frequency red noise in both observations, suggesting that the radiation is not driven by accretion. The energy spectra in this state can be described by a single blackbody component, with an emitting area smaller than the typical size of the polar caps during the accretion phase. Based on the timing and spectral properties, we suggest that the propeller effect is active during the quiescent state, resulting in a total quenching of accretion.

In general, the mass feeding rate to the BH is suggested to be super-Eddington initially, and evolves to be sub-Eddington on timescale of years. In this paper, we carry out calculations of the time-dependent evolution of accretion disk in the standard environment of TDE, i.e., injecting matter at the circularization radius of the stellar debris in the form of $\dot M_{\rm inject} \propto t^{-5/3}$. One of the main findings is that when $\dot M_{\rm inject}$ evolves to a value around the Eddington accretion rate, the radiation pressure instability occurs. We test the influence of the model parameters on the light curves, such as the BH mass $M_{\rm BH}$, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and mass-injecting radius $R_{\rm{out}}$, all of which are found to affect the light curves to some extent. In most cases, we find that the light curves oscillate significantly due to the radiation pressure instability. As an exception, when $\alpha$ is small or $R_{\rm{out}}$ is large, we find that the oscillations are completely suppressed. In this case, the light curve drops steeply and then becomes flat in the late-time evolution, which is applied to explaining the observed ultraviolet (UV) light curves of ASASSN-15oi and ASASSN-14ae together with the assumption of a photosphere. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of our time-dependent accretion disk model to explaining multi-band light curves of TDEs in the future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20131" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Search for High-Energy Emission from the Remnant of Supernova 1181</a><span class="id">[2509.20131]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the previous millennium, only five Galactic supernovae were observed and recorded by contemporary astronomers, and their current-day counterparts subsequently identified.

We show that it will be possible to impose robust bounds of order $\delta m^2_3 \lesssim 10^{-12}$ $\text{eV}^2$ on the new mass squared splitting involving the third pseudo-Dirac mass eigenstates (those with the least electron flavor composition) with the future experiment IceCube-Gen2. The derived sensitivity is robust because it only assumes an extragalactic origin for the astrophysical neutrinos and hierarchical pseudo-Dirac mass spectrum. In case the neutrino sources are known in the future, such bounds can potentially improve by up to five orders of magnitude, reaching $\delta m^2_3 \lesssim 10^{-17}$ $\text{eV}^2$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contemporaneous Appearances of Auroral Spiral and Transpolar Arc: Polar UVI Observations and Global MHD Simulations</a><span class="id">[2409.06389]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A local vortex-structured aurora and a large-scale transpolar arc (TPA) were contemporaneously observed by the Polar ultraviolet imager (UVI) when a substorm almost recovered, and the associated interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) BY and BZ polarities were negative and negative-to-positive. The TPA grew along the dawnside auroral oval from the nightside to the dayside, and an auroral spiral and several spots were located azimuthally near the poleward edge of the nightside auroral oval. Both auroras had tailward elongated source regions with scales of  30 RE (spiral) and more than  45 RE (TPA). To examine their magnetospheric/ionospheric field-aligned current (FAC) profiles, we performed global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, using two different types of code: Block-Adaptive-Tree Solar-wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) and improved REProduce Plasma Universe (REPPU). Both MHD simulations reproduced the tailward elongated TPA-associated FAC structures. The spiral-associated FAC intensity was, however, approximately three orders of magnitude weaker than the TPA-associated FAC intensity. Only improved REPPU simulation replicated faint but continuous poleward extending streak-like structures without evident FACs, instead of the auroral spiral. Geomagnetic field measurements showed that the spiral had upward (from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere) FACs, and its appearance might be accompanied by ultra-low-frequency Pc5 waves. Our results suggest that 1) a local-scale spiral might be formed with much weaker magnetotail FACs than global-scale TPA-associated FACs, although the spiral source region is elongated tailward, and 2) a solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system with minimal or no significant substorm effects is required to form the spiral with the weak magnetotail FACs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biased domain walls: faster annihilation, weaker gravitational waves</a><span class="id">[2504.07902]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the evolution of domain wall networks and their phenomenological implications in a model of a real scalar $\chi$, where a $Z_2$-symmetry is slightly broken by a potential bias $V_{bias}$. It is demonstrated that the latter triggers domain wall annihilation considerably earlier than previously thought. Namely, we observe that the scaling relation $t_{ann} \propto 1/V^{2/3}_{bias}$ for the annihilation time $t_{ann}$ fits to the simulation data better than a commonly assumed $t_{ann} \propto 1/V_{bias}$. As a result, the energy density of gravitational waves produced by the network of biased domain walls, for a given tiny $V_{bias}$, is suppressed compared to naive expectations. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is similar to that resulting from unbiased domain walls, but with more power in the close-to-maximum ultraviolet part. In the far ultraviolet region, the spectrum of gravitational waves becomes nearly flat; such a plateau has been recognised earlier in the case of unbiased walls. In our investigation we mainly focus on the symmetry breaking potential $V_{breaking} \propto \chi^3$, and argue that no significant modifications of the domain walls evolution take place if one includes higher powers of $\chi$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Induced Gravitational Waves as Cosmic Tracers of Leptogenesis</a><span class="id">[2504.20135]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We demonstrate that induced gravitational waves (IGWs) can naturally emerge within the framework of thermal leptogenesis models, thereby providing a robust probe for exploring this theory at remarkably high energy scales. To illustrate this principle, we put forth a basic leptogenesis model in which an early matter-dominated phase, tracing the leptogenesis scale, enhances the generation of gravitational waves induced by an early structure formation. Leveraging recent N-body and lattice simulation results for IGW computations in the non-linear regime, we show that it is possible to establish a direct link between the frequency and amplitude of these IGWs and the thermal leptogenesis scale.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freeze-in gravitational waves and dark matter in warm inflation</a><span class="id">[2507.13916]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent study [1] has suggested that warm inflation may be realized with Standard Model gauge interaction alone. Motivated by this framework, we investigate the gravitational wave spectrum and graviton-portal dark matter production through the freeze-in process generated during warm inflation scenarios. We perform a comparative analysis for different dissipation terms, focusing on their distinct gravitational wave signatures in the high-frequency regime. Our findings reveal qualitative and quantitative differences in the spectral behavior, offering a preliminary pathway for exploring inflationary and dark matter models through high-frequency gravitational wave signals.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic Monopole Molecules</a><span class="id">[2509.17779]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We construct a variety of bound states of Dirac magnetic monopoles in product $U(1)$ gauge theories that make up a Dirac magnetic monopole with unit magnetic charge under the unbroken $U(1)$ gauge group. The size of the bound states is determined by the balance between the repulsive magnetic Coulomb force of the unbroken $U(1)$ gauge group and the attractive force from the tension of the magnetic flux tubes of the broken $U(1)$ gauge groups. These bound states are extensions of the configuration first studied in arXiv:1608.06951 . We dub this type of configurations “Magnetic Monopole Molecules” (MMMs). Besides some illustrative examples of MMMs made of a small number of constituent Dirac magnetic monopoles, a method to combine smaller MMMs to construct larger MMMs is presented. Implications for the weak gravity conjecture are also discussed.</p></div></details></article></body>
