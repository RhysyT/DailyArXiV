The Formation and Evolution of Extended HI Galactic Disks and Warps with a Dynamic CGM</a><span class="id">[2511.00158]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Atomic Hydrogen (HI) is an important component of gas in and around galaxies and forms extended disk-like structures well beyond the extent of starlight. Here we investigate the properties and evolution of extended HI disks that emerge in six Milky Way-mass galaxies using cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE) suite. We focus on the formation, evolution, and morphology of extended gaseous disks that emerge in all six systems. We find that median HI column densities drop sharply at the disk edge, with mean column densities outside the disk dominated by dense (NHI 10^19 cm-2), clumpy structures. All systems have significant misaligned features (warps or polar rings) at some point in their evolution; however, their frequencies, lifetimes, and origins vary significantly. We find that the morphology of the FOGGIE disks are correlated with properties of their Circumgalactic Medium (CGM). We classify these systems into two broad categories: those with CGMs that are Less Populated with HI and those with CGMs that are More Populated with HI. Both categories kinematically settle by z=0, but the Less Populated systems all form thin disks by z=0, while the More Populated systems do not. This classification is independent of disk and halo mass, implying the formation of a thin disk is influenced by local environmental factors. Our results indicate a connection between CGM content and disk formation that is not yet fully understood. A second paper investigates observational aspects of these structures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE).

On the Observability of Extended HI Disks and Warps</a><span class="id">[2511.00159]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Atomic Hydrogen (HI) is a useful tracer of gas in and around galaxies, and can be found in extended disk-like structures well beyond a system's optical extent. Here we investigate the properties of extended HI disks that emerge in six Milky Way-mass galaxies using cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE) suite. This paper focuses on the observability of the extended HI in these systems. We find overall agreement with observational constraints on the HI size-mass relation. To facilitate direct comparisons with observations, we present synthetic HI 21-cm emission cubes. By spatially filtering our synthetic cubes to mimic the absence of short baselines in interferometric maps, we find that such observations can miss  10-40% of diffuse emission, which preferentially removes low column density, low velocity dispersion gas outside the central disk. The amount of observable material depends strongly on its distribution and the system's observed orientation, preventing the formulation of a simple correction factor. Therefore, to fully characterize extended disks, their circumgalactic mediums, and the interfaces between them, dual convolutions including data from interferometers and large single-dish radio telescopes are required.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00199" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Holes at high and low metallicity</a><span class="id">[2511.00199]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>At the end of their lives the most massive stars collapse into black holes (BHs). The detection of an 85 $M_{\odot}$ BH from GW 190521 appeared to challenge the upper-mass limit imposed by pair-instability (PI). Using systematic MESA calculations with new mass-loss implementations, we show that 100 $M_{\odot}$ stars at metallicities below 0.1 $Z_{\odot}$ can evolve into blue supergiant progenitors with cores small enough to avoid PI, yet with limited envelope loss, yielding remnants within the second mass gap. The key ingredients involve (i) a proper consideration of internal mixing and (ii) physically motivated stellar winds. Our modelling provides a robust pathway that roughly doubles the maximum BH mass permitted by PI theory and establish a physically-consistent framework to explore the upper BH mass limit versus metallicity. For rapid rotation ($\ge$50\% of critical), the upper BH mass comes down to $\simeq$35 $M_{\odot}$, matching the LIGO/Virgo BH mass pile-up.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seeds to success: growing heavy black holes in dense star clusters</a><span class="id">[2511.00200]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The observational dearth of black holes (BHs) with masses between $\sim$100 and 100,000 $M_\odot$ raises questions about the nature of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Proposed formation channels for IMBHs include runaway stellar collisions and repeated binary BH (BBH) mergers driven by dynamical interactions in stellar clusters, but the formation efficiency of these processes and the associated IMBH occupation fraction are largely unconstrained. In this work, we study IMBH formation via both mechanisms in young, globular, and nuclear star clusters. We carry out a comprehensive investigation of IMBH formation efficiency by exploring the impact of different seeding models and star cluster formation histories. We employ a new version of the B-POP population synthesis code, able to model several seeding mechanisms as well as hierarchical BBH mergers. We quantify the efficiency of IMBH production across different cluster families, and estimate the fraction of BBH mergers involving an IMBH primary. Comparison with low-redshift IMBH candidates suggests that, depending on the seeding mechanism, stellar collisions can play a pivotal role in explaining potential IMBHs in local globular clusters. Our simulations highlight stellar collisions as the primary IMBH formation channel across a wide range of cluster types. They further suggest that wandering IMBHs may populate Milky Way-like galaxies and that correlations between cluster and IMBH masses can help distinguish the origins of Galactic globular clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing Multiphase Structure in the Circumgalactic Medium: Insights from Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence Simulations</a><span class="id">[2511.00229]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is the diffuse gas surrounding a galaxy's halo, and it plays a vital role in the galactic baryon cycle. However, its mass distribution across the virial phase and the cooler, denser atomic phase, remains uncertain. To investigate this, we perform high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations of 0.125–8 kpc-scale representative patches of the CGM, with parameters informed by quasar absorption line observations. Our simulations resolve the cooling length (the minimum across all temperatures of $c_s t_{\rm cool}$, where $c_s$ is the sound speed and $t_{\rm cool}$ is the cooling time in isobaric conditions), allowing us to track the evolution of cold gas more accurately. We find that low-density CGM gas ($3\times10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$) cannot sustain cold gas below $10^4$ K for long, due to a large value of the ratio between the cooling to mixing time ($t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm mix}$). In contrast, higher-density environments ($3\times10^{-3}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$) reach a turbulent multiphase steady state, with up to $50\%$ of the mass in the cold phase, occupying only about $1\%$ of the volume. To connect with large-volume cosmological simulations and small ${\rm pc}$-scale idealized simulations, we explore different box sizes (0.125–8 kpc) and identify a key scaling relation: simulations with similar $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm mix}$ exhibit comparable cold gas mass fractions and lifetimes. Importantly, we find that simply sub-sampling (reducing box-size) a small region from a large-volume simulation while maintaining a constant turbulent energy density injection rate from larger to smaller scales artificially shortens $t_\mathrm{mix}$, leading to inaccurate predictions for cold gas survival. This means that cold gas at small $\lesssim 10$ kpc scales arises in relatively dense, quiescent regions of the CGM rather than the turbulent ones undergoing cascade from large scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chemodynamic evidence of pristine gas accretion in the void galaxy VGS 12</a><span class="id">[2511.00235]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accretion of metal-poor gas is expected to be an important channel of gas replenishment in galaxy evolution studies. However, observational evidence of this process is still relatively scarce. The unusual polar disk galaxy VGS 12 was found in the Void Galaxy Survey. It appears to be isolated and resides in the cosmological wall between two large voids. The suggested formation scenario for this peculiar system is accretion of metal-poor gas from the void interior. We present the data on the gas-phase chemical abundance of VGS 12 obtained with the Russian 6m telescope BTA. We complement our analysis with HI data obtained with VLA and the data on the kinematics of the ionized gas. VGS 12 appears to be a strong outlier from the &quot;metallicity - luminosity&quot; relation, with gas oxygen abundance  0.7dex lower than expected for its luminosity. The nitrogen abundance, on the other hand, is higher than what is typically observed in galaxies with similar metallicity, but is consistent with the metallicity expected given its luminosity. Such behavior is what is expected in the case of metal-poor gas accretion. The HI reveals clear morphological and kinematical asymmetry between the northern and southern parts of the disk, which are likely related to its unsettled state due to the recent accretion event. The kinematics of the ionized gas seen in Halpha reveal prolate rotation and follow closely the rotation of the HI disk, so we suggest this is accreted HI gas ionized by the stars in the central region of the galaxy. Together, our findings provide strong, multiwavelength evidence of ongoing cold gas accretion in a galaxy caught in the act of growing from the cosmic web. This is one of the very few individual galaxies where a convincing case can be made for such a process, and demonstrates the potential for cold accretion to contribute to galaxy growth even in the low-redshift universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Milky Way mass model for isolated simulations</a><span class="id">[2511.00240]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents an equilibrium model of a Milky Way-like spiral galaxy that supports open, mostly 2- and 3-arm spiral patterns but does not form a bar.

To overcome this limitation, we study a combined sample of 127 MW analogs from the IllustrisTNG-50 cosmological simulation with observations of 11 nearby galaxies. Using both spatial and spectral high-resolution data from VLA and GMRT telescopes, we employ the 3D-Barolo algorithm to derive precise kinematic maps and rotation curves (RCs). To perform a careful analysis of the stellar component, we use Spitzer mid-IR imaging at 3.6 and 4.5um. We decompose the RCs into their different mass components, enabling the construction of a DM radial profile for each galaxy. By using a MCMC-based routine, we account for the DM contribution for the observed RCs. For our simulated sample, we obtain DM radial profiles directly from the TNG50 database. We probe for the universality of the DM profiles by deriving and comparing the equivalent local DM density (LDMD), a critical parameter linked to DM direct detection experiments on Earth. We calculate the DM density at the corresponding location of the Sun in each of the analogs. Our analysis yields a final LDMD range of 0.17-0.46 GeV cm^-3. Finally, by leveraging our mass estimates (M200}, Mgas and Mstar), we contextualize our findings with the efficiency of star formation in MW analogs and with the diversity of galaxies inhabiting similar halo masses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00253" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite Community Science Book</a><span class="id">[2511.00253]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The AXIS Community Science Book represents the collective effort of more than 500 scientists worldwide to define the transformative science enabled by the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a next-generation X-ray mission selected by NASA's Astrophysics Probe Program for Phase A study. AXIS will advance the legacy of high-angular-resolution X-ray astronomy with  1.5” imaging over a wide 24' field of view and an order of magnitude greater collecting area than Chandra in the 0.3-12 keV band. Combining sharp imaging, high throughput, and rapid response capabilities, AXIS will open new windows on virtually every aspect of modern astrophysics, exploring the birth and growth of supermassive black holes, the feedback processes that shape galaxies, the life cycles of stars and exoplanet environments, and the nature of compact stellar remnants, supernova remnants, and explosive transients. This book compiles over 140 community-contributed science cases developed by five Science Working Groups focused on AGN and supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and feedback, compact objects and supernova remnants, stellar physics and exoplanets, and time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these studies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray exploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the 2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation gravitational-wave and neutrino networks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Properties of Carbon-rich AGB Stars in the LMC and the Milky Way</a><span class="id">[2511.00397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comparative study of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 7347 stars) and the Milky Way (7163 stars) using infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), spectral energy distributions (SEDs), two-color diagrams (2CDs), and variability data. Observed SEDs are compared with theoretical models to characterize the central stars and their circumstellar dust envelopes and to estimate distances. For the LMC, a set of best-fitting CAGB models is derived by fitting observed SEDs with radiative transfer models, utilizing the galaxy's well-established distance. For Galactic CAGB stars, where Gaia DR3 parallaxes are uncertain, we estimate distances by fitting observed SEDs with the CAGB models validated against LMC stars, and for Mira variables, from the period-magnitude relation calibrated with LMC Miras. A comparison of these approaches demonstrates that SED-based distances are both reliable and practical for a large sample of Galactic CAGB stars. We find that CAGB stars in both galaxies show broadly similar infrared properties, although the LMC sample lacks stars with extremely thick dust envelopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling dust dynamics in OpenGadget3 - I. SPH implementation of the One-Fluid model</a><span class="id">[2511.00631]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dust dynamics plays a critical role in astrophysical processes and has been modeled in hydrodynamical simulations using various approaches. Among particle-based methods like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), the One-Fluid model has proven to be highly effective for simulating gas-dust mixtures. This study presents the implementation of the One-Fluid model in OpenGadget3, introducing improvements to the original formulation. These enhancements include time-dependent artificial viscosity and conductivity, as well as a novel treatment of dust diffusion using a pressure-like term. The improved model is tested using a suite of dust dynamics benchmark problems: DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK, with the latter extended to multidimensional scenarios, as well as a dusty Sedov-Taylor blast wave. Additional tests include simulations of Cold Keplerian Disks, dusty protoplanetary disks, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to evaluate the model's robustness in more complex flows. The implementation successfully passes all standard benchmark tests. It demonstrates stability and accuracy in both simple and complex simulations. The new diffusion term improves the handling of flows with large dust-to-gas ratios and low drag coefficients, although limitations of the One-Fluid model in these regimes remain. The enhanced One-Fluid model is a reliable and robust tool for simulating dust dynamics in OpenGadget3. While it retains some limitations inherent to the original formulation, the introduced improvements expand its applicability and address some challenges in gas-dust dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00661" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonthermal Pressures: Key to Energy Balance and Structure Formation Near Sgr A* in the Milky Way</a><span class="id">[2511.00661]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The circumnuclear region of the Galactic Center offers a unique laboratory to study energy balance and structure formation around Sgr A$\star$. This work investigates thermal and nonthermal processes within 7 pc distance from Sgr A$\star$. Using MeerKAT 1.3 GHz radio continuum data and ALMA H40 radio recombination line emission from the ACES survey, we separate free-free and synchrotron components at $\sim$0.2 pc resolution. With a thermal fraction of $\simeq$13%, the 1.3 GHz emission shows tight correlations with the Herschel PACS infrared data. The correlation between the equipartition magnetic field and molecular gas traced by JCMT $^{12}$CO (J=3$\rightarrow$2) observations reveals a balance between the magnetic field, cosmic rays, and molecular gas pressures south of the circumnuclear disk on $\sim$0.7 pc scales. Unlike the magnetic field and ionized gas, the molecular gas density declines in the cavity (R$\leq$2 pc) toward the center, likely due to feedback from Sgr A$\star$. We find that nonthermal pressure from turbulent gas nearly balances magnetic and cosmic ray pressures and exceeds thermal pressure by two orders of magnitude. The medium surrounding Sgr A$\star$ is filled by a low-$\beta$ (thermal-to-magnetic energy), supersonic plasma, with an Alfvén Mach number $\simeq$ 4 (assuming equipartition). Analysis of the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio suggests that the circumnuclear region is mostly subcritical and, therefore, the magnetic field can help stabilize gas clouds against gravitational collapse.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00705" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The JWST EXCELS Survey: gas-phase metallicity evolution at 2 &lt; z &lt; 8</a><span class="id">[2511.00705]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an analysis of the gas-phase mass-metallicity relationship (MZR) and fundamental metallicity relationship (FMR) for $65$ star-forming galaxies at $2 &lt; z &lt; 8$ from the JWST/EXCELS survey. We calculate gas-phase metallicities (12 + log(O/H)) using strong-line calibrations explicitly tested against the EXCELS sample, and report direct-method metallicities for $25$ galaxies. Our sample spans $8.1&lt;\log(\rm M_\star/M_\odot)&lt;10.3$ in stellar mass and $0&lt;\log(\rm SFR/M_\odot \, yr^{-1})&lt;2$ in star-formation rate, consistent with typical main-sequence star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. We find a clear MZR at both $2&lt;z&lt;4$ ($\langle z \rangle = 3.2$) and $4&lt;z&lt;8$ ($\langle z \rangle = 5.5$), with consistent slopes and mild evolution in normalization of $\simeq 0.1 \, \mathrm{dex}$, matching trends from simulations and recent observations. Our results demonstrate rapid gas-phase enrichment in the early Universe, with galaxies at fixed mass reaching $\simeq 50$ per cent of their present-day metallicity by $z \simeq 3$ (within the first $\simeq 15$ per cent of cosmic time). We find tentative evidence for SFR-dependence in the MZR scatter, though the results remain inconclusive and highlight the need for larger high-redshift samples. Comparison with locally derived FMRs reveals a clear offset consistent with other $z &gt; 3$ studies. We discuss potential drivers of this offset, noting that high-redshift samples have significantly different physical properties compared to local samples used to define the $z=0$ FMR. Our results confirm that low-mass, high specific star-formation rate galaxies common at high redshift are inconsistent with the equilibrium conditions underlying the local FMR, and highlight the rapid chemical enrichment at early cosmic epochs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00720" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Flocculent Structure of the Inner Milky Way Disk</a><span class="id">[2511.00720]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of HI published in 1957 by Westerhout and Schmidt were presented as showing a global face-on view of spiral structure in the Milky Way. Since then many studies have attempted to improve on the early map, perhaps presupposing our Galaxy to be characterized by a Grand-design pattern of prominent spiral arms. We consider here two approaches to explore the nature of spiral structure of the inner Milky Way disk using the HI4PI survey. The first is to search for shallow shoulders in the high-velocity wings of HI data along the Galactic equatorial disk of the inner Milky Way that would be expected if the lines of sight swept across interarm regions of low HI density. The second is to look for broad dips in the integrated HI brightness temperature over the high-velocity wings, pertaining to gas near the subcentral region, that would be expected for the interarm region of a Grand-design. We find neither shallow shoulders nor broad dips in either the Northern quadrant I or the Southern quadrant IV indicating that the Milky Way seen interior to the Solar orbit is not characterized by a majestic spiral-structure Grand-design; this conclusion is a robust one, in that it does not depend on measures of distance. Taken together with decades of work on the bits and pieces of the quite disorganized shambles of the inner Galaxy, we suggest that the Milky Way belongs to the category of Flocculent spirals.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The CatWISE2020 Quasar dipole: A Reassessment of the Cosmic Dipole Anomaly</a><span class="id">[2511.00822]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmological principle, which asserts a statistically homogeneous and isotropic universe on large scales, is a foundational assumption of the standard cosmological model. A critical test of this principle involves the kinematic interpretation of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature dipole, conventionally attributed to our peculiar motion relative to the cosmic rest frame. The Ellis-Baldwin test provides a probe of this kinematic interpretation by searching for a matching Doppler-driven dipole in the number counts of extragalactic radio sources. Recent measurements from the CatWISE2020 quasar catalog have reported a dipole amplitude significantly exceeding the kinematic expectation, with a claimed significance of $4.9\sigma$. We present a comprehensive reassessment of this test using the same dataset, incorporating major sources of uncertainty in the statistical inference. We use a simulation framework based on the FLASK package, incorporating lognormal realizations of the large-scale structure, the quasar clustering bias, the survey's radial selection function, and its exact sky coverage. Our simulations account for the kinematic dipole, the intrinsic clustering dipole, shot noise, and survey geometry effects. The analysis yields a revised significance of the kinematic dipole excess of $3.63\sigma$ in the absence of a clustering dipole, and $3.44\sigma$ in the presence of a randomly oriented clustering dipole. When the clustering dipole is aligned with the kinematic dipole direction, the significance decreases further to $3.27\sigma$. Our analysis demonstrates that although the anomaly is reduced in significance, it cannot be explained solely as a result of the clustering dipole or mode coupling arising from the survey mask.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outside-In Evolution with a Twist: Metallicity Gradients and Asymmetries in the SMC</a><span class="id">[2511.00913]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Taking advantage of the near-infrared calcium triplet lines, we determine metallicities for a sample of more than 3,500 red giant stars in the field of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).

By utilising deep photometry from the tenth data release of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS DR10), we construct redshift- and cluster mass-binned composite cluster stellar mass functions (SMFs), down to $M_* = 10^{9.5} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. This work presents the first analysis of the cluster SMF for this specific cluster sample at this epoch. We find that the characteristic stellar mass ($M^*$) of the cluster SMF evolves marginally from $0.55 \leq z &lt; 0.8$, with most of the measurable growth occurring at $ 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.55$. This suggests that most of the massive galaxy population in clusters ($M_* \gtrsim 10^{10.75} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) is largely established by $z \sim 0.8$, with subsequent evolution driven primarily by late-time assembly processes. The low-mass slope ($\alpha$) of the composite cluster SMF is flat at high-$z$ ($z \sim 0.8$) but steepens at $z &lt; 0.55$, suggesting an abundance of massive galaxies in high-$z$ clusters compared to low-$z$ clusters. Redshift evolution of cluster stellar mass fractions ($f^{\mathrm{cg}}_{*}$) suggest that cluster stellar mass (from galaxies with $M_* &gt; 10^{9.5} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) has grown by a factor of $3.3$ since $z = 0.8$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A sensitivity analysis of interstellar ice chemistry in astrochemical models</a><span class="id">[2511.01042]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Astrochemical models are essential to bridge the gap between the timescales of reactions, experiments, and observations. Ice chemistry in these models experiences a large computational complexity as a result of the many parameters required for the modeling of chemistry occurring on these ices, such as binding energies and reaction energy barriers. Many of these parameters are poorly constrained, and accurately determining all would be too costly. We aim to find out which parameters describing ice chemistry have a large effect on the calculated abundances of ices for different prestellar objects. Using Monte Carlo sampled binding energies, diffusion barriers, desorption and diffusion prefactors, and reaction energy barriers, we determined the sensitivity of the abundances of the main ice species calculated with UCLCHEM, an astrochemical modeling code, on each of these parameters. We do this for a large grid of physical conditions across temperature, density, cosmic ray ionization rate and UV field strength. We find that, regardless of the physical conditions, the main sensitivities of abundances of the main ice species are the diffusion barriers of small and relatively mobile reactive species such as H, N, O, HCO, and CH$_3$. Thus, these parameters should be determined more accurately to increase the accuracy of models, paving the way to a better understanding of observations of ices. In many cases, accurate reaction energy barriers are not essential due to the treatment of competition between reactions and diffusion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01164" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar halos of bright central galaxies II: Scaling relations, colors and metallicity evolution with redshift</a><span class="id">[2511.01164]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the formation and evolution of stellar halos (SHs) around bright central galaxies (BCGs), focusing on their scaling relations, colors, and metallicities across cosmic time, and compare model predictions with ultra–deep imaging data. We use the semianalytic model \textsc{FEGA25}, applied to merger trees from high–resolution dark matter simulations, including an updated treatment of intracluster light (ICL) formation. SHs are defined as the stellar component within the transition radius, linked to halo concentration. Predictions are compared with observations from the VST Early-type GAlaxy Survey (VEGAS) and Fornax Deep Survey (FDS). The SH mass correlates strongly with both BCG and ICL masses, with tighter scatter in the SH–ICL relation. The transition radius peaks at 30–40 kpc nearly independent of redshift, but can reach $\sim400$ kpc in the most massive halos, after z=0.5. SHs and ICL show nearly identical color distributions at all epochs, both reddening toward $z=0$. At $z=2$, SHs and the ICL are $\sim0.4$ dex more metal–poor than BCGs, but the gap shrinks to $\sim0.1$ dex by the present time. Observed colors are consistent with model predictions, while observed metallicities are lower, suggesting a larger contribution from disrupted dwarfs. SHs emerge as transition regions between BCGs and the ICL, dynamically and chemically coupled to both. Their properties depend on halo concentration, ICL formation efficiency, and the progenitor mass spectrum. Upcoming wide–field photometric and spectroscopic surveys (e.g. LSST, WEAVE, 4MOST) will provide crucial tests by mapping structure, metallicity, and kinematics in large galaxy samples.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CosmoDRAGoN II: Remnant Radio Galaxies in Group and Cluster Environments</a><span class="id">[2511.01193]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radio galaxy remnants are a rare subset of the radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGN) population, representing the quiescent phase in the RLAGN lifecycle. Despite their observed scarcity, they offer valuable insights into the AGN duty cycle and feedback processes. Due to the mega-year timescales over which the RLAGN lifecycle takes place, it is impossible to observe the active to remnant transition in real-time. Numerical simulations offer a solution to follow the long-term evolution of RLAGN plasma. In this work, we present the largest suite (to date) of three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations studying the dynamic evolution of the active-to-remnant transition and explore the mechanisms driving cocoon evolution, comparing the results to the expectations of analytic modelling. Our results show key differences between active and remnant sources in both cluster environments and in lower-density group environments. We find that sources in low-density environments can remain overpressured well into the remnant phase. This significantly increases the time for the remnant lobe to transition to a buoyant regime. We compare our results with analytic expectations, showing that the long-term evolution of radio remnants can be well captured for remnants whose expansion is largely pressure-driven if the transition to a coasting phase is assumed to be gradual. We find that remnants of low-powered progenitors can continue to be momentum-driven for about 10 Myr after the jets switch-off. Finally, we consider how the properties of the progenitor influence the mixing of the remnant lobe and confirm the expectation that the remnants of high-powered sources have long-lasting shocks that can continue to heat the surrounding medium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01195" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling the distribution and redshift dependence of host galaxy dispersion measures using localized fast radio bursts</a><span class="id">[2511.01195]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic radio pulses whose origins are poorly understood.

From line integrated intensity maps of CH3CN(12–11) and H30\alpha, we resolve the spatial distribution of HMFs and UC HII regions. By combining with observations of CO outflows and 1.3 mm continuum, we classify HMFs into four types: HMFs associated with jet-like outflow, with wide-angle outflow, with non-detectable outflow, and shell-like HMFs near UC HII regions. This diversity possibly indicates that the hot core could be polymorphic and long-standing phenomenon in the evolution of massive protostars.

To address the limitations of manual classification in large-scale spectroscopic surveys - where the number of quasar spectra is growing exponentially - we propose BALNet, a deep learning approach consisting of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks to automatically detect BAL troughs in quasar spectra. BALNet enables both the identification of BAL quasars and the measurement of their BAL troughs. We construct a simulated dataset for training and testing by combining non-BAL quasar spectra and BAL troughs, both derived from SDSS DR16 observations. Experimental results in the testing set show that: (1) BAL trough detection achieves 83.0% completeness, 90.7% purity, and an F1-score of 86.7%; (2) BAL quasar classification achieves 90.8% completeness and 94.4% purity; (3) the predicted BAL velocities agree closely with simulated ground truth labels, confirming BALNet's robustness and accuracy. When applied to the SDSS DR16 data within the redshift range 1.5&lt;z&lt;5.7, at least one BAL trough is detected in 20.4% of spectra. Notably, more than a quarter of these are newly identified sources with significant absorption, 8.8% correspond to redshifted systems, and some narrow/weak absorption features were missed. BALNet greatly improves the efficiency of large-scale BAL trough detection and enables more effective scientific analysis of quasar spectra.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for neutrino emission from blazar $γ$-ray flares accounting for possible neutrino time delays</a><span class="id">[2511.01361]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the results of the search for the high-energy neutrino emission associated with blazar flares, accounting for a possible lag of neutrinos with respect to the electromagnetic emission, either due to the slowness of the proton energy losses in $p\gamma$ collisions and/or proton acceleration.

We investigate how baryonic physics affects the strength and redshift evolution of GAB using the largest runs of two state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. We quantify GAB by comparing the clustering of stellar-mass-selected galaxies to that of shuffled samples, where galaxies are randomly reassigned to haloes of similar mass. We find that GAB in both simulations increases from approximately zero at $z=5$ to a $\sim\,5\%$ change in clustering amplitude at $z=2$. After this epoch, the trends diverge: GAB in TNG continues to increase, reaching $\sim\,10\%$ at $z=0$, while in SIMBA it decreases to nearly zero. By further shuffling galaxies within bins of halo mass and cosmic environment – characterised by smoothed matter overdensity ($\delta_5$) and tidal anisotropy ($\alpha_5$) – we show that most of the GAB in both simulations can be attributed to the overdensity, while tidal anisotropy contributes negligibly in both simulations. Exploring this effect from the point of view of the halo occupation distribution (HOD), we find that numbers of central and satellite galaxies vary with overdensity – but only near the respective turn-on masses for these two constituents: the galaxy contents of high-mass haloes are very nearly independent of environment. We present a simple parameterisation that allows the HOD modelling to be modified to reflect this form of density-dependent GAB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Spatial Distribution of Intra-Cluster Globular Clusters in the Fornax Cluster</a><span class="id">[2511.01576]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the spatial distribution of the Intra-Cluster Globular Clusters (ICGCs) detected in the core of the Fornax galaxy cluster. By separately modeling different components of the observed population of Globular Clusters (GCs), we confirm the existence of an abundant ICGCs over-density with a geometrically complex, elongated morphology roughly centered on the cluster dominant galaxy NGC 1399 and stretching along the E-W direction. We identify several areas in the ICGCs distribution that deviate from a simple elliptical model and feature large density enhancements. These regions are characterized based on their statistical significance, GCs excess number, position, size and location relative to the galaxies in their surroundings. The relations between the spatial distribution and features of the ICGCs structures, mostly populated by blue GCs, and properties of the intra-cluster light and dwarf galaxies detected in the core of the Fornax cluster are described and discussed. The line-of-sight velocity distribution of spectroscopically confirmed GCs within the ICGCs structures is compatible with the systemic velocities of nearby bright galaxies in the Fornax cluster, suggesting that the ICGCs population is at least partially composed of GCs stripped from their hosts. We argue that the findings here presented suggest that, on sub-cluster scales, different mechanisms contribute to the growth of the ICGC. The western region of Fornax is likely associated with old merging events that predate the assembly of the Fornax cluster. The eastern side instead points to a mix of tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies and stripping from the GCSs of massive hosts, more typical of relaxed, high-density cluster environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01584" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm Absorption Spectra Classification using Machine Learning</a><span class="id">[2511.01584]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>$\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption, an extremely useful tool to study the cold atomic hydrogen gas, can arise either from the intervening galaxies along the line-of-sight towards the background radio source or from the radio source itself.

Using a sample of 118 known $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption lines from the literature, we train six ML models (Gaussian naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, SVM and XGBoost) on the spectral parameters obtained by fitting the Busy function to the absorption spectra.

Two competing theories for its origin have emerged, positing the gas to be primordial or secondary. Primordial gas survives from the belt's parent protoplanetary disk and is therefore H$_2$-rich. Secondary gas is outgassed \textit{in-situ} by exocomets and is relatively H$_2$-poor. Discriminating between these scenarios has not been possible for belts hosting unexpectedly large quantities of CO. We aim to break this gas origin dichotomy \textit{via} direct measurement of H$_2$ column densities in two edge-on CO-rich exocometary belts around $\sim$15 Myr-old A-type stars, constraining the $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratio and CO gas lifetimes. Observing edge-on belts enables rovibrational absorption spectroscopy against the stellar background. We present near-IR CRIRES+ spectra of HD 110058 and HD 131488 which provide the first direct probe of H$_2$ gas in CO-rich exocometary belts. We target the H$_2$ (v=1-0 S(0)) line at 2223.3 nm and and the $^{12}$CO $v=2\rightarrow0$ rovibrational lines in the range 2333.8-2335.5 nm and derive constraints on column densities along the line-of-sight to the stars. We strongly detect $^{12}$CO but not H$_2$ in the CRIRES+ spectra. This allows us to place $3\sigma$ lower limits on the $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratios of $&gt; 1.35 \times 10^{-3}$ and $&gt; 3.09 \times 10^{-5}$ for HD 110058 and HD 131488 respectively. These constraints demonstrate that at least for HD 110058, the exocometary gas is compositionally distinct and significantly H$_2$-poor, compared to the $&lt;10^{-4}$ $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratios typical of protoplanetary disks. We also find H$_2$ alone is unlikely to shield CO over the lifetime of the systems. Overall this suggests that the gas in CO-rich belts is most likely not primordial in origin, supporting the presence of exocometary gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutral Atomic Hydrogen in a Star-forming Galaxy 7 Billion Years Ago</a><span class="id">[2511.01715]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) constitutes a key phase of the cosmic baryon cycle, bridging the ionised circumgalactic medium and the star-forming molecular gas. Yet, nearly 75 years after its discovery, direct views of HI through its 21cm emission line remain largely confined to the nearby Universe. Indirect measurements and statistical analyses indicate little evolution in the comoving HI density over the past 10 billion years, in stark contrast to the order-of-magnitude decline in the cosmic star-formation rate density over the same epoch. Resolving this tension requires direct HI measurements in individual, representative galaxies at earlier times. Here we report a detection of HI 21cm emission from the Dragon Arc, a gravitationally lensed main-sequence star-forming galaxy at $z=0.725$, observed 6.6 billion years in the past with the MeerKAT radio telescope. The inferred intrinsic HI mass, $M_{\rm HI}=10^{9.66^{+0.16}_{-0.19}}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, and velocity width of $205^{+66}_{-48}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ are consistent with expectations from scaling relations for local star-forming galaxies. The resulting HI depletion time of $1.2^{+1.0}_{-0.6}\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ is significantly shorter than the $\sim5-10$ Gyr, measured locally for comparable galaxies. This indicates that the galaxy must rapidly replenish its atomic gas reservoir to remain on the star-forming main sequence. This detection demonstrates that strong gravitational lensing, combined with modern cm-wave facilities, can now reveal the HI reservoirs of typical galaxies well beyond the local Universe, opening a new path toward statistical samples that will directly trace the evolution of the cosmic atomic gas supply.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Possible &quot;Too-Many-Satellites&quot; Problem in the Isolated Dwarf Galaxy DDO 161</a><span class="id">[2511.01733]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The abundance of satellite galaxies provides a direct test of $\Lambda$CDM on small scales.

We derive excitation coefficients for HCN, HCO+ and HNC in DSFGs, finding them to be systematically higher than those in nearby luminous infrared galaxies. Assuming a canonical dense-mass conversion factor (alpha_HCN = 10), we find that DSFGs have shorter dense- gas depletion times (median 23 Myr) than nearby galaxies ( 60 Myr), with a star-forming efficiency per free-fall time of 1-2%, a factor of a few higher than in local galaxies. We find a wide range of dense-gas fractions, with HCN/CO ratios ranging between 0.01 and 0.15.

Our LFs reach very faint magnitudes, down to M - 5 log h   -10 in r. Independent North and South estimates agree well near the LF knee, with very small statistical errors. These errors reveal that simple analytic forms poorly fit the LFs: the bright end deviates from an exponential, and the faint end shows complex, non-power-law behaviour. We detect an upturn at M - 5 log h &gt; -15, stronger in red galaxies. Below -13, local overdensities and fragmentation of large galaxies amplify this upturn. A systematic offset between North and South appears at the brightest magnitudes, driven by red galaxies. Blue LFs match well across regions, suggesting the discrepancy arises from red galaxy profiles blending into noise in shallower North photometry. This remains inconclusive, so the bright-end offset is treated as a systematic uncertainty. We also present LFs using model Petrosian magnitudes, which are less sensitive to this issue. Splitting by redshift reveals small but significant residuals, indicating our global evolution model, while accurate near the LF knee, misses more complex trends. Using Loveday (2011) redshift limits, we find excellent agreement with GAMA, but with smaller errors. Our methods and results provide a foundation for studying LF dependence on environment, such as local density and cosmic web classification, offering strong constraints on galaxy formation models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei Using Hydrodynamic Simulations and Machine Learning</a><span class="id">[2511.01811]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nuclear star clusters represent some of the most extreme collisional environments in the Universe. A typical nuclear star cluster harbors a supermassive black hole at its center, which accelerates stars to high speeds ($\gtrsim 100$-$1000$ km/s) in a region where millions of other stars reside. Direct collisions occur frequently in such high-density environments, where they can shape the stellar populations and drive the evolution of the cluster. We present a suite of a couple hundred high-resolution smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of collisions between $1$ M$_\odot$ stars, at impact speeds representative of galactic nuclei. We use our SPH dataset to develop physically-motivated fitting formulae for predicting collision outcomes. While collision-driven mass loss has been examined in detail in the literature, we present a new framework for understanding the effects of &quot;hit-and-run&quot; collisions on a star's trajectory. We demonstrate that the change in stellar velocity follows the tidal-dissipation limit for grazing encounters, while the deflection angle is well-approximated by point-particle dynamics for periapses $\gtrsim0.3$ times the stellar radii. We use our SPH dataset to test two machine learning (ML) algorithms, k-Nearest Neighbors and neural networks, for predicting collision outcomes and properties. We find that the neural network out-performs k-Nearest Neighbors and delivers results on par with and in some cases exceeding the accuracy of our fitting formulae. We conclude that both fitting formulae and ML have merits for modeling collisions in dense stellar environments, however ML may prove more effective as the parameter space of initial conditions expands.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03192" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The tidal evolution of anisotropic subhaloes: A new pathway to creating isotropic and cored satellites</a><span class="id">[2411.03192]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is common practice, both in dynamical modelling and in idealised numerical simulations, to assume that galaxies and/or dark matter haloes are spherical and have isotropic velocity distributions, such that their distribution functions are ergodic.

We show that the detailed velocity anisotropy has a large impact on the subhalo's mass loss rate. In particular, subhaloes that are radially anisotropic experience much more mass loss than their tangentially anisotropic counterparts. In fact, in the former case, the stripping of highly radial orbits can cause a rapid cusp-to-core transformation, without having to resort to any baryonic feedback processes. Once the tidal radius becomes comparable to the radius of the core thus formed, the subhalo is tidally disrupted. Subhaloes that at infall are tangentially anisotropic are far more resilient to tidal stripping, and are never disrupted when simulated with sufficient resolution. We show that the preferential stripping of more radial orbits, combined with re-virialisation post stripping, causes an isotropisation of the subhalo's velocity distributions. This implies that subhaloes that have experienced significant mass loss are expected to be close to isotropic, which may alleviate the mass-anisotropy degeneracies that hamper the dynamical modelling of Milky Way satellites.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radial Gradients and Intrinsic Scatter in MaNGA Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2502.00531]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive stellar population parameters and radial gradients within 0.65 $R_e$ for spatially resolved spectra of 2968 early-type galaxies from MaNGA, spanning stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) of 50–340 km s$^{-1}$.

Globally, $\log$(age) increases ($\sim$0.53 dex per decade), [Fe/H] declines slightly ($\sim$-0.06 dex per decade), and [X/Fe] for light elements rises (0.19–0.37 dex per decade for $\log\sigma &lt; 2.0$ but steepens to nearly double slope for $\log\sigma &gt; 2.0$) with $\log\sigma$. [Fe/H] peaks at $\log\sigma \sim 2.0$ and falls on either side. Light-element [X/Fe] anticorrelates with [Fe/H] ($\sim$-0.1 dex per decade). Astrophysical scatter is largest in low-$\sigma$ galaxies, especially for Fe and N. Internally, age gradients are nearly flat in low-$\sigma$ galaxies and slightly negative in high-$\sigma$ systems ($\sim$-0.04 dex per decade). [Fe/H] radial gradients steepen from -0.06 dex per decade to -0.15 dex per decade across $\sigma$, while light elements (except Na) show $\sim$-0.03 dex per decade gradients. Scatter in gradients peaks in high-$\sigma$ galaxies, most strongly for Fe ($\sim$0.23 dex), suggesting comparable numbers of inside-out and outside-in formation. A near-zero ($\sim$-0.03) age and light-element gradient plus mild [Fe/H] gradients supports hierarchical merging for ETG evolution. Simulations match the observed age structure, slope change at $\log\sigma \sim 2.0$, and flat gradients, though they overpredict absolute abundances.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08481" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reconstructing the Anisotropic Ultra-long Wavelength Spectra using a Single Antenna on Lunar-orbit</a><span class="id">[2502.08481]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ultra-long wavelength sky ($\nu\lesssim 30$ MHz) is still largely unexplored, as the electromagnetic wave is heavily absorbed and distorted by the ionosphere on Earth. The far-side of the Moon, either in lunar-orbit or on lunar-surface, is the ideal site for observations in this band, and the upcoming Moon-based interferometers will obtain multi-frequency high-resolution sky maps. Making use of the lunar occultation of the sky and the anisotropy of antenna primary beam response, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the ultra-long wavelength spectral shape in multiple directions in the sky using only one antenna on lunar orbit. We apply the method to one antenna on one of the nine daughter satellites of the proposed Discovering the Sky at Longest wavelength (DSL) project. Using simulated observation data between 1 - 30 MHz from one dipole antenna, we find that the spectra for different regions on the sky can be reconstructed very well and the free-free absorption feature in each region can be derived from the reconstructed spectra. This work demonstrates the feasibility to reconstruct the anisotropic ultra-long wavelength spectra with very limited instrumentation on a lunar-orbit, with mature technologies already in place. It extends the application of such kind of satellite in revealing the distribution of free electrons in the Galactic interstellar medium from the distribution of absorption features in the ultra-long wavelength sky.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identifying compact symmetric objects with high-precision VLBI and Gaia astrometry</a><span class="id">[2503.07288]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) trace the earliest phases of radio-galaxy growth; however, robust classification is difficult when radio cores are weak or invisible. We aim to develop and test a Gaia+VLBI approach that utilizes the high-precision optical astrometry of Gaia together with the high-resolution imaging of VLBI to reliably locate the central engine and classify CSOs. We analysed 40 literature CSO candidates by overlaying Gaia DR3 positions on VLBI maps and by examining spectral index distributions, whole-source variability, and hotspot kinematics over up to 25 years. A source is classified as a CSO when the Gaia centroid lies between two steep-spectrum lobes. Our method yields 20 confirmed CSOs. The confirmed CSOs show low integrated variability, slow hotspot advance speeds, and kinematic ages of 20-2000 yr. High-power CSOs tend to be larger and host faster hotspots, while many low-power systems remain sub-kiloparsec and environmentally confined. Gaia+VLBI registration is a powerful method for CSO classification, especially where radio cores are faint. The observed power-size-velocity-age relations support distinct multiple evolutionary tracks, with high-power CSOs plausibly growing into large radio galaxies, while low-power CSOs appear confined by their host galaxy environments. Taken together, our results indicate that CSO evolution is shaped not only by intrinsic jet power, but also by host-galaxy environment and the duty cycle of the central engine. High-sensitivity observations of low-power CSOs will be crucial to map the full diversity of formation channels and evolutionary pathways of radio galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06349" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing compact massive black hole binary candidates through multi-epoch spectroscopy</a><span class="id">[2504.06349]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Emission from two massive black holes (MBHs) bound in a close binary is expected to be modulated by different processes, such as the Doppler boost due to the orbital motion, accretion rate variability generated by the interaction with a circumbinary disc, and binary gravitational self-lensing. When the binary is compact enough, the two black holes are thought to be surrounded by a common broad-line region that reprocesses the impinging periodically varying ionising flux, creating broad emission lines with variable line shapes. Therefore, the study of broad emission line variability through multi-epoch spectroscopic campaigns is of paramount importance for the unambiguous identification of a binary. In this work, we study the response of a disc-like broad-line region to the Doppler-boosted ionising flux emitted by sub-milliparsec MBH binaries on a circular orbit and compare it with the response of a broad-line region illuminated by a single MBH with a periodically but isotropically varying intrinsic luminosity. We show that in the binary case, the time lags of the blue and red wings of the broad emission lines, arising from diametrically opposite sides of the circumbinary disc, are out of phase by half of the binary's orbital period, as they each respond to the periodic &quot;lighthouse&quot; modulation from the binary's continuum emission. This asymmetric time lag represents a new binary signature that cannot be mimicked by a single MBH.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxyster: A Circumgalactic Low-ionization Oxygen Nebula next to a Starburst Galaxy at $z\sim1$</a><span class="id">[2504.11531]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through the circumgalactic medium (CGM).

The nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 ($\sim 30$ kpc) and [OIII]5007 ($\sim 20$ kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-$z$ AGNs, resembling a higher-$z$ analog of &quot;Hanny's Voorwerp&quot;. However, its uniformly low [OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a single blue spiral &quot;arm&quot;. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests the $2-6\times 10^{10} ~\rm M_{\odot}$ host galaxy sits above the star-forming main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the &quot;arm&quot;, and have $&lt;5\%$ luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and the non-detection of H$\beta$ line. A plausible explanation could involve the combination of a recent ($&lt;10^8$ yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN ($L_{\rm{bol}} \sim 1\times10^{42}$ erg/s).

We develop a semi-analytical framework in which turbulence is modeled as a stochastic velocity field acting through a modified drag force. We integrate the resulting stochastic differential equations both in Cartesian coordinates and in orbital elements using a linearized perturbative approach, and compare these results with full numerical simulations. Eccentricity and inclination evolve toward steady-state Rayleigh distributions, with variances determined by the local disk properties and the ratio of the gas damping rate to the orbital frequency. The analytical predictions agree well with the numerical simulations. We provide closed-form expressions for the variances in both the fast and slow damping regimes. These results are directly applicable to Monte Carlo population models and can serve as physically motivated initial conditions for hydrodynamical simulations. Turbulent forcing prevents full circularization and alignment of BH orbits in AGN disks, even in the presence of strong gas drag. This has important implications for BH merger and binary formation rates, which are sensitive to the residual eccentricity and inclination. Our results highlight the need to account for turbulence-induced stochastic heating when modeling the dynamical evolution of compact objects in AGN environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scatter in the star formation rate-halo mass relation: secondary bias and its impact on line-intensity mapping</a><span class="id">[2506.03015]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the impact of secondary bias – specifically, the correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and halo bias at fixed halo mass – on the line-intensity mapping (LIM) power spectrum. In LIM, the galaxy contributions are flux-weighted, and therefore depend on the luminosity of emission line. We show that the (ensemble-averaged) large-scale two-halo term of the power spectrum depends only on the mean luminosity-halo mass relation if the scatter is uncorrelated with halo bias. However, when luminosity correlates with halo bias at fixed mass, this assumption breaks down. For many emission lines (e.g. H$\alpha$), luminosity is strongly correlated with SFR, making the SFR-weighted power spectrum important to study. In IllustrisTNG, secondary bias increases the two-halo term of the SFR-weighted power spectrum by 5 per cent at $z \sim 1.5$ compared to a model with random scatter. We also find that SFRs of central and satellite galaxies are correlated, enhancing the one-halo term – which depends on the distribution of SFR inside the halo – by 10 per cent relative to random pairings. To mitigate secondary bias in the two-halo term, we identify halo concentration (for haloes with mass $\log M_h \lesssim 12$) and satellite mass (for $\log M_h \gtrsim 12$) as effective secondary parameters. These results highlight the need to account for secondary bias when building mock catalogues and interpreting LIM observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indications of electron-to-proton mass ratio variations in the Galaxy.

In this study, we report the discovery of thirty-six new HyMoRSs, marking the largest collection of such sources in the southern sky to date, using data obtained from the MeerKAT absorption line survey (MALS). The identified HyMoRSs exhibit moderate radio luminosities in the range $9.9 \times 10^{23}$ to $5.7 \times 10^{25}$ W $Hz^{-1}$, with a median value of $4.4 \times 10^{24}$ W $Hz^{-1}$ at 1.4 GHz, and are located within the redshift range $0.04&lt;z&lt;1.34$. In this work, we show for the first time that the two lobes of HyMoRSs exhibit no statistically significant difference in their spectral indices. We also investigate the mid-infrared properties and environments of their host galaxies. Notably, nine out of the thirty-six sources are situated near the centers of galaxy clusters, including one with giant radio jets that extend over 811 kpc. Our analysis reveals that the majority of HyMoRSs are hosted by actively star-forming galaxies that exhibit elevated star formation rates. Furthermore, our findings suggest that HyMoRSs may arise from FR II jets being deflected by a dense, cluster-like environment, along with orientation effects that make one jet appear FR I-like.

However, numerical convergence of subhalo evolution is difficult to achieve, especially in the inner regions of host halos where tidal forces are strongest. I investigate the numerical convergence and correction methods for the abundance, spatial, and velocity distributions of subhalos using two $6144^3$-particle cosmological N-body simulations with different mass resolutions – Jiutian-300 ($1.0 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) and Jiutian-1G ($3.7 \times 10^{8}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) – with subhalos identified by HBT+. My study shows that the Surviving subhalo Peak Mass Function (SPMF) converges only for subhalos with $m_{\mathrm{peak}}$ above $5000$ particles but can be accurately recovered by including orphan subhalos that survive according to the merger timescale model of Jiang et al., which outperforms other models. Including orphan subhalos also enables recovery of the real-space spatial and velocity distributions to $5$–$10\%$ accuracy down to scales of $0.1$–$0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. The remaining differences are likely due to cosmic variance and finite-box effects in the smaller Jiutian-300 simulation. Convergence below $0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ remains challenging and requires more sophisticated modeling of orphan subhalos. I further highlight that redshift-space multipoles are more difficult to recover even at larger scales because unreliable small-scale pairs at $r_{\mathrm{p}} &lt; 0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ in real space affect scales of tens of $\mathrm{Mpc}$ in redshift space due to elongated Fingers-of-God effects. Therefore, for redshift-space statistics, I recommend using modified or alternative measures that reduce sensitivity to small projected separations in subhalo-based studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02677" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gas in Globular Clusters I: Gas Retention and Its Possible Consequences</a><span class="id">[2509.02677]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Globular clusters host complex stellar populations whose chemical signatures suggest early (3 Myr - 1 Gyr) retention and reprocessing of stellar ejecta, yet direct evidence for intracluster gas is lacking. Here we present a unified theoretical framework for the evolution of gas in young globular clusters, and its implications for the production of multiple stellar populations. We show that low-velocity AGB winds are gravitationally retained in clusters more massive than a few 10^5 MSun. In addition, AGB winds in such clusters collide with each other and the previously retained winds, triggering a rapid `switch' to efficient gas retention. Expected gas retention fractions agree well with the observed second population fractions in Galactic globular clusters. Furthermore, the accumulated gas cannot form new stars because protostellar cores are disrupted by encounters with pre-existing stars. Instead, the gas is accreted onto pre-existing main-sequence stars and compact objects. Time-dependent core-halo models indicate that compact objects can grow and collapse within 100 Myr - 1 Gyr, while lower-mass main-sequence stars can be `rejuvenated' into the 4 - 6 MSun range required to reproduce key abundance patterns. Therefore, in our model, the multiple populations will be found in sufficiently massive clusters, with the second-population stars being formed from the inner subset of first-population stars that accreted large fractions of their mass from the AGB-processed retained gas. Finally, we argue that a combination of feedback processes, including accretion luminosity onto compact objects, novae, pulsar winds, and binary supernovae, will clear the gas by 1 Gyr, thus reproducing the gas-poor conditions observed for present-day clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The first radio view of a type Ibn supernova in SN 2023fyq: Understanding the mass-loss history in the last decade before the explosion</a><span class="id">[2509.07080]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernovae that interact with hydrogen-poor, helium-rich circumstellar material (CSM), known as Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn), present a unique opportunity to probe mass-loss processes in massive stars.

We find that the radio emission from 58–185 days is best modeled by synchrotron radiation attenuated by free-free absorption from a CSM of density $\sim$ $10^{-18}$ g/$\rm{cm^{3}}$ ($\sim 10^{6} \mathrm{\rho_{ISM}}$) at a radius of $10^{16}$ cm, corresponding to a mass-loss rate of $\sim$ $4 \times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$ (for a wind velocity of 1700 km/s from optical spectroscopy) from 0.7 to 3 years before the explosion. This timescale is consistent with the time frame over which pre-explosion optical outbursts were observed. However, our late-time observations at 525 days post-explosion yield non-detections, and the 3$\sigma$ upper limits (along with an X-ray non-detection) allow us to infer lower-density CSM at $2\times 10^{16}$ cm with $\rm{\dot{M}}$ $&lt; 2.5\times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$. These results suggest a shell-like CSM from at most $4 \times 10^{15}$ to $2 \times 10^{16}$ cm ($\sim 10^{5} R_{\rm{\odot}}$) with an elevated CSM density (0.004 $\mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$) that is roughly consistent with predictions from a merger model for this object. Future radio observations of a larger sample of SNe Ibn will provide key details on the extent and density of their helium-rich CSM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scaling Relations of the Dusty Torus with Luminosity and the Broad-Line Region</a><span class="id">[2509.07878]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We measure and compare the size of the dusty torus with active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity and the size of the broad-line region (BLR), using a sample of 182 AGNs with the best H$\beta$ lag measurements.

We find that the torus size from the W1-band (W2-band) tightly correlates with the 5100 Å continuum luminosity with an intrinsic scatter of 0.15-0.16 dex and the best-fit slope of $0.35 \pm 0.03$ ($0.33 \pm 0.03$), which is clearly shallower than the expected 0.5 slope from the sublimation radius-luminosity relation.

We mapped two of the most massive of these molecular tori with higher resolution, in order to unveil their morphology and kinematics, their possible warp and clumpiness, and derive their stability and life-time. We used the highest resolution possible with ALMA (16 km baseline) in Band 7, taking into account for mapping CO(3-2) and HCO$^+$(4-3) the compromise between sensitivity and resolution. New features are discovered at the high resolution, obtained with a beam of 0.015\arcsec, equivalent to $\sim$ 1 pc scale, at their $\sim$ 15 Mpc distance. The molecular torus in NGC 613 appears like a ring, depleted in molecular gas near the center. The depletion region is displaced by 3 pc toward the NW from the AGN position, meaning some $m=1$ asymmetry in the torus. The molecular torus in NGC 1672 has a different position angle from previous lower-resolution observations, and is edge-on, revealing a geometrically very thin torus (axis ratio 6.5 to 10), with a clear warp. This confirms that the classical model of a simple geometrically thick dusty torus is challenged by high resolution observations. The nuclear disks appear clumpy, and slightly lopsided. The molecular outflow in NGC 613 is now resolved out. Well inside the sphere of influence of the black holes (BH), we are now able to determine more accurately their mass, for those Seyfert spiral galaxies, in a region of the M-sigma relation where the scatter is maximum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the Bulge Morphology of Dual AGN Host Galaxies from the GOTHIC survey</a><span class="id">[2509.19548]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a structural analysis of bulges in dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. Dual AGN arise in galaxy mergers where both supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are actively accreting. The AGN are typically embedded in compact bulges, which appear as luminous nuclei in optical images. Galaxy mergers can result in bulge growth, often via star formation. The bulges can be disky (pseudobulges), classical bulges, or belong to elliptical galaxies. Using SDSS DR18 gri images and GALFIT modelling, we performed 2D decomposition for 131 dual AGN bulges (comprising 61 galaxy pairs and 3 galaxy triplets) identified in the GOTHIC survey. We derived sérsic indices, luminosities, masses, and scalelengths of the bulges. Most bulges (105/131) are classical, with sérsic indices lying between $n=2$ and $n=8$. Among these, 64% are elliptical galaxies, while the remainder are classical bulges in disc galaxies. Only $\sim$20% of the sample exhibit pseudobulges. Bulge masses span $1.5\times10^9$ to $1.4\times10^{12}\,M_\odot$, with the most massive systems being ellipticals. Galaxy type matching shows that elliptical–elliptical (E–E) and elliptical–disc (E–D) mergers dominate over disc–disc (D–D) mergers. At least one galaxy in two-thirds of the dual AGN systems is elliptical and only $\sim$30% involve two disc galaxies. Although our sample is limited, our results suggest that dual AGN preferentially occur in evolved, red, quenched systems, that typically form via major mergers. They are predominantly hosted in classical bulges or elliptical galaxies rather than star-forming disc galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05634" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Formation of GW231123 in Population III Star Clusters</a><span class="id">[2510.05634]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GW231123 is a binary black hole merger whose primary component lies within or above the pair-instability mass gap, while the secondary component falls within this gap. The standard theory of stellar evolution is significantly challenged by this event. We investigate the formation of candidate progenitors of GW231123 in Population III (Pop III) star clusters. We find that they could form through stellar mergers, binary black hole mergers, and mixed mergers. The mass distribution of these candidate progenitors covers the component masses of GW231123. Under our model assumptions, their predicted merger rate density spans the range of $0.001-0.26{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, encompassing that of GW231123. These findings suggest that GW231123 may originate from Pop III star clusters. Furthermore, such candidate progenitors are expected to be detectable by future gravitational wave detectors LISA/Taiji/TianQin/DECIGO/Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope, which would provide valuable insights into the formation scenarios of events like GW231123.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05199" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kerr black hole in a uniform Bertotti-Robinson magnetic field: An exact solution</a><span class="id">[2507.05199]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A new class of exact spacetimes in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field that is asymptotically uniform and oriented along the rotational axis, is presented. These are axisymmetric stationary solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations such that (unlike in the Plebanski-Demianski spacetime) the null directions of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with neither of the two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor of algebraic type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the spacetime is contained in the Van den Bergh-Carminati solutions which can be understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.</p></div></details></article>

Deconvolution reverses such effects and thus can benefit extracted science in multifaceted ways. We apply the Scaled Gradient Projection (SGP) algorithm for the single-band deconvolution of several observed images from the Zwicky Transient Facility and mainly discuss the performance on stellar sources. The method shows good photometric flux preservation, which deteriorates for fainter sources but significantly reduces flux uncertainties even for the faintest sources. Deconvolved sources have a well-defined Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum (FWHM) of roughly one pixel (one arcsecond for ZTF) regardless of the observed seeing. Detection after deconvolution results in catalogs with $\gtrsim$99.6% completeness relative to detections in the observed images. A few observed sources that could not be detected in the deconvolved image are found near saturated sources, whereas for others, the deconvolved counterparts are detected when slightly different detection parameters are used. The deconvolution reveals new faint sources previously undetectable, which are confirmed by crossmatching with the deeper DESI Legacy DR10 and with Pan-STARRS1 through forced photometry. The method could identify examples of serendipitous potential deblends that exceeded SExtractor's deblending capabilities, with as extreme as $\Delta m \approx 3$ and separations as small as one arcsecond between the deblended components. Our survey-agnostic approach is better and eight times faster than Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and could be a reliable method for incorporation into survey pipelines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00164" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BOOM and Babamul: a real-time, multi-survey, optical alert broker system operating at scale</a><span class="id">[2511.00164]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the arrival of ever higher throughput wide-field surveys and a multitude of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength instruments to complement them, software capable of harnessing these associated data streams is urgently required. To meet these needs, a number of community supported alert brokers have been built, currently focused on processing of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; $\sim 10^5$-$10^6$ alerts per night) with an eye towards Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST; $\sim 2 \times 10^7$ alerts per night). Building upon the system that successfully ran in production for ZTF's first seven years of operation, we introduce BOOM (Burst &amp; Outburst Observations Monitor), an analysis framework focused on real-time, joint brokering of these alert streams. BOOM harnesses the performance of a Rust-based software stack relying on a non-relational MongoDB database combined with a Valkey in-memory processing queue and a Kafka cluster for message sharing. With this system, we demonstrate feature parity with the existing ZTF system with a throughput $\sim 8 \times$ higher. We describe the workflow that enables the real-time processing as well as the results with custom filters we have built to demonstrate the system's capabilities.

Reaching this precision requires mitigating variable atmospheric effects, especially gray extinction from clouds, which remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, we present a novel method for correcting photometric data using simultaneous radiometric measurements from an infrared thermal camera. The gray extinction correction model is fitted on an image-by-image basis as a function of thermal radiance excess and difference between synthetic and instrumental fluxes of calibration stars. This approach stands out by avoiding any assumptions about spatial structure and leveraging a forward model combining in situ environmental monitoring, radiative transfer simulations and use of Gaia Data Release 3 star catalogs. We demonstrate the method using data collected from a dedicated experimental remote observation system, built to conduct repeated observations of two fields over several nights in varying atmosphere conditions. We show that applying the correction model to each source in the test sample results in a reduction of residuals between corrected and reference magnitudes. It delivers extinction correction maps for individual images with a resolution of 2 arcmin and an accuracy of $\sim$0.01 mag. This leads to a significant improvement in accuracy per image, with the mean absolute error decreasing from 0.64 to 0.11 mag for the most gray extinguished exposures. The temporal variations in extinction for non-ideal photometric sequences can be reduced to 0.025 mag per source, which is promising for its application in StarDICE.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00286" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharp dynamic points in Earth-Sun physics</a><span class="id">[2511.00286]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The subsolar point, the closest location on Earth's surface to the Sun, marks the Sun-Earth line of gravity that governs Earth's coupled orbital-rotational cycle. We examined the dynamic interactions among the Sun meridian declination (SMD), the Equation of Time (EoT), Earth's rotational speed (ER$_\omega$) – equatorial and with respect to the Sun – and the path of the subsolar point (NBI) across longitude, including time derivatives up to the fourth order (snap). A central finding was that the function NBI$_\alpha$(SMD) traces a lemniscate whose temporal structure mirrors the analemma, EoT(SMD), and whose symmetry converges to the obliquity component of the EoT. The EoT velocity ($\omega^*$) peaks at solstices, troughs near the equinoxes, and crosses zero every mid-season. ER$_\omega$ decreases monotonically along trans-equinoctial phases where the net drives of EoT and SMD coincide, and increases along trans-solstitial phases, where their net drives oppose. Eight sharp kinematic periods were identified for the cycle SMD-EoT-ER$_\omega$: two equinoctial, two solstitial, and one within each season. The non-solstitial sharp terms, defined by ZCPs and troughs of $\omega^*$, display a consistent 3$^\circ$ northward offset from the function NBI$_\alpha$(SMD). These results reveal a direct dynamical link between SMD, EoT, and Earth's rotational speed, providing a novel framework for understanding Earth's rotation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ATCAT: Astronomical Timeseries CAusal Transformer</a><span class="id">[2511.00614]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will capture light curves (LCs) for 10 billion sources and produce millions of transient candidates per night, necessitating scalable, accurate, and efficient classification. To prepare the community for this scale of data, the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC) sought to simulate a diversity of LSST-like time-domain events. Using a small transformer-based model and refined light curve encoding logic, we present a new state of the art classification performance on ELAsTiCC, with 71.8% F1 on LC-only classifications, and 89.8% F1 on LC+metadata classifications. Previous state of the art was 65.5% F1 for LC-only, and for LC+metadata, 84% F1 with a different setup and 83.5% F1 with a directly comparable setup. Our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art models for fine-grained early detection at all time cutoffs, which should help prioritize candidate transients for follow-up observations. We demonstrate label-efficient training by removing labels from 90% of the training data (chosen uniformly at random), and compensate by leveraging regularization, bootstrap ensembling, and unsupervised pretraining. Even with only 10% of the labeled data, we achieve 67.4% F1 on LC-only and 87.1% F1 on LC+metadata, validating an approach that should help mitigate synthetic and observational data drift, and improve classification on tasks with less labeled data. We find that our base model is poorly calibrated via reliability diagrams, and correct it at a minimal cost to overall performance, enabling selections by classification precision. Finally, our GPU-optimized implementation is 9x faster than other state-of-the-art ELAsTiCC models, and can run inference at  33000 LCs/s on a consumer-grade GPU, making it suitable for large-scale applications, and less expensive to train.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experiments reveal extreme water generation during planet formation</a><span class="id">[2511.01351]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The most abundant type of planet discovered in the Galaxy has no analogue in our Solar System and is believed to consist of a rocky interior with an overlying thick H2 dominated envelope.

The models suffer however from the current lack of experimental data on the reaction between hydrogen and silicate melt at high pressures and temperatures. Here we present novel experimental results designed to investigate this interaction. Laser heating diamond anvil cell experiments were conducted between 16 and 60 GPa at temperatures above 4000 K. We find that copious amounts of hydrogen dissolve into the silicate melt with a large dependence on temperature rather than pressure.

This variability can be measured in the light curves of high-contrast companions from the ground by combining differential spectrophotometric monitoring techniques with high-contrast imaging. However, ground-based observations are sensitive to the effects of turbulence in Earth's atmosphere, and while adaptive optics (AO) systems and bespoke data processing techniques help to mitigate these, residual systematics can limit photometric precision. Here, we inject artificial companions to data obtained with an AO system and a vector Apodizing Phase Plate coronagraph to test the level to which telluric and other systematics contaminate such light curves, and thus how well their known variability signals can be recovered. We find that varying companions are distinguishable from non-varying companions, but that variability amplitudes and periods cannot be accurately recovered when observations cover only a small number of periods. Residual systematics remain above the photon noise in the light curves but have not yet reached a noise floor. We also simulate observations to assess how specific systematic sources, such as non-common path aberrations and AO residuals, can impact aperture photometry as a companion moves through pupil-stabilised data. We show that only the lowest-order aberrations are likely to affect flux measurements, but that thermal background noise is the dominant source of scatter in raw companion photometry. Predictive control and focal-plane wavefront sensing techniques will help to further reduce systematics in data of this type.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Derivative-Aligned Anticipation of Forbush Decreases from Entropy and Fractal Markers</a><span class="id">[2511.01506]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a feature-based framework to anticipate Forbush decreases (FDs) from one-minute neutron-monitor data by tracking sliding-window invariants from information theory, scaling, and geometry. For each station and event, we compute marker series (Shannon, spectral, permutation, sample and approximate entropy; Lempel-Ziv complexity; Hurst via DFA; correlation dimension; Higuchi, Katz, and Petrosian fractal dimensions), smooth them with an exponentially weighted moving average, and analyze within-station standardized derivatives relative to the time of the minimum of the smoothed count derivative. Leads are reported in minutes (negative = precedes) and station-level significance is defined on a pre-onset window via a robust z-score detector with bilateral threshold and persistence; no cross-correlation or hypothesis testing is required. Applied to three recent FDs (2023-04-23, 2024-03-24, 2024-05-10), a compact, robust panel-Hurst (DFA), Katz fractal dimension, Shannon and sample entropy, and Lempel-Ziv-consistently precedes the count derivative with substantial station coverage, yielding actionable lead times from tens to several hundred minutes depending on morphology. Some descriptors are event-dependent: permutation and spectral entropy are strongly anticipatory in the extreme May 2024 episode but closer to contemporaneous in the rapid March 2024 case. Heatmaps, violin plots, and station overlays corroborate these patterns. The approach is reproducible from open code, operates on native station units without cross-station homogenization, and is qualitatively stable to window, smoothing, and detector settings. These results support derivative-aligned invariant panels as practical early-warning tools that complement amplitude thresholds and enable nowcasting workflows in space-weather operations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01524" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Ray Detection and Rejection for CSST</a><span class="id">[2511.01524]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As a space telescope, the China Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) will face significant challenges from cosmic ray (CR) contamination.

The limited revisits prompted us to develop an effective single-image CR processing method for CSST. We retrained the DeepCR model based on CSST simulated images and achieved 97.90+-0.18% recall and 98.67+-0.05% precision on CR detection. Moreover, this paper puts forward an innovative morphology-sensitive inpainting method, which focuses more on areas with higher scientific value. We trained a UNet++ model especially on contaminated stellar/galactic areas, alongside adaptive median filtering for background regions. This method achieves effective for CRs with different intensities and different distances from centers of scientific targets. By this approach, the photometric errors of CR-corrected targets could be restricted to the level comparable to those of uncontaminated sources. Also, it increases the detection rate by 13.6% compared to CR masking.

Directly imaging an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star requires reaching 10$^{-10}$ contrast levels and will be the goal of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). A key technical barrier to reaching such deep contrasts is maintaining wavefront stability on the order of tens of picometers, in particular in the presence of a segmented primary mirror. Keck Observatory is the only facility with all of the hardware components necessary for validating HWO segment phasing strategies: a large segmented primary mirror, capacitive edge sensors, deformable mirror, Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS), and high contrast science instruments. Taking advantage of these parallels, we are using Keck as a testbed for developing and validating HWO wavefront sensing and control loop strategies, as well as demonstrating the full system-level segment control architecture for HWO, using existing infrastructure. Recently, we set the stage for this work by using the ZWFS installed on the Keck II telescope to sense and correct the primary mirror segment pistons in closed-loop in parallel with science observations. This resulted in improved Strehl ratios on the NIRC2 science camera (Salama et al. 2024a). We now aim to directly address concerns related to control authority, actuator offload, and loop stability - tasks which require Keck's existing infrastructure, but which do not require picometer wavefront stability. Moreover, successful comparisons of observed and predicted performances will validate, on a real operating observatory, the HWO error budget methodology and in particular its approach to nested loops operating at multiple timescales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extending to the Submillimeter Universe with the CCAT Observatory</a><span class="id">[2511.01707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The CCAT Observatory's Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope, a novel, high-throughput, 6-meter aperture telescope, is scheduled for first light in 2026.

While the $y$-distortion can be detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the $\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$ arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here, we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the $\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$) assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with $\sim$degree-scale angular resolution at $\sim150$ GHz and 1100 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally measure the $y$-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20479" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leveraging pre-trained vision Transformers for multi-band photometric light curve classification</a><span class="id">[2502.20479]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study investigates the potential of a pre-trained visual transformer (VT) model, specifically the Swin Transformer V2 (SwinV2), to classify photometric light curves without the need for feature extraction or multi-band preprocessing. The goal is to assess whether this image-based approach can accurately differentiate astronomical phenomena and serve as a viable option for working with multi-band photometric light curves. We transformed each multi-band light curve into an image. These images serve as input to the SwinV2 model, which is pre-trained on ImageNet-21K. The datasets employed include the public Catalog of Variable Stars from the Massive Compact Halo Object (MACHO) survey, using both one and two bands, and the first round of the recent Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), which includes six bands. The performance of the model was evaluated on six classes for the MACHO dataset and 20 distinct classes of variable stars and transient events for the ELAsTiCC dataset. The fine-tuned SwinV2 achieved better performance than models specifically designed for light curves, such as Astromer and the Astronomical Transformer for Time Series and Tabular Data (ATAT). When trained on the full MACHO dataset, it attained a macro F1-score of 80.2 and outperformed Astromer in single-band experiments. Incorporating a second band further improved performance, increasing the F1-score to 84.1. In the ELAsTiCC dataset, SwinV2 achieved a macro F1-score of 65.5, slightly surpassing ATAT by 1.3.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximizing Ariel's Survey Leverage for Population-Level Studies of Exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2506.06429]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>ESA's Ariel mission will be uniquely suited to performing population-level studies of exoplanets. Most of these studies consist of quantifying trends between an Ariel-measured quantity, y, and an a priori planetary property, x; for example, atmospheric metallicity as inferred from Ariel transit spectroscopy vs. planetary mass. The precision with which we can quantify such trends depends on the number of targets in the survey and their variance in the a priori parameter. We define the leverage of a survey with N targets as L = sqrt(N)stdev(x) and show that it quantitatively predicts the precision of population-level trends. The target selection challenge of Ariel can therefore be summarized as maximizing L along some axes of diversity for a given cumulative observing time. To this end, we consider different schemes to select the mission reference sample for a notional three year transit spectroscopy survey with Ariel. We divide the exoplanets in the mission candidate sample into logarithmic classes based on radius, equilibrium temperature and host star temperature. We then construct a target list by cyclically choosing the easiest remaining target in each class. We find that the leverage on a single axis of diversity can be increased by dividing that axis into many classes, but this sacrifices leverage along other axes of diversity. We conclude that a modest number of classes, possibly only one, should be defined when selecting Ariel targets. Lastly, we note that the statistical leverage of the Ariel transit survey would be significantly increased if current candidate planets were confirmed. This highlights the urgency of vetting and confirming the easiest transmission and emission spectroscopy targets in the Ariel mission candidate sample.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar Low Energy X-ray Spectrometer on board Aditya-L1: Ground Calibration and In-flight Performance</a><span class="id">[2509.26292]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Solar Low-Energy X-ray Spectrometer (SoLEXS) on board India's Aditya-L1 mission was launched on 2 September 2023 and commenced solar observations on 13 December 2023 following successful aperture cover deployment. Operating from the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point, SoLEXS has been providing continuous Sun-as-a-star soft X-ray spectroscopy across 2-22 keV with 170 eV resolution at 5.9 keV and 1-second temporal cadence since 6 January 2024. The instrument employs two Silicon Drift Detectors with aperture areas of 7.1 mm$^2$ and 0.1 mm$^2$ to accommodate the full dynamic range of solar activity from A-class to X-class flares. This paper presents comprehensive ground and on board calibration procedures that establish SoLEXS's quantitative spectroscopic capabilities. Ground calibration encompassed energy-channel relationships, spectral resolution characterization, instrument response functions, and collimator angular response measurements, with thermo-vacuum testing validating performance stability across operational temperature ranges. On board calibration utilizing an internal $^{55}$Fe source demonstrated preserved post-launch spectral resolution (164.9-171.2 eV), while cross-calibration with GOES-XRS and Chandrayaan-2/XSM confirmed radiometric accuracy and flux agreement. The instrument's 100% observational duty cycle at L1 enables unprecedented continuous monitoring of solar flare evolution across all intensity classes, providing calibrated data for advancing coronal heating mechanisms, flare energetics, and flare-coronal mass ejection relationship studies through soft X-ray spectroscopy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Water Management Considerations for a Self-Sustaining Moonbase</a><span class="id">[2405.14100]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The most pragmatic first step in the all-but-inevitable 3rd-millennium Völkerwanderung of humanity throughout the Solar System is the establishment of a permanent human presence on the Moon.

A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks – to predict cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions, and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning. For the latter, we study different approaches – from simple linear models that are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far longer training time. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at this https URL</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</a><span class="id">[2508.10855]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a time-dependent, end-to-end framework for laser power beaming from cislunar orbits to the lunar surface. The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target Wh day$^{-1}$ and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2 m-class phased array at 1064 nm the reference geometry yields $\sim$0.6–0.8 kWh day$^{-1}$ to a 1 m$^2$ receiver (about 28 W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\rm eff}^{2}$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10 m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\rm tx}=100$ kW delivers $\sim$30–50 kWh day$^{-1}$ at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.</p></div></details></article></body>
