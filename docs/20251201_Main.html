We investigate the cosmological evolution and optical appearance of black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity coupled with Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy (KHDE). Utilizing Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) datasets, we constrain model parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. Results indicate that the late-time universe statistically favors a phantom-like equation of state ($c \approx 0.704$). Regarding the EGB coupling $\alpha$, although data favor a positive value, the parameter space permits negative values down to a theoretical stability cut-off at $\alpha \approx -0.03$. While the best-fit suggests deviation, results remain consistent with General Relativity ($\alpha=0$) within the $2\sigma$ confidence level. Based on these constraints, we model the secular mass accretion history (treating accretion efficiency as a phenomenological constant) and compute the shadow radius evolution. We find that in a realistic dispersive plasma environment, refractive effects significantly mask intrinsic gravitational and dark energy signatures, causing global shadow shrinkage. Nevertheless, a characteristic systematic intrinsic deviation of $\sim 1\%$–$1.5\%$ (under a conservative accretion scenario) persists at redshifts $z \lesssim 1.5$ relative to standard $\Lambda$CDM predictions. These findings suggest that despite environmental dominance, precise statistical analyses of shadow populations could disentangle these subtle dynamic dark energy signals from the standard cosmological paradigm.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asteroseismic detection of an internal magnetic field in the B0.5V pulsator HD 192575</a><span class="id">[2511.21812]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Internal magnetic fields are an elusive component of stellar structure. However, they can play an important role in stellar structure and evolution models through efficient angular momentum transport and their impact on internal mixing. We strive to explain the 9 components of one frequency multiplet, identified as a low-order quadrupole gravity mode detected in the light curve of the beta Cep pulsator HD 192575 assembled by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We update the frequencies of the quadrupole mode under investigation using a standard prewhitening method applied to the 1951.46 d TESS light curve, showing that an internal magnetic field is required to simultaneously explain all 9 components. We implement theoretical pulsation computations applicable to the low-order modes of a beta Cep pulsator including the Coriolis force, as well as a magnetic field that is misaligned with respect to the rotation axis. We apply the theoretical description to perform asteroseismic modelling of the amplitudes and frequencies in the multiplet of the quadrupole g-mode of this evolved beta Cep star. Pulsation predictions based on the measured internal rotation frequency of the star cannot explain the observed 9-component frequency splittings of the quadrupole low-order gravity mode. By contrast, we show that the combined effect of the Coriolis force caused by the near-core rotation with a period of about 5.3 d and the Lorentz force due to an internal inclined magnetic field with a maximum strength of around 24 kG does provide a proper explanation of the 9 multiplet frequencies and their relative amplitudes. Given the stellar mass of about 12 solar masses, this work presents the detection and magneto-gravito-asteroseismic modelling of a stable internal magnetic field buried inside an evolved rotating supernova progenitor.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21817" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Paradigm Shift in Exoplanet False Positive Identification with HIP-44302</a><span class="id">[2511.21817]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Through detailed modeling of all three stars, we show that HIP-44302 is a false positive triple-star system. While the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite initially designated the object as a planetary candidate, observing a 10-day transit and secondary eclipse in Sectors 8 and 35, we definitively exclude this scenario, finding instead that the transit comes from eclipsing stellar companions with $P = 9.599214$ days and $a = 0.1415$ AU. This binary orbits a single star at a wide separation of $\rho = 0.2946''$, determined through high-resolution AO and speckle imaging and corresponding to a $\sim$297 AU, $\sim$1886-year orbit at a distance of 1010 pc. Using transit data and photometry, we use EXOFASTv2 to fit the transit light curve, spectral energy distribution, and MIST evolutionary models of the three stars. We find that the isolated star and the larger binary star are massive A stars, with the single star having evolved off the main sequence, while the smaller companion is a G star. We also found an unusually low rotational velocity of 2.3 km/s from the single A star, observed from MINERVA and TRES RVs, implying a pole-on orientation. The triple-star architecture derived from multiple data sources made this target a complex system that required new capabilities within EXOFASTv2 to properly model. Our successful modeling demonstrates a new paradigm for false positive identification and classification that incorporates imaging, photometry, transits, and global modeling to definitively rule out false positives that may otherwise pollute candidate catalogs without extensive follow-up observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of magnetic fields during tidal disruption events</a><span class="id">[2511.21818]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During a tidal disruption event (TDE) the stream debris inherits the magnetic field of the star. As the stream stretches, the magnetic field evolves and can eventually become dynamically important. We study this effect by means of magnetohydrodynamic simulations and a semi-analytic model of the disruption of a main-sequence star by a supermassive black hole. For stellar magnetic fields stronger than $\sim 10^4\,\rm{G}$, magnetic pressure becomes important in a significant fraction of the mass of the stream, leading to a fast increase in its thickness, an effect that may impact its subsequent evolution. We find that this dynamical effect is associated with a phase of transverse equilibrium between magnetic and tidal forces, which causes the stream width to increase with distance to the black hole as $H \propto R^{5/4}$. In the unbound tail, this fast expansion could enhance the radio emission produced by the interaction with the ambient medium, while in the returning stream, it may qualitatively affect the subsequent gas evolution, particularly the gas dynamics and radiative properties of shocks occurring after the stream's return to pericentre. By characterizing the magnetohydrodynamic properties of the stream from disruption to the first return to pericentre, this work provides physically motivated initial conditions for future studies of the later phases of TDEs, accounting for magnetic fields. This will ultimately shed light on the role of magnetic fields in enabling angular momentum transport in the ensuing accretion disk, thereby affecting observable signatures such as X-ray radiation and relativistic outflows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evaluating Star-Planet Interactions with Zeeman Doppler Imaging: Case Study in YZ Ceti</a><span class="id">[2511.21853]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recent detections of radio emission from the nearby exoplanet host, YZ Ceti, suggest that the star is possibly interacting with its rocky innermost planet. These radio emissions are characterized by strong circular polarization, and appear to repeat within consistent orbital phase windows dictated by the orbital position of YZ Ceti b. If confirmed, this interaction would provide a first means to concretely assess the magnetic field of a close-in rocky exoplanet. This kind of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI) should depend on both the exoplanetary orbit, and the geometry of the stellar magnetic field. In this article, we report measurements of the large-scale magnetic field topology of the star YZ Ceti for the first time, and interpret the cumulative radio data sets in that context to evaluate the plausibility of magnetic SPIs. We find evidence both against and in support of the SPI hypothesis, but crucially that the measured magnetic field does not rule out SPI scenarios. However, clear evaluation of these possibilities requires more accurate assessments of the magnetic field evolution across time. We additionally suggest that YZ Ceti may be exhibiting planet-induced flaring potentially triggered by exoplanet crossings of the Alfvén surface as the planet orbit approaches the stellar magnetic equator, and YZ Ceti b experiences dramatic shifts in the ambient field, its polarity, and connectivity to the host star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Waves as a Probe of Core Collapse Supernova Progenitor Structure</a><span class="id">[2511.21895]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the gravitational wave predictions from two-dimensional core collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations initiated from two nearly identical progenitors that have significantly different internal structures due to their late-stage stellar evolution. At the time of collapse, the 15.78 $M_{\odot}$ and 15.79 $M_{\odot}$ progenitors have compactness parameters $\xi_{2.5}$ of 0.136 and 0.206, respectively. We connect several features of the gravitational wave signal from each model to its previously explored explosion dynamics. In particular, the greater accretion onto the PNS of the more compact model is evident in broad-band frequency features with larger amplitude gravitational wave strains and greater gravitational wave energy release when compared to the less compact model. Additionally, the faster contraction rate of the more compact model is reflected in the $\sim$26% greater slope of the $g$-/$f$-mode feature (gfF) evolution of the gravitational wave signal. This work shows that in principle gravitational wave detection may provide information about interior stellar structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21949" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: $B$-mode delensing with DR6 data and external tracers of large-scale structure</a><span class="id">[2511.21949]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large-scale $B$-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a prime target for current and future experiments in search of primordial gravitational waves (PGW). With increasingly sensitive instruments being deployed, secondary $B$-modes induced by the weak gravitational lensing of CMB photons are becoming an important limitation and need to be removed, a process known as delensing. In this work, we combine internally reconstructed CMB lensing maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 with galaxy samples from unWISE and a map of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) fluctuations from Planck to produce a well-correlated tracer of the CMB lensing field. Our co-added tracer, shown to be 55-85% correlated with the true lensing convergence at multipoles $L \leq 2000$, is then convolved with ACT DR6 $E$-mode polarization to yield a template of the lensing $B$-modes. We assess its performance on a wide range of scales by using it to delens ACT DR6 and Planck $B$-modes over 23% of the sky, removing around 39% of the lensing power at $100\leq l \leq 1500$ and 47% at $30 \leq l \leq 300$, respectively. Our template achieves the highest delensing efficiency to date and will be useful for the analysis of early polarization maps from the Simons Observatory (SO). We finally outline prospects for further improvements by including additional large-scale structure tracers from upcoming cosmological surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vibrationally excited H2 mutes the He i triplet line at 1.08 μm on warm exo-Neptunes</a><span class="id">[2511.21966]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Neptune-sized exoplanets or exo-Neptunes are fundamental in the description of exoplanet diversity. Their evolution is sculpted by atmospheric escape, often traced by absorption in the H i Lyman-{\alpha} line at 1,216 Å and the He i triplet line at 1.08 {\mu}m. On warm exo-Neptunes HAT-P-11 b, GJ 3470 b and GJ 436 b, H i Lyman-{\alpha} absorption causes extreme in-transit obscuration of their host stars. This suggests that He i triplet line absorption will also be strong, yet it has only been identified on two of these planets. Aims. We explore previously unaccounted for processes that might attenuate the He i triplet line on warm exo-Neptunes. In particular, we assess the role of vibrationally excited H2 to remove the He+ ion that acts as precursor of the absorbing He(2$^3$S ). Methods. We formed thermal rate coefficients for this chemical process, leveraging the available theoretical and experimental data. The process becomes notably fast at the temperatures expected in the atmospheric layers probed by the He i triplet line. Results. Our simulations show that the proposed process severely mutes the line on GJ 3470 b and causes the nondetection on GJ 436 b. The overall efficiency of this mechanism is connected to where in the atmosphere the H2-to-H transition occurs and, ultimately, to the amount of high-energy radiation received by the planet. The process will be more significant on small exoplanets than on hotter or more massive ones, as for the latter the H2-to-H transition generally occurs deeper in the atmosphere. Conclusions. Weak He i triplet line absorption need not imply the lack of a primordial, H2-He-dominated atmosphere, an idea to bear in mind when interpreting the observations of other small exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interferometric view into RT Pav's long secondary period. binary vs oscillatory convective modes</a><span class="id">[2511.21987]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long secondary periods (LSPs) occur in about one-third of evolved stars, yet their origin remains unclear. The leading explanations are oscillatory convective modes and a binary companion embedded in dust. We investigate the LSP of the red giant RT Pav using multi-wavelength VLTI interferometry (PIONIER, GRAVITY, MATISSE; 1.5-5.0 microns), obtained near the phase where a companion would appear most separated. These data, combined with photometry and Gaia DR3 astrometry, constrain possible companion masses, orbits, and photometric effects. We model the interferometric observables using uniform-disk, limb-darkened, ellipse, binary, and oscillatory convective dipole representations, supported by Monte Carlo simulations. Gaia limits any companion to a mass whose Roche-lobe volume is too small to hold the obscuring or scattering material required to reproduce the observed LSP modulation. While binary fits can yield low chi-squared values, the inferred positions are inconsistent across wavelength, closure phases do not increase with wavelength as dusty companions predict, and significant detections occur in only two of four bands. Theoretical estimates show that a roughly 1 percent flux companion at LSP-like separations should be consistently detectable for typical O-rich AGB dust, but is not consistently observed. In contrast, an oscillatory convective dipole with a temperature contrast of about 200 K reproduces the H-band morphology and visible-light amplitude without violating Gaia or photometric constraints, and binary-like residuals vanish when dipole models are fitted. Our results therefore favor oscillatory convective modes over a binary origin for the LSP in RT Pav. Time-resolved spectro-interferometry across the LSP cycle is a natural next step.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21991" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical implementation of flat FLRW models of cosmic expansion with Planck 2018 cosmological parameters</a><span class="id">[2511.21991]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an explicit numerical implementation of the Friedmann equations to model the expansion of the Universe in spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies. Using cosmological parameters from the Planck 2018 results for the concordance LCDM model, we compute the evolution of the scale factor a(t) by integrating the Friedmann acceleration equation together with the continuity equation for a perfect fluid with barotropic equation of state p = w*rho. The model includes radiation, non-relativistic matter, and a dark-energy component with constant equation-of-state parameter w. An explicit Euler scheme implemented in Python is used to evolve a(t) into the past and the future, allowing exploration of the qualitative behavior of the expansion for different values of w, including the LCDM case (w = -1), phantom energy (w &lt; -1), and values associated with domain walls and cosmic strings. The simulations qualitatively reproduce the standard radiation-, matter-, and dark-energy-dominated expansion regimes. The code is simple and modular, and is intended as a computational and pedagogical tool for undergraduate and graduate cosmology courses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Properties of GRB Accreting Magnetar with $R/I$ Evolutionary Effects Using \emph{Swift}/XRT Data</a><span class="id">[2511.22149]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A newly born millisecond magnetar has been proposed as one possible central engine of some long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with X-ray plateau. In this work, we used a universal correlation between initial spin period ($P_0$) and surface magnetic field ($B_p$) of newborn magnetar based on an LGRB sample in \cite{Lan2025} to explore the propeller properties of accreting magnetar with $R/I$ evolutionary effects. We found that $B_p-P_0$ relation is approximately consistent with $B_p\propto P_{\rm eq}^{7/6}$. Here, $P_{\rm eq}$ is equilibrium spin period in magnetic propeller model. The $B_p-P_0$ relation indicates that $P_0$ may not be true initial spin period of newborn magnetar, but had reached an equilibrium spin period via fallback accretion in propeller model. The magnetar accretion rate in our LGRBs is in range of $\dot{M}\sim10^{-5}-10^{-2} M_{\odot} \rm s^{-1}$ by incorporating $R/I$ evolutionary effects, and using the transition relation between gravitational mass $M_g$ and baryonic mass $M_b$ in different equation of states. Such accretion rates ensure that the accreting magnetars in our sample survive until reaching the equilibrium spin period, and the accretion rate is one order of magnitude lower compared to the statistical results in \cite{Stratta2018} and \cite{Linweili2020}, which used constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario. We suggested that adopting a constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario for modeling propeller regime in accreting magnetar results in a higher mass accretion rate, which may impair our understanding of the physical nature and its surroundings of accreting magnetar, and low-metallicity progenitors can provide enough material to satisfy the accretion requirements of newborn accreting magnetar in LGRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forecasting Primordial Non-Gaussianity from UNIONS Lyman-Break Galaxies and Planck CMB lensing</a><span class="id">[2511.22243]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs), characterized by $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, provide a powerful window into the physics of inflation. Cross-correlating high-redshift tracer samples with the CMB lensing potential offers a particularly robust probe of PNGs, mitigating imaging systematics that typically affect large-scale measurements from tracer auto-spectra. In this context, UNIONS enables the selection of $u$-dropout high-redshift Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs). We perform a MCMC-based forecast to estimate the uncertainties on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ and on a galaxy bias parameter, which captures our uncertainty in the tracer bias. From the angular cross-power spectrum between LBGs and Planck CMB lensing, we forecast $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=34$ for an idealized photometric sample of $r&lt;24.3$ LBGs selected with a Random Forest classification algorithm from UNIONS-like $ugriz$ imaging, with a resulting surface density of $1,100$ deg$^{-2}$. This precision can be improved to $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=20$ after spectroscopic follow-up with DESI, during its next phase starting in 2029, DESI-II. We test a more realistic $u$-dropout LBG selection using early UNIONS data, which yields a denser sample of $r&lt;24.2$ objects at $1,400$ deg$^{-2}$. From this sample, covering a larger footprint and expected to have a higher large-scale galaxy bias, we forecast $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=20$, with similar precision achievable after DESI spectroscopic follow-up. In addition, we perform preliminary validation of the redshift distribution using the clustering-redshift method with DESI DR1 data, confirming the calibration from deep, small-area photometric fields. However, accounting for uncertainties in the clustering-redshift distribution significantly degrades the $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ constraining power.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22309" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astrophysical constraints from future measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2511.22309]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) will soon allow for the unprecedented detection of small-scale secondary anisotropies, such as the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. Linking the kSZ power spectrum to the properties of ionising sources would provide an opportunity to use such observations to access astrophysical and cosmological information from the Epoch of Reionisation, including the morphology of ionised regions, while simultaneously improving CMB analyses. The aim of this work is to assess this potential of the kSZ power spectrum to measure reionisation-era galaxy properties. We repurpose the publicly available LoReLi II simulations, which track the evolution of neutral hydrogen during reionisation, to generate a training set of patchy kSZ angular power spectra. We then train an emulator using neural network regression in order to allow for efficient Bayesian inference, and conduct forecasts assuming mock observations from current and future CMB experiments. We find that measurements of the kSZ power spectrum from such surveys can provide meaningful constraints on several of the astrophysical model parameters of the LoReLi II suite, including the ionising escape fraction for which we expect a 14% relative error, on average. They also provide an independent measurement of the CMB optical depth, marginalised over the astrophysics and with error bars competitive with the cosmic variance limit from large scale surveys. The kSZ power spectrum offers a promising avenue for probing the properties of reionisation-era galaxies and providing an independent measurement of the CMB optical depth with upcoming CMB experiments. Since the error budget of our mock observations is dominated by emulator reconstruction errors, we expect our results could be further improved with a more extended simulation training set.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The First Scientific Flight and Observations of the 50-mm Balloon-Borne White-Light Coronagraph</a><span class="id">[2511.22336]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A 50-mm balloon-borne white-light coronagraph (BBWLC) to observe whitelight solar corona over the altitude range from 1.08 to 1.50 solar radii has recently been indigenously developed by Yunnan Observatories in collaboration with Shangdong University (in Weihai) and Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, which will significantly improve the ability of China to detect and measure inner corona. On 2022 October 4, its first scientific flight took place at the Dachaidan area in Qinghai province of China. We describe briefly the BBWLC mission including its optical design, mechanical structure, pointing system, the first flight and results associated with the data processing approach. Preliminary analysis of the data shows that BBWLC imaged the Kcorona with three streamer structures on the west limb of the Sun. To further confirm the coronal signals obtained by BBWLC, comparisonswere made with observations of the Kcoronagraph of the High Altitude Observatory and the Atmospheric ImagingAssembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory.

Interstellar dust is also directly observed in the vicinity of the Sun with dust detectors onboard spacecraft, and it is known to be affected by the interplanetary magnetic field. The main goal of this work is to show how the change in the interplanetary magnetic field with the solar cycle affects the infrared picture of the heliosphere. To compose a synthetic intensity map of the interstellar dust thermal emission, we used the Monte Carlo method to calculate the distribution of the dust particles inside the heliosphere. We considered the effects of the heliosphere boundaries and the non-stationary current sheet. The change in the Parker magnetic field caused by the solar activity cycle leads distinguishable features in the mid-infrared emission maps of the heliosphere. The distribution of the interstellar dust in the vicinity of the Sun we calculated suggests that small particles linger outside of the heliosphere, and medium-size particles are mostly affected by the changing interplanetary magnetic field, which leads to number density waves in the tail region of the heliosphere. Finally, large particles form a bulge behind the Sun.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clustering in dynamical dark energy: observational constraints from DESI, CMB, and supernovae</a><span class="id">[2511.22478]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the clustering properties of dynamical dark energy using the latest cosmological observations. We describe the dark energy perturbation within two complementary frameworks, namely the Parameterized Post-Friedmann (PPF) approach and the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of dark energy. Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations together with Planck 2018 CMB data and the Union3 supernova sample, we constrain the effective sound speed of dark energy in both the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM backgrounds. Within the PPF description, the sound speed remains unconstrained for $w$CDM, while for the $w_0w_a$CDM case we obtain $\log_{10} c_s^2 = -3.00^{+2.9}_{-0.99}$. Additionally, in the EFT framework, both models favor a small sound speed, with a mean value $c_s^2 \simeq 0.3$–$0.4$ but with significant uncertainties. For dynamical dark energy, the reconstructed equation of state clearly exhibits a quintom-B behavior, and its deviation from $\Lambda$CDM reaches $3.42\sigma$, rising to $3.63\sigma$ when PPF perturbations are included and reducing to $3.19\sigma$ in the EFT case. Finally, model comparison using information criteria shows that the $w_0w_a$CDM model with a smooth, non-clustering dark energy component ($c_s^2 = 1$) is preferred by AIC, whereas BIC favors $\Lambda$CDM. In summary, current data indicate a mild preference for dynamical dark energy but no evidence for significant clustering, which implies the need for future high-precision observations to probe the perturbative behavior more definitively.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robust evidence for dynamical dark energy in light of DESI DR2 and joint ACT, SPT, and Planck data</a><span class="id">[2511.22512]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI, when combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest a significant preference for dynamical dark energy (DDE) that exhibits the phantom-like behavior in the past and has transitioned into quintessence-like behavior today. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of six representative DDE parametrization models by utilizing the latest and most precise CMB data jointly from ACT, SPT, and Planck, in conjunction with BAO data from DESI DR2 and SN data from DESY5, PantheonPlus, and Union3. Our overall analysis indicates that the preference for DDE in the Quintom-B regime remains robust, regardless of the DDE parameterization model and the data combination employed. The trend of this preference is significantly strengthened with the support of DESY5 SN data. Specifically, when using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, for the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.785 \pm 0.047$ and $w_a = -0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, which significantly deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM values and provide evidence for DDE at the $4.2\sigma$ level. By the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$, normalized dark energy density $f_{\mathrm{DE}}(z)$, and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we also observe clear departures from $\Lambda$CDM, further reinforcing the case for DDE. Furthermore, the Bayesian evidence analysis indicates that the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, BA and Exponential models are moderately favored relative to $\Lambda$CDM based on the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Needle in a Poissonian haystack – An X-ray astronomer's guide to QPE fishing</a><span class="id">[2511.22520]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>After six years of studies following the discovery of GSN069, a link is starting to appear between the elusive Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) and other types of nuclear transients, among which are Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs). As such, observing strategies are adapting, with a current trend focusing on late-time X-ray follow-ups of (optical) TDEs. While these campaigns are so far proving quite successful, the inherent confirmation bias they introduce in our sample could lead the community to hasty, and perhaps erroneous, conclusions. It is thus important to still pursue the search for nuclear transients in other, more agnostic directions. In this work, we focus on the observational aspects of our field, and lay out two different methods that can be deployed in order to reveal new QPE sources. These complementary methods enable the detection of long-term ($\sim$years) and short term ($\sim$minutes) transient events, that would have otherwise been missed by the standard detection pipelines. Both of these methods can be used either for data mining in the 25 years worth of XMM-Newton archive, or to trigger real-time follow-ups upon a more recent discovery.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards Understanding the Origin of Swift Gamma-Ray Bursts Driven by Magnetars</a><span class="id">[2511.22534]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze a sample of\textit{ Swift} gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with extended emissions in $\gamma$-rays and/or X-ray plateaus that may be driven by magnetars. Multi-wavelength data and multi-standards have been adopted to investigate the issue jointly. First, we find that GRBs with both extended emission and X-ray plateau satisfy a three-parameter relation between the luminosity and the end time of X-ray plateaus and the $\gamma$-ray isotropic energy as $L_X\varpropto T_a^{-1.13}E_{\gamma,iso}^{0.74}$, which is consistent with that of normal GRBs. Second, we distinguish these GRBs in the plane of magnetic field versus period of neutron star and find that almost all GRBs but GRB 211024B have reasonable periods and majority of them could be powered by magnetars. Third, we standardize the X-ray afterglows with distinct characteristics and find that the standard X-ray light curves with/without plateaus are significantly different. The standardized X-ray plateaus are similar to the mean temporal profile of magnetars. Fourth, it is verified with a K-S test that all types of GRBs except short ones have the similar distributions of redshift and isotropic energy in the observer/rest frame. GRBs with internal plateaus are significantly different from those of normal long GRBs and GRBs with external plateaus and/or extended emissions. Interestingly, the isotropic energy distributions of GRBs with internal and external plateaus are identical with those of short and long GRBs, respectively. Overall, our study can bring solid evidence that the fascinating magnetars could have multi-formation channels to account for not only short but also long GRBs with either internal or external X-ray plateaus as well.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmology of axion dark energy in supersymmetric models and constraints on high scale parameters</a><span class="id">[2511.22559]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>An analysis is given of interacting dark energy and dark matter where the dark energy is assumed to be an ultralight axionic field with a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson potential which is in general a superposition of $N$ number of cosine terms motivated by supergravity and string models with a $U(1)$ global symmetry, where the symmetry is broken by instanton effects. The case $N=2$ is investigated in detail and a fit to cosmological data is performed where it is found that a better fit is obtained in comparison with the $N=1$ case. The fits also constrain high scale parameters, i.e., the axion decay constant which is determined to be sub-Planckian, a result consistent with string theory that disfavors trans-Planckian axion decay constant. Furthermore, the dark energy-dark matter interaction strength is constrained to be feeble, i.e., $\lambda\lesssim 4\times 10^{-6}$ m$_{\rm Pl}^{-2}$ Mpc$^{-2}$. We study possible implications of this type of potential on the Hubble tension and on the dynamics of the dark energy equation of state using the DESI-DR2 data. For the cases $N=3,4$, the analysis exhibits the phenomenon of transmutation even in the absence of coupling to dark matter, where thawing quintessence transmutes to freezing quintessence. The analysis is internally consistent in its treatment of the dark energy-dark matter interaction as it is based on an underlying Lagrangian, in contrast with several previous works where the sources are chosen in an ad hoc manner to satisfy energy conservation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22573" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The network analysis of the cosmic web as a tool to constrain cosmology and cosmic magnetism</a><span class="id">[2511.22573]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. The spatial distribution of haloes in the Cosmic Web encodes a wealth of information about the underlying cosmological model.

Using our new MAKITRA suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations covering a total volume of $(300\,\text{Mpc})^3$ and with 21 physical model variations (including variations of $\sigma_8$ and of different models of primordial magnetic fields, PMFs), we investigate the sensitivity of network-based statistics describing the Cosmic Web to variations in cosmological and PMF scenarios. Methods. We focus on several complementary metrics that characterise the spatial distribution of dark and baryonic matter haloes: two-point correlation functions, network-centrality statistics, and counts-in-cell measurements. We first compare the halo-halo correlation functions across different cosmological models. For the network analysis, we represent haloes as vertices of the Cosmic Web and compute multiple centrality measures, whose cumulative distributions we evaluate for universes with varying PMF strengths. Finally, we quantify halo abundances within randomly placed spheres of fixed radius to assess differences between scenarios. Results. First, we find that the statistics of the centralities of the network can serve as a novel sensitive probe of the cosmological parameter $\sigma_8$. Moreover, we find that this network analysis approach can allow us to distinguish the presence of PMFs with initial strength $\approx\,4 \text{nG}$ from the scenarios with much weaker PMFs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forecasting Constraint on Primordial Black Hole Properties with the CSST $3\times2$pt Analysis</a><span class="id">[2511.22575]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study forecasts the constraints on the properties of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a cold dark matter component using the galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing (i.e. $3\times2$pt) measurements from the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) photometric survey. Since PBHs formed via gravitational collapse in the early Universe, they can additionally affect the formation and evolution of the cosmic large-scale structure (LSS) through the “Poisson&quot; effect. We compute the angular power spectra for PBH-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and generate mock data based on the CSST instrumental and survey design. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed to constrain the free parameters, such as the product of the PBH fraction and mass $f_{\rm PBH}m_{\rm PBH}$ and other cosmological parameters. The systematic parameters are also included in the fitting process, such as the parameters of the baryonic effect, intrinsic alignment, galaxy bias, photometric redshift (photo-$z$) calibration, shear calibration, and noise terms. We find that the CSST 3$\times$2pt analysis can achieve tight constraints on $f_{\rm PBH}m_{\rm PBH}$, with 68% and 95% confidence levels (CLs) reaching $&lt;10^{3.9} M_{\odot}$ and $&lt;10^{4.7} M_{\odot}$, respectively. Additionally, the cosmological parameters, e.g. $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and $w$, can be constrained with the precisions of 3.3%, 1.7%, 13%, respectively. This indicates that the CSST 3$\times$2pt analysis is a powerful tool to advance the PBH dark matter studies in the near future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skew-spectra: a generalization to spin-$s$</a><span class="id">[2511.22596]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Skew-spectra allow us to extract non-Gaussian information by taking the square of a map and finding the power spectrum of this new map with the original map.

Specifically, the relative alignments of the dark matter (DM) halo, stars, and hot intracluster gas in these clusters offer insights into how well theoretical structure predictions hold. We measure the position angles, ellipticities, and locations/centroids of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), the Intracluster Light (ICL), the hot Intracluster Medium (ICM), and the Core Lensing Mass (CLM) for a sample of strong lensing galaxy clusters from the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS). We measure the shapes (position angles and ellipticities) and centroids of these distributions using ellipse-fitting methods applied to different datasets: HST WFC3 imaging for the BCG and ICL, Chandra X-ray observations for the ICM, and strong-lensing mass reconstructions for the CLM. Additionally, we incorporate ICM morphological measures to classify the dynamical state of the cluster sample. Using this multi-component approach, we constrain the shape and centroids of these distributions in this sample and evaluate the different observable components in terms of their ability to trace the gravitational potential of their respective clusters. We find that misalignments between cluster components can be explained by astrophysical processes related to cluster assembly, relaxation, and merger histories. We find that the ICL is most closely aligned with its host DM halo, as traced by the CLM distribution, in both position angle and centroid. Additionally, we find that on average the ICL and CLM are more elliptical than the ICM and BCG.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22670" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vortex Dynamics in the Neutron Star Inner Crust</a><span class="id">[2511.22670]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the superfluid vortex motion in the neutron star inner crust through direct three-dimensional simulations of the coupled dynamics of the vortex and the nuclear lattice. We demonstrate the pinning of an initially moving vortex to the lattice through excitation of lattice vibrations, and show that the efficiency of this process is higher for attractive than for repulsive nucleus-vortex interactions. We explore the unpinning of a vortex under the action of the applied Magnus force, and find that it is influenced by multiple parameters, including the sign of the pinning force, the lattice orientation, composition, temperature, and the energy of pinning to individual nucleus. In lattices with multiple grains, the unpinning transition is triggered inside the grains with weaker pinning, propagates along the vortex (mediated by the excited Kelvin waves) and crosses into grains with stronger pinning. This is likely to effectively decrease the critical force at which vortices unpin and to produce extended regions of unpinned vorticity. Shearing of the crust lattice (e.g., by a starquake) initiates the unpinning of the vortices that are crossing the slip plane.

However, dust growth barriers appear to impede the ability to assemble sufficiently large dust particles to trigger strong clumping, providing a serious impediment to planetesimal formation. Aims: We aim to address the possibility to enhance dust clumping with dust growth in SI-produced structures, and to estimate the impact of the shift of the dust fragmentation threshold in regions where the SI has enhanced the dust density. Methods: We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations of the SI with a monodisperse description of dust growth, accounting for the impact of mass loading of the dust on the sound speed of the gas and dust mixture when computing dust collisional velocities. Results: Dust mass loading reduces collision velocities in high density regions, allowing dust particles to survive to larger sizes before shattering. In turn, dust clumping is boosted as particles grow in size, as long as they remain sufficiently coupled to the gas. Conclusions: This two-way synergy between dust growth and clumping, which depends on the initial dust-to-gas ratio and dust elastic properties, allows denser dust clumps to form and thus facilitates the onset of planetesimal formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EMU and Euclid: Detection of a radio-optical galaxy clustering cross-correlation signal between the Evolutionary Map of the Universe and Euclid</a><span class="id">[2511.22732]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Synergies between large-scale radio-continuum and optical/near-infrared galaxy surveys are a powerful tool for cosmology.

We perform the first measurement of the clustering cross-spectrum between radio-continuum sources in the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey and galaxies from the ESA Euclid satellite mission's Q1 release. Our goal is to detect and characterise the cross-correlation signal, test its robustness against systematic effects, and compare our measurements with theoretical predictions. We use data from the Australian SKA Pathfinder's EMU Main Survey, which overlaps with the Euclid Deep Field South. We generate two radio-source catalogues using different source finders to create galaxy maps. We measure the harmonic-space cross-correlation signal using a pseudo-spectrum estimator. The measured signal is compared to theoretical predictions based on a {\Lambda}CDM cosmology, using several models for the EMU source redshift distribution and bias. We report detection above 8{\sigma} of the cross-correlation signal consistent across all tested models and data sets. The measured cross-spectra from the two radio catalogues are in excellent agreement, demonstrating that the cross-correlation is robust against the choice of source-finding algorithm. The measured signal also agrees with theoretical models developed from previous cross-correlation studies and simulations. This pathfinder study establishes a statistically significant cross-correlation between EMU and Euclid. The robustness of the signal is a crucial validation of the methodology, paving the way for future large-scale analyses leveraging the full power of this synergy to constrain cosmological parameters and our understanding of galaxy evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Shear-to-Cosmology Paradigm I: Hybrid Field-Level and Simulation-Based Framework for Weak Lensing Surveys</a><span class="id">[2511.22851]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Precise cosmological inference from next-generation weak lensing surveys requires extracting non-Gaussian information beyond standard two-point statistics.

The FLI network extracts rich non-Gaussian information from the shear field to produce informative features, which are then used by SBI to model the resulting complex posteriors. To mitigate noise from intrinsic galaxy shapes, we develop a blind, training-free, PCA-based shear denoising method. Tests on CSST-like mock catalogs reveal significant performance gains. The shear-based inference achieves approximately twice the cosmological constraining power in Figure of Merit (FoM) compared to the conventional convergence-based approach. Moreover, the combination of PCA denoising and ML compression can deliver a 36.4% improvement in FoM over standard shear two-point statistics.

We also compare the spectrophotometric evolution of SN 2021ukt with several well-sampled supernovae that exhibit a short plateau and persistent ejecta-CSM interaction. An estimate of the progenitor mass of SN 2021ukt is made based on the flux ratio between [Ca II] {\lambda}{\lambda} 7291, 7324 and [O I] {\lambda}{\lambda} 6300, 6364 during its nebular phase. Our analysis suggests that the progenitor star of SN 2021ukt has a zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass of about 12 solar masses, a mass of radioactive nickel-56 synthesized in the SN ejecta of about 0.04 solar masses, and a mass of the H-rich envelope of about 0.5 solar masses.

In this work, we propose to encode information on neutron star physics into data-driven prior distributions constructed with normalizing flows, referred to as neural priors. These priors take input from constraints on the nuclear equation of state and neutron star population models. Applied to GW170817, GW190425, and GW230529, we highlight two contributions of the framework. First, we demonstrate its ability to provide source classification and to enable model selection of equation of state constraints for loud signals such as GW170817, directly from the gravitational-wave data. Second, we obtain narrower constraints on the source properties through these informed priors. As a result, the neural priors consistently recover higher luminosity distances compared to agnostic priors. Our method paves the way for classifying future ambiguous low-mass mergers observed through gravitational waves and for continuously incorporating advances in our understanding of neutron star properties into gravitational-wave data analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blending-induced beating and emission in the symbiotic star Terz V 2513</a><span class="id">[2511.22988]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed analysis of Terz V 2513 (=2MASS J17334728-2719266), a poorly studied symbiotic star.

For both components, we infer C/O ratios of about 0.67, slightly above solar, with line list systematics at the 7 percent level emerging as the dominant source of uncertainty, whereas assumptions about $T$-$P$ parameterization or photometric variability play a lesser role. The retrieved $T$-$P$ profiles and molecular abundances are broadly consistent with atmospheric models and equilibrium chemistry. Our results establish Luhman 16AB as a key anchor for substellar C/O measurements, demonstrate the utility of flexible $T$-$P$ modeling in high-resolution retrievals, and highlight the importance of systematic tests – particularly line list uncertainties – for robust comparisons between brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23040" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-resolution cosmological simulations of primordial dark matter clustering under long-range and fractional forces</a><span class="id">[2511.23040]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long-range attractive fifth forces can lead to exponential instabilities in the early Universe. For fermions with a Yukawa coupling to a sufficiently light scalar mediator, rapid oscillations of the scalar field can lead to a conservative force law with fractional behaviour on sufficiently large scales. We study cosmological systems evolving under both this fractional potential and the Newtonian potential using high-resolution N-body simulations. We find that, at the same mass scale, halos that form under the fractional potential are much more dense than those that from the Newtonian potential. However, we also find that the perturbed scalar field may have large fluctuations once halo sizes become comparable to an effective Compton length, which will modify subsequent clustering and collapse.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23089" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$δ$ Circini: A massive hierarchical triple system with an eclipsing binary</a><span class="id">[2511.23089]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>$\delta$ Circini is known to be a massive multiple system containing a 3.9 d inner eclipsing binary in a slightly elliptical orbit exhibiting slow apsidal motion and a distant tertiary with a probable period of 1644 d. All three components of the system are O- or B-type stars. We carried out a comprehensive study of the system, based on light curves from TESS and other instruments, a new series of echelle spectra, older spectra from the ESO archive, and several VLTI interferometric observations. Due to the large amount of different types of data covering both orbits in the system, we obtained a more precise value of the long orbital period ($1603.24\pm0.19$ d) and fully determined all other orbital parameters. Although both orbits are eccentric, their period ratio is large enough for the system to be dynamically stable. The inner and outer orbits are in the same plane, which means that no Kozai-Lidov mechanism is acting in the system. Assuming solar metallicity in our MESA models, we found ages of $(4.4\pm 0.1)$, $(4.7\pm 0.2)$, and $(3.8\pm1.3)$ Myr for the primary, the secondary, and the tertiary, respectively. Our evolutionary scenario predicts that the inner eclipsing binary will merge within approximately 1.7 Myr and eventually evolve into a black hole. The distance to the system, estimated from the angular size of the outer orbit is $(809.9 \pm 1.8)$ pc, which implies that $\delta$ Cir might be located close to the centre of a stellar population ASCC 79, a subgroup of the young Circinus complex. With a total mass of $(53.04\pm0.29)$ M$_{\odot}$, $\delta$ Cir can contribute a significant fraction of the total mass of the population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predictions from $s$-process AGB models of the isotopic variations of zirconium and neodymium for comparison to bulk meteorites</a><span class="id">[2511.23104]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bulk meteoritic data show isotopic variability of $slow$-neutron-capture ($s$-process) origin in a several elements heavier than Fe. One peculiar feature is that the lighter $s$-process elements (e.g., Zr and Mo) present larger anomalies than the heavier $s$-process elements (e.g., Nd and W). To address this observation, we compared Zr and Nd data to model predictions of the s-process abundances at the surface of low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of initial metallicity from solar to twice solar. We found that the relative magnitude of the isotopic variability between these two elements can be matched by models of AGB stars of super-solar metallicity. The match is favoured by stronger convective overshoot, leading to a deeper dredge-up of the H-rich envelope into the He-rich region, and/or a smaller (  half than standard) mass of the region rich in the $^{13}$C nuclei that produce free neutrons via the $^{13}$C($\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O reaction. We conclude that nucleosynthesis in AGB stars can match the difference in the magnitude of the bulk meteoritic variations in Zr and Nd, provided that super-solar metallicity stars are the original site of these signatures. The AGB stars that produced such variations could have belonged to the current population of old, super-solar metallicity stars seen in the galactic solar neighbourhood.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23129" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Young M dwarfs flare activity model: Towards better exoplanetary atmospheric characterisation</a><span class="id">[2511.23129]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Stellar flares can significantly influence the atmospheres and habitability of orbiting exoplanets, especially around young and active M dwarfs. Understanding the temporally and spectrally resolved activity of such stars is essential for assessing their impact on planetary environments. Aims. We aim to examine in detail state-of-the-art concepts of flare models to identify what is missing in our understanding of energy deposition during the flare event. By comparing synthetic and observed flare spectra, we seek to determine the modelling frameworks best suited to represent flare energetics and spectral far-ultraviolet features while providing a foundation for investigating flare impacts on exoplanet atmospheres. Methods. In this work, we built the Young M Dwarfs Flare (YMDF) model utilising the combination of radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) stellar atmosphere models with a high and low-energy electron beam and corresponding synthetic observables. These models are based on physical principles and were validated with solar and stellar observations. Results. The newly developed YMDF model reproduces the observed continuum rise in both the TESS photometric band and the FUV-A spectral range. Furthermore, the flare distributions generated within this framework show consistency with those observed in our sample of stars. Conclusions. We have developed the YMDF model as a tool to reproduce the time-dependent spectra of flaring young M dwarfs, providing a physically motivated description of their spectral and temporal evolution during flare events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blazar classification from multi-wavelength data using Deep Learning</a><span class="id">[2511.23134]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The launch of the Fermi-LAT telescope has revolutionized gamma-ray astronomy by detecting over 7,000 gamma-ray emitting objects. A major fraction of the objects are blazars of known type, and a similar fraction of objects were classified as blazars of uncertain types (BCUs). Apart from that, some of the objects were found to be unassociated with any other classes, and no information is available in other wavebands. These types of objects are classified as unassociated objects in the Fermi catalog. To classify the unassociated objects into known categories and BCUs into a known type of blazar, numerous efforts have been made using the machine learning approach. The ideal way of classification would be to have multi-wavelength temporal and spectral information, which is nearly impossible to have for this number of objects in the near future. In this paper, we focus on classifying BCUs into other types of blazars, such as FSRQs and BL Lacs. For this purpose, we have developed for the first time a deep feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify them, using multi-wavelength data. The complete understanding of blazars can only be known through multi-wavelength observation, and hence, we begin with four input parameters that cover broadband information (radio, optical, X-ray fluxes, and redshift) to train the neural network, and then extend the framework by including additional parameters to examine their impact on the outcome.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large-amplitude Variability Driven by Giant Dust Storms on a Planetary-mass Companion</a><span class="id">[2511.23163]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large-amplitude variations are commonly observed in the atmospheres of directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarfs.

Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Macroscopic Dark Matter under siege: from White Dwarf Data to Gravitational Wave Detection</a><span class="id">[2511.23263]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nature of dark matter (DM) remains a profound mystery.

Turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM), which may be induced by AGN activity or pre-existing motions, has been proposed as a potential heating mechanism based on analysis of Chandra X-ray surface brightness fluctuations. However, subsequent simulation results have found the subdominant role of turbulence in heating the ICM. To investigate this discrepancy, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster including both AGN feedback and pre-existing turbulence, which is stirred to the observationally constrained level in the Perseus cluster. Our results indicate that, although the velocity field is dominated by the pre-existing turbulence, AGN heating through bubbles and shocks remains significant. More importantly, analysis of the velocity structure function and the energy power spectrum shows that the turbulent heating rate is smaller than the radiative cooling rate, especially in the cluster core. Our results offer insights relevant for recent XRISM observations and indicate that turbulent heating alone cannot offset radiative cooling in CC clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23285" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Properties of Core Collapse Supernovae from Binary Population Synthesis</a><span class="id">[2511.23285]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) impact many areas of astrophysics, including compact object formation and gravitational waves, but many uncertainties remain in our understanding of the evolution of their progenitors.

Our models vary the prescriptions for mass transfer stability, common envelope ejection efficiency, natal kick strength, and remnant mass-limited explodability to assess their impact on the resulting population of CCSNe. We find that reproducing the observed Type I to Type II rate requires either low common envelope efficiency or modified prescriptions for common envelope survival, highlighting the importance of stellar mergers in shaping the CCSN population. We further classify our synthetic CCSNe into subtypes and present their relative abundances using several different sets of classification criteria, highlighting the large uncertainties that persist in mapping progenitor properties to spectral classes. Finally, we present delay time distributions (DTDs) for our overall populations, separated into Type I and II, and into the full set of observed subtypes.

The afterglow emission is well understood as the synchrotron radiation from the shock-accelerated electrons in the medium swept up by the blast wave. The same distribution of electrons also inverse-Compton upscatters the softer synchrotron photons to produce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) TeV emission. Accurate modeling of this component generally requires a computationally expensive numerical treatment, which makes it impractical when fitting to observations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Simpler analytical formalisms are often limited to broken power-law solutions and some predict an artificially high Compton-Y parameter. Here we present a semi-analytic framework for a spherical blast wave that accounts for adiabatic cooling and expansion, photon escape, and equal-arrival-time-surface integration, in addition to Klein-Nishina effects. Our treatment produces the broadband afterglow spectrum and its temporal evolution at par with results obtained from more sophisticated kinetic calculations. We fit our model to the afterglow observations of the TeV bright GRB 190114C using MCMC, and find an energetic blast wave with kinetic energy $E_{k, \rm iso} = 9.1^{+7.41}_{-3.13} \times 10^{54} \, \rm erg$ propagating inside a radially stratified external medium with number density $n(r)\propto r^{-k}$ and $k=1.67^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$.

This represents the highest-significance pairwise kSZ measurement to date. The analysis uses three ACT CMB temperature maps: co-added 150 GHz, total frequency maps, and a component-separated Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map, all of which cover 19,000 square degrees of the sky from Advanced ACTPol observations conducted between 2017 and 2022. Comparison of the results of these three maps serves as a consistency check for potential foreground contamination that may depend on the observation frequency. An estimate of the best-fit mass-averaged optical depth is obtained by comparing the pairwise kSZ curve with the linear-theory prediction of the pairwise velocity under the best-fit Planck cosmology, and is compared with predictions from simulations. This estimate serves as a reference point for future comparisons with thermal SZ-derived optical depth measurements for the same DESI cluster samples, which will be presented in a companion paper. Finally, we employ a machine-learning approach trained on simulations to estimate the optical depth for 456,803 DESI LRG-identified clusters within the simulated mass range (greater than about 1e13 solar masses).

There is too much angular momentum in a collapsing and fragmenting protostellar cloud to form a stellar binary in situ with a separation less than an AU, yet thousands of these short-period binaries have been discovered. One indication of a binary's formation is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes – its obliquity. The classical method for determining projtected stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. This method has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, yet only a handful of stellar binaries. Of the binary systems with measured projected obliquities, even fewer have measured 3D obliquities. In this paper, we add five more short-period binary 3D obliquity measurements to the sample that previously consisted of a single system. We present Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements for EBLM J0239-20, EBLM J0941-31, EBLM 1037-25, EBLM 1141-37, and EBLM J2025-45. These systems consist of an M-dwarf eclipsing an F/G type primary. We combined CORALIE and HARPS spectroscopy with TESS photometry of primary and secondary eclipses. We show that even though the sky-projected obliquities seem to be aligned, there is modest but non-zero spin-orbit misalignment ($\psi$ between 5 and 20$^{\circ}$). Our primary stars straddle the Kraft break at $\sim 6250K$. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf masses and radii to precisions better than 3\%. With the exception of EBLM J0941-31, each system has an inflated radius greater than $5\sigma$ from the expected radius from stellar models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A measurement of $H_0$ from DESI DR1 using energy densities</a><span class="id">[2511.23432]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new measurement of the Hubble constant, independent of standard rulers and robust to pre-recombination modifications such as Early Dark Energy (EDE), obtained by calibrating the total energy density of the Universe.

We then compare this to measurements of the ratio of the matter density to the critical density ($\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$), calculated using the relative positions of the baryon acoustic oscillations, to measure the critical density of the universe and hence $H_0$. The important measurements of the evolution of the energy density all happen at low redshift, so we consider this a low-redshift measurement. We validate our method both on a suite of $N$-body mocks and on noiseless theory vectors generated across a wide range of Hubble parameters in both $\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmologies. Using DESI DR1 data combined with the angular CMB acoustic scale and the latest BBN constraints, we find $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with existing early and late-time determinations of the Hubble constant.

This produces a different pre-recombination distribution of baryons and dark matter. After recombination, the gravitational potential responds to both components in proportion to their mass, allowing robust measurement of the baryon fraction. This is independent of new-physics scenarios altering the recombination background (e.g. Early Dark Energy). The accuracy of such measurements does, however, depend on how baryons and CDM are modeled in the power spectrum. Previous template-based splitting relied on approximate transfer functions that neglected part of information. We present a new method that embeds an extra parameter controlling the balance between baryons and dark matter in the growth terms of the perturbation equations in the CAMB Boltzmann solver. This approach captures the baryonic suppression of CDM prior to recombination, avoids inconsistencies, and yields a clean parametrization of the baryon fraction in the linear power spectrum, separating out the simple physics of growth due to the combined matter potential. We implement this framework in an analysis pipeline using Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure with HOD-informed priors and validate it against noiseless LCDM and EDE cosmologies with DESI-like errors. The new scheme achieves comparable precision to previous splitting while reducing systematic biases, providing a more robust way to baryon-fraction measurements. In combination with BBN constraints on the baryon density and Alcock-Paczynski estimates of the matter density, these results strengthen the use of baryon fraction measurements to derive a Hubble constant from energy densities, with future DESI and Euclid data expected to deliver competitive constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinetic Mixing and the Phantom Illusion: Axion-Dilaton Quintessence in Light of DESI DR2</a><span class="id">[2511.23463]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent results from DESI BAO analyses suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant and is in fact dynamical.

To confront the model with data, we develop a fast pipeline based on normalizing flows that (i) learns a theory-informed prior on $(w_0,w_a)$ from KMIX realizations and (ii) provides an inverse mapping from CPL parameters back to the physical KMIX parameters. By importance-sampling pre-computed CPL chains using this framework, we effectively transform generic phenomenological constraints into direct, computationally efficient constraints on the underlying KMIX theory, avoiding the prohibitive cost of full parameter space exploration. Applied to Planck+DESI DR2 BAO measurements, our framework finds support for KMIX at $2.5\sigma$ compared to the base CPL fit at $3.1\sigma$, demonstrating that KMIX may account for the DESI preference without invoking true phantom behavior. When additionally including Type Ia supernovae data, we find that the preference remains above $3\sigma$ for Union3 and DES Y5, but drops to $2.1\sigma$ with Pantheon+. The latter, combined with the DESI full-shape power spectrum and bispectrum data, further reduces the preference to $1.7\sigma$. Ultimately, should the DESI deviation persist with future data, KMIX may offer a theoretically well-motivated explanation for the phantom-like signatures inferred from phenomenological fits.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21808" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Comprehensive Study of WIMP Models Explaining the Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess</a><span class="id">[2511.21808]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Galactic Center excess (GCE) of GeV $\gamma$ rays may hint at dark matter (DM), yet its origin remains debated. Motivated by this, we survey weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) models that can fit the GCE while satisfying relic-density, direct-detection (DD), and indirect-detection (ID) bounds. We group candidates into hadronic (Higgs portals; simplified scalar/vector mediators), leptonic ($U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$), and mixed ($U(1)_{B-L}$, $Z$-portal) classes. Across all cases, present DD and dwarf-spheroidal $\gamma$-ray limits exclude wide regions, leaving mainly narrow resonant funnels with $m_{\rm DM}\!\simeq\! m_{\rm med}/2$ and portal couplings $\ll 1$. In hadronic setups, scalar and vector Higgs portals survive only in a thin strip near $m_h/2\simeq62.5$ GeV with portal couplings $\sim 10^{-4}$, while the Dirac Higgs and $Z$ portals are essentially excluded. The UV-complete vector Higgs portal retains resonant bands whose viable portal strength depends on the mixing angle. Simplified scalars allow small windows for complex-scalar or vector DM; Dirac DM is strongly disfavored, whereas a pseudoscalar with Dirac DM remains viable over a broader parameter range. For a simplified $Z'$ mediator, a pure vector coupling leaves only a marginal region, while pure axial is excluded by DD/ID bounds. In leptonic scenarios, inverse-Compton emission is essential: $L_\mu-L_e$ (and, to a lesser extent, $B\!-\!L$) fits the GCE with near-thermal cross sections, while $L_\mu-L_\tau$ is disfavored. Overall, viable WIMP explanations are constrained to finely tuned resonant regime, with leptophilic vectors and pseudoscalar portals emerging as the most robust options.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bubble Nucleation from Boson Star Collapse</a><span class="id">[2511.21826]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new classical mechanism for nucleation of bubbles of true vacuum.

Models of such binaries also serve as useful tools for understanding the dynamics of compact binary systems and the gravitational waves they emit. Using an eccentric Ori-Thorne procedure developed in previous work, we build worldlines that describe the full inspiral and plunge of a small body on an initially eccentric orbit of a Kerr black hole. We now calculate the gravitational waves associated with these trajectories using a code that solves the Teukolsky equation in the time domain. The final cycles of these waveforms, the ringdown, contains a superposition of Kerr quasinormal modes followed by a power-law tail. In this paper, we study how a binary's eccentricity and orbital anomaly angle affect the excitation of both quasinormal modes and late-time tails. We find that the relative excitation of quasinormal modes varies in an important and interesting way with these parameters. For some anomaly angles, the relative excitations of quasinormal modes are essentially indistinguishable from those excited in quasi-circular coalescences. Consistent with other recent studies, we find that eccentricity tends to amplify the late-time power-law tail, though the amount of this amplification varies significantly with orbital anomaly. We thus find that eccentricity has an important impact on the late-time coalescence waveform, but the interplay of eccentricity and orbit anomaly complicates this impact.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21971" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Relation between Source Region and In-situ Variability of Low $δB$ Solar Wind Streams</a><span class="id">[2511.21971]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observed a high speed stream near the Sun ($\sim 9.8 R_\odot$) in March 2025. As this stream was observed near the Sun, it allowed for an unparalleled opportunity to observe pristine, coronal hole wind with little evolution (expansion, stream interaction, etc) effects impacting its properties. Through an ensemble of magnetic connectivity analysis utilizing Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) modeling and ballistic propagation, we make estimates of the footpoints, and corresponding source region parameters, associated with the stream. We then look at how the low variability regions (small gradient in the in-situ $B_r$) are related to the variability in the field strength at their source ($B_0$). We find that about half of these periods are associated with low source region variability. Lastly, we examine the low $\delta B / B$ periods between switchback patches and similarly find that they show statistically less variability in their associated $B_0$ value than their switchback patch counterparts. We believe that these results point to a solar source of these “low-variability&quot; periods, that warrants further investigation with composition diagnostics and more complex modeling techniques.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QCD axions and domain walls in dense matter under compact stellar conditions</a><span class="id">[2511.21995]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In compact stellar environments, the stability of dense QCD matter requires the simultaneous fulfillment of charge neutrality and beta equilibrium. In this work, we study how temperature and finite chemical potential affect QCD topology and axion properties within this medium, analyzing both cases with and without the charge neutrality condition. Our results show that the topological susceptibility and axion properties are highly sensitive to the critical behavior of the chiral phase transition in both cases. In particular, the axion mass is strongly suppressed near the transition, while the axion self-coupling constant develops a pronounced peak whose magnitude depends on the temperature and density of the medium. Remarkably, around the critical point at $T\simeq70$ MeV and $\mu\simeq346$ MeV, the self-coupling constant is enhanced by more than a factor of seven compared to its vacuum value, a feature that to the best of our knowledge has not been reported in previous studies. Such a strong amplification at the phase boundary indicates that axion-mediated interactions could play an important role in shaping the structure and stability of compact stars, with potential implications for their evolution and observable astrophysical signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22221" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lorentz Violation in Emergent Gravity and Its Cosmological Consequences</a><span class="id">[2511.22221]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that General Relativity and other geometrical theories can be viewed as a degenerate Otto cycle with only heat-exchange legs in emergent gravity.

In Wald's classic analysis (Wald 1974), which was based on the assumption of vanishing injection energy, the black hole was predicted to acquire a universal &quot;saturation charge&quot; $Q_{\mathrm{w}}=2B_{0}J$. However, the physical mechanism that sets the saturation charge must ultimately be governed by the competition between the absorption rates of positively and negatively charged particles. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the problem in the framework of a simple accretion model, where two dilute, equivalent fluxes of charged particles of opposite signs are injected from infinity along the magnetic field lines. The problem then reduces to that of individual particle motion in the electromagnetic field of the magnetized Kerr black hole. Using a combination of numerical and analytical tools, we determine the domains of absorption and establish both lower and upper bounds on the corresponding absorption cross sections. At $Q=Q_\mathrm{w}$ these bounds reveal a systematic difference between the two charge signs. In particular, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the lower bound on the absorption cross section for the &quot;attracted&quot; charge exceeds the upper bound for the &quot;repelled&quot; one. This charge accretion imbalance (which we find to become extreme at the limit of large $B_{0}$) indicates a persistent net charge accretion at $Q=Q_{\mathrm{w}}$, implying that the actual saturation charge must differ from Wald's charge $Q_{\mathrm{w}}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multipole moments do not uniquely characterise spacetimes beyond general relativity</a><span class="id">[2511.22405]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spacetimes in general relativity can be uniquely decomposed into a set of multipole moments.

Moreover, two metrics can match and yet take different moments.

Often, radiative corrections are included phenomenologically by replacing the potential by the effective potential which is a \emph{static quantity}, its usefulness is restricted to (near) equilibrium situations. We study the misalignment dynamics of a scalar condensate Yukawa coupled to $N_f$ fermions in a manifestly energy conserving, fully renormalized Hamiltonian framework. A large $N_f$ limit allows us to focus on the fermion degrees of freedom, which yield a negative contribution to the effective potential, a radiatively induced instability and ultraviolet divergent field renormalization. We introduce an adiabatic basis and an adiabatic expansion that embodies the derivative expansion in the effective action, the zeroth order is identified with the effective potential, higher orders account for the derivative expansion including field renormalization and describe profuse particle production. Energy conserving dynamics leads to the conjecture of emergent asymptotic highly excited stationary states with a distribution function $n_k(\infty)\propto 1/k^6$ and an extensive entropy which is identified with an entanglement entropy. Subtle aspects of renormalization associated with the initial value problem are analyzed and resolved. Possible new manifestations of asymptotic spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) as a consequence of the dynamics even in absence of tree level (SSB), and cosmological inferences are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22530" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D Modeling of Solar Oscillations with Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Method</a><span class="id">[2511.22530]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With increasing quantity and quality of solar observations, it becomes essential to account for three-dimensional heterogeneities in wave modeling for seismic data interpretation. In this context, we present a 3D solver of the time-harmonic adiabatic stellar oscillation equations without background flows on a domain consisting of the Sun and its photosphere. The background medium consists of 3D heterogeneities on top of a radial strongly-stratified standard solar model. The oscillation equations are solved with the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, considering a first-order formulation in terms of the vector displacement and the pressure perturbation. This method combines the high-order accuracy and the parallelism of DG methods while yielding smaller linear systems. These are solved with a direct solver, with block low-rank compression and mixed-precision arithmetic to reduce memory footprint. The trade-off between compression and solution accuracy is investigated, and our 3D solver is validated by comparing with resolution under axial symmetry for solar backgrounds. The capacity of the solver is illustrated with wave speed heterogeneities characteristic of two physical phenomena: active regions and convection. We show the importance of global 3D gravito-acoustic wave simulations, in particular when the amplitudes of the perturbations are strong and their effect on the wavefield cannot be estimated by linear approximations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22798" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflation, black holes with primary hair, and regular planar black holes from an infinite tower of regularized Lovelock-Proca corrections</a><span class="id">[2511.22798]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Infinite towers of higher-order corrections to General Relativity have been proposed as a mechanism to resolve singularities in early-universe cosmology and black holes, in a variety of settings.

Astrophysical observations of neutron stars provide invaluable information on existing nuclear interaction models and equations of state (EoSs) at various densities. Most studies of neutron star structure employ the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation which describes spherically symmetric, non-rotating stars in hydrostatic equilibrium. However, since neutron stars rotate fast, they could experience significant centrifugal deformation, and axially-symmetric calculations are required for accurate description of internal structure. The Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method is well known for modeling rapidly-rotating compact objects in a fully general relativistic manner. In this contribution, we report results of KEH calculations for rapidly-rotating neutron stars using EoSs based on Gogny-type finite-range effective nucleon-nucleon interactions. Our results show that the mass-radius relation systematically changes with increasing angular velocity, highlighting the importance of including rotational effects when confronting theoretical EoSs with observational data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scalar field effective potentials in de Sitter spacetime</a><span class="id">[2511.23076]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate two different definitions of a scalar field effective potential in quantum field theory in de Sitter spacetime: the standard textbook definition, and the constraint effective potential proposed by O'Raifeartaigh et al. in 1986.

It is well known that the perturbative expansion of the standard effective potential fails converge for light fields. In contrast, the constraint effective potential does not suffer from this infrared problem, and it can therefore be computed using perturbation theory. We discuss the physical interpretation of the two effective potentials. In particular, we provide evidence supporting an earlier conjecture that the constraint effective potential is the correct one to use in the stochastic Starobinsky-Yokoyama theory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vector-field spontaneous baryogenesis with Lorentz invariance violation</a><span class="id">[2511.23378]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extend spontaneous baryogenesis by considering the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_B$ through a complex vector field. This field interacts with baryons and leptons via a vector-current coupling and, by construction, acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Accordingly, the theory also exhibits a spontaneous violation of Lorentz invariance, effectively realizing a Bumblebee model. In this picture, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson arising from spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)_B$ global symmetry is the global phase of the Bumblebee vector and, in the broken phase, it results minimally coupled with the baryonic current, guaranteeing the violation of the baryon number. Consequently, we assume that the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone, arising from spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_B$, plays the role of the inflaton, leading to baryogenesis across the entire inflationary stage, up to when the inflaton decays into baryon-antilepton and antibaryon-lepton pairs through a CP-violating interaction that also violates the Lorentz symmetry. Afterwards, we address the issue of flavor oscillations among baryon and lepton fields, including the oscillation probability in the calculation of the baryon asymmetry. Remarkably, our framework predicts a non-null mixing factor even for massless fermions. This mixing acts on the spatial momenta rather than on the masses of the produced fermions, allowing larger values of the coupling constant even guaranteeing the production of light fermions. The net baryon asymmetry results accordingly modified, and may also reproduce the experimental data for allowed values of the coupling constant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multipartite entanglement features of primordial non-gaussianities</a><span class="id">[2511.23389]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We discuss some entanglement features associated with cubic non-Gaussian perturbations in single-field inflationary scenarios.

In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations. Within the interaction picture, we further observe that the quantum correlations arising from cubic gravitational interactions are typically much larger than the standard squeezing contribution, in agreement with previous studies focusing on von Neumann entropy generation across the Hubble horizon.

We use recent measurements for statistical analysis and constrain the parameters $H_0$ in km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_m$, $r_d$, $M$, $\sigma_8$, $S_8$, and the interaction term $Q_{dm}$. From the constrained values of $Q_{dm}$, we show that the diffusive model is a promising alternative DE model, capable of driving late-time cosmic acceleration due to energy exchange from DM to DE. State-finder diagnostics indicate that the model behaves like a Chaplygin gas when energy transfers from DM to DE during the Universe's expansion. We also investigate the growth of density contrast, finding $\delta_m(z)\gg\delta_{de}(z)$, which highlights the dominant role of DM in structure formation. Redshift space distortion and growth rate analysis show that minor deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at low redshifts, with larger differences at higher redshifts, indicate the impact of energy diffusion on early structure growth.

First, we find that dynamical effects cause the gas to be detained in low-density and intermediate-density regions, resulting in high baryon fractions, while prevent the convergence of the gas in high-density regions, leading to low baryon fractions. Second, turbulent energy is converted into thermal energy, and the injection and dissipation of turbulent energy have essentially reached a balance from $z=1$ to $0$. This indicates that the cosmic fluid is in a steady state within this redshift range. Due to turbulent heating, as redshift decreases, an increasing amount of warm gas is heated and transitions into the WHIM, and some even into hot gas. We find that, compared with turbulence in the cosmic fluid, shocks are unimportant in intermediate-density regions and even negligible in high-density regions, both dynamically and thermodynamically. This finding not only provides the origin of WHIM in terms of both dynamics and thermodynamics, but also questions the traditional view of the shock heating and highlights the importance of turbulence in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe, particularly in the evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. In addition to TNG50-1, we validated our key findings with TNG50-2, TNG100-1, WIGEON, and EAGLE simulations, demonstrating that resolution, box size, and subgrid-physics variations do not affect our main conclusions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05813" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new approach for simulating PBH formation from generic curvature fluctuations with the Misner-Sharp formalism</a><span class="id">[2504.05813]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our Universe. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp approach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution equations exhibit divergent terms ($0/0$), which complicate and prevent the simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable, allowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism. Using a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply and test our new approach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time evolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and PBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not necessarily result in PBH formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A New Wavelet Scattering Transform-Based Statistic for Cosmological Analysis of Large-Scale Structure</a><span class="id">[2505.14400]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large-scale structure (LSS) analysis in galaxy surveys is a powerful cosmological probe but is limited by tracer bias, which can obscure underlying information and weaken parameter constraints.

Central to our approach are the WST $m$-mode ratios, $R^{\rm wst}$, a new statistical measure, and a high-density apodization preprocessing that smoothly rescales extreme values. We use a reduced chi-square to assess the cosmological parameter constraints and find that $R^{\rm wst}$, in the scale range $j \in [3,7]$, achieves $\chi^2_{\nu, \rm cos} \approx 6$ for cosmology while maintaining $\chi^2_{\nu, \rm bias} \sim 1$–a regime unattained by other statistics. $R^{\rm wst}$ thus provides robust cosmological sensitivity with effective bias mitigation for future surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Spectroscopy of a Blue Binary Cold Classical Kuiper Belt Object</a><span class="id">[2506.11972]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present observations of two binary systems within the cold classical region of the Kuiper belt$-$2001 XR254 and 2016 BP81$-$obtained with the JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph.

In contrast, 2016 BP81 is a blue binary, with a water-ice-rich surface composition. The two components of the 2016 BP81 binary display identical spectral profiles, consistent with coeval formation from gravitational collapse. Through qualitative and quantitative comparisons of water-ice-rich Kuiper belt objects observed with JWST, we identify a small subclass, including 2016 BP81, that appears to differ in systematic ways from the rest of the population. The relatively deep carbon dioxide ice absorption bands and enhanced signatures of aliphatic organics suggest that objects within this subclass may have originated in a distinct formation environment from the other water-ice-rich Kuiper belt objects.

However, the rarity of such multi-messenger events limits the precision of the $H_0$ constraint. Recently, the newly-discovered nuclear transient, quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) show intriguing evidence of a stellar-mass companion captured by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme/intermediate mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI), which is the most promising sources of the space-based GW detectors, such as LISA. Here, we model the secular orbital evolution of known QPE systems using two frameworks: a stripping scenario in which periodic mass transfer at periapsis drives the evolution; and an orbiter-disk collision scenario in which the companion interacts with a misaligned accretion disk, modulated by coupled orbiter-disk precession. For each framework, we assess detectability by LISA, together with the resulting constraints on $H_0$. Our principal findings are: (i) in the stripping scenario, no currently known QPE reaches detectability within a four-year LISA mission. (ii) in the orbiter-disk scenario, two sources-eRO-QPE2 and eRO-QPE4-are detectable with signal-to-noise ratios $\simeq 8.5-28.8$ and constrain $H_0$ with fractional uncertainty of 6.7-14.9\%. QPE systems remain uncertain on the decade-long secular evolution. Therefore, they motivate continued time-domain monitoring of QPE candidates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20391" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological abundance of primordial black holes in mixed dark matter scenarios incorporating Kaluza-Klein dark matter</a><span class="id">[2506.20391]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles and primordial black holes (PBHs) emerge as plausible candidates for dark matter. In scenarios where dark matter is a mix of KK particles and PBHs, PBHs can attract surrounding KK dark matter particles post-formation, leading to the creation of ultracompact dark matter halos (UCMHs). The distribution of KK dark matter particles within UCMHs tends to be steeper than in classical dark matter halo structures, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White model. Consequently, the annihilation rate of KK dark matter particles in UCMHs is significant. The high-energy photons resulting from the annihilation of KK particles in UCMHs contribute to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). Leveraging data from the $\mathtt{Fermi\text{-}LAT}$ experiment, we have derived, for the first time, upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs in the context of KK dark matter annihilation. For a KK dark matter mass range of $500\le m_{\rm B^{(1)}}\le 1500$ GeV, which aligns with the observed present abundance of dark matter, the conservative limits on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, for massive PBHs with $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$, are $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 2\times 10^{-5}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Field-level Reconstruction from Foreground-Contaminated 21-cm Maps</a><span class="id">[2508.13265]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current and upcoming 21-cm experiments will soon be able to map 21-cm spatial fluctuations in three dimensions for a wide range of redshifts. However, bright foreground contamination and the nature of radio interferometry create significant challenges, making it difficult to access rich cosmological information from the Fourier modes that lie within the &quot;foreground wedge&quot;. In this work, we introduce two approaches aiming to reconstruct the full 21-cm density field, including the missing modes in the wedge: (a) a field-level inference under an effective field theory (EFT) framework; (b) a diffusion-based deep generative model trained on simulations. Under the EFT framework, we implement a fully differentiable forward model that maps the initial conditions of matter fluctuations to the observed, foreground-filtered 21-cm maps. This enables a gradient-based sampler to simultaneously sample the initial conditions and bias parameters, allowing a physically motivated mode reconstruction. Alternatively, we apply a variational diffusion model to perform 21-cm density reconstruction at the map level. Our model is trained on semi-numerical simulations over a wide range of astrophysical parameters. Our results from both approaches should provide improved cosmological constraints from the field level and also enable cross-correlation between experiments that have little or no overlapping modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining deviations from $Λ$CDM in the Hubble expansion rate</a><span class="id">[2508.17848]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $\Lambda$CDM cosmolgical model has long been regarded as highly successful in accurately describing a wide range of astronomical observations. However, numerous observational findings have also provided hints of discrepancies from the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM framework. We explore a phenomenological model that quantifies the deviation of the Hubble expansion rate from the standard scenario, which is expressed as $H^{2}(z) = H^{2}_{\rm \Lambda CDM}(\Omega_m, z)[1+\delta(z)]$. We consider three distinct forms for the deviation parameter $\delta(z)$: in model I, $\delta(z)=\delta_c$; in model II, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}z/(1+z)$, and in model III, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}{\rm ln}(1+z)$. Here, $\delta_c$ represents a constant value. We utilize a comprehensive set of observational data to constrain the models. Our results show that for most combined datasets, $\delta_c$ tends to take on negative values for models I and II, while consistently taking positive values in model III. Furthermore, we find that both models I and II remain consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model across all datasets examined. In contrast, model III exhibits a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model, exceeding $2\sigma$ for the full combined datastes. The AIC indicates that models I and II are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model, whereas model III is preferred over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, with the $\Lambda$CDM model being disfavored for the combined datasets DESI BAO + CMB + CC + DESY5. These results suggest that the Hubble expansion rate likely deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN2023syz and SN2025cbj: Two Type IIn Supernovae Associated with IceCube High-energy Neutrinos</a><span class="id">[2508.19080]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a subclass of core-collapse SNe in which strong interactions occur between the ejecta and dense circumstellar material, creating ideal conditions for the production of high-energy neutrinos.

After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \sim 0.67\%$, suggesting that they may originate from genuine physical associations, though the result is not yet statistically significant. Our model calculations, however, indicate that the likelihood of a neutrino originating from IC231027A is low, implying that the association between IC231027A and SN2023syz is likely coincidental.

I. Orbital evolution due to conservative mass transfer</a><span class="id">[2509.05243]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mass transfer (MT) is a fundamental process in stellar evolution. While MT in circular orbits is well studied, observations indicate that it also occurs in eccentric ones, where theoretical models are limited. We present a new semi-analytic framework for the secular orbital evolution of mass-transferring binaries, treating stars either as point-masses or as extended bodies. For the first time, a MT model is applicable to both circular and eccentric orbits and accommodates conservative and non-conservative MT across a broad range of mass ratios and stellar spins. We derive secular, orbit-averaged equations describing the orbital evolution by treating MT, mass loss, and angular momentum (AM) loss as perturbations to the general two-body problem. Assuming conservative MT, we compare our results to previous models and validate them against numerical integrations. Our model predicts eccentric post-MT systems in wider orbits than classical results. Compared to other eccentric MT frameworks we find a broader parameter space for orbital widening and eccentricity pumping. Accounting for extended bodies yields stronger semimajor axis and eccentricity growth at a given mass ratio, and further broadens the parameter space for orbital widening and eccentricity pumping. Whether extended bodies are considered or not, eccentric MT naturally predicts higher eccentricities at longer orbital periods, a correlation observed in numerous post-MT systems, providing a robust mechanism for their formation. Our model can be integrated into binary evolution and population synthesis codes to consistently treat conservative and non-conservative MT in arbitrarily eccentric orbits with applications ranging from MT on the main sequence to gravitational-wave progenitors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">89.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hubble constant from the improved lens modeling of cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal with new spectroscopic redshifts and the Jackknife method</a><span class="id">[2509.09979]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Time-delay cosmology offers an alternative approach to measuring the Hubble constant ($H_0$), which is distinct from the cosmic distance ladder and cosmic microwave background radiation methods.

They challenge the internal structure models and prompt investigation on their formation, evolution, and atmospheres. We report the characterisation of new sub-Neptunes orbiting two similar M dwarfs, TOI-521 (T_eff=3544 K), and TOI-912 (T_eff=3572 K). Both stars host a candidate identified by TESS and are part of the THIRSTEE follow-up program, which aims at understanding the sub-Neptune population through precise characterisation studies on a population level. We analysed light curves, ground-based photometry and ESPRESSO, HARPS and IRD RVs to infer precise orbital and physical parameters. The two stars host nearly identical planets in terms of mass and radius. TOI-521 b is a transiting sub-Neptune in a 1.5-d orbit with radius and mass of R=1.98+/-0.14 R_e and M=5.3+/-1.0 M_e respectively. Moreover, we identified an additional candidate at 20.3 d, with a minimum mass of Msini=10.7+/-2.4 M_e currently not detected to transit. Similarly, TOI-912 b is a 4.7-d sub-Neptune with R=1.93+/-0.13 R_e and M=5.1+/-0.5 M_e. Interestingly, TOI-912 b likely has an unusually high eccentricity (e=0.58+/-0.02), and it is probably undergoing strong tidal dissipation. If such eccentricity is confirmed, it would make it one of the most eccentric sub-Neptunes known to date. TOI-521 b and TOI-912 b have very similar densities (4 g/cm^3) and they lie in the degenerate region of the mass-radius diagram where different compositions are plausible, including a volatile-rich composition, or a rocky core surrounded by a H-He envelope. Our sample supports the division of sub-Neptunes into two distinct populations divided by a density gap. Both planets are interesting targets for atmospheric follow-up in the context of understanding the temperature-atmospheric feature trend that starts to emerge thanks to JWST observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Where did Heavy Binaries Go?

Crucially, the complexity of the model – namely, the number, positions, and weights of triangulation nodes – is inferred directly from the data, resulting in a highly efficient approach that requires about one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and significantly less calibration than current state-of-the-art methods. We find no evidence for a peak at $M_{\mathrm{tot}} \sim 70\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at low redshifts ($z \sim 0.2$), where it would correspond to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature reported in redshift-independent mass spectrum analyses, and we infer an increased merger rate at high redshifts ($z \sim 1$) around those masses, compatible with such a peak. When related to the time-delay distribution from progenitor formation to binary black-hole merger, our results suggest that sources contributing to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature follow a steeper (shallower) time-delay distribution at high (low) redshifts.

The weak s-process nucleosynthesis is driven by neutrons produced in the 22Ne({\alpha}, n)25Mg reaction during convective He-core and C-shell burning. The yields of heavy elements thus depend on the 22Ne({\alpha}, n)25Mg and the competitive 22Ne({\alpha}, {\gamma})26Mg reaction rates which are dominated by several narrow-resonance reactions. While the accuracy of these rates has been under debate for decades, recent experimental efforts, including ours, drastically reduced these uncertainties. In this work, we use a set of 280 massive star nucleosynthesis models calculated using different 22Ne({\alpha}, n)25Mg and 22Ne({\alpha}, {\gamma})26Mg rates, and a galactic chemical evolution (GCE) study to probe their impact on the weak s-process elemental abundances in the Galaxy. The GCE was computed with the OMEGA+ code, using the new sets of stellar yields with different 22Ne+{\alpha} rates. From GCE, we find that these rates are causing up to 0.45 dex of variations in the [Cu/Fe], [Ga/Fe], and [Ge/Fe] ratios predicted at solar metallicity. The greatest impact on the stellar nucleosynthesis and GCE results derives from uncertainties in the ({\alpha},n) strength ({\omega}{\gamma}({\alpha},n)) of the Ex=11.32 MeV resonance. We show that the variations observed in the GCE calculations for the weak s-proess elements become negligibly smaller than dispersions found in observations once the {\omega}{\gamma}({\alpha},n) is accurately determined within the uncertaintiy of 10 to 20% (typically reported experimental errors for the resonance) in future nuclear physics experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">93.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for increasing dark energy in DESI from the Local Distance Ladder</a><span class="id">[2509.23168]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. A comprehensive survey of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) in the Large Scale Structure (LSS), in stratified data covering a finite redshift range is provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Extracting cosmological parameters in a joint analysis of LSS-CMB data is hereby inherently a nonlinear problem. Aims. In particular, this nonlinearity may concern the unknown equation of state of dark energy w(a), defined in the general w(a)CDM framework. Nevertheless, a common approach is the linearized approximation hereto notably w0waCDM, also applied by DESI. Here, we consider a potential source of a systematic uncertainty in this linearization due to non-commutativity between w0waCDM and a posteriori linearization of w(a)CDM, identified with an intrinsic symmetry in the latter, which is violated in the former. We shall refer to these as early and late linearization, respectively. Methods. Observational consequences of symmetry violation is inherent to early linearization regardless of choice of data, here elucidated in the analysis of the Hubble expansion in the Local Distance Ladder (LDL) using cosmic chronometer data. Results. Strikingly, opposite results are found for the evolution of dark energy by early versus late linearization, indicating a thawing or respectively, increasing dark energy. This is further confirmed by mock data experiments. Accordingly, it is unlikely that the DESI pipeline is immune to the same contradiction. Conclusions. Our results show rather than thawing, claimed by DESI, dark energy may in fact be increasing upon preserving the underlying symmetry. Further confirmation is expected from Euclid.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">94.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited: II.

With the present two Papers we remedy this anomaly. In Paper I we derived the angular momentum (AM) of protohalos centered on triaxial peaks of suited scale, taking into account that, to leading order, their density profile is smooth and homogeneous. Here we use that result to derive the AM of these objects, accounting for the fact that their actual density profile is slightly outward decreasing and lumpy so that they do not collapse monolithically at once, but progressively from inside out, undergoing mergers during the process. By monitoring in detail their resulting mass and AM growth, we characterize the spin distribution of final halos and the precise mass and radial distribution of their inner mean specific AM.

These populations represent a largely unstudied demographic with unknown origins, and their relative isolation may minimize gravitational disruptions that impact traceback, making them compelling targets for dynamical studies. In this paper, we survey 15 of these isolated young associations for the first time: Andromeda South (SCYA-97), Aquila East, Aries South (SCYA-104), Cassiopeia East (SCYA-43), Canis Major North, Leo Central (SCYA-2), Leo East (SCYA-3), Theia 72, Ophiuchus Southeast, Scutum North (SCYA-70), Taurus-Orion 1 (TOR1), Theia 78, Vulpecula East (UPK 88), SCYA-54, and SCYA-79. By combining Gaia astrometry and photometry with new ground-based spectroscopic measurements, we assess the membership of each population, search for substructure, analyze their demographics, and compute ages. We find that the smallest populations in our sample contain $&lt;20$ $M_{\odot}$ of stellar mass, making them the smallest associations ever detected. Four host substantial substructure, including TOR1, where we discover TOR1B, a new 16 $M_{\odot}$ association with radial velocities inconsistent with an origin in the parent complex. Using PARSEC isochrones, we produce self-consistent ages for all populations supported by dynamical and lithium depletion ages, which range from 6.9 $\pm$ 0.5 Myr in TOR1A to 42.8 $\pm$ 2.4 in AndS. Our results provide the first detailed overview of the properties of these populations, characterizing a largely unknown category of young associations that may have an important role in tracing the processes that guide local star formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">96.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25636" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mode Composition Shapes Magnetic Anisotropy in Solar Wind Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2510.25636]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Turbulence is a ubiquitous process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales, thereby influencing particle transport and heating. Recent progress has improved our understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence with respect to the mean magnetic field; however, its exact form and implications for magnetic topology and energy transfer remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the nature of magnetic anisotropy in compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence within low-$\beta$ solar wind using measurements from the Cluster spacecraft. By decomposing small-amplitude fluctuations into Alfvén and compressible modes, we reveal that magnetic anisotropy is largely mode dependent: Alfvenic fluctuations are broadly distributed in propagation angle, whereas compressible fluctuations are concentrated near the quasi-parallel (slab) direction, a feature closely linked to collisionless damping of compressible modes. For $\beta\rightarrow0$, compressible modes become dominant within the slab component at smaller scales. These findings advance our understanding of magnetic anisotropy in solar wind turbulence and offer a new perspective on the three-dimensional turbulence cascade, with broad implications for particle transport, acceleration, and magnetic reconnection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">97.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic voids and the kinetic analysis.

The linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation with the cosmological term is shown to lead to van Kampen's waves, Landau damping, and then to aperiodic structures. Aperiodicity thereby emerges as a intrinsic feature of the filamentary and void structure of the local Universe, and reveals the self-consistent field mechanism of its formation. The damping of the aperiodicity is then predicted and can be observationally traced upon the increase in the scale of the filaments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">98.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04738" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confirmation of SRGt 062340.2-265751 as a nova-like cataclysmic variable with a possible magnetic nature</a><span class="id">[2511.04738]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>SRGt 062340.2-265751, a cataclysmic variable identified by SRG/eROSITA thanks to its significant X-ray variability, remains poorly characterised despite the multi-wavelength follow-up. We present spectral and timing analyses from the first dedicated X-ray and ultraviolet observations with XMM-Newton, complemented by SRG/eROSITA data from four all-sky surveys (eRASS1-4) and ASAS-SN optical photometry. Our timing analysis reveals a &gt;8$\sigma$ significant modulation at 3.6 $\pm$ 0.5 hours, likely representing the orbital period. Long-term ASAS-SN monitoring confirms the source as a VY Sculptoris-type nova-like system, while short-timescale X-ray and ultraviolet variability, down to a few minutes, suggests a possible underlying magnetic white dwarf. Two additional significant X-ray modulations at 43 $\pm$ 1 min and 36.0 $\pm$ 0.7 min tentatively point to the spin period of an intermediate polar. The best-fit XMM-Newton energy spectra reveal a multi-temperature thermal plasma ($kT$ = 0.23, 0.94, and 5.2 keV), while the SRG/eROSITA spectra are consistent with a single-temperature thermal plasma of a few keV. We estimate unabsorbed X-ray luminosities of $\gtrsim$$10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.2-12 keV). Broadband spectral energy distribution modelling, from near-ultraviolet to infrared, indicates a disc-dominated system consistent with a nova-like classification. We discuss these results in the context of the source's confirmed nova-like classification and its possible magnetic nature, a scenario increasingly supported by discoveries of intermediate polars exhibiting VY Sculptoris-type nova-like features.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">99.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recoil-Enabled Energy Transfer from Coherent Neutrino Scattering in Core-Collapse Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2511.04896]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit neutrino-matter coupling in the post-shock region of core-collapse supernovae by restoring nuclear recoil in coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS).

This indicates that the long-standing failure of isoenergetic transport schemes to revive the shock originates from their neglect of recoil kinematics. Because the momentum exchange in each scattering is tiny, the emergent neutrino spectra and lepton-number balance remain essentially unchanged. The result highlights nuclear recoil as a minimal yet physically grounded correction to standard neutrino transport, providing a self-consistent route toward reliable explosion modeling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">100.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creation of Viscous Dark Energy by the Hubble Flow: Comparison with SNe Ia Master Sample Binned Data</a><span class="id">[2511.16130]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study a cosmological model featuring evolutionary dark energy, according to the idea that the creation of its constituents arises from the gravitational field of the expanding universe, whose non-equilibrium physics is described by a non-zero bulk viscosity coefficient. This physical scenario calls for two additional parameters with respect to the {\Lambda}CDM model, one of which is the equation of state parameter of the created dark energy. The model is constrained by the requirement that its deceleration parameter coincides with the one predicted by the {\Lambda}CDM model. Then, we construct the effective running Hubble constant, a theoretical function that corresponds to the ratio of the Hubble parameter in our model to the {\Lambda}CDM expansion rate. The model's theoretical predictions for the effective running Hubble constant are compared with the binned data of the Supernovae Ia Master Sample. The comparison is performed by a MCMC procedure for each bin, with three parameters left free to vary, while the particle creation rate is taken from a grid of values, each of which is fixed in the given MCMC run. The most important result emerging from this analysis is that the created dark energy constituent corresponds to an equation of state parameter with phantom character. Only if particle creation is removed do the dark energy constituents acquire a quintessence character. No matter the intrinsic nature of the constituents, their effective z-dependent equation of state parameter is, both with and without considering particle creation, entirely of phantom nature across the considered redshift range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">101.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measurement of Milli-Charged Particles with a running electromagnetic coupling constant at IceCube</a><span class="id">[2511.18881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is postulated that heavy dark matter $\phi$ with a mass on the order of TeV, once captured by the Earth, can decay into relativistic milli-charged particles (MCPs).

The expected number of background neutrino events at IceCube has also been evaluated. Under the assumption that no signal events are observed over a 10-year period at IceCube, upper limits on the MCP flux have been derived at the 90\% confidence level.

Based on the availability of simultaneous multi-wavelength data and considering flux level as the depiction of AGN-jet activity we identified 11 epochs (named as Epoch-A to Epoch-K) and investigated temporal as well as spectral variability during these epochs to understand the emission properties in this source. The fractional variability analysis reveals that, in all epochs, X-ray light curve exhibits relatively high degree of variability in compared to the optical, UV and gamma-ray light curves. The flux-flux plots among different bands, in general, show weak to moderate correlation with Spearman correlation coefficient ranging from 0.29 to 0.58. Notably, during Epoch-I, we detect a possible orphan flare exhibiting increase in the X-ray flux level ($\sim$ 2.4 times of the total average flux) but with no corresponding counterpart seen in the optical, UV bands. In contrast, during Epoch-K, we detect a significant decrease in the X-ray flux but no corresponding decrease in optical, UV and gamma-ray bands.

While one-dimensional (1D) atmospheric models with 1D radiative transfer (RT) have been widely used, advances in three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models (GCMs) and 3D RT methods now allow quantitative comparisons of these approaches. With the precision and sensitivity of JWST, such differences can be observationally tested. This study investigates the spectral variations produced by 1D and 3D models and estimates the JWST observing time or number of transits needed to distinguish them. Using HD 189733b as a case study, three sets of simulations were performed: 1D atmospheric models with 1D RT and 3D GCM models coupled with both 1D and 3D RT. An inherent limitation of our study is that the temperature-pressure (T-P) profiles derived from the 3D GCM extend only to the high-pressure regions. The simulations incorporated both equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry. Significant spectral discrepancies were found, with 3D models generally showing weaker features. Using a JWST noise simulator, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detecting these differences was calculated. For transmission spectra, the SNR ranged from 2.04-7.68 (equilibrium) and 1.66-7.04 (disequilibrium), while for emission spectra it ranged from 5.90-34.52 (equilibrium) and 7.11-36.93 (disequilibrium). To test the limitations of the 3D GCM, we extended the atmosphere to lower pressures using an isothermal T-P profile and found wavelength-dependent variations in both the spectra and the SNR. These results show that JWST can distinguish 1D from 3D model spectra for major molecular features, underscoring the importance of 3D modeling in interpreting exoplanetary atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">104.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compton-induced $γ$-ray Cascade Emissions in Radio Galaxy NGC 1275</a><span class="id">[2511.21463]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Among active galactic nuclei (AGNi), blazars are the brightest emitters of high-energy (HE, $E \geq 100$ MeV) to very-high-energy (VHE, $E \geq 100$ GeV) $\gamma$-rays from their jets. Radio galaxies, being the misaligned parent population of the blazar class, were historically not detected at these frequencies.

We find three types of configurations of the scalar potential that allow for a first-order phase transition, namely tree-level barriers, radiative barriers, or radiative symmetry breaking through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. We also find versions of these with significant supercooling. We perform a global likelihood scan over the Wilson coefficients of SMEFT operators involving only the Higgs field, to identify parameter regions that exhibit these first-order phase transitions and are consistent with experimental and theoretical constraints.

By performing rotations to align one field with the direction of curvature perturbations and applying the same rotations to the other two field directions, we introduce the semikinematic basis, which is applicable to models with more than two fields. We derive the governing equations in this basis. We also stress a characteristic property of more-than-two-field models: the freedom in choosing the isocurvature perturbations. This framework enables the computation of the curvature and two isocurvature power spectra for any given potential. We numerically solve the background and perturbation equations for three distinct scenarios. First, to validate the consistency of our three-field formalism, we examine an effective two-field model inspired by the two-block case of the multigiant vacua matrix inflation scenario. Next, we analyze a purely three-field system without direct interfield interactions. Finally, we study a three-field case that incorporates direct interactions. For all scenarios, we numerically compute the curvature perturbation power spectra and highlight the effects of rapid turns on the spectra. Finally, we investigate the relationship between these quantities and the observables in the early radiation-dominated era. Through both general arguments and a simple example, we show that three-field inflation can yield a much richer phenomenology. This is particularly true when we assume the initial perturbations in the radiation era include two isocurvature modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">108.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18635" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waveform models for the gravitational-wave memory effect: II.

The amplitude of the GW memory effect from binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers is small compared to that of primary (oscillatory) GWs and is unlikely to be detected by current ground-based detectors. Evidence for its presence in the population of all the BBH mergers is more likely, once thousands of detections are made by these detectors. Having an accurate and computationally efficient waveform model of the memory signal will assist detecting the memory effect with current data-analysis pipelines. In this paper, we build on our prior work to develop analytical time-domain and frequency-domain models for the dominant nonlinear memory multipole signal ($l=2$, $m=0$) from nonspinning BBH mergers in quasicircular orbits. The model is calibrated for mass ratios between one and eight. There are three parts to the time-domain signal model: a post-Newtonian inspiral, a quasinormal-mode-based ringdown, and a phenomenological signal during the late inspiral and merger (which interpolates between the inspiral and ringdown). The time-domain model also has an analytical Fourier transform, which we compute in this paper. We assess the accuracy of our model using the mismatch between our waveform model and the memory signal computed from the oscillatory modes of a numerical-relativity surrogate model. We use the advanced LIGO sensitivity curve from the fourth observing run and find that the mismatch increases with the total mass of the system and is of order $10^{-2}\unicode{x2013}10^{-4}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">109.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermodynamics of magnetized BPS baryonic layers and the effects of the Isospin chemical potential</a><span class="id">[2505.18007]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Through the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics, BPS magnetized Baryonic layers (possessing both baryonic charge and magnetic flux) have been constructed in the gauged non-linear sigma model (G-NLSM) minimally coupled to Maxwell theory, which is one of the most relevant effective theories for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the strongly interacting low-energy limit which also takes into account the electromagnetic interactions. Since the topological charge that naturally appears on the right hand side of the BPS bound is a non-linear function of the baryonic charge, the thermodynamics of these magnetized Baryonic layers is highly non-trivial. In this work, using tools from the theory of Casimir effect, we derive analytical relationship between baryonic charge, topological charge, magnetic flux and relevant thermodynamical quantities (such as pressure, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility) of these layers. The critical Baryonic chemical potential is identified. Quite interestingly, the grand canonical partition function can be related with the Riemann zeta function. On the technical side, it is quite a remarkable result to derive explicit expressions for all these thermodynamics quantities of a strongly interacting magnetized system at finite Baryon density.

Several groups have reported a $\gamma$-ray excess toward the Galactic Centre, commonly referred to as the Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). Its spectrum is consistent with annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of mass $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ GeV and a thermal-relic cross section. Although many concrete WIMP models reproduce the GCE spectrum, most are now excluded by direct detection experiments that are approaching the neutrino floor. We investigate a class of anomaly-free extensions of the Standard Model featuring gauged differences of lepton number, $U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$, and gauged baryon minus lepton number, $U(1)_{B-L}$. We show that these models can reproduce the GCE while remaining compatible with the observed relic abundance. We then impose collider and direct detection constraints, accounting for both tree-level and loop-induced kinetic mixing. The $L_\mu-L_e$ model gives the best fit to the GCE: a DM mass of $m_\chi\sim 40-50$ GeV remains consistent with the muon and electron magnetic moment anomalies, $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, as well as current collider and direct detection limits, for mediator masses in the range $m_{A'}\sim 70-86$ GeV and a DM-mediator coupling of $(1-5)\times10^{-2}$. By contrast, the $L_e-L_\tau$ and $L_\mu-L_\tau$ models yield poorer fits; satisfying both the relic density and experimental bounds forces the DM mass to lie very close to resonance (i.e., approximately half the mediator mass). Finally, while the $B-L$ model also matches the GCE well, its parameter space is almost entirely ruled out by strong direct detection limits, except for the narrow resonance region where $m_\chi$ should be equal to $m_{A'}/2$ requiring a fine-tuning at the few-percent level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">112.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QCD corrections to Minimal Dark Matter annihilations</a><span class="id">[2508.02778]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>QCD corrections to fermionic Minimal Dark Matter annihilations increase its annihilation cross section (by 2% for a weak doublet, 1.3% for a triplet, 0.5% for a quintuplet) and thereby the Dark Matter mass required to achieve the observed cosmological relic abundance via thermal freeze-out.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">113.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unified Framework for Geodesic Dynamics with Conservative, Dissipative, and GUP Effects</a><span class="id">[2509.14663]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated minimal-length corrections.

Within this revised perturbative QCD model, we find that if we require only that the energy per baryon of up-down ($ud$) quark matter exceeds 930 MeV so as not to contradict the standard nuclear physics, the maximum mass of an $ud$ quark star allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model can reach up to 2.17 $M_{\odot}$. From this perspective, the observed 2.14 $M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0740+6620 may be an $ud$ quark star. However, if we further impose the constraint that the tidal deformability of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ $ud$ quark star must be consistent with the GW170817 event, the maximum mass allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model would decrease to no more than 2.08 $M_{\odot}$.

Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">120.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost instabilities and strong coupling in quadratic non-metricity theories</a><span class="id">[2511.19101]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit the framework of Newer General Relativity, defined by all independent quadratic invariants of the non-metricity tensor, including the unique quadratic parity-violating term. We analyze linear perturbations around a flat FLRW background and find that the theory generically exhibits ghost instabilities and/ or propagates more degrees of freedom than in the Minkowski limit, signalling strong coupling. There are two notable exceptions: the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR) and the transverse-diffeomorphism-invariant gravity subclass, both of which are supplemented by the parity-violating operator. However, since the parity-violating term explicitly breaks (transverse) diffeomorphism invariance, we show, using both the Dirac-Bergmann procedure and the Cartan-Kuranishi algorithm, that the parity-violating extension of STEGR propagates eight degrees of freedom at the fully non-linear level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">121.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$\mathbb Z_2$-Stable Dark Matter via Broken $\text{SU}(5)$ Gauge Bosons</a><span class="id">[2511.19462]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">122.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Bottom-Up EFT Approach To Superdense Baryonic Matter</a><span class="id">[2511.21141]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>How to arrive at the densest matter in massive compact stars starting from Walecka's linear $\omega$-$\sigma$ mean-field model is described in a series of arguments anchored on hidden local symmetry, hidden scale symmetry and emergent parity-doublet symmetry. I follow the bottom-up approach from chiral symmetry with pions, coupled to hidden local and scale symmetry degrees of freedom. Exploiting the renormalization-group treatment à la Shankar and Polchinski of the fermionic interactions on the Fermi sphere, leading to Landau-Migdal Fermi-liquid, one obtains a sort of generalized “Density Functional&quot; that allows via a topology change hadrons transform to quarks without phase changes at the center of massive stars. The highly dense matter is “pseudo-conformal&quot; with the sound velocity $v_{pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$ but the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is not equal to zero, hence the matter is non-conformal.</p></div></details></article></body>
