<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Beta-Bound: Drift constraints for Gated Quantum Probabilities</a><span class="id">[2601.22188]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quantum mechanics provides extraordinarily accurate probabilistic predictions, yet the framework remains silent on what distinguishes quantum systems from definite measurement outcomes. This paper develops a measurement-theoretic framework for projective gating. The central object is the $\beta$-bound, an inequality that controls how much probability assignments can drift when gating and measurement fail to commute. For a density operator $\rho$, projector $F$, and effect $E$, with gate-passage probability $s = {\rm Tr}(\rho F)$ and commutator norm $\varepsilon = \|[F, E]\|$, the symmetric partial-gating drift satisfies $|\Delta p_F(E)| \leq 2 \sqrt{(1 - s)/s} \cdot \varepsilon$. The constant 2 is sharp. We introduce two diagnostic quantities: the coherence witness $W(\rho, F) = \|F \rho (I - F)\|_1$, measuring cross-boundary coherence, and the record fidelity gap $\Delta_T(\rho_F, R)$, measuring expectation-value change under symmetrisation. Three experimental vignettes demonstrate falsifiability: Hong–Ou–Mandel interferometry, atomic energy-basis dephasing, and decoherence-induced classicality. The framework is operational and interpretation-neutral, compatible with Everettian, Bohmian, QBist, and collapse approaches. It provides quantitative structure that any interpretation must accommodate, along with a template for experimental tests.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Navigating permanent underdetermination in dark energy and inflationary cosmology</a><span class="id">[2501.13521]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We identify troubling cases of so-called `permanent underdetermination' in both dark energy and inflationary cosmology. We bring to bear (a) a taxonomy of possible responses to underdetermination, and (b) an understanding of both dark energy and inflationary cosmology from an effective field theory point of view. We argue that, under certain conditions, there are viable responses which can arguably alleviate at least some of the concerns about underdetermination in the dark energy and inflationary sectors. However, the epistemic threat of permanent underdetermination remains a significant challenge.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16050" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implications of computer science theory for the simulation hypothesis</a><span class="id">[2404.16050]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The simulation hypothesis has recently excited renewed interest in the physics and philosophy communities. However, the hypothesis specifically concerns {\textit{computers}} that simulate physical universes. So to formally investigate the hypothesis, we need to understand it in terms of computer science (CS) theory. In addition we need a formal way to couple CS theory with physics. Here I couple those fields by using the physical Church-Turing thesis. This allow me to exploit Kleene's second recursion, to prove that not only is it possible for {us} to be a simulation being run on a computer, but that we might be in a simulation being run a computer \emph{by us}. In such a “self-simulation”, there would be two identical instances of us, both equally “real”. I then use Rice's theorem to derive impossibility results concerning simulation and self-simulation; derive implications for (self-)simulation if we are being simulated in a program using fully homomorphic encryption; and briefly investigate the graphical structure of universes simulating other universes which contain computers running their own simulations. I end by describing some of the possible avenues for future research. While motivated in terms of the simulation hypothesis, the results in this paper are direct consequences of the Church-Turing thesis. So they apply far more broadly than the simulation hypothesis.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22428" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Learning vs Traditional Lecturing in Introductory Mechanics: A Pooled Pass-Rate Benchmark Under Common Departmental Assessments from a Latin American Institutional Change Initiative</a><span class="id">[2601.22428]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Improving student success in introductory physics remains a persistent challenge despite substantial progress from research-based instructional practices. Evidence from the Latin American context remains limited, where resources for instructional change are often constrained. This study reports a transparent benchmark of student passing outcomes in \textit{Elementary Mechanics I} at a large public university in México, comparing sections using Active Learning (AL) with those using Traditional Lecturing (TL). The labels AL and TL are operational, referring to section-level implementations by individual instructors rather than standardized protocols. Using aggregated counts from coordinator reports and common departmental assessments – written by a committee independent of instructional modality – we estimated pooled student-level pass probabilities for the first and second midterm exams, the global exam, and the final mark. Modality differences are summarized primarily by the risk difference, $RD_a=p_{\mathrm{AL},a}-p_{\mathrm{TL},a}$ (percentage points), with uncertainty quantified using Wilson confidence intervals and a Bayesian reference analysis with Jeffreys priors for binomial proportions. Across assessments, pooled pass rates were higher under AL than under TL, with the strongest separation observed for the global exam and the final mark. For these outcomes, the $95\%$ confidence intervals excluded zero, including under a random-intercept Bayesian model. We emphasize a constrained interpretation: the results provide a student-weighted benchmark of “AL as implemented” versus “TL as implemented” in this setting, without isolating the causal effect of individual instructional techniques. Implications are discussed for departmental decision-making and feasible next steps in evaluation, including improved student data collection and more robust qualitative analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formative experience for intensive instruction physics courses: Evaluation and results in an Electromagnetism course</a><span class="id">[2512.12404]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rising demand for higher education has led universities to offer courses in multiple formats, including Intensive Instruction Courses (IICs), to meet the needs of a diverse student body. While active teaching methods improve physics understanding in standard courses, little research has examined their effectiveness in IICs. This research explored the most efficient methodologies for promoting meaningful learning in intensive physics courses. To this end, an integrated pedagogical proposal was designed based on the opinions gathered from a focus group of teachers with previous experience teaching these courses, as well as on existing literature, highlighting methodologies, types of assessment, and characteristics of ICCs. To evaluate its efficiency, a quasi-experiment was conducted in which students were divided into two groups: an experimental group (EG), which followed the teaching proposal, and a control group (CG), which received non-innovated lessons. Results were measured using the BEMA electromagnetism concepts inventory before and after the intervention. Statistical analysis revealed that Hake's Gain was greater in the EG, both in general terms and in each thematic unit of the course. The intervention in the EG showed that the use of active methodologies was more efficient than those used in the CG in the context of IICs. The results obtained suggest the need to continue investigating other factors involved in the teaching-learning process of IICs.</p></div></details></article></body>
