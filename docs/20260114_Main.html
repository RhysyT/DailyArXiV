However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow (  0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to   30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors   100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dense gas linked to star-forming regions photoionised by embedded gamma-ray bursts</a><span class="id">[2601.07919]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 1-100 pc region embedding long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) has been hitherto unexplored, as extremely high ionisation by the GRB prevents application of optical absorption spectroscopy on such distances. We show that the GRB ionising flux imprints a unique time- and spatially-dependent ionisation structure on the gas, that can be probed by X-ray absorption. Application of this model to a selected sample of 7 bright GRB X-ray afterglow spectra observed by \textit{XMM-Newton} EPIC-pn enables an independent, quantitative estimation of the density (log(n) $\sim$ 2-4) and distances (5-100 pc) of the ionized absorber directly from the GRB X-ray spectrum, thereby allowing us to locate the absorbing medium of this representative sample of long GRBs in the region of the density-size diagram populated by star-forming regions versus other gravitationally bound objects in the Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07922" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A persistent bow shock in a diskless magnetised accreting white dwarf</a><span class="id">[2601.07922]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar bow shocks are formed when an outflow interacts with the interstellar medium. In white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion, outflows are associated with either strong winds from the donor star, the accretion disk, or a thermonuclear runaway explosion on the white dwarf surface. To date, only six accreting white dwarfs are known to harbour disk-wind driven bow shocks that are not associated to thermonuclear explosions. Here, we report the discovery of a bow shock associated with a high-proper-motion disk-less accreting white dwarf, 1RXS J052832.5+283824. We show that the white dwarf has a strong magnetic field in the range B 42-45 MG, making RXJ0528+2838 the a bonafide known polar-type cataclysmic variable harbouring a bow shock. The resolved bow shock is shown to be inconsistent with a past thermonuclear explosion, or being inflated by a donor wind, ruling out all accepted scenarios for inflating a bow shock around this system. Modelling of the energetics reveals that the observed bow shock requires a persistent power source with a luminosity significantly exceeding the system accretion energy output. This implies the presence of a powerful, previously unrecognized energy loss mechanism - potentially tied to magnetic activity - that may operate over sufficiently long timescales to influence the course of binary evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07924" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sahyadri: A simulation suite for the cosmology dependence of the Cosmic Web</a><span class="id">[2601.07924]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Sahyadri, a suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations designed to enable precision studies of the low-redshift Universe with next-generation spectroscopic surveys. Sahyadri includes systematic variations of six cosmological parameters around Planck 2018 constraints, with seed-matched initial conditions enabling cosmological parameter derivatives. Each simulation evolves $2048^3$ particles in a periodic box of side length $200$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc, yielding a particle mass of $m_{\rm{p}} = 8.1 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ in the fiducial Planck 2018 cosmology. This resolution enables robust identification of dark matter halos down to $M_{\rm min} = 3.2 \times 10^{9}$ $h^{-1}$ $M_\odot$, which represents a factor of $\sim$25 improvement over the AbacusSummit suite, and is over two orders of magnitude better than the Quijote and Aemulus suites. We estimate that approximately 40% of DESI BGS galaxies at redshift $z &lt; 0.15$ - roughly 1.6 million objects - reside in halos accessible to Sahyadri but beyond the reach of existing parameter-varying simulation suites. We demonstrate Sahyadri's capabilities through measurements of the matter power spectrum, halo mass function and power spectrum, and beyond 2-point statistics such as the Voronoi volume function and $k^{\rm th}$ nearest neighbour statistics, showing excellent agreement with theoretical predictions and significant sensitivity to $\Omega_{\rm m}$ variations. We implement a custom compression scheme reducing storage requirements by a factor of $\sim$3 while maintaining sub-percent clustering accuracy. Key data products will be made publicly available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An eclipsing 8.56 minute orbital period mass-transferring binary</a><span class="id">[2601.07925]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of ATLAS J101342.5-451646.8 (hereafter ATLAS J1013-4516), an eclipsing, mass-transferring AM Canum Venaticorum binary with an 8.56-minute orbital period, identified via periodic variability in light curves from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System survey of Gaia white dwarf candidates. Follow-up spectroscopy with the Large Lenslet Array Magellan Spectrograph reveals a helium-dominated accretion disk, while high-speed photometry with ULTRACAM shows pronounced primary and secondary eclipses. We construct a decade-long timing baseline using data from ATLAS, Gaia, ULTRACAM on the Gran Telescopio Canarias, and the proto-Lightspeed instrument on the Magellan Clay telescope. From this baseline, we measure an orbital period derivative of dP/dt = -1.60 +/- 0.07 x 10^-12 seconds per second. Interpreted in the context of stable mass transfer, the magnitude and sign of the period derivative indicate that the orbital evolution is governed by the interplay between gravitational-wave-driven angular momentum losses and mass transfer, directly probing the donor star's structural response to mass loss. Assuming angular momentum loss dominated by gravitational wave emission, we constrain the component masses and infer the characteristic gravitational wave strain of the system for future space-based observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. We predict a characteristic strain corresponding to a four-year signal-to-noise ratio greater than approximately 20, establishing ATLAS J1013-4516 as a strong prospective source for probing long-term orbital evolution in the mass-transferring regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07928" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The GRB Intrinsic Duration Distribution: Progenitor Insights Across Cosmic Time</a><span class="id">[2601.07928]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the distribution of the intrinsic duration of gamma-ray bursts' prompt emission. This expands upon the analysis of Bromberg et al., 2012 and Bromberg et al. 2013 who showed evidence for collapsar progenitors based on the presence of a plateau in the distribution of $T_{90}$, the duration over which 90 % of the prompt emission is observed for any given detector. We confirm the presence of this plateau in the distribution of duration corrected for cosmological time dilation (what we call intrinsic duration, $T_{int}$), but shifted to smaller timescales by a factor of $1/(1+z_{\rm av}) \sim 1/3$, where $z_{\rm av}$ is the average GRB redshift. More significantly, we show this plateau is only present in the sample of GRBs with redshifts greater than $(1+z) \sim 2$, and does not appear in the duration distribution of lower redshift GRBs. This result aligns with suggestions that the low redshift population of GRBs has a significant contribution from non-collapsar progenitors (while the high redshift sample is dominated by collapsars). We also show the difference in this distribution between spectrally hard and soft GRBs, confirming that a plateau is only present for the soft subset of GRBs. However, when we separate the soft GRBs into low and high redshift subsets, we find that only the high redshift soft GRBs show evidence of a plateau, while the low-redshift soft GRBs do not. This suggests there exists a significant subset of spectrally soft non-collapsar progenitors at low redshift. Finally, we use the end time of the plateau to constrain the GRB progenitor density profile and radius, and show the maximum size of a collapsar is a few tenths of a solar radius.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identification of three new ULXs in NGC 4631 and NGC 1097: evidence for stellar-mass black holes</a><span class="id">[2601.08047]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations of galaxies continue to reveal new ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), increasing their known population and improving the statistics needed to understand their nature. We study the ULX populations of NGC 4631 and NGC 1097 using archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift/XRT observations to identify new ULXs and investigate their X-ray and optical properties. We analyzed X-ray data spanning 2000-2025. Spectral fitting was performed for sources with sufficient counts using absorbed power-law and diskbb models. Variability analyses, including hardness-intensity diagrams and light curves, were used to assess short- and long-term variability. Optical color-magnitude diagrams and near-infrared (NIR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were employed to identify possible donor stars. In NGC 4631, we identified two new transient ULXs, X-6 and X-7, with X-ray count rates varying by more than an order of magnitude. The LX-T^4 relation from diskbb fits provides strong evidence that NGC 4631 X-6 is powered by a stellar-mass black hole accreting via a standard disk. The optical sources within the X-ray error circles of X-6 and X-7 are candidate counterparts, suggesting these systems are candidate HMXBs. In NGC 1097, we discovered a new transient ULX, ULX-3, showing X-ray luminosity variations by a factor of about 30 and evidence for spectral state transitions, consistent with either a stellar-mass black hole or a neutron star. We identified a unique optical and NIR counterpart. While the optical emission is variable, the NIR emission is stable. The NIR SED is consistent with a blackbody temperature of about 3300 K, compatible with a red supergiant donor with a radius of about 200 solar radii.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08093" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cascade Processes of Strong and Weak MHD Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2601.08093]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>On the framework of relativistic force-free magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we explore the fundamental properties of strong and weak turbulent cascades using high-resolution numerical simulations in the presence of a uniform background magnetic field. We find that (1) power spectra and scale-dependent anisotropies both for the strong and weak turbulence resemble those observed in the non-relativistic MHD turbulence; (2) intermittency of magnetic fields in strong turbulence is stronger than that in the weak one; (3) generated Alfvén modes show similar energy spectra and scale-dependent anisotropies to those of non-relativistic case; (4) generated fast modes present a power spectrum similar to that of Alfvén modes, with a strong (for strong turbulence) or weak (for weak turbulence) scale-dependent anisotropy, which are significantly different from non-relativistic turbulence; and (5) applications of our numerical results to neutron star magnetospheres show that the strong (or moderately weak) turbulent cascade can explain the X-ray radiation of the Vela pulsar. Our study is of great significance for understanding energy transfer, magnetic field evolution, and particle acceleration mechanisms in extreme astrophysical environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the C IV Forest with DESI DR2</a><span class="id">[2601.08103]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the cross-correlation of triply ionized carbon C IV absorption with the positions of quasars (QSO) and Emission Line Galaxies (ELG). We use quasars and ELGs from the second data release (DR2) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. Our data sample consists of 2.5 million quasars, 3.1 million ELGs, and the C IV absorption is measured along the line of sight of 1.5 million high redshift quasars with $z &gt; 1.3$. We measure the isotropic BAO signal at 4.2$\sigma$ for the CIV$\times$QSO cross-correlation. This translates into a 3.0% precision measurement of the ratio of the isotropic distance scale, $D_{\rm V}$, and the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_{\rm d}$, with $D_{\rm V}/r_{\rm d}(z_{\rm eff} = 1.92) = 30.3 \pm 0.9$. We make the first detection of the BAO feature in the CIV$\times$ELG cross-correlation at a significance of 2.5$\sigma$ and find $D_{\rm V}/r_{\rm d}(z_{\rm eff} = 1.47) = 24.6 \pm 1.0$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08154" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observation of the Forbush decrease on 2024 May 10, using the ALPAQUITA air-shower array at the 70-1000 GV rigidity range</a><span class="id">[2601.08154]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Andes Large area PArticle detector for Cosmic ray and Astronomy (ALPACA) is a new air-shower array experiment under construction in the Bolivian Andes, and its prototype ALPAQUITA surface array has been operating since 2023 April. In addition to the traditional $\ge$3-hit or $\ge$4-hit coincidences to trigger recording air-shower events, ALPAQUITA records the counting rates of the $\ge$1-hit and $\ge$2-hit events (Any1 and Any2, respectively). We report a successful detection of a Forbush decrease occurred on 2024 May 10 caused by a passage of an interplanetary shock formed ahead of the Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection. The amplitude detected in the Any1 rate is 4.26$\pm$0.33% at the median primary rigidity of 76GV which is consistent with the observations with the worldwide neutron monitor and muon detector networks. Under the assumption of a power-law rigidity spectrum, we renormalized the errors of the observed amplitude ($A_{obs}$) and fitted them as a function of the median primary rigidity ($R_{m}$) of each detector and observational method. The result $A_{obs} = (10.9\% \pm 0.9\%) \times (R_{m}/10\,GV)^{-0.55 \pm 0.07}$ exhibits a hard nature of this event. Our non-detection in the Any2 rate decrease constrains the amplitude with a 2$\sigma$ upper limit to be 0.95% at 960GV. This marginally suggests an existence of a spectral softening between 100GV and 1000GV as also suggested by the Misato underground muon detector at 145GV. Although a strong geomagnetic storm was observed during this period, we conclude it does not impact our results. Our novel technique realizes a unique coverage to study the behavior of the Forbush decreases at the highest rigidity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08164" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unraveling Year-Long Radial Velocity Variations in Red Clump Region – I: Comprehensive analysis of a K0 Giant star, 2 Draconis</a><span class="id">[2601.08164]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Slow-rotating evolved stars frequently exhibit radial velocity (RV) variations on annual timescales, complicated by instrumental systematics and aliasing in the one-year regime. Here we investigate the origin of the near-yearly periodicity in 2 Dra, a star located in the red-clump region, assessing possible causes between stellar activity, instrumental profile (IP) effects, sampling alias, and planetary companions. We applied two independent approaches: (1) constraining diagnostic signals and performing a correlation analysis ($r$) between period-confined signals, and (2) evaluating phase stability by partitioning Keplerian fits. These methods enabled us to examine the physical connections and phase coherence among stellar activity indicators, RV measurements, and IP diagnostics. Our analysis suggests a stellar rotation period of $\simeq270\text{--}320$ d for 2 Dra. The 340-d RV signal does not appear to originate from stellar activity in this chromospherically quiet star ($|r| \lesssim 0.33$), nor from instrumental systematics near the annual period ($|r| \lesssim 0.1$). This conclusion is supported by contrasting phase behavior: the RV and stellar activity phases remain stable, whereas the IP phases do not. We therefore propose that the 340-d variation likely arises from either small-amplitude intrinsic variability or a tentative gas giant companion with potential weak activity-induced modulation. The case of 2 Dra provides a framework for distinguishing the origins of $\sim$1-yr RV variations in other evolved stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08227" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jupiter-like uniform metal enrichment in a system of multiple giant exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2601.08227]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The accretion of icy and rocky solids during the formation of a gas giant planet is poorly constrained and challenging to model. Refractory species, like sulfur, are only present in solids in the protoplanetary disk where planets form. Measuring their abundance in planetary atmospheres is one of the most direct ways of constraining the extent and mechanism of solid accretion. Using the unprecedented sensitivity of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we measure a detailed chemical make-up of three massive gas giants orbiting the star HR 8799 including direct detections of H$_2$O, CO, CH$_4$, CO$_2$, H$_2$S, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O. We find these planets are uniformly and highly enriched in heavy elements compared to the star irrespective of their volatile (carbon and oxygen) or refractory (sulfur) nature, which strongly suggests efficient accretion of solids during their formation. This composition closely resembles that of Jupiter and Saturn and demonstrates that this enrichment also occurs in systems of multiple gas giant planets orbiting stars beyond the Solar System. This discovery hints at a shared origin for the heavy element enrichment of giant planets across a wider range of planet masses and orbital separations than previously anticipated.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08269" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bifurcated Impact of Neutrino Fast Flavor Conversion on Core-collapse Supernovae Informed by Multi-angle Neutrino Radiation Hydrodynamics</a><span class="id">[2601.08269]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this {\it Letter}, we present a compelling and robust argument for the roles of neutrino fast flavor conversion (FFC) in the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), combining the {\it multi-angle} FFC subgrid model rooted in quantum kinetic theory with the multi-dimensional four-species Boltzmann neutrino radiation hydrodynamics. Employing various progenitor masses and the nuclear equations of states, we find that the effect of FFC on CCSN explosion is bifurcated depending on the progenitors. For the lowest-mass progenitor, FFC facilitates the shock revival and enhances the explosion energy, whereas for higher-mass progenitors its impact is inhibitory. We identify the mass accretion rate as the key determinant governing this bifurcation. When the mass accretion rate is low (high), the contribution of FFC to neutrino heating becomes positive (negative), because the heating efficiency enhancement via FFC-driven spectral hardening of electron-type neutrinos dominates over (is outweighed by) the concurrent reduction in neutrino luminosity. Our results further highlight the limitations of approximate neutrino transport, and demonstrate that a multi-angle treatment is essential for accurately capturing FFC effects; otherwise, FFCs are missed and even generated spuriously.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08306" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A youthful Titan implied by improved impact simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.08306]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The small number of impact craters found on Titan suggests that its surface is relatively young. Previous work estimated its surface age to be between 200 and 1000 Myr. This estimate, however, is based on crater scaling laws for water and sand, which are not representative of the composition of Titan's icy surface. Titan's surface is likely composed of water ice, methane clathrates, or a combination of both. Here, we perform impact simulations for impactors of various sizes that strike an icy target with a 0-15 km thick methane clathrate cap layer. We derive new crater scaling laws based on our numerical results, and find that Titan's surface age is 300-340 Myr, assuming heliocentric impactors and surface clathrates. This age, which represents the crater retention age, indicates a relatively youthful surface, suggesting that active endogenic and/or exogenic processes have recently reshaped Titan's surface.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direct detection of hydrogen reveals a new macroscopic crustal water reservoir on early Mars</a><span class="id">[2601.08390]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The next great leap in Martian exploration will be the return of samples to Earth. To ensure the maximum scientific return from studying these samples, the development and utilisation of nondestructive analytical techniques are essential to enable early three-dimensional characterisation of their interiors. Neutron computed tomography is a powerful method in this context: it is highly sensitive to hydrogen and complements the more conventional X-ray computed tomography. Because the distribution and nature of hydrous phases are central to understanding the habitability, the climatic and geological evolution, and potential biosignatures of Mars, identifying hydrogenbearing phases in Martian crustal rocks is of particular importance. Using the only Martian crustal material available on Earth, the NWA 7034 meteorite and its pairs, we show that combined neutron and X-ray computed tomography enables non-destructive sample-wide mapping of hydrogen and reveals the distribution and petrographic contexts of hydrous phases. We identify hydrogen-rich iron oxyhydroxides within ancient igneous clasts, forming a macroscopic mineralogical water reservoir within the meteorite. These alteration assemblages closely resemble those observed in samples collected by the Perseverance rover in Jezero crater, where hydrated iron oxyhydroxides are also present. This similarity suggests that such phases may represent a widespread near-surface water reservoir on early Mars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new magnitude–redshift relation based on SNe Ia</a><span class="id">[2601.08505]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new empirical relation between the standardized magnitude ($m$) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and redshift ($z$). Using Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR, we find a negative linear correlation between $m-5\log(z(1+z))$ and $z$, implying that their magnitude–redshift relation can be parametrized with just two parameters: an intercept $\mathcal{M}$ and a slope $b$. This relation corresponds to the luminosity distance $d_L(z)=c\,H_0^{-1}z(1+z)10^{bz/5}$ and is valid up to at least $z\simeq1.1$. It outperforms the $\Lambda$CDM and flat $w$CDM models and the (2,1) Padé approximant for $d_L(z)$, and performs comparably to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model and the (2,1) Padé($j_0=1$) model of Hu et al. Furthermore, the relation is stable in the absence of low-$z$ SNe, making it suitable for fitting Hubble diagrams of SNe Ia without the need to add a low-$z$ sample. In deep fields in particular, assuming that the large-scale density is independent of the comoving radial coordinate, $b\propto q_0+1$. We fit the empirical relation to SN data in eight deep-field regions and find that their fitted $\mathcal{M}$ and $b$ parameters are consistent within $1.6\,\sigma$, in agreement with isotropy. The inferred $q_0$ values, ranging from $-0.6$ to $-0.4$, are consistent within $1.5\,\sigma$ and significantly lower than zero, indicating statistically consistent cosmic acceleration across all eight regions. We apply the empirical relation to the DES-Dovekie and Amalgame SN samples, finding $b$ values consistent with those from DES-SN5YR and Pantheon+. Finally, using the empirical relation in the hemispheric comparison method applied to Pantheon+ up to $z=1.1$, we find no evidence for anisotropies in $\mathcal{M}$ and $b$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the estimation of Sulfuric Acid Vapor concentrations below the Venus cloud deck using the Akatsuki Radio Science Experiment</a><span class="id">[2601.08507]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report new constraints on the vertical distribution of sulfuric acid vapor in the Venusian atmosphere, derived from a refined analysis of radio occultation (RO) data. The method estimates the power spectral density (PSD) of the received signal to recover both the signal intensity and the Doppler shift. The received signal power is estimated at 1-sec cadence which enhances the sensitivity and detection of the signal at lower altitudes of Venus, even in regions of high atmospheric opacity. After correcting total attenuation for refractive losses, absorption by known microwave absorbers is removed, leaving a residual signal attributable to sulfuric acid vapor. Two different methods of estimating the absorption due to Sulfur Dioxide have been presented, including one which incorporates in-situ data, which should better constrain the sulfuric acid vapor abundance below the clouds. Retrieved profiles for altitudes of 40 - 50 km reveal an increasing vapor abundance to more than 10 ppm below the clouds, and a sharp decline above 50 km in line with the expected saturation profile. These measurements agree with current models of the Venusian cloud structure and composition, and demonstrate that RO data, when coupled with optimized spectral analysis, can yield quantitative constraints on trace absorbers in optically thick atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08508" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermal-timescale accretion does not always yield critical rotation in mass gainers</a><span class="id">[2601.08508]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binary evolution plays a central role in producing rapidly rotating stars. Previous studies have shown that mass gainers in binaries can reach critical rotation after accreting only modest amounts of material, particularly during thermal-timescale Case B mass transfer, where tidal spin-down is ineffective due to wide orbits. However, such rapid accretion often drives the mass gainer out of thermal equilibrium, and its subsequent spin evolution during thermal relaxation has not been analysed in depth. In this study, we construct a suite of accreting detailed single-star models with different accretion prescriptions, which inflate and spin up to critical rotation during the accretion. After the accretion has ended, the models relax thermally and deflate. We find that the ratio of surface to critical angular velocity decreases to subcritical values during thermal contraction, with the magnitude of this decrease correlating with the degree of thermal disequilibrium at the end of accretion. This reduction in fractional critical rotation is even stronger when internal angular momentum transport is inefficient. Detailed binary models show the same trend, indicating that the results from our toy single-star models also apply to real binary evolution. Our results highlight that binary mass transfer does not always produce critically rotating stars, but instead may yield a wide range of spin rates depending on the mass transfer and accretion history. Our findings offer new insights into the rotational properties of mass gainers in binaries, stellar merger products, and newly formed massive stars following accretion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio timing constraints on the orbital orientation and component masses of PSR J1455$-$3330</a><span class="id">[2601.08541]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>PSR J1455$-$3330 is a $\sim$7.98 ms pulsar in a $\sim$76.17 day nearly circular orbit with a white dwarf companion.

The analysis is carried out with all-flavour neutrino interactions, where we demonstrate that cascade events, primarily due to $\nu_{e,\tau}$, show greater sensitivity to a dark matter signal compared to the more commonly studied track events. Furthermore, we highlight the impact of a previously overlooked background, Galactic neutrinos produced from interactions between hadronic cosmic rays and interstellar gas. We find dark matter sensitivities are more strongly degraded in the high energy region above $\sim 10\, {\rm TeV}$, with a maximal weakening of approximately a factor of $\sim 2$. This effect remains smaller than the uncertainty associated with the dark matter density profile but can nonetheless mimic a positive annihilation signal. We contextualize these results with a concrete particle model and show that TRIDENT will be able to probe the most interesting untested parts of parameter space.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost-free non-local $F(R)$ Gravity Compatible with ACT</a><span class="id">[2601.07879]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We confront the ghost-free non-local $F(R)$ gravity theories with the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) constraints on the spectral index of the scalar perturbations and the updated constraints of Planck/BICEP on the tensor-to-scalar ratio.

Starting from a universally conformally coupled matter sector, we rewrite the field equations in terms of the invariant set $\{{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_3,\hat g_{\mu\nu}\}$, so that Machian requirements can be stated independently of conformal frame. Sciama's causal postulate is implemented not by modifying the local dynamics, but as a selection rule on the solution space of the invariant scalar equation: the admissible configuration is the retarded response to the matter distribution in the causal past, with any source-free contribution removed. In a spatially flat FLRW universe, and in the light, slowly varying regime, the prescription reduces to an explicit temporal kernel that links the background scalar evolution to the matter content within the Hubble region, reproducing the expected Machian scaling in an expanding background. Universal coupling to a single physical metric implies that structureless test bodies share the same acceleration in a given external configuration, so that the Eötvs parameter vanishes at leading order. Nonuniversal effects can arise only when gravitational binding energy contributes appreciably to the total mass, as in strongly self-gravitating objects. Thus, the theory implements a causal Machian determination of the cosmological inertial scale while remaining consistent with standard weak-field tests.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signatures of a subpopulation of hierarchical mergers in the GWTC-4 gravitational-wave dataset</a><span class="id">[2601.07908]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Repeated black-hole mergers in dense stellar clusters are a plausible mechanism to populate the predicted gap in black hole masses due to the pair-instability process.

We introduce an astrophysically-motivated model in the joint space of effective inspiral and precessing spins, which captures the dominant spin dynamics expected for hierarchical mergers. We find decisive evidence both for a population transition above $\sim 45M_\odot$, consistent with the anticipated onset of the pair-instability gap, as well as a peak at $\sim 15 M_\odot$, which we interpret as the global peak in the hierarchical merger rate. The existence of low- and high-mass subpopulations of higher-generation black holes suggests the contribution of both near-solar-metallicity and metal-poor star clusters to the hierarchical merger population.

While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta~\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the &quot;frozen-in&quot; condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, identifying magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08199" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chiral three-nucleon forces for the new local position-space two-nucleon potential in $\textit{ab initio}$ many-body calculations</a><span class="id">[2601.08199]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Three-nucleon force (3NF) plays an important role in understanding the structure of finite nuclei and the saturation properties of infinite nuclear matter.

Our aim is to explore the application of single spacecraft diagnostics to the IIAI, in anticipation of application to the current missions operating in the inner heliosphere, e.g. PSP and Solar Orbiter. Methods. We apply the field-particle correlation (FPC) technique to fully kinetic simulations of IIAI. We characterize the conversion of energy between the electric field and particle species, allowing the differentiation between oscillatory and secular energy transfer to and from the particles and highlighting the role of resonant energy exchange.

Applying the FPC technique to our simulations run in parameters regime compatible with solar wind conditions, we have identified IIAI signatures that would enable efficient recognition of IIAI in observations.

In this work, we investigate power suppression and related mitigation of lensing anomaly with the help of phenomenological models which are valid over scales of interest. We consider simple extensions to nearly scale invariant power spectra such as those which includes running and running of running of spectral index. We perform Bayesian analysis of these models, which are agnostic about power suppression, with Planck legacy data and show that data tend to choose parameters which leads to power suppression at low multipoles. We then investigate the connection between power suppression and alleviation of lensing anomaly and show that lensing anomaly is mitigated the most in models with maximum suppression of power at low multipoles. We also analyse the significance of these findings using information criteria. These results are further analyzed in the light of Planck Release 4 data using CamSpec, HiLLiPoP and LoLLiPoP likelihoods in which departure of lensing parameter from one is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we investigate the ability of near-ultimate future CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models and to settle the issue. We conclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power suppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenological models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00880" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Model of UV-Blue Absorbance in Bulk Liquid of Venusian Cloud Aerosols Is Consistent with Efficient Organic Absorbers at High Concentrations</a><span class="id">[2505.00880]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>At visible wavelengths, Venus appears serene and pale-yellow, but since the 1920s, observers have noted high-contrast features in the ultraviolet. These features track the about 4-day superrotation of the upper cloud deck and vary widely over time and space. The identity of the UV absorber(s), active between at least 280 and 500 nm, remains unknown, as no proposed candidate fully matches all observational data. From remote observations of Venus, and accounting for light scattering by sub-micrometer droplets, we modeled the 365-455 nm absorbance per cm of the bulk liquids forming Venus's clouds. Assuming a uniform distribution in mode 1 and 2 particles across a 6 km layer below the cloud top at 65 km, we constrain the bulk absorbance with a peak at A375 nm is 2942 per cm. This extremely high absorbance implies the presence of a highly efficient absorber, for example, conjugated organics, at relatively high concentration, e.g., approx. 25 g/L for porphyrin-type pigments with molar absorption coefficient of approx. 100,000 per mole per cm. Inorganic absorbers, typically below 10,000 per mole per cm, would either need to constitute a large portion of the aerosols or still not be sufficiently light-absorbing, even in pure form. We emphasize that all candidate absorbers must be evaluated against Venus's reflectance curve using (i) known molar absorption coefficients, (ii) realistic atmospheric distributions, and (iii) appropriate particle size distributions. The upcoming Rocket Lab mission will test the hypothesis of organics in Venus's clouds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Low Energy Reconstruction using Convolutional Neural Networks</a><span class="id">[2505.16777]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>IceCube is a Cherenkov detector instrumenting over a cubic kilometer of glacial ice deep under the surface of the South Pole.

In several instances, synchrotron seed photons do not fully explain the emission observed, suggesting the presence of other seed photon sources to up-scatter. In this work, we consider the kilonova as a source of seed photons for up-scattering in the afterglow. We model the kilonova as a thermal source injecting into the back of a GRB fireball, evolved using a shell model, and with the electron and photon populations updated via a kinetic solver. We find that VHE emission from weaker afterglows, such as those found in short GRBs, can be affected by such seed photons, with the kilonova seed photons mitigating the loss of synchrotron photons on the VHE emission when afterglow parameters are varied. We also find that VHE emission in structured jets, due to weaker synchrotron emission at their wings, can also benefit from this supply of seed photons, especially when viewed off-axis. We apply this model to GRB 170817A, and show that its VHE spectral flux is higher than expected in previous models for the first 100 d, though still below the detection threshold.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14579" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2024hpj: A perspective on SN 2009ip-like events</a><span class="id">[2508.14579]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernovae (SNe) IIn are terminal explosions of massive stars that are surrounded by a dense circumstellar medium (CSM).

We adopt the SH0ES data for the most up-to-date and carefully vetted measurements, where the Cepheid hosts were selected to harbour also Type Ia supernovae. We introduce two important improvements: a rigorous selection modelling and a state-of-the-art density and peculiar velocity model using Manticore-Local, based on the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm. We infer $H_0 = 71.7 \pm 1.3\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, assuming the Cepheid host sample was selected by supernova magnitudes. However, the actual selection criteria are not clear, and other assumptions can increase $H_0$ by up to one statistical standard deviation. The posterior has a lower central value and a 45 per cent smaller uncertainty than a previous study using the same distance-ladder data. The result is also slightly lower than the supernova-based SH0ES inferred value of $H_0 = 73.2 \pm 0.9\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and is in $3.3\sigma$ tension with the latest cosmic microwave background results in the standard cosmological model. These results demonstrate that a measurement of $H_0$ of sufficient precision to weigh in on the Hubble tension is achievable using second-rung data alone, underscoring the importance of robust and accurate statistical and velocity-field modelling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bias in the tensor-to-scalar ratio from self-interacting dark radiation</a><span class="id">[2509.10607]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the cosmological imprint of self-interacting dark radiation (DR) on the primordial $B$-mode angular power spectrum and its impact on the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We consider a minimal model in which DR is described as an effectively massless axion-like particle with quartic self-interactions. These interactions are incorporated into the Einstein-Boltzmann equations using the relaxation time approximation and implemented in the $\texttt{CLASS}$ code. We show that increasing the strength of DR self-interactions suppresses anisotropic stress, thereby reducing the damping of gravitational waves and leading to an enhancement of the primordial $B$-mode signal relative to the free-streaming case. Using mock CMB data and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, we show that neglecting DR self-interactions may bias the inferred value of $r$ by an amount comparable to the uncertainty expected in forthcoming CMB polarization experiments, such as the ground-based $\textit{Simons Observatory}$ and the satellite missions $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ and PICO. Our results emphasize the importance of properly modeling DR interactions in future precision searches for primordial $B$-modes in order to obtain unbiased constraints on inflationary gravitational waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPTF16geu through the lens of thermonuclear explosion models</a><span class="id">[2510.01160]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The magnification resulting from strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool to add new constraints to the cosmic evolution of supernova progenitors by enabling the study of distant supernovae that would otherwise not be observable. iPTF16geu is the most well-observed gravitationally lensed supernova (glSN) to date. At a redshift of $z = 0.409$ and magnified by a factor of $\sim$68, extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations have been obtained. The explosion mechanism producing this rare event and differences compared to lower redshift supernovae however have not been explored in detail. Here we compare observations of iPTF16geu to existing radiative transfer simulations of type Ia supernova explosion models selected from the literature. We find that overall the DDC6, PDDEL1, and N10 models produce the closest match to the light curves and many absorption features, providing some evidence in favour of the delayed detonation scenario. All models struggle however to replicate the observed colours and in particular the rest-frame UV. We also investigate the magnification and reddening values required to improve agreement with the selected models. Upcoming surveys will significantly increase the samples of SNe discovered at high redshifts due to strong gravitational lensing. These glSNe will enable tighter constraints on the explosion physics of type Ia supernovae and how this has evolved throughout the Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coherence of Supermassive Black Hole Binary Demographics with the nHz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</a><span class="id">[2510.10548]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a refined estimation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) based on observed dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) together with AGN X-ray luminosity functions, in light of recent Pulsar Timing Array detections of an nHz SGWB.

In both long-lived and short-lived remnant scenarios, neutrino flavor conversions modify species-dependent neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and drive the matter towards more neutron rich conditions. They produce up to $300\%$ more neutron rich ejecta and significantly boost the r-process yields, especially in low-density, near-equatorial outflows. We identify regions unstable to fast flavor instabilities and find that these instabilities persist despite flavor conversions. We further test the sensitivity to the equilibration timescale of the flavor conversions, finding that slower flavor conversions can interact with thermodynamic equilibration, and increase the neutron richness of the ejecta. Flavor conversions may also contribute to stronger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions, pointing to a correlation between neutrino transport and merger dynamics. These results highlight the potential impact of flavor conversions while motivating future work to improve on theoretical understanding of flavor instabilities in global simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-rays Emission: a novel tool to detect Extensive Air Showers</a><span class="id">[2511.01624]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the feasibility of detecting extensive air showers via their geo-synchrotron X-ray emission from high-altitude platforms.

The calculation uses noted parameterizations of the electron state variable distributions in the shower to establish a scale for the photon footprint and, further, takes into account the propagation of emitted photons in the atmosphere. The computed fluxes at the position of the detector are used to estimate the detector acceptance and event rate using a bootstrap Monte Carlo procedure. For a 1 m radius and 70° half-aperture circular detector at an altitude between 20 to 30 km viewing the Earth's limb, we find acceptances at the 1 $\mathrm{m^2 sr}$ level and integral event rates of roughly 10 per month.

However, despite their importance in astrophysics, their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Neutrinos that emerge from the dense core of the star offer a promising way to study supernova dynamics. A strategy is presented to improve the potential of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope to detect core-collapse supernovae in our Galaxy or the Large Magellanic Cloud by further exploiting the properties of its optical modules equipped with multiple photomultipliers. A supernova burst is expected to produce a sudden hit rate increase in the KM3NeT detectors. New observables have been defined for individual optical modules that exploit the geometry and time distribution of the detected hits, enabling a better discrimination between signal and background signatures. In addition, a thorough investigation of the related systematic uncertainties is presented for the first time. When implemented, this new methodology allowed KM3NeT to probe 46% more Galactic core-collapse supernova candidates than with the previous trigger strategy, reaching the dense Galactic bulge. It is now expected that, once completed, KM3NeT will achieve full Galactic sensitivity to core-collapse supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variable X-ray Emission of the Planet Hosting T Tauri Star CI Tau</a><span class="id">[2512.00246]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report results of Chandra X-ray observations of CI Tau, a young magnetically active classical T Tauri star for which previous studies have reported periodic variability attributed to a massive planet in a short-period orbit. CI Tau was clearly detected by Chandra in four separate observations acquired in late 2023. The X-ray emission was steady in the first two observations with a characteristic plasma temperature kT   2 keV ( 23 MK) and X-ray luminosity log Lx = 29.74 erg/s. During each of the last two observations obtained two weeks later the count rate increased slowly and the X-ray plasma temperature was much higher but remained nearly steady at kT   4 - 5 keV ( 46 - 58 MK) and peak luminosity log Lx = 30.5 erg/s. Such variable X-ray emission in T Tauri stars accompanied by high plasma temperatures is a signature of magnetic activity, consistent with the known presence of a strong magnetic field in CI Tau. We summarize the variable X-ray emission properties of CI Tau within the framework of T Tauri stars of similar mid-K spectral type, identify possible variability mechanisms, and assess the effects of stellar X-ray irradiation on the claimed planet.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A secondary orbiter under collisions with an accretion disk</a><span class="id">[2512.23826]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dynamics of stellar orbits in dense stellar systems and nuclear star clusters (NSC) with an embedded supermassive black hole (SMBH) is governed a complex interplay of different forces.

The method forms ratios of BAO distances including the Hubble distance, the comoving angular diameter distance, and the volume-averaged distance, so that the sound horizon scale cancels, and then maps each observed ratio to an effective flat-$\Lambda$CDM matter density parameter, ${\Omega}_{\rm M}^{\Lambda}$, defined as the value of $\Omega_{\rm M}$ that reproduces the measured ratio within $\Lambda$CDM. Flat $\Lambda$CDM predicts that ${\Omega}_{\rm M}^{\Lambda}$ should be independent of redshift and of the particular ratio used. For ratios involving the integrated distances, we associate them with well-defined effective line-of-sight redshift intervals based on the integral mean value theorem. We apply the test to BAO measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 and Data Release 2, propagating the full published BAO covariance matrices into all derived ratios and ${\Omega}_{\rm M}^{\Lambda}$ constraints. Within current uncertainties, the inferred ${\Omega}_{\rm M}^{\Lambda}$ values are broadly consistent with a redshift-independent constant, providing an internal consistency check of flat $\Lambda$CDM that can be strengthened straightforwardly as BAO measurements improve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular correlation and deformed Hellings-Downs curve from spin-2 ultralight dark matter</a><span class="id">[2402.03984]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The pulsar timings are sensitive to both the nanohertz gravitational-wave background and the oscillation of ultralight dark matter.

Using Skyrme-like energy density functionals, we demonstrate that a significantly enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction, about four times stronger than conventional parametrizations, can resolve the PREX-CREX puzzle, which has challenged modern nuclear theories and our understanding of nuclear symmetry energy, while maintaining a good description of nuclear bulk properties and well-established shell structure of finite nuclei. This enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction also provides a novel mechanism for the emergence of the $N = 14$, $16$, $32$ and $34$ magic numbers in neutron-rich nuclei on the mean-field level. These findings point to a strong isospin dependence of the nucleon spin-orbit interaction, which is expected to have important implications for nuclear structures, electroweak nuclear processes, and related problems in nuclear astrophysics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scalar perturbations on the normal and self-accelerating branch of a DGP brane and $σ_8$</a><span class="id">[2412.08852]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we constrain the value of $\sigma_8$ for the normal and self-accelerating branch of a DGP brane embedded in a five-dimensional Minkowski space-time.

We model the massive EMRI component as a nonrotating black hole (BH) surrounded by a DM halo. We compute axial and polar GW fluxes for circular orbits at linear order in the mass ratio for DM density profiles with varying mass and compactness. By comparing the phase evolution with vacuum systems, we find that DM halos can induce dephasings of tens to hundreds of radians over a one-year observation period. We demonstrate that even highly diluted DM distributions can significantly affect the emitted waveforms, and that the resulting GW signals can usually be distinguished from each other. While it is important to generalize these findings to more generic orbits and to spinning BHs, our results suggest that LISA could not only reveal the presence of DM halos, but also discriminate between different halo models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Could a Primordial Black Hole Explosion Explain the extremely high-energy KM3NeT neutrino Event?</a><span class="id">[2505.24666]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A black hole is expected to end its lifetime in a cataclysmic runaway burst of Hawking radiation, emitting all Standard Model particles with ultra-high energies. Thus, the explosion of a nearby primordial black hole (PBH) has been proposed as a possible explanation for the $\sim 220$ PeV neutrino-like event recently reported by the KM3NeT collaboration. If the event originated from a PBH, the source would need to lie at $(1-7)\times 10^{-5} \mathrm{pc}$ - depending on the assumed effective area - thus within the Solar System. At such proximity, the resulting flux of gamma rays and cosmic rays would be detectable at Earth. By incorporating the time-dependent field of view of gamma-ray observatories, we show that LHAASO should have recorded $\mathcal{O}(10^8)$ events between fourteen and seven hours prior to the KM3NeT detection. IceCube and KM3NeT \textit{itself} should likewise have detected of order a few hundred events in the range $1~\mathrm{TeV} \lesssim E_\nu \lesssim 1~\mathrm{PeV}$ during the 24 hours preceding the burst. The absence of any such multi-messenger signal, particularly in gamma-ray data, strongly disfavors the interpretation of the KM3-230213A event as arising from evaporation in a minimal four-dimensional Schwarzschild scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic field dynamics in presence of Hall conductivity and thermo-diffusion</a><span class="id">[2506.02202]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Anisotropy of kinetic coefficients in presence of a magnetic field is represented by Hall currents, which appear in a collisional medium due to action of the Lorentz force on the charged particles between collisions.

Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08685" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydrodynamic models of reheating</a><span class="id">[2510.08685]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a causal hydrodynamic model that provides an effective macroscopic description of the field-theoretic dynamics during the early stages of reheating.

The surviving high-energy muons, produced in the first interactions of extensive air showers, open a unique observational window into primary cosmic rays from tens of TeV to up the PeV scale and beyond. This distinctive feature also enables detailed studies of charged hadron production in the earliest stages of shower development. Using 1,338.6 live days of data collected with a one-ton prototype detector for the Jinping Neutrino Experiment, we measured the underground muon flux originating from air showers. The results show discrepancies of about 40\% corresponding to significances of more than 2$\sigma$ (including model-related uncertainties) and 5.5$\sigma$ (excluding them), relative to predictions from several leading hadronic interaction models. We interpret these findings from two complementary perspectives: (i) by adopting the expected cosmic-ray spectra, we constrain the modeling of the first hadronic interactions in air showers and provide novel insights into resolving the long-standing \textit{muon puzzle}; and (ii) by assuming specific hadronic interaction models, we infer the mass composition of cosmic rays, and our data favor a lighter component in the corresponding energy range.
