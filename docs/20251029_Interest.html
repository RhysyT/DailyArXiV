<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two Shades of Quark Color: Parallel Canons across the Cold War Divide</a><span class="id">[2510.23909]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The introduction of the color quantum number is conventionally narrated as a linear progression from the quark-model statistics paradox to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper challenges that teleology by arguing that &quot;color&quot; emerged as two conceptually distinct constructs during the Cold War. The first, originating with Han and Nambu and culminating in QCD, conceived of color as a local gauge charge, the source of a fundamental force mediated by gluons. The second, developed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, treated color as a hidden, three-valued label–a statistical and structural property within a composite, S-matrix-inflected hadron model. We trace these parallel narratives, linking the Dubna approach to a holist epistemology that prioritizes observable amplitudes and global constraints, and the QCD approach to a reductionist program grounded in micro-dynamics. A case study of Fermilab's E-36 experimental chain (1970–78) shows how an observables-first design-tuned to S-matrix and Regge constraints on forward elastic scattering–performed robustly within its natural domain but was ultimately discontinued amid declining theoretical interest and involvement. The subsequent hegemony of QCD retroactively projected its gauge-theoretic conception of color onto history, erasing this epistemic diversity. We conclude that the marginalization of Dubna's structural color was not merely a political outcome of the Cold War but a result of deep ontological and philosophical divergences, advocating for a domain-sensitive pluralism in the historiography of particle physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Algorithmic Randomness, Exchangeability, and the Principal Principle</a><span class="id">[2510.24054]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a framework uniting algorithmic randomness with exchangeable credences to address foundational questions in philosophy of probability and philosophy of science. To demonstrate its power, we show how one might use the framework to derive the Principal Principle – the norm that rational credence should match known objective chance – without circularity. The derivation brings together de Finetti's exchangeability, Martin-Löf randomness, Lewis's and Skyrms's chance-credence norms, and statistical constraining laws ( arXiv:2303.01411 ). Laws that constrain histories to algorithmically random sequences naturally pair with exchangeable credences encoding inductive symmetries. Using the de Finetti representation theorem, we show that this pairing directly entails the Principal Principle of this framework. We extend the proof to partial exchangeability and provide finite-history bounds that vanish in the infinite limit. The Principal Principle thus emerges as a mathematical consequence of the alignment between nomological constraints and inductive learning. This reveals how algorithmic randomness and exchangeability can illuminate foundational questions about chance, frequency, and rational belief.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24296" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmology and Philosophy</a><span class="id">[2510.24296]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scientific cosmology has now reached its period of maturity with the establishment of a standard model, which is the theory of an expanding universe. The question of whether this expansion resolves itself, in the past, into a singularity identifiable with an absolute beginning, or whether the universe in which we are is only one of the multiple possible universes existing either in space or in time, is still under debate. Moreover, the assimilation of the beginning of the universe to a &quot;creation&quot; has often been contested by theology, which, since Thomas Aquinas, if not since the Fathers of the Church, tends to carefully distinguish the two. In the following article, after briefly summarizing some points in the recent history of scientific cosmology, we will attempt to present in broad outline the standard model that scientists have arrived at. Then, we will undertake to study some of the problems it raises as well as the alternative theories that can be opposed to it. Finally, we will discuss the problematic links that scientific cosmology continues to maintain with philosophy and theology, notably the thorny question of creation from nothing ({\it creatio ex nihilo}).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diversity legitimizes science: Holding basic research in the physical sciences accountable to the public</a><span class="id">[2510.23616]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The American scientific community is reeling from funding cuts and policy directives that will debilitate scientific research and education. The underlying hostilities fueling these attacks have intensified in recent years as the COVID-19 pandemic increased suspicion of scientific experts and the institutional embrace of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies in 2020 prompted a backlash along longstanding political fault lines. Under the banner of anti-elitism, opponents of science and DEI have formed a coalition that sees attacks on higher education as a strategic means to achieve their political ends. While some of their arguments contain legitimate criticisms, academics must resist these attacks that seek to dismantle higher education altogether. Instead, we should engage the public in our research process, build a scientific practice representative of and accountable to the communities we serve, and interrogate the aims of our work by critically studying the history of science.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analyzing New Planetary Systems at School: Applications of Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation and Kepler's Third Law</a><span class="id">[2510.23861]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As scientific knowledge expands, science education may not always keep pace with the latest advancements in astrophysics. A solid scientific education is crucial for preparing students for 21st-century challenges. However, science education often focuses narrowly on specific content, neglecting frontier scientific research. To address this, a teaching sequence was developed in Chile using real exoplanet data from the Open Exoplanet Catalog and NASA's Eye on Exoplanets webpage. This integrates cutting-edge astrophysical concepts into classroom discussions. Analyzing this data prompts students to discuss how Newton's law of universal gravitation and Kepler's third law apply to current research on extrasolar systems. This sequence deepens understanding of these principles within modern astrophysics, enriching science education. Such activities spark new research questions akin to those debated in scientific circles, enhancing insights into planetary formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06479" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Novice to Expert in Cloud Physics: a Graph-Based Analysis of Learner Understanding</a><span class="id">[2411.06479]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding how learners conceptualise complex scientific systems remains a key challenge in geoscience education. We investigate the evolution of conceptual understanding of cloud physics among 153 learners, ranging from bachelor students to disciplinary experts and representing diverse academic backgrounds across STEM. To do so, we trace how knowledge structures evolve over time using metrics from a cross-sectional network analysis. The analysis characterises the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of the epistemological shift that learners experience as they mature in their understanding of the discipline. We show that in their description of the life-cycle of a cloud, they progressively transition from the general physics of the water cycle to detailed descriptions of cloud microphysical processes. A triangulation of data sources with a panel of experts complements and confirms the analysis. The results can assist lecturers in structuring their teaching towards higher levels of understanding and enable students to anticipate the key complexities and conceptual challenges in the field during their learning process. Furthermore, the generic nature of the analysis can be transferred to a wide range of disciplines.</p></div></details></article></body>
