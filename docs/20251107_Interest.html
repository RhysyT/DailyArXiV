<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resolution of Loschmidts Paradox via Geometric Constraints on Information Accessibility</a><span class="id">[2511.03843]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We resolve Loschmidt's paradox – the apparent contradiction between time-reversible microscopic dynamics and irreversible macroscopic evolution – including the long-standing puzzle of the thermodynamic arrow of time. The resolution: entropy increases not because dynamics are asymmetric, but because information accessibility is geometrically bounded. For Hamiltonian systems (conservative dynamics), Lyapunov exponents come in positive-negative pairs ($\{\lambda_i, -\lambda_i\}$) due to symplectic structure. Under time reversal these pairs flip ($\lambda_i \to -\lambda_i$), but stable manifolds contract below quantum resolution $\lambda = \hbar/\sqrt{mk_BT}$, becoming physically indistinguishable. We always observe only unstable manifolds where trajectories diverge. Hence information loss proceeds at the same rate $h_{KS} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\text{all } i}|\lambda_i|$ in both time directions, resolving the arrow of time: “forward” simply means “where we observe expansion,” which is universal because stable manifolds always contract below measurability. Quantitatively, for N$_2$ gas at STP with conservative estimates ($h_{KS} \sim 10^{10}$ s$^{-1}$), time reversal at $t = 1$ nanosecond requires momentum precision $\sim 10^{-13}$ times quantum limits – geometrically impossible. At macroscopic times, the precision requirement becomes $\sim 10^{-10^{10}}$ times quantum limits. This framework preserves microscopic time-reversal symmetry, requires no special initial conditions or Past Hypothesis, and extends to quantum systems (OTOCs) and black hole thermodynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Legal Entanglement</a><span class="id">[2511.03982]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two physical systems are correlated in such a way that they appear to instantaneously affect one another, regardless of the distance between them. As commonly understood, Bell's Theorem famously demonstrates that any causal explanation of entanglement must discard either locality (the principle that nothing, including information, travels faster than light) or classical notions of realism (or both). Drawing on this concept, several legal scholars have metaphorically described 'entangled' legal concepts. For instance, if a state's highest court redefines the concept of 'foreseeability' in negligence law, this redefinition alters the concept of 'reasonable care' immediately in the eyes of the law. Godfrey (2024) is the first work to mathematically model entangled legal concepts, particularly in the context of legal interpretation. Here, we extend the quantification to the formulation and delineation of law (lawmaking) and the adjudication of law (judgment). In so doing, we connect legal entanglement to Sichelman's (2022) work on legal entropy, complexity, and the informational content of law. In addition to quantifying entanglement across various legal contexts, our approach provides broader insights. For example, it offers a more comprehensive analysis of the uses and limits of 'modularity' in law–specifically, the role legal boundaries (spatial or intangible) play in reducing information costs within legal systems. Moreover, we discuss how our model can improve theories of legal artificial intelligence. Finally, we explore the application of legal theory back to physics. If quantum physical entanglement operates analogously to legal entanglement, it requires discarding both locality and classical realism, though not in the manner commonly imagined.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comments on Weinstein's comments arXiv: 2509.09361 &amp; 2510.03793</a><span class="id">[2509.22726]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In 2024, after thirty years of research on this subject, I published a book entitled: \textit{Poincaré, Einstein and the discovery of special relativity. An end to the controversy} \cite{Ginoux2024}. In September 2025, Galina Weinstein published a review of this book entitled: \textit{Convergences and Divergences: Einstein Poincaré and Special Relativity} ( arXiv:2509.09361 ) in which she harshly criticized my work in an unfair and error filled manner. The, she published a second comment (arXiv: 2510.03793 ) in which she added she added insults about me to all her mistakes, falsehoods and misleading criticisms. So I've decided to reply to her comments, in an academic way (as she would normally have done), in order to demonstrate that her allegedly “novel way” of reconstructing the history of the theory of special relativity is purely based on her own interpretation of the facts and not on the facts themselves. To this aim, I will follow the structure of each Weinstein's comment (arXiv: 2509.09361 &amp; 2510.03793 ) and I will highlight section by section all the erroneous things she has reported and repeated.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Examining Student and AI Generated Personalized Analogies in Introductory Physics</a><span class="id">[2511.04290]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Comparing abstract concepts (such as electric circuits) with familiar ideas (plumbing systems) through analogies is central to practice and communication of physics. Contemporary research highlights self-generated analogies to better facilitate students' learning than the taught ones. &quot;Spontaneous&quot; and &quot;self-generated&quot; analogies represent the two ways through which students construct personalized analogies. However, facilitating them, particularly in large enrollment courses remains a challenge, and recent developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) promise potential to address this issue. In this qualitative study, we analyze around 800 student responses in exploring the extent to which students spontaneously leverage analogies while explaining Morse potential curve in a language suitable for second graders and self-generate analogies in their preferred everyday contexts. We also compare the student-generated spontaneous analogies with AI-generated ones prompted by students. Lastly, we explore the themes associated with students' perceived ease and difficulty in generating analogies across both cases. Results highlight that unlike AI responses, student-generated spontaneous explanations seldom employ analogies. However, when explicitly asked to explain the behavior of the curve in terms of their everyday contexts, students employ diverse analogical contexts. A combination of disciplinary knowledge, agency to generate customized explanations, and personal attributes tend to influence students' perceived ease in generating explanations across the two cases. Implications of these results on the potential of AI to facilitate students' personalized analogical reasoning, and the role of analogies in making students notice gaps in their understanding are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04452" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A quaternionic approach to teaching 3D rotations and the resolution of gimbal lock</a><span class="id">[2511.04452]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quaternions provide a unified algebraic and geometric framework for representing three-dimensional rotations without the singularities that afflict Euler-angle parametrisations. This article develops a pedagogical and conceptual analysis of the \emph{Gimbal lock} phenomenon and demonstrates, step by step, how quaternion algebra resolves it. Beginning with the limitations of Euler representations, the work introduces the quaternionic rotation operator $v' = q\,v\,q^{*}$, derives the Rodrigues formula, and establishes the continuous, singularity-free mapping between unit quaternions and the rotation group $SO(3)$. The approach combines historical motivation, formal derivation, and illustrative examples designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students. As an extension, Appendix A presents the geometric and topological interpretations of quaternions, including their relation to the groups $\mathbb{Q}_8$ and $SU(2)$, and the Dirac belt trick, offering a visual analogy that reinforces the connection between algebra and spatial rotation. Overall, this work highlights the educational value of quaternions as a coherent and elegant framework for understanding rotational dynamics in physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experimental Skills for Non-PhD Roles in the Quantum Industry</a><span class="id">[2510.12936]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As the quantum information science and engineering (QISE) workforce grows, there is an anticipated need for professionals with bachelor's and master's degrees who can fill a wide range of roles in the quantum industry. This report identifies the experimental skills needed for individuals with bachelor's or master's degrees to succeed in quantum industry roles. Through semi-structured interviews with quantum industry employers, we gathered data on 22 distinct positions spanning hardware, software, and business functions. While employers describe varying expectations of quantum expertise, the unifying requirement across these roles is proficiency in experimental skills, which fall into four key categories: instrumentation, computation and data analysis, experimental and project design, as well as communication and collaboration. Positions open to bachelor's and master's graduates use all four skill areas, but the balance of experimental skill set needed differs. Bachelor's roles lean toward instrumentation, computation and data analysis, as well as experimental and project design skills. Individuals in these roles build, operate, and troubleshoot hardware, and they gather and interpret data to design and carry out experiments. Master's roles stand out with the communication and collaboration skills needed on top of the other three skill categories. Individuals in these roles oversee experiments, coordinate teams, and align efforts with company and client needs. By articulating experimental skills needed for bachelor's and master's roles in the quantum industry, this report provides actionable insights for educators developing QISE courses and programs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26689" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Spectroscopy Using Diffraction Grating, CMOS Monochrome Sensor, and Reflecting Telescopes</a><span class="id">[2510.26689]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the design and testing of a compact, low-cost stellar spectrometer developed for undergraduate and outreach applications. The instrument employs a 600 lines/mm diffraction grating, a CMOS monochrome sensor, and a 3D-printed mount integrated with reflecting telescopes. Calibration was performed using helium emission sources in the laboratory and Vega as a spectrophotometric standard, supported by a custom Python-based image-processing pipeline for wavelength calibration and spectral stacking. The spectrometer successfully recorded usable spectra of bright stars including Vega, Sirius, Procyon, Capella, and Betelgeuse, covering spectral types A through M. The results demonstrate that meaningful stellar spectroscopy can be achieved with accessible, low-cost equipment, providing a practical framework for student-led astronomical instrumentation projects.</p></div></details></article></body>
