The work presents a theoretical framework rooted in Chemical Organization Theory (COT) to characterize how stable, self-sustaining structures arise from the interactions of basic components. Key theoretical contributions include the formalization of atom sets as fundamental reactive units and the concept of synergy to describe the emergence of new reactions and species from the interaction of these units. The property of separability is defined to distinguish dynamically coupled systems from those that can be decomposed. This framework is then applied to the STARLIB nuclear reaction network database, analyzing how network structure, particularly the formation and properties of atom sets and semi-self-maintaining sets, changes as a function of temperature. Results indicate that increasing temperature generally enhances network cohesion, leading to fewer, larger atom sets. Critical temperatures are identified where significant structural reorganizations occur, such as the merging of distinct clusters of atom sets and the disappearance of small, isolated reactive units. The analysis reveals core clusters - large (containing more that 1000 reactions), semi-self-maintaining structures that appear to form the core of all potentially stable nucleosynthetic configurations at various temperatures. Overall, the paper provides insights into the structural underpinnings of stability and emergence in complex reaction networks, with specific implications for understanding stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06277" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Energy-Duration Relationship in Astrophysical Self-Organized Criticality Systems</a><span class="id">[2601.06277]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scaling laws in astrophysical systems that involve the energy, the geometry, and the spatio-temporal evolution, provide the theoretical framework for physical models of energy dissipation processes. A leading model is the standard fractal-diffusive self-organized criticality (FD-SOC) model, which is built on four fundamental assumptions: (i) the dimensionality $d=3$, (ii) the fractal dimension $D_V=d-1/2=2.5$, (iii) classical diffusion $L \propto T^{(1/2)}$, and (iv) the proportionality of the dissipated energy to the fractal volume $E \propto V$. Based on these assumptions, the FD-SOC model predicts a scaling law of $T \propto E^k \propto E^{(4/5)} = E^{0.8}$. On the observational side, we find empirical scaling laws of $T \propto E^{0.81\pm0.03}$ by Peng et al. (2023) and $T \propto E^{0.86\pm0.03}$ by Araujo &amp; Valio (2021) that are self-consistent with the theoretical prediction of the FD-SOC model. However, cases with a small time range $q_T = \log{(T_{max}/T_{min})} \lapprox 2$ have large statistical uncertainties and systematic errors, which produces smaller scaling law exponents ($k \approx 0.3, ..., 0.6$) as a consequence. The close correlation of the scaling exponent $k$ with the truncation bias $q_T$ implies that the dispersion of k-values is an observational effect, rather than a physical property.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VLBI Observations of SN 2012au Reveal a Compact Radio Source a Decade Post Explosion</a><span class="id">[2601.06278]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Three leading models have been put forth to justify the observed radio re-brightening associated with stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) years post-explosion: radiation from an emerging pulsar wind nebula (PWN), shock interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), or emission from off-axis, relativistic jets. SN 2012au is a particularly intriguing SESN in this regard as observations obtained $\gtrsim$ 6 years post-explosion have shown \emph{both} (i) optical emission features consistent with a young PWN and (ii) a radio re-brightening. We present the results of our Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometric (VLBI) observations of SN 2012au performed between 8 to 13 years post core-collapse. Our VLBI observations reveal a luminous, steadily fading radio source that remains compact ($\leq1.4\times10^{17}~\mathrm{cm}$) and stationary ($\leq0.36c$) over the course of our campaign. Overall, we find that our VLBI measurements can be readily explained by a $\sim$decade-old PWN, potentially explained by shock interaction with specific CSM geometries, and are unlikely to be explained by emission from an off-axis, relativistic jet. Assuming a PWN origin, our observations require that the initial spin-down luminosity of the central pulsar be between $10^{36}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}\leq\dot{E}_0\leq10^{42}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ and radio efficiency factor be $\eta_\mathrm{R}\geq3\times10^{-6}$. These results are consistent with independent inferences obtained using optical spectroscopy of SN 2012au, alongside inferences of known Galactic systems. If a PWN origin is confirmed, SN 2012au would represent the first extragalactic PWN emerging from a modern day SN, providing a novel opportunity to study the formation properties of a decade-old pulsar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Role of Interferometric Phase in Measuring Black Hole Photon Rings</a><span class="id">[2601.06313]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) captured the first images of a black hole using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). In the near future, extensions of the EHT such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) will allow access to finer-scale features, such as a black hole's ”photon ring.” In the Kerr spacetime, this image structure arises from strong gravitational lensing near the black hole that results in a series of increasingly demagnified images of each emitting region that exponentially converge to a limiting critical curve. Exotic black hole alternatives, such as wormholes, can introduce additional photon rings. Hence, precisely characterizing multi-ring images is a promising pathway for measuring black hole parameters, such as spin, as well as exploring non-Kerr spacetimes. Here, we examine the interferometric response of multi-ring systems using a series of 1) simple geometric toy models, 2) synthetic BHEX and EHT observations of geometric models, and 3) semi-analytic accretion models with ray-tracing in the Kerr spacetime. We find that interferometric amplitude is more sensitive to the shape of the photon ring, while interferometric phase is more sensitive to its displacement, which is most sensitive to black hole spin. We find that for models similar to Messier 87* (M87*), the relative displacement of the first strongly lensed image from the weakly lensed direct image is approximately $1\,\mu {\rm as}$ per unit dimensionless spin, yielding an expected phase signature on a 25 G$\lambda$ baseline of $\sim44^\circ$ per unit spin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the internal structure of a neutron star and the associated magnetic fields aided by the mass-radius relationship</a><span class="id">[2601.06380]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutron stars exhibit magnetic fields and densities far beyond those achievable in terrestrial laboratories, offering a natural probe of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. Using observationally anchored mass-radius relations and a density profile consistent with established equations of state, we construct a piecewise model that explicitly integrates the neutron-drip line, nuclear-saturation, the electron-dominated halo, and core-crust interfaces. The resulting structure reproduces the stiffness and curvature behavior across the nuclear-pasta regime reported in the literature, validating our treatment of the crust-core transition. From this model, we derive updated moments of inertia, crustal mass fractions, and the effective number of neutrons contributing to the star's magnetic moment. Comparing these quantities with spin-down inferred magnetic dipole moments indicates that the observed magnetic fields of particularly millisecond pulsars can be sustained entirely by the crustal neutron polarization, requiring alignment of only about $\lesssim5.5\%$ ($99\%$ C.L.) of the neutrons in the crust. This finding supports a crust-confined magnetic-field origin for non-magnetar neutron stars, consistent with magneto-thermal evolution studies, and provides a quantitative framework for connecting neutron-star observables to its underlying structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Signatures of Cosmic-Ray Particle Showers in Deep In-Ice Antennas</a><span class="id">[2601.06409]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To detect ultra-high-energy neutrinos, experiments such as ARA and RNO-G target the radio emission induced by these particles as they cascade in the ice, using deep in-ice antennas at the South Pole or in Greenland. In this context, it is essential to first characterize the in-ice radio signature from cosmic-ray-induced particle showers, which constitute a primary background for neutrino detection, and represent the fist in-situ detection of in-ice particle cascades with radio antennas. This characterization will help validate the detection principle and assist in calibration. To achieve this goal, we used FAERIE, the &quot;Framework for the simulation of Air shower Emission of Radio for in-Ice Experiments&quot;, that combines CoREAS and GEANT4 to simulate the radio emission of cosmic ray showers deep in the ice. Using this tool, we analyze in-ice radio signatures of cosmic-ray showers, including polarization, timing, and radiation energy, as well as their dependence on shower parameters. These insights will facilitate the first cosmic-ray detections and improve cosmic-ray/neutrino discrimination.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulations of Electron Beam Interactions in Brown Dwarf Atmospheres</a><span class="id">[2601.06420]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over two decades ago, the first detection of electron cyclotron maser instability (ECMI) radio emission from a brown dwarf confirmed the presence of aurorally precipitating electrons on these objects. This detection established that brown dwarfs can exhibit magnetic activity that is planetary and auroral, rather than stellar in nature. This discovery motivated ongoing observational searches for the corresponding optical, ultraviolet (UV), and infrared (IR) auroral emission expected based on solar system analogs. The continuing nondetection of such auroral emission indicates important differences exist between auroral processes on brown dwarfs and solar system planets. In this work, we implement a Monte Carlo simulation of monoenergetic electron beams interacting with brown dwarf atmospheres, as a step towards understanding the physics of brown dwarf auroral emission. We detail the algorithm and underlying assumptions, and validate against previously published Jovian results (Hiraki et al. 2008). Our results agree well with literature, with some discrepancy from our updated interaction cross sections. We demonstrate the applicability of our simulation across the range of surface gravities and effective temperatures of radio-emitting brown dwarfs. We present an analytic parameterization of interaction rates based on our finding that atmospheric column density governs the interaction profiles. We apply this parameterization to calculate the total volumetric interaction rates and energy deposition rate for representative electron beam energy spectra enabling future predictions for spectra of aurorally emitting brown dwarfs. Simulations of high energy electron interactions with substellar hydrogen-dominated atmospheres will guide observational searches for multi-wavelength auroral features beyond the solar system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-order expansions of multi-revolution elliptic Halo orbits in the elliptic restricted three-body problem</a><span class="id">[2601.06563]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Multi-revolution elliptic Halo (ME-Halo) orbits are a special class of symmetric and periodic solutions within the framework of the elliptic restricted three-body problem (ERTBP). During a single period, an M:N ME-Halo orbit completes $M$ revolutions around a libration point and the primaries revolve N times around each other. Owing to the repeated configurations, ME-Halo orbits hold great promise as nominal trajectories for space mission design. However, a major challenge associated with ME-Halo orbits lies in their mathematical description. To this end, we propose a novel method to derive high-order analytical expansions of ME-Halo orbits in the ERTBP by introducing two correction terms into the equations of motion in the y- and z-directions. Specifically, both the coordinate variables and correction terms are expanded as power series in terms of the primary eccentricity, the in-plane amplitude, and the out-of-plane amplitude. High-order approximations are constructed using a perturbation method, and their accuracy is validated through numerical analysis. Due to the inherent symmetry, ME-Halo orbits can be classified into four distinct families: southern/northern and periapsis/apoapsis groups. The analytical approximations developed in this study not only provide high-accuracy initial guesses for the numerical computation of ME-Halo orbits, but also offer new insights into the dynamical environment near collinear libration points in the ERTBP, thereby advancing practical applications in mission design.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A binary merger product as the direct progenitor of a Type II-P supernova</a><span class="id">[2601.06577]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type II-P supernovae (SNe II-P) are the most common class of core-collapse SNe in the local Universe and play critical roles in many aspects of astrophysics. Since decades ago theorists have predicted that SNe II-P may originate not only from single stars but also from interacting binaries. While  20 SNII-P progenitors have been directly detected on pre-explosion images, observational evidence still remains scarce for this speculated binary progenitor channel. In this work, we report the discovery of a red supergiant progenitor for the Type II-P SN 2018gj. While the progenitor resembles those of other SNe II-P in terms of effective temperature and luminosity, it is located in a very old environment and SN 2018gj has an abnormally short plateau in the light curve. With state-of-the-art binary evolution simulations, we find these characteristics can only be explained if the progenitor of SN 2018gj is the merger product of a close binary system, which developed a different interior structure and evolved over a longer timescale compared with single-star evolution. This work provides the first compelling evidence for the long-sought binary progenitor channel toward SNe II-P, and our methodology serves as an innovative and pragmatic tool to motivate further investigations into this previously hidden population of SNe II-P from binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of a negative cosmological constant on the reconstruction of dark energy in light of DESI BAO data</a><span class="id">[2601.06656]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>An anti-de Sitter vacuum, corresponding to a negative cosmological constant (NCC), might coexist with one evolving positive dark energy component at low redshift and is hinted by the latest DESI observations. In this paper, we use two methods, \textit{redshift-binned} and \textit{Gaussian Process-based} reconstructions to investigate the effect of a NCC on the equation of state (EOS) $w(z)$ of evolving dark energy (DE) component. We find that a NCC is slightly preferred in both the two reconstructions by up to $\simeq1\sigma$. Although the degeneracy between the EOS of evolving DE component and NCC weakens the constraint on the reconstructed $w(z)$, this degeneracy leads to the phantom divide $w=-1$ more consistent with the 1$\sigma$ posterior of $w(z)$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbulent Properties of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections Observed by Solar Orbiter in the Inner Heliosphere</a><span class="id">[2601.06904]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the turbulent properties of 12 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) observed by Solar Orbiter between 0.29 and 1.0 AU. We analyze fluctuation power, spectral indices, break scales, and correlations between magnetic and velocity fluctuations (v-b) to quantify differences between ICME substructures (sheath and magnetic ejecta (ME)) and the surrounding solar wind. The ICME sheath is consistently the most turbulent region at all distances. In the solar wind, Alfvénicity influences inertial-range scaling, resulting in either single power laws near f^-3/2 or f^-5/3, or a coexistence of both, whereas ICME substructures consistently exhibit Kolmogorov-like f^-5/3 spectra. Alfvénicity is reduced within ICMEs, particularly in the ejecta, indicating more balanced Alfvénic fluctuations than in the solar wind. Spectral breaks shift to higher frequencies in ICME regions, with average break frequencies of 0.53 +/- 0.35 Hz (solar wind), 1.87 +/- 1.46 Hz (sheath), and 1.46 +/- 1.28 Hz (ME), reflecting differences in underlying microphysical scales. Our findings highlight distinct turbulence regimes in ICMEs compared to the solar wind and support the use of fluctuation power, spectral breaks, and v-b correlations as effective diagnostics for identifying ICME boundaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rings around irregular bodies. II. Numerical simulations of the 1/3 spin-orbit resonance confinement and applications to Chariklo</a><span class="id">[2601.06975]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rings have been found around Chariklo, Haumea and Quaoar, three small objects of the Solar System. All these rings are observed near the second-order spin-orbit resonances (SORs) 1/3 or 5/7 with the central body, suggesting an active confinement mechanism by these resonances. Our goal is to understand how collisional rings can be confined near second-order SORs in spite of the fact that they force self-intersecting this http URL use full 3D numerical simulations that treat rings of inelastically colliding particles orbiting non-axisymmetric central bodies, characterized by a dimensionless mass anomaly parameter mu. While most of our simulations ignore self-gravity, a few runs include gravitational interactions between particles, providing preliminary results on the effect of self-gravity on the ring confinement. The 1/3 SOR can confine ring material, by transferring the forced resonant mode into free Lindblad modes. We derive a criterion ensuring that the 1/3 SOR counteracts viscous spreading. Assuming meter-sized ring particles, and tau 1, this requires a threshold value mu &gt; 1e-3 in Chariklo's case. The confinement is not permanent as a slow outward leakage of particles is observed in our simulations. This leakage can be halted by an outside moonlet with a mass of  1e-7 - 1e-6 relative to Chariklo, corresponding to subkilometer-sized objects. With self-gravity, the ring viscosity nu increases by a factor of few in low-tau rings due to gravitational encounters. For large tau, self-gravity wakes enhance nu by a factor of  100 compared to a non-gravitating ring, requiring  10-fold larger mu since the threshold value increases proportional to square-root of nu.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic winds in resistive compact binary discs</a><span class="id">[2601.06994]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dwarf Novae and low-mass X-ray binaries are eruptive binary systems comprised of a Roche-lobe overflowing solar-type star and an accreting compact object. Their recurrence time can be explained by a low-accreting phase, the quiescence, during which the angular momentum transport parameter is inferred to be $\alpha \approx 0.01$ by the Disc Instability Model. Non-magnetics mechanisms, such as spiral wave transport, only achieve angular momentum transport an order of magnitude too low, at best, because these discs are so thin in quiescence. During this phase, the Magneto-rotational Instability is known to be suppressed by the increased resistivity of the weakly ionised plasma. Studying these thin magnetised discs is a numerical challenge because of the wide range of scales to be resolved. Thanks to the new GPU-accelerated code Idefix, we produce global 3D MHD simulations of a very thin disc $(H/R = 0.01)$ for the first time. We explore the possibility that an MHD wind arises and increases accretion in low magnetic Reynolds number $(\mathrm{Rm}\approx100)$ and realistic plasma parameter ($\beta \approx 1000$) regimes. We observe that the MRI is only quenched in the resistive disc bulk but survives in the disc atmosphere. This drives strong accretion and wind launching. We quantify the efficiency of the resulting wind and measure its global effect on the disc. We explore the effect of the initial disc magnetisation and compare the accretion/ejection regime with and without resistivity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Structure of Poloidal Fields Embedded in Thin Disks</a><span class="id">[2601.07031]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many accreting systems are modeled as geometrically thin disks. Simulations of accretion disks cannot be extended to this regime, although local models can address the behavior of narrow annuli. A global model needs to account for the interactions between a large-scale poloidal field, accreted from the environment, and the disk. The disk magnetosphere can be modeled subject to the boundary conditions imposed by the disk. These depend on the structure of the magnetic field as it crosses the disk and the degree to which the disk can support a bend in the field lines. Building on earlier work we derive a set of equations describing a stationary disk with an embedded poloidal field. We derive a modified induction equation that incorporates tensorial turbulent diffusivities and a helicity-regulated $\alpha$-effect. We quantify how helicity conservation introduces a nonlinear backreaction on the large-scale dynamo, dynamically coupling turbulent diffusion and $\alpha$-quenching. We discuss the challenges encountered in finding a unique solution under stationary flows $E_\phi =0$, which balances the inflow of $B_z$ due to accretion, the outflow due to radial diffusion of $B_z$, and the vertical movement of $B_r$ due to turbulent diffusion and buoyancy. The vertical profiles of both the azimuthal diffusion coefficient $D_{ijk}$ and the helicity-driven $\alpha_{ij}$ demonstrate that changes in the radial gradient can restructure the magnetic field geometry. The ability of disks to sustain large bending angles in the poloidal field implies that angular momentum flux through the magnetosphere can dominate over internal transport even for weak fields. Competing factors can result in non-unique solutions, necessitating extra constraints and diagnostics that highlight the role of isotropic turbulence and helicity regulation in magnetized disk environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A New Consistency Test for the $Λ$CDM Model using Radial and Transverse BAO Measurements</a><span class="id">[2601.07075]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a calibration-free consistency test of spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM based on baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measurements. The method forms ratios of BAO distances – the Hubble distance $Ð(z)$, the comoving angular diameter distance $\DM(z)$, and the volume-averaged distance $\DV(z)$ – so that the sound horizon scale cancels, and then maps each observed ratio to an effective flat-$\Lambda$CDM matter density parameter, $\OmL$, defined as the value of $\Omega_{\rm M}$ that reproduces the measured ratio within $\Lambda$CDM. Flat $\Lambda$CDM predicts that $\OmL$ should be independent of redshift and of the particular ratio used. For ratios involving the integrated distances $\DM$ and $\DV$, we associate them with well-defined effective line-of-sight redshift intervals using a redshift-matching strategy based on the integral mean value theorem. We apply the test to BAO measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 and Data Release 2, propagating the full published BAO covariance matrices into all derived ratios and $\OmL$ constraints. Within current uncertainties, the inferred $\OmL$ values are broadly consistent with a redshift-independent constant, providing an internal consistency check of flat $\Lambda$CDM that can be strengthened straightforwardly as BAO measurements improve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magma Ocean Waves and Thermal Variability on Lava Worlds</a><span class="id">[2601.07080]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Lava worlds are rocky planets with dayside skins made molten by stellar irradiation. Tidal heating on these shortest-period planets is more than skin deep. We show how orbital eccentricities of just a few percent (within current observed bounds and maintained secularly by exterior companions) can create deep magma oceans. “Lava tidal waves” slosh across these oceans; we compute the multi-modal response of the ocean to tidal forcing, subject to a coastline at the day-night terminator and a parameterized viscous drag. Wave interference produces a dayside heat map that is spatially irregular and highly time-variable; hotspots can wander both east and west of the substellar point, and thermal light curves can vary and spike aperiodically, from orbit to orbit and within an orbit. Heat deposited by tides is removed in steady state by a combination of fluid, mushy, and solid-state convection in the mantle. For Earth-sized planets with sub-day periods, the entire mantle may be tidally liquified.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More power on large scales</a><span class="id">[2601.07106]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The high value of the cosmic microwave dipole may be telling us that dark matter is macroscopic rather than a fundamental particle. The possible presence of a significant dark matter component in the form of primordial black holes suggests that dark halo formation simulations should be commenced well before redshift z = 100. Unlike standard CDM candidates, PBHs behave as dense, non-relativistic matter from their inception in the radiation-dominated era. This allows them to seed gravitational potential wells and begin clustering earlier. We find that starting N-body simulations at redshifts even before matter-radiation equality yield galaxy bulk flow velocities that are systematically larger than those predicted by standard LCDM models. The early, high-mass concentrations established by PBHs lead to a more rapid and efficient gravitational acceleration of surrounding baryonic and dark matter, generating larger peculiar velocities that remain coherent over scales of hundreds of Mpc. Furthermore, a sub- population of PBHs in the 10^-20 to 10^-17 solar mass range would lose a non-negligible fraction of their mass via Hawking radiation over cosmological timescales. This evaporation process converts matter into radiation, so a time-varying matter density parameter, Omega_m', is introduced, which behaves like a boosted radiation term in the Friedmann equation. This dynamic term acts to reduce the Hubble tension. A higher effective Omega_r in the early universe reduces the sound horizon at the epoch of recombination. PBH mass loss also influences fits to the equation of state parameter, w, at low redshift. The naive N-body modelling presented here suggests investigation with tried and tested cosmology codes should be carried out, by introducing mass losing PBHs and starting the evolution as early as practicable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07151" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slow White Dwarf Mergers as a New Galactic Source of Trans-Iron Elements</a><span class="id">[2601.07151]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The astrophysical origins of the heaviest stable elements that we observe today in the Solar System are still not fully understood.

As our models approach the Chandrasekhar mass during the merger phase, the 22Ne(a,n)25Mg neutron source reaction is activated in the external layers of the primary WD, where the carbon-rich material accreted from the secondary WD is burned via the 12C+12C reaction, which provides the necessary {\alpha}-particles via the 12C(12C,{\alpha})20Ne channel. The resulting neutron capture abundance distribution closely resembles a weak s-process one and peaks at Zr, which is overpro- duced by a factor of 30 compared to solar. The mass of the most external layers enriched in first-peak s-process elements crucially depends on the 12C+12C re- action rate, ranging between 0.05 Msun and  0.1 Msun. These results indicate that slow white dwarf mergers can efficiently produce the lightest p-process iso- topes (such as 74Se, 78Kr, 84Sr, 92Mo and 94Mo) via {\gamma}-induced reactions if they explode via a delayed detonation mechanism, or eject the unburned external layers highly enriched in first peak s-process elements in the case of a pure deflagration. In both cases, we propose for the first time that slow WD mergers in binary systems may be a new relevant source for elements heavier than iron.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limit cycles and the climate history of Mars</a><span class="id">[2601.07159]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Evidence for fluvial features and standing liquid water indicate that Mars was a warmer and wetter place in its past; however, climate models have historically been unable to produce conditions to yield a warm early Mars under the faint young sun. Some models invoke thick greenhouse atmospheres to produce continuously warm conditions, but others have argued that available geologic evidence is more consistent with short-duration and transient warming events on an otherwise cold Mars. One possibility of harmonizing these perspectives is that early Mars experienced climate limit cycles that caused the climate to oscillate between short periods of warmth and prolonged periods of glaciation, due to modulation of greenhouse warming by the carbonate-silicate cycle. This study suggests that episodic limit cycling during the Noachian and Hesperian periods provides a hypothetical explanation for the timing and formation of fluvial features on Mars. A schematic time-forward trajectory of the full history of Mars is calculated using an energy balance climate model, which includes an active carbonate-silicate cycle, instellation changes due to the sun's main sequence evolution, variations in the obliquity of Mars, and supplemental warming from additional greenhouse gases beyond carbon dioxide alone. These calculations demonstrate the viability of a climate history for Mars involving episodic limit cycling to enable the formation of the valley networks at 4.1-3.5 Ga and delta features at 3.3-3.0 Ga, interspersed with cold stable climates and ending in the late Amazonian in a carbon dioxide condensation regime. This schematic climate trajectory provide a plausible narrative that remains consistent with available geologic data, and further exploration of warming mechanisms for the climate of Mars should consider the possibility of episodic transient events driven by carbonate-silicate limit cycling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Does the radio-active phase of XTE J1810$-$197 recur following the same evolutionary pattern?</a><span class="id">[2601.07173]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetars are the most strongly magnetized compact objects known in the Universe and are regarded as one of the primary engines powering a variety of enigmatic, high-energy transients. However, our understanding of magnetars remains highly limited, constrained by observational sample size and radiative variability. XTE J1810$-$197, which re-entered a radio-active phase in 2018, is one of only six known radio-pulsating magnetars. Leveraging the distinctive capability for simultaneous dual-frequency observations, we utilized the Shanghai Tianma Radio Telescope (TMRT) to monitor this magnetar continuously at both 2.25 and 8.60 GHz, capturing its entire evolution from radio activation to quenching. This enabled precise characterization of the evolution in its integrated profile, spin frequency, flux density, and spectral index ($\alpha$, defined by $S \propto f^{\alpha}$). The first time derivative of its spin frequency $\dot{\nu}$ passed through four distinct phases – rapid decrease, violent oscillation, steady decline, and stable recovery – before returning to its pre-outburst value concomitant with the cessation of radio emission. Remarkably, both the amplitudes and the characteristic time-scales of these $\dot{\nu}$ variations match those observed during the previous outburst that began in 2003, providing the first demonstration that post-outburst rotational evolution and radiative behavior in a magnetar are repeatable. A twisted-magnetosphere model can qualitatively account for this repeatability as well as for the progressive narrowing and abrupt disappearance of the radio pulse radiation, thereby receiving strong observational support.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07244" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The magnetic helicity driven solar-type dynamo</a><span class="id">[2601.07244]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>(1)The previous theoretical studies showed that in the presence of the small-scale dynamo the large-scale vorticity can produce the the divergent-type helicity flux breaking the equatorial reflection symmetry of the magnetic fluctuations in the stellar convection zone.

Similarly to the $\alpha$ effect, the NV flux is able to maintain the large-scale turbulent dynamo. 2) Methods:Using the mean-field dynamo model we study the effect of the NV flux on the solar type dynamos. We found that the NV flux results to a increase of the dynamo efficiency for the turbulent generation of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field of the Sun. The dynamic effect of the NV flux on the magnetic field evolution results into concentrating the dynamo waves toward the equator. Using the numerical simulations of the mean-field dynamo model we compare the helicity production rates by the turbulent dynamo effects, like the $\alpha$ effect and the NV flux.

We examine the implications of these anisotropy measurements and assess to what extent they can be used to constrain the origin of UHECRs and the astrophysical or physical parameters of viable source scenarios. Methods. As in the first two papers of this series, we generate realistic UHECR sky maps for a wide range of astrophysical models consistent with current spectral and composition constraints, assuming that UHECR sources trace the distribution of galaxies in the Universe. We update our previous studies by incorporating the most recent models of the Galactic magnetic field and apply the same large- and intermediate-scale anisotropy analyses as those used by the Auger Collaboration to simulated datasets with current experimental exposure. Results. The main novelty of this third paper is the improved compatibility between simulations and data, in particular regarding the reconstructed dipole direction, when using several of the recently proposed Galactic magnetic field models. Despite this progress, our main conclusions remain unchanged: although the observed anisotropies are compatible with an extragalactic origin of UHECRs, present data and magnetic-field uncertainties do not allow strong constraints to be placed on the nature, spatial distribution, or density of UHECR sources. Conclusions. Further progress in the interpretation of UHECR anisotropies will require improved constraints on cosmic magnetic fields, advances in source modeling, and significantly larger experimental exposures</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direct detection of the non-thermal X-ray emission from the Arches star cluster</a><span class="id">[2601.07357]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The compact stellar clusters have emerged as particularly promising candidates for cosmic rays (CR) accelerators. The star clusters, recently observed in gamma-rays, are also known sources of non-thermal X-ray emission, which is due to synchrotron or inverse-Compton scattering of relativistic electrons. Thus, the search for the non-thermal X-ray emission from stellar clusters is of particular interest. Until recent time the X-ray emission of the Arches star cluster in the Galactic Center was mixed with non-thermal emission of the surrounding molecular cloud, associated with reflection of hard X-ray irradiation. This reflected emission has been observed to fade, giving us a chance to characterize intrinsic non-thermal emission of the Arches cluster. In this work we demonstrate that Fe K_alpha line emission at 6.4 keV, attributed to the reflected non-thermal emission of the molecular cloud in 2000-2010, is not detected in deep observations with XMM-Newton in 2020 and Chandra in 2022, leaving stellar cluster well isolated. We showed that the Arches non-thermal emission is localized in the cluster's core and characterized by a relatively weak, hard (Gamma 1.5) power-law spectral continuum with 2-10 keV flux of  10E-13 ergs/s/cm^2.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong Evidence for Dark Sector Interactions</a><span class="id">[2601.07361]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data reveal deviations from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, conventionally attributed to dynamical dark energy (DE). We demonstrate that these deviations are equally, if not better, explained by interactions between dark matter and dark energy (IDE), without requiring a time-varying DE equation of state. Using a unified framework, we analyze two IDE models–coupled quintessence and coupled fluid–against the latest CMB (Planck, ACT, SPT), DESI BAO, and SN (including DES-Dovekie recalibrated) data. Both IDE scenarios show robust evidence for non-vanishing interactions at the 3-5$\sigma$ level, with marginalized constraints significantly deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM limit. This preference persists even under DES-Dovekie SN recalibration, which weakens dynamical DE evidence. Crucially, for the same number of free parameters, IDE models provide fits to low- and high-redshift data that match or exceed the performance of the CPL dynamical DE parametrization. Our results establish IDE as a physically motivated alternative to dynamical DE, highlighting the necessity of future cosmological perturbation measurements (e.g., weak lensing, galaxy clustering) to distinguish between these paradigms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07387" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporal variability of polarization in blazars</a><span class="id">[2601.07387]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the temporal variability of polarization of synchrotron radiation from blazar jets. Multiwavelength observations revealed high-amplitude rotations of the electric vector position angle (EVPA), both in the optical and in the X-rays. More often, the polarization degree and the EVPA show a seemingly erratic variability. To interpret these observations, we present a geometric and deterministic model in which off-axis, compact emitting features (i.e., blobs) propagate along the jet with the local velocity of the flow. The dynamics of the blobs is determined by the jet electromagnetic fields, which are calculated self-consistently using an analytical model of magnetically dominated outflows. The jet is axisymmetric, and its electromagnetic fields do not have a turbulent component. We show that the observed polarization is sensitive to the initial spatial configurations of the blobs. For the same jet structure, we observe several remarkably complex polarization patterns, including large EVPA rotations of $180^{\circ}$ or more in both directions and more erratic fluctuations. Simultaneous high-amplitude variations of the polarization degree and the EVPA can coincide with peaks of the observed luminosity. However, seemingly uncorrelated variations are also possible. We discuss the feasibility of constraining the particle acceleration mechanism from multifrequency polarimetric observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asymmetric distribution of Fe-peak elements in Cassiopeia A revealed by XRISM</a><span class="id">[2601.07394]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The elemental abundances of the Fe-peak elements (such as Cr, Mn, Fe and Ni) and Ti are important for understanding the environment of explosive nuclear burning for the core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe). In particular, the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, which is well known for its asymmetric structure, contains three “Fe-rich blobs,” and the composition of the Fe-peak elements within these structures could be related to the asymmetry of the supernova explosion. We report a highly asymmetric distribution of the Fe-peak elements in Cassiopeia A as revealed by XRISM observations. We found that the southeastern Fe-rich region has a significant Mn emission above the 4$\sigma$ confidence level, while the northwestern Fe-rich region has no clear signature. In addition to the significant difference in Mn abundance across these regions, our observations show that the Ti/Fe, Mn/Cr, and Ni/Fe ratios vary from region to region. The observed asymmetric distribution of Fe-peak elements could be produced by (1) the mixing of materials from different burning layers of the supernova, (2) the asymmetric distribution of the electron fraction in the progenitor star and/or (3) the local dependence of the neutrino irradiation in the supernova innermost region. Future spatially resolved spectroscopy of Cassiopeia A using X-ray microcalorimeters will enable more detailed measurements of the distribution and composition of these elements, providing a unique tool for testing asymmetric supernova physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07414" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterization of two new transiting sub-Neptunes and a terrestrial planet around M-dwarf hosts</a><span class="id">[2601.07414]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the confirmation of three transiting exoplanets orbiting TOI-1243 (LSPM J0902+7138), TOI-4529 (G 2–21), and TOI-5388 (Wolf 346) that were initially detected by TESS through ground-based photometry and radial velocity follow-up measurements with CARMENES.

The near maximum spectrum of SN 2019gaf shows shallow H$\alpha$ absorption and He lines with almost similar strength. Both the SNe show transition from hydrogen-dominated spectra to helium-dominated spectra within a month after maximum brightness. The velocity evolution of SN 2008aq matches well with those of other well-studied Type IIb SNe, while SN 2019gaf shows higher velocities. Close to maximum light, the H $\alpha$ and He I line velocities of SN 2019gaf are $\sim$ 2000 km sec$^{-1}$ and $\sim$ 4000 km sec$^{-1}$ higher than other well-studied Type IIb SNe. Semi-analytical modeling indicates SN 2019gaf to be a more energetic explosion with a smaller ejecta mass than SN 2008aq. The zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass of the progenitor estimated using the nebular spectra of SN 2008aq ranges between 13 to 20 M$_\odot$, while for SN 2019gaf, the inferred ZAMS mass is between 13 to 25 M$_\odot$.

We modelled the LS 5039 system assuming a wind-driven scenario. Our numerical model uses a joint simulation of the dynamical wind interaction together with the transport of energetic leptons from the shocked pulsar wind. We computed the non-thermal emission from this system in a post-processing step from the resulting distribution of energetic leptons. In this computation, we took into account the synchrotron and inverse Compton emission, relativistic beaming, and {\gamma}{\gamma}-absorption in the stellar radiation field. We investigated the dynamical variation of the energetic particle spectra on both orbital and on short timescales. Our model successfully reproduces many of the spectral features of LS 5039. We also find a better correspondence between our predicted orbital light curves and the corresponding observations in soft x-rays, low-energy, and high-energy gamma rays than in our previous modelling efforts. We find that our high-resolution and large-scale simulations can successfully capture the relevant parts of the wind-collision region that are related to particle acceleration and emission of non-thermal radiation. The quality of the fit strengthens the wind-driven assumption underlying our model.

Models of homogeneous strange stars for the equation of state in the &quot;quark bag model&quot; have a simple analytical solution. The solutions presented in the paper for various equations of state differ from the exact solutions obtained by the numerical integration of differential equations by at most $ \sim 20 \%$. The formation of strange stars is examined as a function of the deconfinement boundary (DB), at which quarks become deconfined. Existing experimental data indicate that matter reaches very high densities in the vicinity of the DB.

From these calculations, we estimate the global contribution of ejecta to the entire Galactic spectrum to be $\sim1\%$, with the cosmic ray contribution rising to $\sim5\%$ at PeV energies, assuming roughly equal energy in non-thermal protons, non-thermal electrons and magnetic fields. In addition, we calculate associated $\gamma$-ray and neutrino spectra of the MAXI J1820+070 ejecta to investigate new detection methods with CTAO, which provide strong constraints on initial ejecta size of order $10^7$ Schwarzschild radii ($10^{-5}$ pc) assuming a period of adiabatic expansion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07592" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timing Gamma-ray Pulsars using Gibbs Sampling</a><span class="id">[2601.07592]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Timing analyses of gamma-ray pulsars in the Fermi Large Area Telescope data set can provide sensitive probes of many astrophysical processes, including timing noise in young pulsars, orbital period variations in redback binaries, and the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). These goals can require careful accounting of stochastic noise processes, but existing methods developed to achieve this in radio pulsar timing analyses cannot be immediately applied to the discrete gamma-ray arrival time data. To address this, we have developed a new method for timing gamma-ray pulsars, in which the timing model fit is transformed into a weighted least squares problem by randomly assigning each photon to an individual Gaussian component of a template pulse profile. These random assignments are then numerically marginalised over through a Gibbs sampling scheme. This method allows for efficient estimation of timing and noise model parameters, while taking into account uncertainties in the pulse profile shape. We simulated Fermi-LAT data sets for gamma-ray pulsars with power-law timing noise processes, showing that this method provides robust estimates of timing noise parameters. We also describe a Gaussian-process model for orbital period variations in black-widow and redback binary systems that can be fit using this new timing method. We demonstrate this method on the black-widow binary millisecond pulsar B1957+20, where the orbital period varies significantly over the LAT data, but which provides one of the most stringent gamma-ray upper limits on the GWB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Search for Joint Sources of Gravitational Waves and High-Energy Neutrinos with IceCube During the Third Observing Run of LIGO and Virgo</a><span class="id">[2601.07595]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories. The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, from the dynamics of compact object mergers and stellar collapses to the mechanisms driving relativistic outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the common observation even when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, i.e. not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Using data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, including sub-threshold events, we searched for common sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We derive constraints on the rate densities of joint sources.

The $\eta_T$ distribution has a mean of $1.01 \pm 0.03$, with average changes of $8.1\%$ and $2.7\%$ when relativistic corrections and molecular hydrogen absorption are not included, respectively. The $\eta_T$ distribution is positively skewed, with the scatter mostly affected by cluster morphology: relaxed clusters are closer to unity and less scattered than mixed and disturbed systems.

Departing from the commonly studied non-minimal couplings to gravity, our framework considers a real spectator scalar field coupled quadratically to spacetime curvature invariants. We show that the rapid reorganization of spacetime curvature at the end of inflation can dynamically render the dark matter field tachyonic, triggering a short-lived phase of spontaneous symmetry breaking and explosive particle production. As a concrete and theoretically controlled example, we focus on the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant. By combining analytical estimates with fully non-linear $3+1$ classical lattice simulations, we track the out-of-equilibrium evolution of the system and compute the resulting dark matter abundance. We find that this purely gravitational mechanism can robustly reproduce the observed dark matter relic density over a wide range of masses and inflationary scales, providing also a simple fitting function that enables a lattice-independent application of our results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brightest GRB flare observed in GRB 221009A: bridge the last gap between flare and prompt emission in GRB</a><span class="id">[2601.07688]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Flares are usually observed during the afterglow phase of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in soft X-ray, optical and radio bands, but rarely in gamma-ray band. Despite the extraordinary brightness, GECAM-C has accurately measured both the bright prompt emission and flare emission of GRB 221009A without instrumental effects, offering a good opportunity to study the relation between them. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of flare emission of GRB 221009A, which is composed of a series of flares. Among them, we identify an exceptionally bright flare with a record-breaking isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso} = 1.82 \times 10^{53}$ erg of GRB flares. It exhibits the highest peak energy ever detected in GRB flares, $E_{\rm peak} \sim 300$ keV, making it a genuine gamma-ray flare. It also shows rapid rise and decay timescales, significantly shorter than those of typical X-ray flares observed in soft X-ray or optical band, but comparable to those observed in prompt emissions. Despite these exceptional properties, the flare shares several common properties with typical GRB flares. We note that this is the first observation of a GRB flare in the keV-MeV band with sufficiently high temporal resolution and high statistics, which bridges the last gap between prompt emission and flare.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07716" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Induced gravitational waves - beyond linear cosmological perturbation theory</a><span class="id">[2601.07716]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This thesis focuses on gravitational waves (GWs) that arise beyond linear order in cosmological perturbation theory. In recent years, scalar-induced GWs have attracted significant attention because they may serve as the observational signature of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe. The formation of PBHs requires large density perturbations, which can naturally emerge in some models of inflation. When these large density fluctuations couple, they act as a source for scalar-induced GWs at second order. In this work, we extend the existing formalism by including linear tensor fluctuations as an additional source term. This gives rise to two new classes of second-order GWs: those sourced by scalar-tensor couplings (scalar-tensor induced GWs) and those quadratic in tensor modes (tensor-tensor induced GWs). We find that the scalar-tensor contribution becomes significant if first-order tensor modes are enhanced, whilst the tensor-tensor contribution remains subdominant. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spectrum of scalar-tensor induced GWs exhibits an unphysical enhancement in the UV limit when the primordial scalar power spectrum is insufficiently peaked. To investigate whether this can be resolved, we study third-order induced GWs and their correlation with primordial GWs. We find that this new contribution suppresses the overall signal but does not cancel the unphysical enhancement. Possible explanations for this behaviour are discussed and left for future work. Finally, we explore the effect of primordial scalar non-Gaussianity on the spectrum of scalar-tensor induced GWs, building on previous results showing its impact on scalar-induced GWs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07745" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A COLIBRI Photometric Study of SN 2025bvm: A Normal, Slowly Declining Type Ia Supernova</a><span class="id">[2601.07745]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present 121 days of multi-band (\Bband, \gband, \rband, \iband) optical photometry of the Type Ia supernova SN 2025bvm, obtained with the COLIBRI telescope at OAN-SPM. The light curves show a photometric decline of $\Delta m_{15}(B) = 0.867 \pm 0.051$ mag, characteristic of a slow-declining Type Ia supernova. After correcting for host galaxy extinction ($E(B-V)_{host} = 0.308 \pm 0.030$ mag) and adopting a distance of 70 Mpc, we derive a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -19.13 \pm 0.40$ mag. This luminosity is fully consistent with its slow decline rate, placing SN 2025bvm within the population of normal Type Ia supernovae. We conclude that SN 2025bvm is a normal Type Ia supernova, whose photometric properties, such as a slow late-time decline and a prominent \iband-band secondary maximum, suggest an explosion that resulted in a particularly massive ejecta.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation.

Our IA implementation in the Flagship simulation takes into account photometric properties of galaxies as well as their dark matter host halos. We compare simulations against theory predictions, determining the parameters of two of the most widely used IA models: the Non Linear Alignment (NLA) and the Tidal Alignment and Tidal Torquing (TATT) models. We measure the amplitude of the simulated IA signal as a function of galaxy magnitude and colour in the redshift range $0.1&lt;z&lt;2.1$. We find that both NLA and TATT can accurately describe the IA signal in the simulation down to scales of $6$-$7 \,h^{-1}\,$Mpc. We measure alignment amplitudes for red galaxies comparable to those of the observations, with samples not used in the calibration procedure. For blue galaxies, our constraints are consistent with zero alignments in our first redshift bin $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.3$, but we detect a non-negligible signal at higher redshift, which is, however, consistent with the upper limits set by observational constraints. Additionally, several hydrodynamical simulations predict alignment for spiral galaxies, in agreement with our findings. Finally, the evolution of alignment with redshift is realistic and comparable to that determined in the observations. However, we find that the commonly adopted redshift power-law for IA fails to reproduce the simulation alignments above $z=1.1$. A significantly better agreement is obtained when a luminosity dependence is included, capturing the intrinsic luminosity evolution with redshift in magnitude-limited surveys. We conclude that the Flagship IA simulation is a useful tool for translating current IA constraints into predictions for IA contamination of Euclid-like samples.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation.

We construct a semi-analytic model of galaxy ellipticities and alignments in the \Euclid Flagship simulation to predict this contamination in Euclid's weak lensing observations. Galaxy shapes and orientations are determined by the corresponding properties of the host haloes in the underlying $N$-body simulation, as well as the relative positions of galaxies within their halo. Alignment strengths are moderated via stochastic misalignments, separately for central and satellite galaxies and conditional on the galaxy's redshift, luminosity, and rest-frame colour. The resulting model is calibrated against galaxy ellipticity statistics from the COSMOS Survey, selected alignment measurements based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey samples, and galaxy orientations extracted from the Horizon-AGN hydrodynamic simulation at redshift $z=1$. The best-fit model has a total of 12 alignment parameters and generally reproduces the calibration data sets well within the $1\sigma$ statistical uncertainties of the observations and the \flagship simulation, with notable exceptions for the most luminous sub-samples on small physical scales. The statistical power of the calibration data and the volume of the single \flagship realisation are still too small to provide informative prior ranges for intrinsic alignment amplitudes in relevant galaxy samples. As a first application, we predict that \Euclid end-of-mission tomographic weak gravitational lensing two-point statistics are modified by up to order $10\,\%$ due to intrinsic alignments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07836" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axion misalignment as a synchronization phenomenon</a><span class="id">[2601.07836]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a dynamical reinterpretation of axion misalignment as an emergent collective phenomenon.

In this framework, the misalignment angle is not a fundamental initial condition but a collective variable that becomes well defined only once phase coherence develops. Using a simple lattice model, we illustrate how the collective phase is selected prior to the onset of axion oscillations, providing a dynamical basis for the standard misalignment picture. This perspective offers a new way of organizing axion initial-condition sensitivity, reframes anthropic small-angle arguments in terms of phase-ordering efficiency, and suggests a broader connection between fine-tuning and emergent collective dynamics in the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temperature-Dependent CPT Violation: Constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</a><span class="id">[2601.06259]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we explore temperature-dependent CPT violation during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) through electron-positron mass asymmetries parametrized by $b_0(T) = \alpha T^2$.

In this paper, we focus on the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter case and present a unified analytic treatment of the horizon structure and its physical properties, allowing for a transparent comparison between general relativity and $ f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature. We solve the quartic equation determining the horizon locations and derive closed analytic expressions for the horizon radii. Focusing on extremal configurations, we obtain analytic formulas for the squared rotation parameter $ a^2 $ and the inverse square of the curvature radius $ l^{-2} $ as functions of the horizon location and the electric charge. For generic values of these parameters, the extremality conditions are non-universal, reducing to the familiar Kerr-Newman bound only in the limit of vanishing background curvature. We identify an ultra-extremal configuration in which $ a^2 $ attains its maximal value at zero charge and decreases monotonically to zero as the charge approaches its limiting value, while $ l^{-2 }$ increases correspondingly. As an illustrative example, we show that black holes with charge $ q=M/2 $ necessarily possess a minimum rotation, which emerges naturally as an intersection point in our analytic description of $ a^2 $ and $ l^{-2 }$, when embedded in a universe characterized by a critical value of $ l^{-2} $ (equivalently, the scalar curvature or the cosmological constant). Finally, we demonstrate that when the mass satisfies $ M^2= (a^2+q^2)(1-a^2/l^2)$, the quartic horizon equation factorizes, leading in the extremal regime to a chiral-like horizon structure that allows only the outer-cosmological horizon merger.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limits of vacuum-template subtraction for LISA massive black hole binary sources in realistic environments</a><span class="id">[2601.06684]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of gravitational wave (GW) dephasing due to gas accretion on the subtraction of massive black hole (MBH) binary signals over 4 yr of LISA data in the context of the global-fit.

Investigation of the viability conditions for these models, in particular, the condition $\frac{dF}{dR}&gt;0$ required a deep analysis. Both models appeared to be viable during the early-time era, but for the late-time evolution the viability conditions are not fulfilled in definite domains in the parameter spaces of these models.

In the inference, the outer crust is fixed using the AME2020 nuclear mass table, supplemented by Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov mass models, while the inner crust is described using a compressible liquid-drop model consistently coupled to the RMF interaction. The same RMF framework is used to describe the uniform core, ensuring a unified treatment across all density regimes. From the resulting posteriors, we extract key crustal observables, including the crust–core transition density and pressure, crust thickness, crust mass, and the fractional crustal moment of inertia. We find that the transition density is primarily governed by the symmetry-energy slope $L$ and curvature $K_{\rm sym}$ evaluated at sub-saturation densities, while the transition pressure plays a central role in determining global crustal properties. The inner-crust equation of state reflects a collective interplay between isovector nuclear-matter properties rather than a dependence on any single parameter.

In our analysis, we apply a machine learning algorithm known as symbolic regression, paired with principal component analysis, to datasets generated from Bayesian inference over relativistic mean-field models. A systematic Principal Component Analysis has allowed to break down the percentage contribution of each element or feature in the relationships obtained. This study examines two main models (datasets): the NL model, which includes nucleonic degrees of freedom; and the NL-hyp model, which includes hyperons in addition to nucleons. Our analysis confirms a robust correlation between the tidal deformability of a 1.4 \(M_\odot\) neutron star and $\beta$-equilibrium pressure at twice the nuclear saturation density. This correlation remains once hyperons are included. The contribution of the different nuclear matter properties at saturation to the radius and tidal deformability was calculated. It was shown that the isovector properties have the largest impact, with a contribution of about 90\%. We also studied the relationship between the proton fraction at different densities and various symmetry energy parameters defined at saturation density. For the hyperon data set, we took into account the effects of the negatively charged hyperon $\Xi$ in order to recover the relationships. Our study reveals the individual impact of various symmetry energy parameters on proton fractions at different densities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotation-dependent $I$-Love-$Q$-$δM$ relations in perturbation theory</a><span class="id">[2601.07734]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The so-called $I$-Love-$Q$ relations link some normalized versions of the moment of inertia, the Love number, and the quadrupole moment of a star.

The first detection of PeV gamma rays from astrophysical sources may provide a very sensitive probe of the effect of the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which results in decay of high-energy gamma rays in the superluminal scenario and hence a sharp cutoff of the energy spectrum. Two highest energy sources are studied in this work. No signature of the existence of LIV is found in their energy spectra, and the lower limits on the LIV energy scale are derived. Our results show that the first-order LIV energy scale should be higher than about 10^5 times the Planck scale M_{pl} and that the second-order LIV scale is &gt;10^{-3}M_{pl}.

In contrast to expansion opacities and other wavelength-binned treatments, a line-by-line treatment enables us include fluorescence effects and associate spectral features with the emitting and absorbing lines of individual elements. We find variations in the synthetic observables with both the polar and azimuthal viewing angles. The spectra exhibit blended features with strong interactions by Ce III, Sr II, Y II, and Zr II that vary with time and viewing direction. We demonstrate the importance of wavelength-calibration of atomic data using a model with calibrated Sr, Y, and Zr data, and find major differences in the resulting spectra, including a better agreement with AT2017gfo. The synthetic spectra for near-polar inclination show a feature at around 8000 A, similar to AT2017gfo. However, they evolve on a more rapid timescale, likely due to the low ejecta mass (0.005 M$_\odot$) as we take into account only the early ejecta. The comparatively featureless spectra for equatorial observers gives a tentative prediction that future observations of edge-on kilonovae will appear substantially different from AT2017gfo. We also show that 1D models obtained by spherically averaging the 3D ejecta lead to dramatically different direction-integrated luminosities and spectra compared to full 3D calculations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A model of the heliocentric dust ring on Venus orbit</a><span class="id">[2504.16610]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A heliocentric dust ring on Venus orbit was discovered following observations by the Helios spacecraft, and then confirmed thanks to observations by STEREO and the Parker Solar Probe. The impact risk it poses needs to be evaluated for any spacecraft crossing the ring. This study aims to provide a first model of the dust ring, in terms of distribution of particles (including size distribution), velocity, density of the ring, and deduce a first estimation of the impact risk to spacecrafts crossing the ring. We seek to describe the orbits of dust particles in the ring. We explore a first simple model, that leads us to propose a second, more elaborate, model. This model is then populated by particles that we integrate for 2000 years. We demonstrate that the dust ring will persist over the next 2000 years, only slightly extending radially and perpendicularly to the Venus orbital plane. We show that particles tend to accumulate at Venus orbit, but that along it the differences in density is negligible. We compute the number of particles we can expect to find in the ring. Finally, as an example, we apply this model to Bepi-Colombo to obtain a first estimate of the impact flux in function of radius and mass, for radii between 2 $\mu$m and 2 cm (i.e. for masses between 10^-2 kg and 10^-14 kg). We also present the impact velocity and direction of impacts with respect to Bepi-Colombo. We are able to conclude that the ring seems to present a low risk for spacecrafts using Venus as a gravity assist.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time-evolving coronal modelling of the solar maximum around the solar storms in May 2024 by COCONUT</a><span class="id">[2505.11990]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Time-evolving MHD coronal models deliver more realistic results than traditional quasi-steady-state models. The fully implicit time-evolving coronal model COCONUT performs efficiently enough for real-time coronal simulations during solar minimum. However, during solar maxima, the coronal magnetic field is more complex and stronger, and coronal structures evolve more rapidly than during solar minima. Time-evolving MHD coronal modelling of solar maxima often struggles with poor numerical stability and low computational efficiency. We enhanced the numerical stability of the time-evolving coronal model COCONUT to mitigate these issues with the aim to evaluate the differences between the time-evolving and quasi-steady-state coronal simulation results, and to assess the impact of the spatial resolution on global MHD coronal modelling of solar maxima. After enhancing the positivity-preserving property of COCONUT, we employed it to simulate the evolution of coronal structures within 0.1 AU in an inertial coordinate system over two CRs around the solar storms in May 2024. These simulations were performed on unstructured geodesic meshes containing 6.06, 1.52, and 0.38 M cells. We also conducted a quasi-steady-state coronal simulation that treated the solar surface as a rigidly rotating spherical shell. A comparison with observations further validated the reliability of the time-evolving coronal modelling technique. It shows that incorporating the evolution of the magnetic field on the solar surface can significantly improve the fidelity of global MHD coronal simulations around a solar maximum. A simulated magnetic field strength using a mesh with 6.06 M cells can be stronger by more than 40% than that in a mesh with 0.38 M cells.

Quark matter is modeled within an interacting MIT bag framework that consistently accommodates color-superconducting phases (2SC, 2SC+s, and CFL) and perturbative QCD corrections. We find that quark star models exhibit a distinct advantage in naturally accommodating the ultra-low mass object HESS J1731-347, a configuration that is challenging for standard neutron star models. In the high-mass regime, the interpretation of the secondary component of GW190814 is shown to be strongly prior-dependent: only broad priors allow for the substantial stiffness required to support such a massive object ($\sim$2.6 M$_\odot$), while more restrictive priors favor a softer equation of state consistent with standard pulsar populations. Microscopically, we demonstrate that current data tightly constrain the effective bag constant and the overall stiffness, but cannot distinguish between different color-superconducting phases. Furthermore, we validate a reduction of the model to two effective parameters without loss of information. Our results indicate that if quark stars exist, their sound speeds consistently exceeds the conformal limit ($c_s^2&gt;1/3$) at stellar densities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05648" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confronting Mukhanov Parametrization of Inflationary Equation-of-State with ACT-DR6</a><span class="id">[2507.05648]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We provide a simple yet effective semi-analytical approach to confront Mukhanov Parametrization of inflationary equation-of-state, $1+\omega =\frac{\beta}{({N}+1)^\alpha}$, with the latest ACT-DR6 data employing Hamilton-Jacobi formulation.

In order to get the bounds of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we have also made use of the recent finding $r&lt;0.032$. We have further utilized results from the joint analysis of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data to find the observationally viable region for $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We have also employed the predictions on primordial gravity waves from forthcoming CMB missions in the likes of CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD along with results from the combination of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data to further restrict the model parameters. We find that detection of gravity waves would help us narrow the viable parameter space for Mukhanov parametrization. But in the absence of detection of primordial gravity waves signal by those CMB missions parameter space is reduced significantly for $\beta$, while the range for $\alpha$ is slightly increased. In addition we observe that, $\alpha$ is primarily dependent on the observationally viable range for scalar spectral index while other model parameter $\beta$ is resting heavily on the restriction upon the amplitude of primordial gravity waves.

In novae with main-sequence companions, this emission is believed to result from shocks internal to the nova ejecta, as a later fast wind collides with an earlier slow outflow. To test this model and constrain the $\gamma$-ray production mechanism, we present a systematic study of a sample of recent Galactic novae, comparing their $\gamma$-ray properties ($\gamma$-ray luminosity and duration) with their outflow velocities, peak $V$-band magnitudes, and the decline times of their optical light curves ($t_2$). We uniformly estimate distances in a luminosity-independent manner, using spectroscopic reddening estimates combined with three-dimensional Galactic dust maps. Across our sample, $\gamma$-ray luminosities ($&gt;$100 MeV) vary by three orders of magnitude, spanning $10^{34}-10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Novae with larger velocity of the fast outflow (or larger differential between the fast and slow outflow) have larger $\gamma$-ray luminosities, but are detectable for a shorter duration. The optical and $\gamma$-ray fluxes are correlated, consistent with substantial thermal emission in the optical from shock-heated gas. Across six novae with $\gamma$-ray and infrared light curves, evidence for dust formation appears soon after the end of the detected $\gamma$-ray emission. Dusty and non-dusty novae appear to have similar $\gamma$-ray luminosities, though novae that have more material processed by the shocks may be more likely to form dust. We find that the properties of the $\gamma$-ray emission in novae depend heavily on the ejecta properties, and are consistent with expectations for internal shocks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COCONUT: A coronal model with an energy decomposition strategy</a><span class="id">[2508.20423]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we propose an energy decomposition method combined with an HLL Riemann solver that includes an additional dissipation term in the energy equation to improve the numerical stability of the fully implicit, time-evolving coronal model COCONUT and extend its applicability to solar-maximum phases. In MHD simulations that evolve conservative variables in time, the thermal pressure is typically computed by subtracting the magnetic and kinetic energies from the total energy. In low-beta (the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure; $&lt; 10^{-3}$) regions, discretization errors of magnetic energy can be comparable to the thermal pressure, potentially leading to negative thermal pressure and causing the simulation to crash. Therefore, we update the decomposed energy, excluding the magnetic energy, at each time step. It avoids subtracting a large magnetic energy from the total energy to obtain a very small thermal pressure in low-$\beta$ regions, thereby improving the numerical stability of MHD models. We validate the algorithm using a time-evolving solar-maximum Carrington rotation simulation in 2025, which the previous code failed to run to completion. We also perform quasi-steady-state coronal simulations and 2D benchmark tests to further assess the algorithm's performance. The simulation results show that the algorithm produces results nearly identical to those obtained using the traditional full energy equation during solar minimum, while significantly improving COCONUT's ability to simulate coronal evolution under strong magnetic fields, even including fields exceeding 100 Gauss with $\beta&lt;10^{-3}$. This method provides a promising approach for performing quasi-realistic coronal simulations during solar maxima.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13413" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaia Barium Dwarfs and Their Ostensibly Ordinary Counterparts</a><span class="id">[2509.13413]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recently identified Gaia population of main-sequence–white dwarf (MS+WD) binaries at separations of ${\sim}\,1~{\rm AU}$, often with moderate eccentricities, is not readily reproduced by binary population synthesis models. Barium stars represent a closely related population whose enrichment in $s$-process elements both confirms the presence of a WD companion and attests to past binary interaction. It also indicates that mass transfer occurred at least during the late- and post-AGB phases of the WD progenitor, when $s$-process elements are dredged up. In this work, we further explore the connection between the astrometrically identified Gaia MS+WD binaries and the classical barium star population. To achieve this, we used high-resolution FEROS spectroscopy to measure abundances for 30 Gaia DR3 non-single-star binaries, identifying 10 as Ba-enriched. Together with our recent analysis of archival GALAH data, this yields a sample of 38 barium dwarfs with dynamically measured WD masses, compared to only 6 previously known systems with known WD masses at these separations. We find that, in cases where metallicity is sufficiently low to facilitate efficient $s$-process production, barium and yttrium enrichment is often detected. This enrichment is also identified in eccentric systems, suggesting that post-AGB mass transfer mechanisms are capable of pumping eccentricity into the orbit or occur without erasing it. Our results indicate that the Gaia MS+WD binaries trace the population from which barium stars emerge. Treating the large Gaia-discovered population as an extension of known $s$-process enriched dwarfs opens an avenue to empirically constrain their formation and evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New ultralight scalar particles and the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs – the important role of Sirius B</a><span class="id">[2510.06312]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the equation of state for two classes of new ultralight particles, a scalar field coupling to electrons and a light $\mathbb{Z}_\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion field coupling to nucleons.

In the 1980s, to explain how these pulsars could be formed, a new hypothesis was formulated: the recycling of pulsars, i.e the fact that a pulsar could accrete matter from a companion and been spun up. In this paper, we developed a population synthesis algorithm for pulsars which belong to a binary, in order to check whether most of the observed recycled pulsars were formed via an accretion mechanism and derive statistics about their properties, that are difficult to obtain through observations. We also make predictions for future surveys. Toward the presented objectives, we use the code Stellar EVolution for N-body (SEVN) to take into account all the binary processes and our own code to evolve each pulsar self-consistently by taking into account the secular evolution of a force-free magnetosphere, the magnetic field decay, gravitational braking and spatial evolution. Each pulsar is born in binary with a main sequence companion, and evolve to present time. The radio and $\gamma$-ray emission locations were modeled by the polar cap geometry and striped wind model, respectively. Our simulations seem to reproduce well the population of radio and $\gamma$-ray pulsars observed in the selected surveys. We also found that there should be less than $220$ unidentified pulsars in the Fourth Fermi-LAT catalogue of $\gamma$-ray sources (4FGL). High values of the viewing angle $\zeta$ seem to be needed to be able to observe the recycled pulsars, and it also seems difficult to observe recycled pulsars with an aligned rotation axis and magnetic axis (i.e., $\chi \leq 10$°). We find that only a small fraction, approximately $\sim 7.6\times10^{-3}$ %, of oxygen-neon white dwarfs (ONeWDs) in binary systems appear to contribute to the population of mildly recycled pulsars through accretion-induced collapse.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Wind-Blown Bubbles as Environments for Late-Time Rebrightening of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows</a><span class="id">[2510.22891]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We presented the multi-wavelength afterglow fitting results for three events that exhibit late afterglow rebrightening behavior: EP240414a ($z=0.401$), GRB 240529A ($z=2.695$), and GRB 240218A ($z=6.782$), which span a broad range of redshifts, from the local to the high-redshift this http URL prove that the peculiar afterglow light curves of three bursts can be well fitted by structured jets propagated in free-to-shocked stellar wind environment of stellar wind blown bubbles. This scenario offers a self-consistent explanation for the observed subclass of afterglows that exhibit rebrightening that is characterized by steep rises and rapid decays. It also provides a unified solution for such events and offers pathways to study both the jet generation mechanism and the propagation process of jets through the envelope of the progenitor. This study reveals that the structured jets produced by such events exhibit a narrow jet core and a steep angle-dependent energy decay index, suggesting highly magnetized jets. The derived transition radii from free stellar winds to shocked stellar winds for all three events are smaller than 0.5 pc, with statistical analysis of similar events indicating a median value of 0.1 pc, which conflicts with numerical simulation results.

Its identification as a strong candidate black hole-white dwarf (BH-WD) system, combined with its exceptionally short period and high X-ray luminosity, suggests it may be one of the most vital low-frequency GW sources in M31. In this \textit{Letter}, we investigate the detectability of its GW signal for future space-borne detectors in multiband GW detection. We find that while its signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for low-frequency detectors remains marginal for high-confidence detection, middle-frequency detectors such as DECIGO and BBO are far more promising, potentially achieving S/N $\varrho&gt;8$ within reasonable observational duration. With a primary mass of only $m_1 &gt; 5.4M_\odot$ (or $6.6M_\odot$), the network of all low and middle frequency detector (or BBO alone) is capable of detecting GW from this system with a $\varrho &gt; 8$, during 10-year observation.

This study establishes M31 UCXB-1 as a key prototype of short-period UCXBs, cementing its role as a cornerstone for multiband, multi-messenger astrophysics and a vital bridge between X-ray astronomy and the future GW era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Particle production and Higgs reheating</a><span class="id">[2512.21658]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reheating is essential for transforming the cold, vacuum dominated Universe at the end of inflation into the hot thermal bath required by the Standard Model. In many well motivated inflationary models, however, the inflaton has no direct couplings to other fields, raising the question of how the Universe becomes repopulated with particles. We address this question within the framework of geometric reheating, where energy transfer occurs purely through gravitational effects. Focusing on a Higgs inflationary scenario with a non-minimal curvature coupling $\xi \phi^2 R$, we derive the post-inflationary dynamics and compute particle production using the Bogoliubov formalism. We show that the rapid, oscillatory evolution of the curvature scalar after inflaton acts as a time dependent gravitational pump, creating scalar spectator particles even in the absence of explicit interactions. This curvature driven production mechanism provides a natural and efficient route to reheating, demonstrating that gravity alone can initiate the standard thermal history and bridge inflation with radiation domination in minimal, coupling free models of the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A global view of post-interaction white dwarf-main sequence binaries</a><span class="id">[2601.00439]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Common-envelope evolution (CEE) is among the most uncertain phases in binary evolution. To empirically constrain CEE, we construct a uniformly selected sample of eclipsing post–common-envelope binaries (PCEBs). Starting from an unresolved white dwarf-main-sequence (WDMS) candidate sample within 200 pc selected from the Gaia color-magnitude diagram, we identify 39 detached eclipsing WDMS binaries using ZTF light curves. The binaries contain cool M dwarfs orbiting warm white dwarfs with orbital periods ($P_{\rm orb}$) of 0.1-2 d. The sample's simple selection function allows us to model observational incompleteness and infer intrinsic properties of the PCEB population. We find an orbital-period distribution consistent with being log-uniform over 0.1-2 d, contrary to recent reports of a bimodal distribution. The companion-mass distribution peaks around $0.25~{\rm M_\odot}$ and declines steeply toward larger masses. The estimated local space density is $7.2\times10^{-5}~{\rm pc^{-3}}$, corresponding to a Galaxy-wide birth rate of 0.01 per year. Combining our results with recent Gaia-based constraints on wider WDMS binaries, we construct an empirical period distribution of post-interaction WDMS binaries spanning 0.1-1000 d. The emerging period distribution is roughly log-flat (d$N/{\rm d}\log P_{\rm orb}\propto P_{\rm orb}^0$) at $P_{\rm orb} &lt; 2$ d and log-increasing (d$N/{\rm d}\log P_{\rm orb}\propto P_{\rm orb}^1$) at $P_{\rm orb} = 100-1000$ d. The 10-100 d regime remains poorly constrained, but a few nearby systems suggest it is also well-populated. Short-period PCEBs ($P_{\rm orb}&lt;2$ d) with M dwarf companions are roughly 2-3 times more common than wide ($P_{\rm orb} = 100-1000$ d) WDMS binaries with FGK companions, which likely formed through stable mass transfer. These results provide direct observational constraints on CEE and an empirical benchmark for binary-population models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vetting and False Positive Analysis of TOI 864.01: Evidence for a Likely Hierarchical Eclipsing Binary Masked by Dilution</a><span class="id">[2601.02171]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed vetting analysis of the TESS candidate TOI 864.01, initially identified as a potential ultra-short-period ($P \approx 0.52$ d) Earth-sized planet orbiting an M-dwarf. Using 12 sectors of TESS photometry spanning a multi-year baseline, we recover a robust periodic transit-like signal. While the recovered transit depth is attenuated by detrending ($\approx 158$ ppm), the SPOC pipeline reports an undiluted depth of $\approx 640$ ppm. Stellar characterization based on Gaia DR3 astrometry yields a nominally single-star solution (RUWE = 1.18), highlighting the limitations of astrometric vetting for tight companions. Incorporating archival high-resolution imaging from the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP SG1) reveals a stellar companion at a separation of 0.04&quot;, unresolved by both Gaia and TESS. Accounting for this close contaminant renders statistical validation inapplicable, as False Positive Probability calculations fail to converge in this regime of extreme dilution. Bayesian model comparison between planetary and eclipsing binary scenarios yields an inconclusive result ($\Delta \ln Z \approx 0.09$), consistent with the strong degeneracy introduced by unresolved blending. Ground-based follow-up photometry further supports significant dilution, with a measured transit depth ($\approx 0.37$ ppt) shallower than predicted under an undiluted planetary scenario ($\approx 0.64$ ppt). Notably, ground-based observations also reveal a transit timing offset of 6.3 minutes late compared to the SPOC ephemeris, further supporting a non-planetary interpretation. Taken together, the available evidence favors a hierarchical eclipsing binary interpretation. We therefore classify TOI 864.01 as a probable False Positive and recommend its retirement from planetary candidate lists.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energetic particles accelerated via turbulent magnetic reconnection in protoplanetary discs - I. Ionisation rates</a><span class="id">[2601.05060]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Ionisation controls the chemistry, thermal balance, and magnetic coupling in protoplanetary discs. However, standard ionisation vectors such as stellar UV, X-rays, Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) might not be efficient enough, as UV/X-rays are attenuated rapidly with depth, while GCRs are modulated. Turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection in disc atmospheric layers offers a physically motivated, in situ source of energetic particles (EPs) that has never been considered. Aims. We quantify the ionisation and heating produced by EPs accelerated by turbulent reconnection, identify where they dominate over X-rays and GCRs, and determine energetic thresholds for their relevance. We provide scalable diagnostics tied to the local energy budget. Methods. We adopt a Fermi-like acceleration model with parameters linked to a turbulent reconnection geometry trigger by the magneto-rotational instability, yielding a steady-state energy distribution of the EP forming a power-law of index $p=2.5$. We propagate electrons and protons through the disc and compute primary and secondary ionisation and associated heating on a fiducial T Tauri disc model background. The non-thermal normalisation is set by the fraction of local viscous accretion energy dissipation channelled to EPs, parametrised by $\kappa$. Results. For $\kappa\gtrsim 0.4\%$, EPs ionisation overpass standard ionisation sources in the disc atmosphere and intermediate/deep layers out to radii of a few tens of astronomical units. Even at $\kappa\sim 0.025\%$, EPs contribute at the few-percent level, thus are chemically and dynamically relevant. These results identify EPs accelerated by turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection as a rather robust, disc-internal ionisation channel that should be included in thermo-chemical models of protoplanetary discs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hidden pattern of self-invariant cosmic expansion: Empirical evidence from Hubble diagram of supernovae</a><span class="id">[2601.05512]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present empirical evidence extracted from the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa demonstrating that the speed of light varies as the universe expands. Moreover, the speed of light must vary in a specific quantifiable manner. Departing from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, we reformulate the kinematics of late-time acceleration by employing Dolgov's power-law cosmology $a=\left(t/t_{0}\right)^{\mu}$ [Phys. Rev. D 55, 5881 (1997)] and Barrow's varying speed of light $c=c_{0}\,a^{-\zeta}$ [Phys. Rev. D 59, 043515 (1999)]. In this cosmology, light traveling through an expanding universe undergoes an additional refraction caused by the varying c along its path, resulting in a modified Lemaitre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-(1+\zeta)}$. Despite its parsimony, the model achieves a high-quality fit to the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa and exhibits a strong degeneracy along the locus $(1+\zeta)\,\mu=1$. This empirical relation indicates a self-invariant cosmic evolution: at all instants during the late-time epoch, the speed of light is exactly proportional to the rate of cosmic expansion, viz. $c=\mu^{-1}c_{0}\,t_{0}\,\frac{da}{dt}$, a characteristic that is absent in the $\Lambda$CDM model. This synchronous behavior between $c$ and $da/dt$ has profound cosmological implications that we will discuss, regarding (i) the nature of late-time acceleration; (ii) the horizon problem; (iii) Kolb's coasting universe model [Astrophys. J. 344, 543 (1989)]; (iv) a generalization of the cosmological principle to the time domain; and (v) the emergence of a novel conformally flat metric applicable to cosmology. This newfound kinematic $c\propto da/dt$ relation, if further corroborated, will represent a stringent requirement that any viable dynamical model of cosmology must satisfy – a requirement that the $\Lambda$CDM model does not fulfill.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04358" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corrections to the Black hole entropy from a Bose Einstein condensate: a semi-classical phenomenological approach</a><span class="id">[2501.04358]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper we obtain logarithmic corrections to the black hole entropy.

We investigate supernova cooling constraints on lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple to electrons and muons. For LFV-ALP production in supernovae, muon decay and lepton bremsstrahlung have been considered previously. In this work, we identify the electron-muon coalescence channel as an efficient new production mechanism in the high-mass regime. We also include the semi-Compton scattering process, which has recently been shown to provide sizable contributions for electron-coupled ALPs. We find that muon decay dominates in the low-mass regime, electron-muon coalescence becomes the leading channel at high masses, and semi-Compton scattering provides the dominant contribution in the intermediate mass range. We find that the electron-muon coalescence process yields the strongest constraints in the mass range of $\sim (115,280)$ MeV, probing the ALP-electron-muon coupling down to $\sim 4\times 10^{-10}$ for an ALP mass of $\sim200$ MeV.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sound waves from primordial black hole formations</a><span class="id">[2504.12243]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a numerical investigation of primordial black hole (PBH) formation from super-horizon curvature perturbations and the subsequent generation and propagation of sound waves, which can serve as a new source of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) presented in a companion letter.

In the case of sub-GeV DM, annihilation or decay into $e^+e^-$ contributes to the diffuse sea of cosmic-ray (CR) leptons, which can generate bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton (IC) emission on Galactic photon fields, producing a broad spectrum from X-rays to $\gamma$-rays detectable by instruments such as eROSITA and XMM-Newton. For PBHs with masses below $\sim10^{17}$ g, Hawking evaporation similarly yields low-energy $e^\pm$, leading to comparable diffuse emission. Using the first data release from eROSITA and incorporating up-to-date CR propagation and diffusion parameters, we derive new constraints on both scenarios. For sub-GeV DM, we exclude thermally averaged annihilation cross sections in the range $\sim 10^{-27}-10^{-25} \ \mathrm{cm^3/s}$ and decay lifetimes of $\sim 10^{24}-10^{25}$ s for masses between 1 MeV and 1 GeV, with eROSITA outperforming previous X-ray constraints below $\sim$ 30 MeV. For asteroid-mass PBHs, we set new bounds on the DM fraction based on their Hawking-induced emission. Finally, we revisit earlier constraints from XMM-Newton, finding that they were approximately four orders of magnitude too stringent due to the use of the instrument's geometric solid angle rather than its exposure-weighted solid angle. Upon using the exposure-weighted solid angle, we show that the revised XMM-Newton limits are slightly weaker than those from eROSITA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diffuse astrophysical neutrinos from dark matter around blazars</a><span class="id">[2506.06416]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutrinos from blazars can originate from inelastic scatterings between protons within their jets and sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around them, explaining IceCube detections of neutrinos from TXS 0506+056 that are otherwise challenging for models of its jet.

By explicitly incorporating the color-superconducting pairing gap into the phenomenological model of a smooth transition from hadron to quark matter, we extend the known quarkyonic framework to include this essential aspect relevant at high densities. The momentum dependence of the pairing gap, motivated by the running of the QCD coupling and introduced similarly to chiral quark models with nonlocal interaction, is a novel element of the model that is crucial for enabling the simultaneous onset of all color-flavor quark states in the presence of color superconductivity. While asymptotically conformal behavior of the present model is ensured by construction, we demonstrate that reaching the conformal limit in agreement with the predictions of perturbative QCD is provided by the proper momentum dependence of the thickness of the hadron shell in momentum space. We employ the flexible meta-modeling approach to nuclear matter, analyzing the structure of the hadron shell in momentum space and focusing on the effects of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter. Similar to the effects induced by the onset of the quarkyonic phase, color superconductivity leads to stiffening of the equation of state of the NS matter. This causes a significant impact on observable properties of neutron stars, which are analyzed and compared to recent astrophysical and theoretical constraints. We argue that the developed model of color-superconducting quarkyonic matter provides a new, consistent tool for studying the scenario of smooth quark-hadron transition in NSs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncertainty in predicting the stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences</a><span class="id">[2510.02163]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The stochastic gravitational-wave background from compact binary coalescences is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation searches with terrestrial detectors.

Within this framework, the relevant infrared structure is encoded in a functional Berry phase associated with the space of gauge connections, and the corresponding Berry corrections modify the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. The infrared scaling symmetry of the Rayleigh-Jeans law leads to a simple renormalization-group equation whose solution determines the frequency dependence of an effective factor $F_{\rm eff}(\omega)$ controlling the strength of the electron-photon cloud dressing. As a result, the energy density of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) receives a Berry-induced correction that scales as a power law and produces a frequency-dependent temperature excess in the radio domain. Although the exponent $\gamma$ governing this scaling behaviour is not fixed internally by the present formulation of IR-QED and must instead be determined phenomenologically, the existence and structure of the excess are genuine predictions of the theory. Remarkably, the resulting expression is extremely simple and naturally aligns with the deviations suggested by the ARCADE 2 data. Taken together, these results indicate that Berry phases in IR-QED may lead to observable consequences in the low-frequency tail of the CMB spectrum.</p></div></details></article></body>
