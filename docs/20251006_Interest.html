<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An account of the arrow of time when scale is surplus</a><span class="id">[2510.03041]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Existing accounts of the cosmological arrow of time face a dilemma: generalist approaches that posit time-asymmetric laws lack independent motivation, while particularist approaches that invoke a Past Hypothesis face serious conceptual and explanatory problems. We propose a novel account that dispenses with the need for both time-asymmetric laws and a Past Hypothesis. Instead, it is centred around a symmetry argument that reveals attractors and so-called 'Janus points'. The main idea is that the global spatial scale of the Universe is not empirically accessible, and should therefore be treated as surplus structure. By contrast, the Hubble parameter, which encodes the relative rate of change of scale, is empirically accessible. Once the scale redundancy is eliminated, the empirically meaningful description of cosmic dynamics involves a drag-like variable that transforms in a way that preserves time-reversal invariance. The resulting space of dynamical possibilities possesses universal attractors and Janus points, giving rise to particular states in which observers experience a cosmological arrow of time akin to our own. We illustrate the proposal by applying it to cosmological and gravitational N-body models, showing how it accounts, respectively, for the rapid cooling of the early universe and its relative smoothness.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comment on Marek Czachor article entitled &quot;On Relativity of Quantumness as Implied by Relativity of Arithmetic and Probability&quot;</a><span class="id">[2510.02412]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Czachor's model of hierarchical arithmetics begins with a valid formal premise but fixes the key probability mapping g by importing the Born rule and Fubini-Study metric from standard quantum mechanics, where Born probabilities are Kolmogorov within a fixed measurement context. This g is then applied in a non-Newtonian hidden-variable setting, producing a hybrid framework whose agreement with quantum correlations is built in by design, not derived from new physics, and thus does not constitute a genuine counterexample to Bell's theorem</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inconsistencies and errors in traditional approaches to energy in our introductory courses</a><span class="id">[2007.09480]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a critical analysis of the classical approaches to energy subjects, based on the work-energy theorem and the conservation of mechanical energy proposed in the courses of the first years of tertiary education.

The framework consists of three steps: (i) instructing machines to impersonate each human in the population, reflecting their backgrounds and beliefs, (ii) administering a questionnaire covering various philosophical positions to both humans and machines, and (iii) statistically analyzing the resulting responses. We apply this methodology to the debate on scientific realism, a long-standing philosophical inquiry exploring the relationship between science and reality. By considering the outcome of a survey of over 500 human participants, including both physicists and philosophers of science, we generate their machine personas using an artificial intelligence engine based on a large language model. We reveal that the philosophical views of a population of machines are, on average, similar to those endorsed by a population of humans, irrespective of whether they are physicists or philosophers of science. As compared to humans, however, machines exhibit a weaker inclination toward scientific realism and a stronger coherence in their philosophical positions. Given the observed similarities between the populations of humans and machines, this methodological framework may offer unprecedented opportunities for advancing research in the empirical social sciences by complementing human participants with their machine-impersonated counterparts.</p></div></details></article>
