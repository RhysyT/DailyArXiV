However, it is expected that some TDEs will occur outside the galaxy nucleus, arising from wandering black holes originating in galaxy mergers. Here we present observations of TDE 2025abcr, the first optical TDE discovered in the outskirts of a host galaxy. The TDE was identified by a custom 'off-nuclear' implementation of the ML classifier $\texttt{tdescore}$, which classifies new ZTF transients based on their lightcurves. Follow-up observations confirm that TDE 2025abcr is a TDE-H+He, occurring 9.5$&quot;$ (10.3 kpc projected distance) from the nucleus of a massive galaxy ($\mathrm{M}_{\star}$ = $10^{11.18 \pm 0.03}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) with a central black hole mass of $10^{8.82 \pm 0.65}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. TDE 2025abcr itself was likely disrupted by a much lighter black hole ($10^{6.09\pm0.53}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, as estimated with peak luminosity scaling relations). The black hole was either dynamically ejected from the nucleus or lies at the center of a very faint tidally-stripped dwarf galaxy undergoing a minor merger. Late-time observations of TDE 2025abcr could confirm the origin of this apparent 'orphan' black hole. The rate of highly offset ($\gtrsim$3 kpc) TDEs can be constrained to $&lt;$10% of the nuclear TDE rate, but our discovery implies that many dozens of similar sources will be detected by the Vera C. Rubin each year with resolvable offsets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10186" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A method for constructing the joint mass function of binary stars</a><span class="id">[2602.10186]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The initial mass function (IMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses in a population of newly born stars and is amongst the most fundamental concepts in astrophysics. It is not only the direct result of the star formation process but it also explains the evolution of galaxies' luminosities, metal yields, star-formation efficiencies, and supernova production rates. Because most stars exist in binary systems, however, a full statistical account of stellar mass requires not the IMF but rather the joint distribution of a binary population's primary- and secondary-star masses. This joint distribution must respect the IMF of the stars from which the population has been assembled as well as the distribution of mass ratios that results from the assembly mechanism. Despite its importance, this joint distribution is known only in the case of random pairing. Here we present a method for constructing it in the general case. We also illustrate the use of our method by recovering the known result for random pairing and by finding the previously unknown result for uniform pairing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning Methods for Stellar Collisions. I. Predicting Outcomes of SPH Simulations</a><span class="id">[2602.10191]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar collisions can occur frequently in dense cluster environments, and play a crucial role in producing exotic phenomena from blue stragglers in globular clusters to high-energy transients in galactic nuclei. Successive collisions and mergers of massive stars could also lead to the formation of massive black holes, serving as seeds for supermassive black hole in the early universe. While analytic fitting formulae exist for predicting collision outcomes, they do not generalize across different energy scales or stellar evolutionary phases. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations are often used to compute the outcomes of stellar collisions, but, even at low resolution, their computational cost makes running on-the-fly calculations during an $N$-body simulation quite challenging. Here we present a new grid of $27,720$ SPH calculations of main-sequence star collisions, spanning a wide range of masses, ages, relative velocities, and impact parameters. Using this grid, we train machine learning models to predict both collision outcomes (merger vs disruption, or flyby) and final remnant masses. We compare the performance of nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks, achieving classification balanced accuracy of $98.4\%$, and regression relative errors as low as $0.11\%$ and $0.15\%$ for the final stars $1$ and $2$, respectively. We make our trained models publicly available as part of the package collAIder, enabling rapid predictions of stellar collision outcomes in $N$-body models of dense star cluster dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10192" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forged by Feedback: Stellar Properties of Brightest Group Galaxies in Cosmological Simulations</a><span class="id">[2602.10192]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate how different galaxy formation models impact the stellar properties of brightest group galaxies (BGGs) in four cosmological simulations: ROMULUS, SIMBA, SIMBA-C, and OBSIDIAN. The stellar masses, specific star formation rates, and mass-weighted stellar ages of the simulated BGGs are analysed alongside those of observed BGGs from X-ray-selected galaxy groups in the COSMOS field. We find that the global properties and underlying evolutionary pathways of simulated BGG populations are strongly impacted by the strength and mechanism of their respective active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback models, which play a critical role in regulating the growth of massive galaxies. OBSIDIAN's sophisticated three-regime AGN feedback model achieves the highest overall agreement with COSMOS observations, matching stellar property distributions, quenched fractions, and the evolution of star formation in increasingly massive systems. We find evidence suggesting that BGG populations of OBSIDIAN and COSMOS undergo a gradual decline in star formation with stellar mass, in contrast to SIMBA and SIMBA-C, which display rapid quenching linked to the onset of powerful AGN jet feedback. By comparison, ROMULUS produces highly star-forming, under-quenched BGGs due to the inefficiency of its thermal AGN feedback in preventing cooling flows from fuelling BGG growth. The success of the OBSIDIAN simulation demonstrates the importance of physically motivated subgrid prescriptions for realistically capturing the processes that shape BGGs and their dynamic group environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The stellar-to-halo mass relation of central galaxies across three orders of halo mass</a><span class="id">[2602.10193]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The stellar content of galaxies is tightly connected to the mass and growth of their host dark matter halos. Observational constraints on this relation remain limited, particularly for low-mass groups, leaving uncertainties in how galaxies assemble their stars across halo mass scales. Accurately measuring the brightest central galaxy (BCG) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) over a wide mass range is therefore crucial for understanding galaxy formation and the role of feedback processes. Here we present the SHMR spanning $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12}$-$10^{15}\,M_\odot$, using halo masses derived from eROSITA eRASS1 X-ray data and BCG stellar masses based on SDSS photometry. By stacking X-ray spectra of optically selected groups, we recover robust average halo gas temperatures for each bin, which are then converted to halo masses via the $M$-$T_X$ relation. We find that the SHMR peaks near $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12}\,M_\odot$, with a declining stellar fraction at higher masses. This trend reflects a combination of processes that reduce the efficiency of stellar mass growth in massive halos, such as AGN feedback, reduced cooling efficiency, and the increasing dominance of ex-situ assembly, while halos continue to grow through mergers and accretion. Our measurements are consistent over the full mass range with previous observational studies, including weak lensing, X-ray analyses of individual clusters, and kinematical and dynamical methods. Comparisons with hydrodynamical simulations show good agreement at low masses but reveal significant discrepancies in the normalization at cluster scales, highlighting the sensitivity of BCG stellar growth to feedback prescriptions and halo assembly history. These results provide the first X-ray-based observational SHMR covering three orders of magnitude in halo mass, establish a robust benchmark for testing galaxy formation models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Keck/DEIMOS Stellar Archive: I. Uniform Velocities and Metallicities for 78 Milky Way Dwarf Galaxies and Globular Clusters</a><span class="id">[2602.10200]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a homogeneous spectroscopic dataset of 22,339 stars in 78 Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites and globular clusters. All data were taken with the Keck II telescope and Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multiobject Spectrograph (DEIMOS) spectrograph using the 1200G grating (spectral resolution R 6000). Based on a uniform data reduction of 411 DEIMOS masks, we present a catalog of individual stellar radial velocities, equivalent width-based [Fe/H] metallicities, and membership estimates. The Milky Way satellites range from M_V = 2 to -14 (M* = 10^1.5 to 10^7.5 Msun); the majority of individual stars presented in these systems have magnitudes 17 &gt; r &gt; 22. The data were reduced to 1D spectra using PypeIt, which provides near Poisson statistics-level sky subtraction. Radial velocities were determined via dmost, a forward modeling method first presented here, which combines both synthetic telluric and stellar templates to determine stellar radial velocities. We assess the accuracy and precision our method via comparison to thousands of repeat measurements and literature values. We determine a velocity error floor of 1.1 km/s and a CaII triplet-based metallicity error floor of 0.1 dex. We calculate internal velocity dispersions and compare to literature values, demonstrating 20-50% improved precision over the literature in most cases. In a companion paper, we use our homogeneous catalogs to explore properties of these Milky Way satellites, including previously unpublished measurements in several systems including Bootes II and Draco II. We provide full access to the data catalogs to enable further studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Keck/DEIMOS Stellar Archive: II. Dynamical Masses and Metallicities for a Uniform Sample of Milky Way Satellites</a><span class="id">[2602.10202]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Population-level studies of Milky Way satellites used to constrain dark matter or the threshold of galaxy formation often rely on velocity dispersions and metallicities derived from heterogeneous spectroscopic analyses. Systematic differences between data reduction pipelines and membership criteria can masquerade as astrophysical signals, or obscure real trends. Here, we present the largest self-consistent sample of spectroscopically-derived quantities for Milky Way satellite galaxies and globular clusters based on a homogeneous re-analysis of individual stars observed with the Keck/DEIMOS spectrograph. We determine enclosed dynamical masses, mean [Fe/H] metallicities, and metallicity dispersions for 67 systems with 10 or more member stars. At a given stellar mass, systems classified as satellite galaxies are well separated from globular clusters in their dynamical mass and mass-to-light ratios. The average enclosed mass densities of satellite galaxies agree with semi-analytic CDM model predictions. For satellite galaxies, we observe a break in the stellar mass-metallicity relation near log M*/Msun = 4 (M_V   -4.5). Above this stellar mass, satellite galaxies show the well-known tight trend (0.16 dex scatter in [Fe/H]) of decreasing metallicity with stellar mass; below log M*/Msun = 4, the mass-metallicity relation flattens and/or increases in scatter. Satellite galaxies have internal metallicity scatter between 0.3-0.4 dex across our stellar mass range. These uniform measurements will enable tighter constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relation, improved J-factor estimates for dark matter searches, and lay a foundation for interpreting the flood of new Milky Way satellites expected in the LSST/Roman/Euclid era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimizing Deep Learning Photometric Redshifts for the Roman Space Telescope with HST/CANDELS</a><span class="id">[2602.10207]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Photometric redshifts (photo-$z$'s) will be crucial for studies of galaxy evolution, large-scale structure, and transients with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Deep learning methods leverage pixel-level information from ground-based images to achieve the best photo-$z$'s for low-redshift galaxies, but their efficacy at higher redshifts with deep, space-based imaging remains largely untested. We used Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS optical and near-infrared imaging to evaluate fully-supervised, self-supervised, and semi-supervised deep learning photo-$z$ algorithms out to $z\sim3$. Compared to template-based and classical machine learning photometry methods, the fully-supervised and semi-supervised models achieved better performance. Our new semi-supervised model, PITA (Photo-$z$ Inference with a Triple-loss Algorithm), outperformed all others by learning from unlabeled and labeled data through a three-part loss function that incorporates images and colors for all objects as well as redshifts when available. PITA produces a latent space that varies smoothly in magnitude, color, and redshift, resulting in the best photo-$z$ performance even when the redshift training set was significantly reduced. In contrast, the self-supervised approach produced a latent space with significant color and redshift fluctuations that hindered photo-$z$ inference. Looking forward to Roman, we recommend using semi supervised deep learning to take full advantage of the information contained in the hundreds of millions of high-resolution images and color measurements, together with the limited redshift measurements available, to achieve the most accurate photo-$z$ estimates for both faint and bright sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for neutrino emission from X-ray Bright Seyfert Galaxies in the Southern Hemisphere using Enhanced Starting Track Events with IceCube</a><span class="id">[2602.10208]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>IceCube recently reported the observation of TeV neutrinos from the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, and the corresponding neutrino flux is significantly higher than the upper limit implied by observations of GeV-TeV gamma rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced near the supermassive black hole, where the radiation density is high enough to obscure gamma rays. We use a set of muon neutrinos with interaction vertices inside the detector, which have good sensitivity to sources in the Southern sky, from IceCube data recorded between 2011 and 2021. We then search for individual and collective neutrino signals from 14 Seyfert galaxies in the Southern Sky selected from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGN Spectroscopic Survey. Using the correlations between keV X-rays and TeV neutrinos predicted by disk-corona models, and assuming production characteristics similar to NGC 1068, a collective neutrino signal search reveals an excess of $6.7_{-3.2}^{+4.0}$ events, which is inconsistent with background expectations at the 3$\sigma$ level of significance. In this paper, we present new independent evidence that Seyfert galaxies contribute to the extragalactic flux of high-energy neutrinos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10244" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The S-PLUS Fornax Project (S+FP): An extragalactic catalog covering $\sim$ 5 virial radii around NGC 1399 with galaxy properties</a><span class="id">[2602.10244]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observational extragalactic catalogs over wide sky areas are essential for uncovering the large-scale structure of the Universe. They allow, among others, cosmological studies and density analyses that impose strong constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution. By taking advantage of the wide field images and the 12 optical bands of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS), we aim at providing a catalog of galaxies located, in projection, towards the Fornax galaxy cluster, within $\sim$ 5 virial radii in right ascension (R.A.) and $\sim$ 3 virial radius in declination (Dec) around NGC,1399, the dominant galaxy of the cluster. Such a catalog will allow unprecedented large-scale structure studies in that sky region. Supervised deep learning algorithms have been developed, utilizing neural networks complemented with dimensionality reduction techniques, to classify and separate spurious objects, stars and galaxies in a photometric catalog previously built for the S-PLUS Fornax Project (S+FP). That catalog was built using a combination of SExtractor configurations optimized for galaxy detection and characterization. A catalog of 119,580 galaxies was obtained in the direction of the Fornax cluster containing photometric information in the 12 optical bands of S-PLUS complemented with GALEX (UV), VHS-VISTA (NIR) and AllWISE (MIR) data. We estimate photometric redshifts ({\sigma}_ NMAD $\sim$ 0.0219) with a lower limit of z_ lim $\sim$ 0.03. Stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs) and D4000_N index estimates were obtained through a machine learning approach, by matching S-PLUS photometric data to SDSS spectroscopic data.

Inner (r &lt; 3 au) disk planetary carbon compositions are strongly influenced by supply and survival of carbonaceous solids. Here we trace the journey of carbon from the interstellar medium to the processes leading to planet formation. The review highlights the following central aspects: -Organics forming in evolved star envelopes are supplemented by aromatic molecules forming in the dense ISM to represent the seeds of (hydro)carbon supply through pervasive pebble drift to rocky planets and sub-Neptune cores. -Within the protoplanetary disk the sharp gradient in the C/Si content of Solar System bodies and mineral geochemistry outlines a tale of carbon loss from pebbles to within planetesimals and planets, and from planetary atmospheres. -Within two planet formation paradigms (pebble and planetesimal accretion) a range of planetary carbon content is possible that is strongly influenced by early (&lt; 0.5 Myr) formation of a pressure bump that titrates drift. Overall, it is unlikely that the carbon architecture of our Solar System applies to all systems. In the absence of giant planets, carbon-rich rocky worlds and sub-Neptunes may be common. We outline observations that support their presence and discuss habitability of terrestrial worlds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Re-visiting the Canis Major star-forming region with Gaia data release 3 data</a><span class="id">[2602.10323]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: The Canis Major (CMa) star-forming region, a remote molecular cloud complex within the recently discovered Radcliffe Wave, remains under-explored in the literature. Aims: We revisit the stellar census in the CMa region, characterizing its stellar population, kinematics, and age using recent astrometric and photometric data from the third data release of the Gaia space mission (Gaia DR3). Methods: We conducted a membership analysis of Gaia DR3 sources across a 16 deg$^2$ field encompassing the youngest subgroups in CMa. This new stellar census, combined with spectroscopic observations, allowed us to investigate the structure, kinematics, and age of this region. Results: We identified 1531 objects as members of the CMa region, confirming 401 previously known members and introducing 1130 new candidate members. These objects have magnitudes ranging from 10 to 18 mag in the G band from Gaia DR3. We identified two subgroups of CMa stars in our sample labelled as Cluster A and Cluster B. They are located at roughly the same distance ($d_{A} = 1150^{+79}_{-88}$ pc and $d_{B} = 1183^{+103}_{-108}$ pc) and exhibit similar space motions that can be derived thanks to the precise radial velocities obtained in this study. The subgroups have a mean isochronal age of about 2-3 Myr. However, based on infrared photometry we show that Cluster A has a higher fraction of disc-bearing stars suggesting that it could be somewhat younger than Cluster B. Conclusions: Our analysis provides new insights into the stellar population of the Canis Major region, by identifying new members, characterizing their kinematics, and assessing their evolutionary stages. Future studies incorporating additional data from upcoming Gaia data releases, multi-wavelength and high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be essential to further advance our understanding of the history of star formation in this region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor Star Candidates in the Milky Way from J-PLUS and S-PLUS</a><span class="id">[2602.10325]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent large-scale multi-band photometric surveys now enable elemental-abundance estimates for millions of stars with accuracies approaching those of low- to medium-resolution spectroscopy. Using [Fe/H] and [C/Fe] estimates derived from the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) DR3 and the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) DR4, which together cover $\sim$6,200 deg$^2$ of the sky, we identify large numbers of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the Milky Way. After applying data-quality cuts and evolutionary corrections to the carbon-abundance estimates, we construct a combined J/S-PLUS sample of $\sim$6.40 million stars and identify $\sim$104,900 CEMP candidates, roughly twice the number of CEMP candidates identified from Gaia XP spectra by Lucey et al. We photometrically confirm that the absolute carbon abundance $A$(C) separates CEMP stars into two primary groups, CEMP-no and CEMP-$s$ stars, consistent with previous spectroscopic studies. We also recover CEMP morphological Groups I-III in the Yoon-Beers diagram, as well as the recently proposed Group IV, and show that it is statistically distinct even in photometric data. A cumulative frequency analysis confirms that the CEMP fraction increases toward lower metallicity and that CEMP-no stars dominate in the most metal-poor regime. By comparing frequencies with and without Group IV stars, we assess their relation to CEMP-no and CEMP-$s$ stars, and examine CEMP distributions across different Galactic components. The resulting catalog provides a substantial sample for future spectroscopic follow-up, in particular to constrain the likely origin(s) of the Group IV stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Evolution of the HI Spin Temperature with Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2602.10328]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) emit broad band radio wave radiation that may, in rare cases, encode atomic hydrogen (HI) absorption signals produced as they traverse the interstellar medium of their host galaxies. Combining such signals with high resolution HI emission maps offers a unique opportunity to probe the dynamics of neutral gas at cosmological distances through constraints of the HI excitation temperature $T_{spin}$, which characterises the balance of neutral gas phases and the underlying thermal processes within these galactic environments. While no absorption signal has been recorded in an FRB to date, we demonstrate a proof of concept with the bright (F = 35 Jy ms) and narrow (0.2 ms) FRB 20211127I detected by ASKAP. We find a 3${\sigma}$ upper limit on the integrated optical depth in the pulse-averaged spectrum of 33 km s$^{-1}$, and, based on the HI emission observed in a 3 hr MeerKAT L-band observation, subsequently find a lower limit on $T_{spin}$ of 26 K. While this test case provides little constraining power, we find that narrow, non-repeating FRBs with fluences greater than 20/70/150 Jy ms observed with all dishes with the current MeerKAT/ASKAP/DSA telescopes can probe integrated optical depths below 5 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, we highlight that utilising FAST's incredible sensitivity to stack thousands of bursts from hyperactive repeaters also provides a plausible avenue through which HI absorption, and hence $T_{spin}$, can be measured. Finally, we discuss how HI absorption can address several modern challenges in FRB science, providing a physical anchor for locating bursts within their host galaxies and helping to disentangle the host contribution to dispersion and scattering.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MAGNUS III: Mild evolution of the total density slope in massive early-type galaxies since z$\sim$1 from dynamical modeling of MUSE integral-field stellar kinematics</a><span class="id">[2602.10347]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the total mass density slope evolution in massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) over the last 6.5 billion years ($0 &lt; z &lt; 0.75$). We perform a detailed dynamical analysis of approximately 200 ETGs spanning the redshift range $0.24 &lt; z &lt; 0.75$, utilizing spatially resolved stellar kinematics derived from high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) MUSE-DEEP spectroscopy and surface brightness models from high-resolution HST imaging. We constrain mass distributions using the Jeans Anisotropic Modeling (JAM) technique coupled with Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) method. To rigorously constrain evolutionary trends, we combine this intermediate-redshift dataset with a local ETG sample ($z \sim 0.05$) from the MaNGA survey. We adopt dynamical constraints for the local sample derived using an identical homogeneous methodology, ensuring a strictly consistent comparison. We found that the total density profiles of the intermediate-redshift ETG sample are approximately isothermal and exhibit a median mass-weighted total density slope, $&lt;\gamma_{\rm T}&gt;=2.19 \pm 0.01$ at $&lt;z&gt;=0.44$, which is shallower than the local baseline of $&lt;\gamma_{\rm T}&gt; = 2.26 \pm 0.01$ at $&lt;z&gt;=0.04$. This structural shift corresponds to a redshift gradient of $\mathrm{d} \gamma_{\rm T}/\mathrm{d} z \approx -0.20 \pm 0.03$, detected at $\sim$5-$\sigma$ significance. We demonstrate that this trend is robust against model assumptions and persists even when restricting the analysis to high-velocity dispersion systems ($\sigma_e &gt; 150$ km/s). Our findings are consistent with previous lensing-based studies and in tension with cosmological simulations. The observed steepening suggests that dissipative processes, such as gas-rich accretion and mergers, must play a non-negligible role in the late-stage assembly of massive ETGs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic-ray electron propagation in NGC 3044 from radio continuum observations</a><span class="id">[2602.10574]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Star-forming edge-on galaxies often exhibit extended halo radiation in multiple bands, providing ideal laboratories for studying the transfer of matter from the disk to the halo. We investigate the transport of cosmic-ray electrons (CREs) and the associated galactic wind, and assess their impact on the surrounding medium in NGC 3044. We obtained the NGC 3044 total intensity image at 943 MHz from the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) observations with a resolution of 16 arcsec and an rms noise of 20 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The sensitivity is higher than the previous observations at similar frequencies. We find that the ASKAP intensity profiles perpendicular to the disk can be fit with two exponential components. The scale heights of the thin and thick disks are $0.43 \pm 0.13$ kpc and $1.91 \pm 0.26$ kpc, respectively. By jointly fitting total intensity and spectral index profiles with one-dimensional advection and diffusion models, we find that CREs are advected outward from the disk with the velocity increasing with height in a power law. Beyond $\sim3$ kpc, the velocity exceeds the escape speed of $\sim400$ km s$^{-1}$, indicating a strong wind. We further identify a possible superbubble of radius $\sim3$ kpc filled with soft X-ray emitting hot gas and surrounded by an HI shell and a bright H$\alpha$ rim. These results demonstrate that radio continuum observations provide a powerful probe of cosmic-ray-driven winds in normal star-forming spiral galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST spectra are consistent with the edge-on star-forming galaxy scenario for the &quot;runaway supermassive black hole&quot;</a><span class="id">[2602.10682]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The linear structure reported by van Dokkum et al. (2023) has been proposed as either a massive stellar wake produced by a runaway supermassive black hole (SMBH) or a bulgeless edge-on galaxy. New JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations target the tip of the structure, where a SMBH would produce a bow shock, whereas a normal galaxy would host an HII region. Using standard BPT diagrams ([OIII]5007/Hb vs [NII]6583/Ha and [OIII]5007/Hb vs [OII]6716,6731/Ha), we find that the line ratios at the tip fall on the locus of low-metallicity low-extinction HII regions. This region does not overlap with loci typical of shocks in merging galaxies. Thus, these results are consistent with the interpretation that the linear structure is a star-forming galaxy, with the bright knot representing one of its HII regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The metal-poor tail of the APOGEE survey I.

However, the spectra of metal-poor stars can be difficult to analyse because of the relative lack of available lines, which can also lead to misclassification. We aim to identify the stars observed by the APOGEE survey that are below the metallicity limit of APOGEE's analysis. For the highest confidence candidates, we classify the orbital properties of the stars to investigate whether their orbital distribution matches what we would expect for stars that are this metal poor and to select especially interesting targets for spectroscopic follow-up purposes. We examined the properties derived by APOGEE for metal-poor stars from the literature to find signatures of stars with a metallicity below the range of the grid used for spectral analysis. The calibrated APOGEE stellar parameters provide a clear signature of the most metal-poor stars in the survey, indicated by null values for their metallicities while having effective temperatures and surface gravities determined by the pipeline. From comparison with the literature, we find that, within a temperature range of 3700 - 6700 K and above a threshold of S/N &gt; 30, the vast majority of APOGEE stars without calibrated metallicities are very metal poor. The radial velocities provided by APOGEE, Gaia DR3 positions and astrometry along with spectrophotometric distances derived in this work allowed for the computation of their orbits. In this work, we select 289 very metal-poor red giant stars (likely below = -2.5) from the APOGEE results. Our sample contains 16 very metal-poor member candidates of the Magellanic Clouds, 14 very metal-poor stars with orbits confined to the inner Galaxy, and 13 inner Galaxy halo interlopers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10883" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The metal-poor tail of the APOGEE survey II. Spectral analysis of Mg and Si in very metal-poor APOGEE spectra</a><span class="id">[2602.10883]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>H-band spectra contain very limited spectral information for stars at the most metal-poor tail ( Fe/H &lt; -2.5) because the available Fe lines in FGK stars in this wavelength range are weak. The first paper in this series successfully identified a sample of 327 very metal-poor stars (with [Fe/H] &lt; -2) from the APOGEE database, 289 of which are on the red giant branch. The spectra of these stars were not properly analysed by the APOGEE main pipeline because they are very metal poor. In this work, we measure metallicities for these stars using the abundances of the elements Mg and Si. We demonstrate that the absorption lines of the elements Mg and Si are of good quality despite the challenging combination of (low) metallicity, wavelength regime, spectral resolution, and signal-to-noise ratios available for these spectra. A specialised pipeline was designed to measure the abundance of Mg and Si in APOGEE spectra and yielded a robust estimate of the overall metallicity. In order to provide reliable measurements, we tested three different sets of assumptions for Mg and Si enhancement. We present Mg and Si abundances as well as overall metallicities for 327 stars, all of which had previously gotten null values from the main APOGEE pipeline for either the calibrated M/H or [Fe/H] . The typical uncertainties for our measurements are 0.2 dex. We found five stars in our sample with unusual [Si/Mg] abundances higher than 0.5, and we connect this signature to globular cluster stars, and this might be related to specific supernova events. Our data suggest a concentration of high [Si/Mg] stars in the Sextans dwarf galaxy. Other dwarf galaxies are found to agree well with results in the literature. Our derived metallicities range between -3.1 $\leq$ [M/H] $\leq$ -2.25, thereby pushing the metal-poor tail of APOGEE results down by 0.6 dex.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep and Sparse Denoising Benchmarks for Spectral Data Cubes of High-z Galaxies: From Simulations to ALMA observations</a><span class="id">[2602.10893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Beyond cosmic noon, galaxies appear as faint whispers amid noise, yet this epoch is key to understanding massive galaxy assembly. ALMA's sensitivity to cold dust and [C II] emission allows us to probe their interstellar medium, but faint signals make robust denoising essential. We evaluate and benchmark denoising strategies including Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis, sparse unsupervised representations: iterative soft thresholding with 2D-1D wavelets, and supervised deep learning with a 3D U-Net, to identify techniques that suppress noise while preserving flux and morphology across peak SNRs of 2.5-8, applied to (i) synthetic spectral cubes of rotating toy disk galaxies, (ii) synthetic [C II] IFU cubes from FIRE simulations, and (iii) ALMA [C II] observations of CRISTAL galaxies and W2246-0526. Performance is assessed via RMSE, conservation of flux and spectra, noise reduction, and SNR improvement of the central galaxy. For synthetic cubes: PCA and ICA provide marginal improvement; IST reduces noise effectively at moderate SNRs but can suppress emission at low SNRs; and the U-Net outperforms IST, though it can produce quantifiable hallucinations at lower-SNRs. For moderate-SNR observations (ALMA-CRISTAL), U-Net and IST achieve comparable performance, conserving &gt;91% flux and increasing SNR by &gt;6. However, for observations with complex morphologies absent in the training set (W2246), the U-Net underperforms relative to IST, recovering  80% flux, while IST robustly conserves flux and improves SNR by  3, highlighting generalisation challenges and the need for physically-motivated training priors. We conclude that IST is a robust unsupervised denoiser for moderate-SNR data, and a synthetically trained U-Net generalises effectively to real data, dependent on training priors. This framework offers a pathway for transferable denoising for ALMA, VLT/MUSE, and JWST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Massive stars as gravitationally lensed transients – Insights on the high-mass initial mass function</a><span class="id">[2602.10909]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A robust stellar initial mass function (IMF) is crucial in any studies related to star formation.

Recently, a new method for accessing the stellar IMF beyond the local universe has been developed. The observed detection rate of transient lensed stars – individual, massive, thus luminous stars in strongly lensed galaxies that are temporarily detectable upon stellar microlensing – can serve as a probe to break the IMF-star formation history degeneracy in studies utilizing spectral energy distribution fitting, hence providing a window to look at the IMF at a subsample of gravitationally lensed galaxies.

Aided by information from these facilities, next-generation ground-based GW detectors (e.g., Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope) can potentially capture gravitational radiation in the hectohertz band from rapidly spinning neutron star (NS) components in such binaries. These Galactic Center systems are thus anticipated to act as dual-line (i.e., low-frequency inspiral and high-frequency spin) GW sources. However, the formation channels of these systems remain largely unexplored. In this \textit{Letter}, we propose that the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect can enhance the formation of dual-line GW sources in hierarchical triples involving the Galactic supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. We show that ZLK-driven oscillations in the eccentricity and inclination of the inner binary can modulate the GW emission from both the binary inspiral and the individual NS spins. This effect boosts the expected dual-line source count by a factor of $\sim 3$, from rare to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in 4 years, making dual-line observations substantially more probable. Our results demonstrate that the ZLK effect provides an important formation channel for Galactic dual-line GW sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray stellar feedback in low-metallicity starbursts: Insights from the template starburst galaxy ESO 338-IG04 and its halo</a><span class="id">[2602.10979]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The X-ray output of low-metallicity starburst galaxies is a key component of stellar feedback, tracing the processes responsible for gas ionization and chemical enrichment. The integrated X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) from high-mass X-ray binaries in star-forming galaxies scales with both the star formation rate (SFR) and host-galaxy metallicity $Z$. Due to the inverse correlation between $L_X/\mathrm{SFR}$ and $Z$, the contribution of X-ray binaries to the ionizing photon budget is enhanced in metal-poor systems and may ionize He II in the surrounding interstellar medium, powering nebular He II $\lambda4686$ emission. The blue compact dwarf galaxy ESO 338-IG04 (ESO 338-4) provides a nearby laboratory for studying stellar feedback in a low-metallicity starburst, combining vigorous recent star formation, low metallicity ($12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})\approx7.9$), and a rich population of massive stellar clusters. We characterize the X-ray emission of ESO 338-4 and its halo using new deep Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. We analyze X-ray spectra, light curves, and images to constrain the nature of its X-ray sources. We identify five ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) and diffuse hot gas surrounding the galaxy. Two ULXs are spatially associated with stellar clusters. The total X-ray luminosity exceeds $10^{41}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. The brightest source, ULX1, shows variability on day timescales and lacks a stellar-cluster counterpart. Photoionization modeling shows that X-ray sources significantly impact the ionizing photon budget; models with ULX1 as the ionizing source predict nebular He II $\lambda4686$ luminosities of $\sim10^{39}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11068" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Most Strong Lensing Deflectors in the AGEL Survey are in Group and Cluster Environments</a><span class="id">[2602.11068]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The environments of deflectors in strong lensing systems affect our ability to test cosmological models and constrain evolutionary properties of galaxies. Here we measure the deflector scale (Einstein mass) and deflector environment (halo mass) of 89 spectroscopically confirmed strong lenses in the ASTRO3D Galaxy Evolution With Lenses (AGEL) survey. We classify deflector scale by measuring $\theta_{\rm{E}}$ to determine the mass enclosed by the Einstein radius, $M(&lt;\theta_{\rm{E}})$. We quantify deflector environment by using photometric redshifts to determine the galaxy surface density to the fifth-nearest neighbor $\Sigma_5(z)$. We find that 47.2% of our deflectors are embedded in cluster environments, whereas only 9.0% have cluster-scale Einstein radii (masses). We measure a weak correlation ($r = 0.38$) between Einstein mass and $\Sigma_5(z)$, suggesting that the assumption of single galaxy-scale deflectors in lens modeling is overly-simplified. We hypothesize that the weak correlation results from galaxy-scale bias in the original AGEL selection and the observational challenge of detecting faint arcs with large Einstein radii. Comparing number densities, $N_{\rm{gal}}$, between AGEL and control fields, we find that AGEL deflectors are in systematically denser environments. Our study provides a method to identify strong lenses as a function of deflector environment and approximate the impact of large-scale environment in lens modeling.

To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable.

However, a critical understanding gap remains between the microscopic generation of these seeds and the macroscopic onset of the dynamo. Current kinetic models, often constrained to electron scales, predict premature saturation via magnetic trapping, leaving the generated fields potentially too weak and small-scale to effectively prime magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes. Here, using high-resolution kinetic simulations with a realistic mass ratio, we reveal the physics of this unexplored ion-kinetic regime. Under generalized continuous shear driving, used to simulate ubiquitous macroscopic flows, we demonstrate that the saturation of electron instabilities is not the endpoint but a precursor to a distinct, ion-dominated evolution. Massive ions, sustaining the velocity shear, trigger a subsequent filamentation instability that accesses the vast ion kinetic energy reservoir. This mechanism amplifies the magnetic energy by orders of magnitude beyond the electron-saturation limit, expanding the field coherence to ion scales. Our results establish ion kinetics as the essential ”missing link” that bridges the divide between microscopic plasma instabilities and macroscopic cosmic dynamos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11050" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine learning exploration of binding energy distributions of H2O at astrochemically relevant dust grain surfaces</a><span class="id">[2602.11050]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binding energies (BEs) of adsorbates on interstellar dust grains critically control adsorption, desorption, diffusion, and surface reactivity, and therefore strongly influence astrochemical models of star- and planet-forming regions. While recent computational studies increasingly report full distributions of BEs rather than single representative values, these distributions are typically derived for either bare grain surfaces or thick water-ice mantles. In this work, we bridge these regimes by systematically investigating the BE distributions of water on partially and fully ice-covered dust grain surfaces. We employ machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) based on graph neural networks to model water adsorption on graphene and on the Mg-terminated (010) surface of forsterite, representing carbonaceous and silicate grains, respectively. The models enable extensive sampling of adsorption sites on water clusters, monolayers, and bilayers generated under both crystalline (thermally processed) and amorphous (low-temperature) growth conditions. At submonolayer coverage, the chemical nature of the underlying grain strongly affects both ice morphology and binding energies, with Mg-O interactions on silicate surfaces producing particularly deep binding sites. From monolayer coverage onward, adsorption on both substrates is dominated by hydrogen bonding within the ice, reducing the influence of the grain material. Across all coverages, amorphous ice structures systematically shift the BE distributions toward stronger binding compared to crystalline ice, introducing highly stable defect and pocket sites. These results demonstrate that BE distributions in the submonolayer to few-layer ice regime are broad and highly surface dependent, and they provide physically motivated input for next-generation astrochemical models incorporating surface heterogeneity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supermassive black hole growth from stellar binary encounters</a><span class="id">[2509.02316]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a central problem in astrophysics, with current observations providing only limited constraints on the underlying mechanisms.

We adopt a framework based on kinematics to predict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density of stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole mass. We then estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of galactic environments. In a data set of 91 galaxies of various types and masses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may be a driver of growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed hypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary star interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced in this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active growth channel for the LMC's black hole.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05403" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">H-alpha as a Tracer of Star Formation in the SPHINX Cosmological Simulations</a><span class="id">[2509.05403]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The H-alpha (Ha) emission line in galaxies is a powerful tracer of their recent star formation activity. With the advent of JWST, we are now able to routinely observe Ha in galaxies at high redshift (z &gt; 3) and thus measure their star formation rates (SFRs). However, using classical SFR(Ha) calibrations to derive the SFRs leads to biased results because high-redshift galaxies are commonly characterized by low metallicities and bursty star formation histories, affecting the conversion factor between the Ha luminosity and the SFR. In this work, we develop a set of new SFR(Ha) calibrations that allow us to predict the SFRs of Ha-emitters at z &gt; 3 with minimal error. We use the SPHINX cosmological simulations to select a sample of star-forming galaxies representative of the Ha-emitter population observed with JWST. We then derive linear corrections to the classical SFR(Ha) calibrations, taking into account variations in the physical properties (e.g., stellar metallicities) among individual galaxies. We obtain two new SFR(Ha) calibrations that, compared to the classical calibrations, reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) in the predicted SFRs by $\Delta$RMSE $\approx$ 0.04 dex dex and $\Delta$RMSE $\approx$ 0.06 dex, respectively. Using the recent JWST NIRCam/grism observations of Ha-emitters at z   6, we show that the new calibrations affect the high-redshift galaxy population statistics: (i) the estimated cosmic star formation rate density decreases by $\Delta\rho$(SFR) $\approx$ 12%, and (ii) the observed slope of the star formation main sequence increases by $\Delta$ $\partial$log SFR / $\partial$log M* = 0.08 $\pm$ 0.02.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Observations of Starbursts: PAHs Closely Trace the Cool Phase of M82's Galactic Wind</a><span class="id">[2510.01314]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar feedback drives multiphase gas outflows from starburst galaxies, but the interpretation of dust emission in these winds remains uncertain. To investigate this, we analyze new JWST mid-infrared images tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 7.7 and 11.3 $\mu$m from the outflow of the prototypical starburst M82 out to $3.2$ kpc. We find that PAH emission shows significant correlations with CO, H$\alpha$, and X-ray emission within the outflow, though the strengths and behaviors of these correlations vary with gas phase and distance from the starburst. PAH emission correlates strongly with cold molecular gas, with PAH–CO scaling relations in the wind nearly identical to those in galaxy disks despite the very different conditions. The H$\alpha$–PAH correlation indicates that H$\alpha$ traces the surfaces of PAH-bearing clouds, consistent with arising from ionized layers produced by shocks. Meanwhile the PAH–X-ray correlation disappears once distance effects are controlled for past 2 kpc, suggesting that PAHs are decoupled from the hot gas and the global correlation merely reflects the large-scale structure of the outflow. The PAH-to-neutral gas ratio remains nearly flat to 2 kpc, with variations following changes in the radiation field. This implies that the product of PAH abundance and dust-to-gas ratio does not change significantly over the inner portion of the outflow. Together, these results demonstrate that PAHs robustly trace the cold phase of M82's wind, surviving well beyond the starburst and providing a powerful, high-resolution proxy for mapping the life cycle of entrained cold material in galactic outflows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In-situ globular clusters in alternative dark matter Milky Way galaxies: a first approach to fuzzy and core-like dark matter theories</a><span class="id">[2510.02130]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a first analysis of the dynamics of in-situ globular clusters (GCs) in Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies embedded in fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos, combining cosmological assembly histories from the TNG50 simulation with dedicated orbital integrations and analytical models.

In a universe dominated by FDM, we identify three distinct regimes for the in-situ GC population depending on the particle mass $m_{22} \equiv m_{\chi}/ 10^{-22}~\mathrm{eV}$. For $m_{22} &lt; 7$, baryons dominate the inner potential, which remains steep and centrally concentrated, confining GC orbits to a narrow region and producing less massive, more compact systems than in CDM. For $m_{22} \sim 7$, GC properties resemble those in CDM, with similar mass and spatial distributions. For $m_{22} &gt; 7$, the dark matter becomes both compact and globally dominant, generating a deeper and more extended gravitational potential that supports a wider range of stable GC orbits, resulting in more massive and spatially extended GC systems. Finally, we extend our framework to make predictions for GC populations in alternative DM models, including warm dark matter and self-interacting dark matter, in both MW-like and dwarf galaxies.

Understanding their formation and evolution requires identifying the rise and fall of the key features that characterize these systems, such as their compactness and ”V”-shaped spectral energy distributions.

We investigate the properties of gas giving rise to O VI emission from the CGM that upcoming missions, such as the Aspera SmallSat, will be able to map in local galaxies. We use the FOGGIE simulations to predict the O VI emission from edge-on galaxies across the redshift range $z=1\rightarrow0$. O VI emission is brightest surrounding small, clumpy structures near the galaxy where the gas density is high. Most of the O VI surface brightness originates from collisionally ionized, $T\sim10^{5.5}$ K, inflowing gas and is not preferentially aligned with the major or minor axis of the galaxy disk. Simulated galaxies with higher halo masses, higher median CGM gas density, and higher star formation rates produce brighter and more widespread O VI emission in their CGM. We show that while O VI emission primarily originates in inflowing gas, turning off outflows in a simulation without star formation feedback eliminates most of the O VI emission. Enrichment from feedback is necessary to mix with the inflowing gas and allow it to glow in O VI. Collectively, our findings point towards a picture where O VI emission traces warm, ionized envelopes of cooler clouds that are accreting onto the galaxy in a metal-enriched galactic fountain. Finally, we show that the detection limit of Aspera is sufficient to detect O VI emission tens of kpc from the galaxy center for $\sim L^\star$ galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REBELS-IFU: Spatially Resolved Ionizing Photon Production Efficiencies of 12 Bright Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization</a><span class="id">[2511.10743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Measuring the ionizing photon production efficiency $\xi_{\mathrm{ion,0}}$ – the ratio of ionizing photon output rate $Q_{\rm H^0}$ to UV continuum luminosity $L_{\rm UV}$ – in galaxies at $z &gt; 6$ is crucial for constraining their contribution to cosmic reionization.

We find global $\log\xi_{\mathrm{ion,0}}$ values ranging from $25.19\pm0.11$ to $25.61\pm0.11$, with a weighted mean of $25.44\pm0.15$, consistent with the canonical value of $\sim25.3$. Using a sample of 25 star-forming clumps within these galaxies, we explore local variations in LyC production efficiency, finding a broader range, from $24.52\pm0.21$ to $26.18\pm0.61$. We identify strong correlations between $\xi_{\mathrm{ion,0}}$ and specific star formation rate, star formation surface density, H$\beta$ equivalent width, and stellar mass. Clumps with the highest $\xi_{\mathrm{ion,0}}$ exhibit $\mathrm{EW}_0(\mathrm{H}\beta) \ge 150$ Angstrom, consistent with young stellar ages. From previous Ly$\alpha$ measurements in three galaxies, we estimate a typical Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction of $f_{\rm esc, Ly\alpha} \sim 2\%$, suggesting similar or lower escape fractions for LyC photons. Combining this with our H$\alpha$ measurements, we infer ionized bubble sizes $\sim 1$ pMpc, aligned with expectations from Ly$\alpha$-detected systems and reionization models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIRI spectrophotometry of GN-z11: Detection and nature of an optical red continuum component</a><span class="id">[2512.02997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new MIRI F560W, F770W and F1000W imaging of GN-z11, extending the previous rest-frame coverage from 0.38 to 0.86$\mu$m. We report significant detections (14$\sigma$) in the F560W and F770W images, and a marginal detection (3.2$\sigma$) in F1000W. Here, we analyse its SED combining new MIRI imaging data with archival NIRSpec/Prism and MRS spectroscopy, and NIRCam imaging. The continuum emission shows a flat energy distribution, in f$_\nu$, up to 0.5$\mu$m, compatible with the presence of a mixed stellar population of young (4$\pm$1 Myr) and mature (63$\pm$23 Myr) stars that also account for the [O III], H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ emission lines. The continuum at rest-frame 0.66$\mu$m shows a 36$\pm$3% flux excess above the predicted flux for a mixed stellar population, pointing to the presence of an additional source contributing at these wavelengths. This excess increases to 91$\pm$28% at rest-frame 0.86$\mu$m, although with a large uncertainty due to the marginal detection in the F1000W filter. We consider that hot dust emission in the dusty torus around a type 2 AGN could be responsible for the observed excess. Alternatively, this excess could be due to hot dust emission or to a photoluminiscence dust process (Extended Red Emission, ERE) under the extreme UV radiation field, as observed in some local metal-poor galaxies and in young compact starbursts. The presence of a type 1 AGN is not supported by the observed SED since high-z QSOs contribute at wavelengths above rest-frame 1$\mu$m, and an additional ad-hoc red source would be required to explain the observed flux excess at 0.66 and 0.86$\mu$m. Additional deep MIRI imaging covering the rest-frame near-IR are needed to confirm the flux detection at 10$\mu$m with higher significance, and to discriminate between the different hot dust emission in the extreme starburst and AGN scenarios with MIRI imaging at longer wavelengths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Galactic Transformation – Understanding the SMC's Structural and Kinematic Disequilibrium</a><span class="id">[2512.06075]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The SMC is in disequilibrium. Gas line-of-sight (LoS) velocity maps show a gradient of $60-100$ km s$^{-1}$, generally interpreted as a rotating gas disk consistent with the Tully-Fisher relation. Yet, the stars don't show rotation. Despite a small on-sky extent ($\sim4$ kpc), the SMC exhibits a large ($\sim10$ kpc) LoS depth, and the stellar photometric center is offset from the HI kinematic center by $\sim$1 kpc. With N-body hydrodynamical simulations, we show that a recent ($\sim$100 Myr ago) SMC-LMC collision (impact parameter $\sim2$ kpc) explains the observed SMC's internal structure and kinematics. The simulated SMC is initialized with rotating stellar and gaseous disks. Post-collision, the SMC's tidal tail accounts for the large LoS depth. The SMC's stellar kinematics become dispersion dominated ($v/\sigma\approx0.2$), with radially outward motions at $R&gt;2$ kpc, and a small ($&lt;10$ km s$^{-1}$) remnant rotation at $R&lt;2$ kpc, consistent with observations. Post-collision gas kinematics are also dominated by radially outward motions, without remnant rotation. Hence, the observed SMC's gas LoS velocity gradient is due to radial motions as opposed to disk rotation. Ram pressure from the LMC's gas disk during the collision imparts $\approx30$ km s$^{-1}$ kick to the SMC's gas, sufficient to destroy gas rotation and offset the SMC's stellar and gas centers. Our work highlights the critical role of group processing through galaxy collisions in driving dIrr to dE/dSph transformation, including the removal of gas. Consequently, frameworks that treat the SMC as a galaxy in transformation are required to effectively use its observational data to constrain interstellar medium and dark matter physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08693" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar masses of optically dark galaxies: uncertainty introduced by the attenuation law and star-formation histories</a><span class="id">[2601.08693]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST observations have suggested that some high-redshift galaxies may be ultra-massive, thereby challenging standard models of early galaxy formation and cosmology. We analyse the stellar masses using different modelling assumptions and with new data of three galaxies (S1, S2 and S3), whose NIRCam/grism redshifts were consistent with $z&gt;5$. These three optically dark galaxies have previously been reported to host exceptionally high stellar masses and star-formation rates, implying extremely high star-formation efficiencies. Recent NIRSpec/IFU observations for S1 indicate a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm spec}=3.2439\pm0.0002$, which is lower than previously reported. Using the Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling tool \texttt{Prospector}, we investigate the impact of key model assumptions on stellar mass estimates, such as the choice of star-formation history (SFH) priors (constant versus rising SFH base for the non-parametric prior), the dust attenuation law, and the treatment of emission line fluxes. Our analysis yields revised stellar masses of $\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \approx 10.36^{+0.47}_{-0.32}, 10.95^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ and $10.31^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$ for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. We find that adopting a rising SFH base prior results in lower inferred stellar masses compared to a constant SFH base prior. We identify a significant degeneracy between the dust attenuation curve slope, the amount of dust attenuation, and stellar mass. Our results highlight various systematics in SED modelling due to SFH priors and dust attenuation that can influence stellar mass estimates of heavily dust obscured sources. Nevertheless, even with these revised stellar mass estimates, two of the three galaxies remain among the most massive and actively star-forming systems at their respective redshifts, implying high star-formation efficiencies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EMU Radio Observations of Barred Spiral Galaxy NGC 5938 (Araish)</a><span class="id">[2602.09658]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present multi-wavelength observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 5938 (Araish) to investigate the origin of its radio emission, specifically the contribution from active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and star formation. Using Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) data, we detect extended radio emission extending outwards to the galactic axis, with a steep non-thermal spectral index ($\alpha = -1.2 \pm 0.2$) indicative of synchrotron radiation from an AGN jet. The jet has a physical extent of $\approx 8.2\,kpc$ (angular length of $64^{\prime\prime}$). Multi-wavelength data from The Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey 2 (DECaPS2), Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) provide further support for this interpretation. The colour-colour diagram presenting WISE infrared observations suggests the presence of dust and young stars that trace the galaxy's disk structure. Our analysis reveals a radio jet, alongside star formation traced by infrared emission, demonstrating the complex interplay of AGN activity and star formation in this well-resolved galaxy. Intriguingly, the spatial relationship reveals the brighter X-ray emission to be largely adjacent to and enveloping the extended radio emission. This suggests that the radio jet, while extending at a significant angle to the galactic disk, is confined by the larger X-ray gas halo, similar to other systems (i.e., ESO 295-IG022, Centaurus A) and may indicate jet collimation and channelling effects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the Nested Structure of the Outflow from the Low Luminosity Protostar IRAS 16253-2429 using JWST and ALMA</a><span class="id">[2602.09837]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the earliest stage of star and planet formation requires detailed observations to address the connection and interplay between the accretion, outflow and disk evolution.

Numerical and observational studies show that solar vortices are intimately connected to key physical processes including magnetic reconnection, atmospheric heating, turbulence, and wave generation. This white paper, prepared for the UK Space Frontiers 2035 call, outline five high-priority scientific questions addressing vortex generation mechanisms, cross-layer coupling, magnetic restructuring, collective wave-guidance structures, and their role in triggering explosive events and modulating the solar wind. Key observations and capabilities required to make significant advancements over the coming decade are identified. The UK solar physics community has established world-leading expertise in vortex dynamics, combining strengths in high-resolution observations, MHD turbulence theory, numerical modelling, and space instrumentation. UK researchers have made foundational contributions to Solar Orbiter, delivered critical systems for DKIST, and maintain active involvement in MUSE and SOLAR-C EUVST missions. Our technical approach centres on developing next-generation instrumentation: a multi-band, space-qualified system employing four tunable Fabry-Pérot Interferometers providing diffraction-limited, high-cadence spectropolarimetric coverage from the deep photosphere to the low corona. This capability will be validated through a staged mission architecture beginning with balloon-borne demonstrators. Continuing this effort over the coming decade is vital to maintain UK leadership in this field and achieve the goals of roadmap for solar system research.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10172" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmo3DFlow: Wavelet Flow Matching for Spatial-to-Spectral Compression in Reconstructing the Early Universe</a><span class="id">[2602.10172]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reconstructing the early Universe from the evolved present-day Universe is a challenging and computationally demanding problem in modern astrophysics. We devise a novel generative framework, Cosmo3DFlow, designed to address dimensionality and sparsity, the critical bottlenecks inherent in current state-of-the-art methods for cosmological inference. By integrating 3D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with flow matching, we effectively represent high-dimensional cosmological structures. The Wavelet Transform addresses the “void problem” by translating spatial emptiness into spectral sparsity. It decouples high-frequency details from low-frequency structures through spatial compression, and wavelet-space velocity fields facilitate stable ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers with large step sizes. Using large-scale cosmological $N$-body simulations, at $128^3$ resolution, we achieve up to $50\times$ faster sampling than diffusion models, combining a $10\times$ reduction in integration steps with lower per-step computational cost from wavelet compression. Our results enable initial conditions to be sampled in seconds, compared to minutes for previous methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why do we do astrophysics?</a><span class="id">[2602.10181]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>At time of writing, large language models (LLMs) are beginning to obtain the ability to design, execute, write up, and referee scientific projects on the data-science side of astrophysics.

Aims: We present a fast, unsupervised methodology to reduce stellar contamination and instrument-specific noise in exoplanet transmission spectra using denoising autoencoders, improving the reliability of retrieved atmospheric parameters. Methods: We design and train denoising autoencoder architectures on large synthetic datasets of terrestrial (TRAPPIST-1e analogues) and sub-Neptune (K2-18b analogues) planets. Reconstruction quality is evaluated with the $\chi^2$ statistic over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, and atmospheric retrieval experiments on contaminated spectra are used to compare against standard correction approaches in accuracy and computational cost. Results: The autoencoders reconstruct uncontaminated spectra while preserving key molecular features, even at low S/N. In retrieval tests, pre-processing with denoising autoencoders reduces bias in inferred abundances relative to uncorrected baselines and matches the accuracy of simultaneous stellar-contamination fitting while reducing computational time by a factor of three to six. Conclusions: Denoising autoencoders provide an efficient alternative to conventional correction strategies and are promising components of future atmospheric characterization pipelines for both rocky and gaseous exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pollux test bench: from NUV to FUV polarimetric measurements</a><span class="id">[2602.10901]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pollux is a high-resolution spectropolarimeter proposed by an European consortium for HWO. The current design of Pollux features four spectropolarimetric channels, three of which are in the UV range. For the near-UV (NUV) [236-472 nm] and mid-UV (MUV) [118-236 nm] channels, the polarimeters consist of waveplates and prisms made of MgF2, a birefringent material. However, no such birefringent material can be used for the far-UV (FUV) channel [100-123 nm]. Therefore, the polarimeter for this FUV channel is composed solely of mirrors in an innovative assembly.

The prevailing explanation is that micrometer-sized dust particles released from the beam screen produce beam losses through interactions with the protons. However, the release mechanism of these particles remains unknown. We propose that roughly $(1-10)$% of UFOs may be caused by axion quark nuggets (AQNs), macroscopic dark matter (DM) candidates with masses of order $(5-1000)\,$g. The AQN model naturally relates the dark- and visible-matter abundances ($\Omega_\mathrm{DM}\sim\Omega_\mathrm{visible}$) and provides a mechanism for generating the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry, with DM composed of both matter and antimatter AQNs. When passing underground within approximately 100km of the LHC, an antimatter AQN generates acoustic waves strong enough to trigger multiple UFO events within $2\,$s. If three correlated UFOs (placed at different locations along the LHC ring) are detected, the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed 5 across the entire allowed AQN mass range for a measurement time of about 360 hours. Practically, the LHC can serve as a large broadband acoustic detector for AQNs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photons x Force: Differentiable Radiation Pressure Modeling</a><span class="id">[2602.10712]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a system to optimize parametric designs subject to radiation pressure, \ie the effect of light on the motion of objects.

Despite its importance, the high computational cost of high-fidelity radiation pressure modeling has limited its use in large-scale spacecraft design, optimization, and space situational awareness applications. We enable this by offering three innovations in the simulation, in representation and in optimization: First, a practical computer graphics-inspired Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation of radiation pressure. The simulation is highly parallel, uses importance sampling and next-event estimation to reduce variance and allows simulating an entire family of designs instead of a single spacecraft as in previous work. Second, we introduce neural networks as a representation of forces from design parameters. This neural proxy model, learned from simulations, is inherently differentiable and can query forces orders of magnitude faster than a full MC simulation. Third, and finally, we demonstrate optimizing inverse radiation pressure designs, such as finding geometry, material or operation parameters that minimizes travel time, maximizes proximity given a desired end-point, minimize thruster fuel, trains mission control policies or allocated compute budget in extraterrestrial compute.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ten-dimensional neural network emulator for the nonlinear matter power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2507.07177]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present GokuNEmu, a ten-dimensional neural network emulator for the nonlinear matter power spectrum, designed to support next-generation cosmological analyses.

We observe a reduction in the mean error by more than a factor of five and in the worst-case error by approximately a factor of eight in leave-one-out cross-validation, relative to previous work.

Neutron stars accreting mass at the highest rates are the most promising targets for a search for CWs, because a strong emission of gravitational waves is required to balance the torque exerted by mass accretion onto the neutron star. Detecting coherent pulsations in the electromagnetic emission maximizes the search sensitivity, but has so far not been successful for most of the brightest accreting neutron stars. Here, we present the first search for pulsations in the optical band from the brightest accreting neutron star known, Sco X-1. To this end, we tailored semi-coherent search strategies to data obtained over four years, for a total of $\sim$$56$ ks, by the SiFAP2 fast photometer mounted at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). These searches are especially suited to analysing long observations of systems for which only limited knowledge on the orbital parameters is available, and involve joining coherent analyses on shorter segments without connecting the spin phase between them. The large count rates afforded by an optical telescope and the efficiency of the search strategy employed allowed us to set an upper limit of $9 \times 10^{-5}$ to the pulsed amplitude, which is lower by a factor of four with respect to previous searches in the X-ray band. We also show that the application of semi-coherent searches to SiFAP2 observations of the first detected optical millisecond pulsar, PSR J1023+0038, could have preceded its detection in the radio band. These results highlight the role played by high-time-resolution optical observations in performing deep searches of quickly rotating pulsars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HyperAIRI: a plug-and-play algorithm for precise hyperspectral image reconstruction in radio interferometry</a><span class="id">[2510.15198]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The next-generation radio-interferometric (RI) telescopes require imaging algorithms capable of forming high-resolution high-dynamic-range images from large data volumes spanning wide frequency bands. Recently, AIRI, a plug-and-play (PnP) approach taking the forward-backward algorithmic structure (FB), has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in monochromatic RI imaging by alternating a data-fidelity step with a regularization step via learned denoisers. In this work, we introduce HyperAIRI, its hyperspectral extension, underpinned by learned hyperspectral denoisers enforcing a power-law spectral model. For each spectral channel, the HyperAIRI denoiser takes as input its current image estimate, alongside estimates of its two immediate neighboring channels and the spectral index map, and provides as output its associated denoised image. To ensure convergence of HyperAIRI, the denoisers are trained with a Jacobian regularization enforcing non-expansiveness. To accommodate varying dynamic ranges, we assemble a shelf of pre-trained denoisers, each tailored to a specific dynamic range. At each HyperAIRI iteration, the spectral channels of the target image cube are updated in parallel using dynamic-range-matched denoisers from the pre-trained shelf. The denoisers are also endowed with a spatial image faceting functionality, enabling scalability to varied image sizes. Additionally, we formally introduce Hyper-uSARA, a variant of the optimization-based algorithm HyperSARA, promoting joint sparsity across spectral channels via the $\ell_{2,1}$-norm, also adopting FB. We evaluate HyperAIRI's performance on simulated and real observations. We showcase its superior performance compared to its optimization-based counterpart Hyper-uSARA, CLEAN's hyperspectral variant in WSClean, and the monochromatic imaging algorithms AIRI and uSARA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulation-based inference with neural posterior estimation applied to X-ray spectral fitting – III Deriving exact posteriors with dimension reduction and importance sampling</a><span class="id">[2512.16709]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Simulation-based inference (SBI) with neural posterior estimation (NPE) provides rapid X-ray spectral fitting in both Gaussian and Poisson regimes by learning approximate parameter posteriors from simulations. We investigate auto-encoders for compressing high-resolution X-ray spectra, motivated by newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU), and use likelihood-based importance sampling to refine NPE outputs. Our auto-encoder maps spectra to a low-dimensional latent space and is trained with a custom loss equal to the Cash statistic (C-stat) between simulated and reconstructed spectra. A neural density estimator is then trained on the latent representations. Both models are trained in multiple rounds: at each round, new simulations are drawn from a truncated proposal concentrated around the observation, improving efficiency as the proposal contracts. After NPE convergence, we apply likelihood-based importance sampling to correct the learned posterior. To assess information retention, we train a diagnostic network that predicts the original spectral parameters from the latent space, and we also train a network to learn the likelihood directly to accelerate importance sampling. On X-IFU-like simulations, the auto-encoder and multi-round NPE outperforms PCA and hand-crafted spectral summaries in accuracy and robustness. After importance sampling, the resulting posteriors are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained with nested sampling. On a standard laptop, the full pipeline (simulation, compression, inference, correction) delivers 10x speedups. We further demonstrate the approach on XRISM/Resolve and on lower-resolution NICER and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data, confirming applicability across instruments and resolutions. Overall, NPE on compressed spectra paired with likelihood-based importance sampling offers an exact yet efficient alternative for Bayesian X-ray spectral fitting.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Implementation to Identify the Properties of Multiple Population of Gravitational Wave Sources</a><span class="id">[2509.13638]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rapidly increasing sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is enabling the detection of a growing number of compact binary mergers. These events are crucial for understanding the population properties of compact binaries. However, many previous studies rely on computationally expensive inference frameworks, limiting their scalability. In this work, we present GWKokab, a JAX-based framework that enables modular model building with independent rate for each subpopulation such as BBH, BNS, and NSBH binaries. It provides accelerated inference using the normalizing flow based sampler called flowMC and is also compatible with NumPyro samplers. To validate our framework, we generated two synthetic populations, one comprising spinning eccentric binaries and the other circular binaries using a multi-source model. We then recovered their injected parameters at significantly reduced computational cost and demonstrated that eccentricity distribution can be recovered even in spinning eccentric populations. We also reproduced results from two prior studies: one on non-spinning eccentric populations, and another on the BBH mass distribution using the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4). We anticipate that GWKokab will not only reduce computational costs but also enable more detailed subpopulation analyses such as their mass, spin, eccentricity, and redshift distributions in gravitational wave events, offering deeper insights into compact binary formation and evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Multi-Constellation Observations of Navigation Satellite Signals in the Lunar Domain by Post-Processing L1/L5 IQ Snapshots</a><span class="id">[2601.06081]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to increase spacecraft autonomy for orbit determination has gained renewed momentum following the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE), which demonstrated feasible onboard GPS and Galileo signal reception and tracking at lunar distances. This work processes in-phase and quadrature (IQ) snapshots collected by the LuGRE receiver in cis-lunar space and on the lunar surface to assess multi-frequency, multi-constellation signal availability. Signals from additional systems beyond GPS and Galileo, including RNSS and SBAS constellations, are observable and successfully acquired exclusively in the recorded IQ snapshots. These observations provide the first experimental evidence that signals from multiple constellations, including systems not supported by LuGRE realtime operations, are detectable at unprecedented distances from Earth. Useful observables can be extracted from the IQ snapshots, despite minimal sampling rates, 4-bit quantization, and short durations (200 ms-2 s), through a hybrid coherent/non-coherent acquisition stage compensating for code Doppler. These observations are exploited to tune simulation tools and to perform extended simulation campaigns, showing that the inclusion of additional constellations significantly improves availability; for a 26 dB-Hz acquisition threshold, the fraction of epochs with at least four visible satellites increases from 11% to 46% of the total epoch count. These findings indicate that BeiDou, RNSS, and SBAS signals can substantially enhance GNSS-based autonomy for lunar and cislunar missions.</p></div></details></article></body>
