Observed at a redshift of z=5.39 and z=5.11 respectively, and with stellar masses of $\rm 10^{9.6}M_\odot$ and $\rm 10^{9.5}M_\odot$, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1 are two of the most distant quiescent galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to-date, and are by far the least massive ($\sim10\times$ lower mass). Full spectrophotometric modelling reveals that COS-z5-Q1 appears to have quenched more than 300Myr prior to observation ($z\sim 7$) and has a formation redshift of around z$\sim$11, whilst GS-z5-Q1 formed and quenched in a single burst around 150Myr prior to observation ($z\sim6$). GS-z5-Q1 is found to lie near the centre of a known high-z overdensity in GOODS-S, as would be expected by galaxy formation models, while COS-z5-Q1 lies towards the outskirts of an overdense region. This highlights the role that environment could play in accelerating galaxy evolutionary processes and could possibly be linked to the galaxies' quiescent nature. By modelling their stellar populations, we show that these types of low-mass quiescent galaxies could potentially be descendants of the higher-z &quot;mini-quenched&quot; galaxies. The discovery of these two low-mass $z&gt;5$ quiescent galaxies illuminates a previously undiscovered galaxy population and motivates dedicated follow-up surveys to investigate the overall population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Witnessing downsizing in the making: quiescent and breathing galaxies at the dawn of the Universe</a><span class="id">[2509.09764]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>[Shortened for arXiv] We conduct a systematic search for $\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 9.5$ quiescent galaxies at $z &gt; 3$ in six extragalactic deep fields observed with NIRCam, with the goal of extracting their physical and statistical features in a uniform and self-consistent manner. We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional forms of star formation history and the $\chi^2$ probabilities of the solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as &quot;gold&quot;. According to the best-fit models, 79\% of the massive ($\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 10.5$) quiescent galaxies at $3 &lt; z &lt; 5$ stopped forming stars at least 150 Myr before the time of observation, while 89\% of low-mass sources have been quenched for less than 150 Myr. The abundance of low-mass old quiescent systems does not increase significantly with time from $z = 5$ to 3: low-mass objects seem to be experiencing a short episode of quenching followed by rejuvenation (“breathing”), consistent with a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. We also find an abrupt drop in the density of massive quiescent candidates at $z &gt; 5$. We derive estimates for the number density of early passive galaxies up to $z = 10$ and compare them against various models: tensions with data remain in the modeling of the observed bimodality of time passed since quenching as a function of mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spatially Offset Active Galactic Nuclei in the Very Large Array Sky Survey: Tracers of Galaxy Mergers and Wandering Massive Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2509.09768]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The remnants of galaxy mergers may host multiple off-nuclear massive black holes (MBHs), some of which may wander indefinitely within the host galaxy halos. Tracing the population of offset MBHs is essential for understanding how the distribution of MBHs in the Universe evolves through galaxy mergers, the efficiency of binary MBH formation, and the rates at which MBHs are seeded in low-mass satellite galaxies. Offset MBHs can be observationally traced if they are accreting and detectable as spatially offset active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this work, we build the largest uniform sample of spatially offset AGN candidates (328) by matching sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) to galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Based on the radio source surface density, 29+/-3% are unrelated chance projections. The offset AGN occupation fraction is positively correlated with host galaxy stellar mass, consistent with predictions that most offset MBHs will reside in massive halos. However, this trend vanishes, and may reverse, at the lowest stellar masses, potentially reflecting the weaker host galaxy gravitational potentials. The offset AGN occupation fraction shows no significant evolution with orbital radius, and the agreement with predictions suggests a binary MBH formation rate of &lt;0.5 per merger. Finally, for offset MBHs down to masses of 10^5 Solar masses, the occupation fraction is  30-70 times lower than the expected value assuming all accreted satellites host a MBH. This result may suggest a relatively low MBH seeding efficiency.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Stages of Dusty Tori: The First Infrared Spectra from a Highly Multiscale Quasar Simulation</a><span class="id">[2509.09770]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first infrared spectral predictions from a self-consistent simulation of the formation of a quasar in a starburst galaxy, spanning cosmological to innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) scales. The infrared emission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly magnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas tidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the AGN is buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by almost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from the inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses silicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads to prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation structure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent extinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated scattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge substantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the central black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine in later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features. These results suggest that dusty starburst quasars can undergo a buried, IR-bright phase early in their evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09798" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Last Stand Before Rubin: a consolidated sample of strong lensing systems in wide-field surveys</a><span class="id">[2509.09798]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As the Vera Rubin Observatory begins its ten-year survey in 2025, it will probe key observables such as strong lensing (SL) by galaxies and clusters. In preparation for this new era, we assemble an extensive compilation of SL candidate systems from the literature, comprising over 30,000 unique objects that can be used as a watch list of known systems. By cross-matching this sample with photometric and spectroscopic catalogs, we construct two value-added tables containing key parameters for SL analysis, including lens and source redshifts and lens velocity dispersions $\sigma_v$. As a preparation for Rubin, we generate image cutouts for these systems in existing wide-field surveys with subarcsecond seeing, namely CFHTLens, CS82, RCSLens, KiDS, HSC, DES, and DESI Legacy. This sample, dubbed the &quot;Last Stand Before Rubin&quot; (LaStBeRu), has a myriad of applications, from using archival data to selections for follow-up projects and training of machine learning algorithms. As an application, we perform a test of General Relativity using these data, combining the effects of motion of massless particles (through SL modeling) and non-relativistic bodies through $\sigma_v$, which allow one to set constraints on the Post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$. Using the LaStBeRu database, we present an independent test of $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$ (distinct from previous analyses) and, for the first time, we present such a test exclusively with systems identifiable in ground-based images. By combining these data with the previously published samples, we obtain the most stringent constraint on $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$. Our results are consistent with GR at the $\sim$ 1-$\sigma$ level and with the previous results from the literature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The invariance of group occupation across the cosmic web</a><span class="id">[2509.09800]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent efforts to identify secondary variations in the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) have primarily focused on simulations examining the role of large-scale cosmic environments such as superclusters, filaments, and underdense regions or voids. If present, these variations could yield valuable insights into galaxy formation mechanisms, halo assembly processes, and the influence of external factors on cosmic structure. We aim to test whether secondary trends in the HOD driven by the large-scale structure of the Universe are detectable observationally. In particular, we examine whether the HOD depends on distance to key features of the cosmic web by explicitly quantifying these spatial relationships. We also analyze whether HODs vary across different cosmic environments, defined by critical point classifications, and assess the influence of intrinsic galaxy properties such as central galaxy color. We create volume-limited galaxy samples from SDSS-DR18 and use a group catalog to determine halo masses and identify central and satellite membership. Additionally, we employ a DisPerSE catalog to locate critical points such as maxima, minima, and filaments in the cosmic web. We evaluate how the HOD varies with proximity to these features and across five distinct cosmic environments. We further examine trends related to the color of central galaxies and test the robustness of our results with alternative DisPerSE catalogs generated using different smoothing scales and persistence thresholds. Our analysis shows that large-scale environments only weakly influence the HOD. However, second-order dependencies may be revealed through a multivariate approach that combines local and large-scale metrics with intrinsic galaxy properties. Future work with next-generation surveys and advanced modeling may achieve the precision required to detect and characterize these subtle environmental correlations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Improved Fit to the Density Distribution in Supersonic Isothermal Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2509.09811]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The density distribution of supersonic isothermal turbulence plays a critical role in many astrophysical systems. It is commonly approximated by a lognormal distribution with a variance of $\sigma_{s,V}^2 \approx \ln(1 + b^2 M_{\rm V}^2),$ where $s \equiv \ln \rho/\rho_0,$ $M_{\rm V}$ is the rms volume-weighted Mach number, and $b$ is a parameter that depends on the driving mechanism, which can be solenoidal (divergence-free), compressive (curl-free), or a mix of the two. However, this neglects the correlation time of driving ($\tau_{\rm a}$), which plays a key role whenever compressive driving is significant. Here we conduct turbulence simulations spanning a wide range of Mach numbers, $1\lesssim M_{\rm V}\lesssim 10$, driving mechanisms, and $\tau_{\rm a}$ values. In the compressive case, we find that $\sigma_{s,V}^2$ scales approximately linearly with $M_{\rm V},$ and its dependence on $\tau_{\rm a}$ is $\sigma_{s,V}^2 \approx M_{\rm V} [1 + \frac{2}{3}(\lambda_{\rm a} + 1)\Theta(\lambda_{\rm a} + 1)]$, where $\lambda_{\rm a} \equiv \ln(\tau_{\rm a}/\tau_{\rm e})$, $\tau_{\rm e}$ is the eddy turnover time, and $\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function. Mixed-driven turbulence shows a weaker dependence on $\tau_{\rm a},$ and for solenoidally-driven turbulence, $\sigma_{s,V}^2 \approx \frac{1}{3}M_{\rm V}$, independent of $\tau_{\rm a}$ and consistent with the standard expression when $M_V \lesssim 10.$ The volume-weighted mean and skewness also show systematic trends with $M_{\rm V}$ and $\tau_{\rm a}$, deviating from lognormal expectations. For the mass-weighted density distribution, we observe significant broadening and skewness in compressively driven cases, especially at large $\tau_{\rm a}/\tau_{\rm e}$. These results provide a refined framework for modeling astrophysical turbulence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimized HDBSCAN clustering for reconstructing the merger history of the Milky Way: applications and limitations</a><span class="id">[2509.09839]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Clustering algorithms can help reconstruct the assembly history of the Milky Way by identifying groups of stars sharing similar properties in a kinematical or chemical abundance space. However, although being promising tools, their efficiency has not yet been fully tested in a realistic cosmological framework. We investigate the effectiveness of the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm in the recovery of the progenitors of Milky Way-type galaxies, using several systems from the Auriga suite of simulations. We develop a methodology aimed at improving the efficiency of the algorithm and avoiding fragmentation: First, we use a 12-dimensional feature space including a range of chemodynamical properties and stellar ages; furthermore, we optimise the algorithm using information from the internal structure of the clusters of accreted stars. We show that our approach yields good results in terms of both purity and completeness of clusters for galaxies with different types of accretion histories. We also evaluate the decrease in efficiency due to contamination by in situ stars. While for accreted-only haloes the algorithm matches well the recovered clusters with the individual progenitors and is able to recover accretion events up to a redshift of accretion $z_{\rm acc}\sim3$, for accreted + in situ haloes it can only identify the more recent accretion events ($z_{\rm acc} &lt; 1$). However, the purity of the identified clusters remains remarkably high even in this case. Our results suggest that HDBSCAN can efficiently identify accreted debris in Milky Way-type galaxies in realistic conditions, however, it requires careful optimization to provide valid results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09883" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PeV particle acceleration and non-thermal emission in the `minimalist' model of the extended jets in W50/SS433</a><span class="id">[2509.09883]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The W50 nebula around microquasar SS 433, powered by supercritical accretion, features two `extended jets' (tens of pc long and a few pc wide) from which polarized X-ray and very high energy radiation above 100 TeV is detected. Here we present a model of very high energy particle acceleration in these extended jets. In the `minimalist' model (discussed in Churazov, Khabibullin, and Bykov, 2024), a collimated outflow aligned with the rotation axis is propagating through a more isotropic wind produced by the accretion disk. The observed extended X-ray jets with bright knots in this model are associated with the formation of strong recollimation MHD shocks after the collision of the collimated outflow with the isotropic wind termination surface. The spectra of electrons and protons up to PeV energies are simulated with a nonlinear Monte Carlo model of diffusive shock acceleration with turbulent magnetic field amplification. The overall efficiency of the jets power transfer to accelerated protons in this model is above 10\% and about 0.5\% for electrons above 50 TeV. The magnetic field amplification by Bell's instability due to the electric current of cosmic rays escaping the accelerator produces highly anisotropic magnetic turbulence in the shock downstream. This results in the polarized synchrotron X-ray emission with the photon electric vector predominantly transverse to the jet direction and the degree of polarization above 20\%. The model is able to reproduce the observed spectra and intensity profiles of non-thermal X-ray and gamma-ray emission, which are both dominated by the leptonic radiation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinematics of the lens host S0 galaxy NGC 1553: role of secular processes</a><span class="id">[2509.09902]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an investigation of the central structure of the S0 galaxy NGC 1553, to understand its origin and the underlying dynamical processes that shape it. The high-resolution integral field spectroscopic data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) reveal a well-ordered rotation pattern, consisting of a rapidly rotating nuclear disc that is somewhat decoupled from the main disc, together with an inner lens; we collectively refer to these structures as the &quot;disc-lens&quot;. The central peak in the velocity dispersion indicates the presence of a classical bulge. The nuclear disc is dynamically colder than the surrounding disc, while the lens is dynamically hotter. The higher-order Gauss-Hermite moments, $h_{3}$ and $h_{4}$, further characterise the stellar kinematics. An anti-correlation between the line-of-sight velocity and skewness ($h_{3}$) is consistent with regular rotation. In contrast, the ring-like enhancement in kurtosis ($h_{4}$) confirms the presence of the nuclear disc component. Unsharp masking of HST images (Erwin et al. 2015) reveals a nuclear bar and faint spiral structures within the central 10 arcsec, supporting the role of secular evolution. The mass-weighted stellar age map shows an old stellar population in the central regions, with high metallicity that suggests the in-situ formation of the disc-lens from disc material. We discuss possible formation scenarios for the disc-lens, including both minor mergers and secular processes, and examine the influence of the Dorado group environment on NGC 1553. Our findings suggest that the disc-lens in NGC 1553 formed during the early stages of the galaxy's evolution. However, its subsequent development has been shaped by internal and external processes. These results provide new insights into the origin and evolution of kinematically distinct substructures in S0 galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A star-by-star correspondence between X-ray activity and rotation in the young open cluster NGC 2516 with eROSITA</a><span class="id">[2509.09996]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The coronal soft X-ray emission of cool stars, especially when taken in combination with their measured rotation periods, offers insights into their levels of magnetic activity and related transitions. We study the X-ray properties of low-mass members of the open cluster NGC 2516 to explicate their detailed dependencies on mass and rotation. We analysed the pointed SRG/eROSITA satellite observations of NGC 2516 obtained during the calibration and performance verification phase of the mission. We found 1561 X-ray sources within the field of view and related 1007 of them to their optical stellar counterparts, including 655 members of NGC 2516 (433 with rotation periods). We combined these detections with auxiliary optical data to facilitate their interpretation. Furthermore, we extracted X-ray spectra for all sources and fit two-component APEC models to them. To aid the analysis, we grouped stars with similar mass and rotational properties together, which allowed us to investigate the influence of rotation on various X-ray properties. The colour-activity diagram of NGC 2516 displays a general increase in the fractional X-ray luminosity with spectral type change from F through G and K to M-type. However, the behaviour of K-type stars, representing the ones that best sample the fast-to-slow rotational transition, is more complex, with both increased and decreased X-ray emission relative to G-type stars for fast and slow rotators, respectively. The rotation-activity diagram is analogous, with an identifiable desaturated group of X-ray emitters that corresponds to stars in the rotational gap between the fast and slow rotator sequences. We prefer to describe the normalised X-ray emission for all cluster stars as declining logarithmically with Rossby number over those using broken power laws. Coronal temperatures appear to be largely independent of mass or rotation.

We present deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 continuum and CO(3–2) observations of 17 QGs at $z\sim0.4$ in the COSMOS field. Using the dust-to-molecular gas mass ratio ($\delta_{\rm DGR}$) as a key diagnostic, we trace post-quenching evolution of the cold interstellar medium. Our study triples the number of QGs with direct $\delta_{\rm DGR}$ estimates, constraining 12 systems with stellar population ages of $\sim$5–10 Gyr. For the first time, we show that $\delta_{\rm DGR}$ in QGs ranges from $\sim8\times$ below to $\sim2.5\times$ above the canonical value of $\delta_{\rm DGR}\sim1/100$. Despite uniformly low molecular gas fractions (median $f_{\rm H_2}=M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\star}\sim4.1\%$), QGs follow diverse evolutionary paths: about half exhibit rapid ($\sim700$ Myr) exponential dust decline with age, while the rest show mild decline over $\gtrsim$2 Gyr, maintaining elevated $\delta_{\rm DGR}\gtrsim1/100$. Our results support simulations predictions of dust and molecular gas evolving independently post-quenching, without a preferred quenching mode. This challenges the use of dust continuum as a $\rm H_2$ tracer, implying that quenching cannot be robustly linked to interstellar medium conditions when relying solely on dust or gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of stochastic star-formation histories and dust on selecting quiescent galaxies with JWST photometry</a><span class="id">[2509.10117]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now allows identifying quiescent galaxies (QGs) out to early epochs, the photometric selection of quiescent galaxy candidates (QGCs) and the derivation of key physical quantities are highly sensitive to the assumed star-formation histories (SFHs). We aim to quantify how the inclusion of JWST/MIRI data and different SFH models impacts the selection and characterisation of QGCs. We test the robustness of the physical properties inferred from the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, such as M*, age, star formation rate (SFR), and AV, and study how they impact the quiescence criteria of the galaxies across cosmic time. We perform SED fitting for  13000 galaxies at z&lt;6 from the CEERS/MIRI fields with up to 20 optical-mid infrared (MIR) broadband coverage. We implement three SFH prescriptions: flexible delayed, NonParametric, and extended Regulator. For each model, we compare results obtained with and without MIRI photometry and dust emission models. We evaluate the impact of these configurations on the number of candidate QGCs, selected based on rest UVJ colours, sSFR and main-sequence offset, and on their key physical properties such as M*, AV, and stellar ages. The number of QGCs selected varies significantly with the choice of SFH from 171 to 224 out of 13000 galaxies, depending on the model. This number increases to 222-327 when MIRI data are used (up to  45% more QGCs). This enhancement is driven by improved constraints on dust attenuation and M*. We find a strong correlation between AV and M*, with massive galaxies (M* 10^11 M\odot) being 1.5-4.2 times more attenuated in magnitude than low-mass systems (M* 10^9 M\odot), depending on SFH. Regardless of the SFH assumption,  13% of QGCs exhibit significant attenuation (AV &gt; 0.5) in support of recent JWST studies challenging the notion that quiescent galaxies are uniformly dust-free.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reionization in HESTIA: Studying reionization in the LG through zoom simulations</a><span class="id">[2509.10133]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While cosmic reionization has been broadly constrained by global observables, the interplay between internal sources (Milky Way, M31, and their satellites) and external ionization fronts remains poorly understood in a realistic Local Group (LG) context. To address this issue, we perform radiative transfer post-processing on the original HESTIA LG constrained simulation. We calibrate our source models using a uniform 1024^3 particle, dark-matter only, HESTIA simulation coupled with a subgrid collapse-fraction model to match the global reionization observables. These source models are then applied to the HESTIA zoom-in simulations, which consist of a 4096^3 particle effective resolution in the zoom region centered on the Milky Way (MW) and M31 haloes, which resolves haloes down to 10^8 solar masses. We find that in all scenarios, reionization within the LG proceeds in an inside-out manner with the progenitors of the MW and M31 having 50 percent of their material ionized by z   9-8.6, significantly earlier than the global midpoint at z   7-7.7, noting that external fronts from large-scale structure play a negligible role, even under the most permissive feedback model. We further show that present-day satellite galaxies exhibit only a weak correlation between their reionization redshift and their present-day radial distance from their host halo, with somewhat tighter trends around M31 than the MW. Finally, we find that satellites which assembled before reionization are systematically more massive today, suggesting that the oldest stellar populations preferentially reside in the most massive subhaloes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cluster Ages to Reconstruct the Milky Way Assembly (CARMA) IV. Chrono-dynamics of seven old star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the peculiar origin of NGC 1841</a><span class="id">[2509.10144]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we report conclusive evidence for an ancient star cluster that has been accreted by the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). By leveraging observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we investigate the chrono-dynamical structure of a sample of seven old star clusters within the LMC in a self-consistent way. The multi-epoch nature of the dataset allowed the determination of high-precision proper motions for the clusters. Employing an isochrone-fitting methodology, we additionally infer from the deep high-resolution HST data homogeneous and robust estimates for their distances, ages and metallicities. Supplementing these data with literature line-of-sight velocities, we investigate the full 3-dimensional dynamics of the clusters within the frame of the LMC. With respect to the other clusters in our sample, NGC 1841 depicts a peculiar case. Its position in the age-metallicity plane, that makes it about 1 Gyr younger than the other metal-poor LMC clusters, but also its dynamical properties with a radial orbit almost perpendicular to the LMC disc plane, clearly advocates for a different origin. We thus conclude that NGC 1841 has likely been accreted by the LMC from a smaller galaxy. The other clusters in our sample show disc-like kinematics, with the case of NGC 2210 being peculiar, based on its inclined orbit. Their coherent age-metallicity relation closely resembles that of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus globular clusters, thus suggesting a similar early evolution for the two dwarf galaxies. We do not find clear-cut chrono-kinematic evidence that NGC 2005 has been accreted by the LMC as suggested by a previous study based on its chemical abundance pattern. Regardless of its nature, its very old age illustrates that peculiar chemical evolutions already emerge at very early times.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards Precision Cosmology With Improved PNLF Distances Using VLT-MUSE. III. Impact of Stellar Populations in Early-Type Galaxy</a><span class="id">[2509.10175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Distance measurements using the planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) rely on the bright-end power-law cut-off magnitude ($M^*$), which is defined by a number of the [OIII]$\lambda5007$-brightest planetary nebulae (PNe). In early-type galaxies (ETGs), the formation of these PNe is enigmatic; the population is typically too old to form the expected $M^*$ PNe from single star evolution. We aim to give a solution to this problem. We selected five ETGs with known MUSE-PNLF distances. The MUSE instrument allows us to calculate the PNLF and consistently investigate the underlying stellar populations. Using stellar population synthesis, we derive the population age, star formation history, metallicity, and alpha abundance. We compare these parameters to the PNLF variables: $M^*$ and luminosity-specific PN number at the top 0.5 mag of the PNLF ($\alpha_{0.5}$). We also compare our results with PNe In Cosmological Simulations (PICS) model applied to Magneticum Pathfinder analogue galaxies. The average mass-weighted ages and metallicities of our observations are typically old ($9 &lt;\mathrm{Age}&lt; 13.5$ Gyr) and rather metal-rich ($-0.4 &lt;\mathrm{[M/H]}&lt; +0.2$). We find $M^*$ to be independent of age and metallicity in these ages and metallicity intervals. We discover a positive correlation between $\alpha_{0.5}$ values and the mass fraction of stellar population ages of 2–10 Gyr, implying that most of the PNe originate from stars with intermediate ages. Similar trends are also found in the PICS analogue galaxies. We show that the presence of at least $\sim 2\%$ of stellar mass younger than 10 Gyr is, in principle, sufficient to form the $M^*$ PNe in ETGs. We also present observing requirements for an ideal PNLF distance determination in ETGs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signatures of dynamical activity in the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters in the FLAMINGO simulations</a><span class="id">[2509.10230]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In anticipation of upcoming cosmological surveys, we use the large volume Flamingo hydrodynamical simulations to look for signatures of dynamical activity, focusing on the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters out to redshift $z=1$. To determine the dynamical state of each object, we consider the halo mass accretion rate, $\Gamma$, as well as three observational proxies: stellar mass gap, $\Mstar$; X-ray concentration, $c_\mathrm{x}$, and X-ray centroid shift, $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$. In general, the median values of these indicators vary in accordance with an increase in dynamical activity with both mass and redshift. We find $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$ to be the most reliable proxy, while $c_\mathrm{x}$ and $\Mstar$ are more sensitive to resolution and feedback model details. Looking at the profiles, the correlation between dark matter density and $\Gamma$ has a characteristic radial dependence, being negatively (positively) correlated at small (large) radii. This trend is insensitive to both halo mass and redshift. Similar behaviour is also seen for the hot gas densities in low redshift clusters, particularly when using $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$, but the correlations become weaker in groups, at higher redshift and when stronger feedback is employed. We also find the intrinsic scatter in the gas density profiles to decrease with redshift, particularly in groups, contrary to what is seen for the dark matter. Interestingly, the radius of minimum gas density scatter increases with feedback strength, suggesting that this property could be a useful feedback diagnostic in future observational studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 21-cm signature of X-ray heated halos around galaxies during cosmic dawn</a><span class="id">[2509.10255]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-rays emitted by high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and supernovae-driven winds in the first galaxies during Cosmic Dawn are expected to warm the intergalactic medium prior to its reionization. While most of the heating will be uniform on measurable scales, exceptionally bright sources will produce a warm ring around them with a distinctive 21-cm signature. The detection of such systems would confirm X-rays are a source of IGM heating during Cosmic Dawn and provide a test of models predicting higher X-ray luminosities per star formation rate compared with present-day galaxies. We illustrate the effect for a star-forming galaxy in a $10^{11}\, M_\odot$ halo at $z=12$, treating the photoionizing radiation and X-rays using a novel fully time-dependent 3D ray-tracing radiative transfer code. We consider a range in possible spectra for the HMXBs and star formation efficiencies, as well as the possible effect of an extended halo around the galaxy. We find detection of the signal would require integration times of a few thousand hours using SKA1-Low except for a bright galaxy like a starburst, but only a thousand hours for the expected noise levels of SKA2-Low. Depending on the surrounding gas density profile, the 21-cm signature of X-ray heating may still require an exceptionally high star formation rate, either intrinsic to the source or provided by other systems clustered near it, to avoid dominance of the signal by absorption from the surrounding gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10256" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UV-irradiated outflows from low-mass protostars in Ophiuchus with JWST/MIRI</a><span class="id">[2509.10256]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The main accretion phase of protostars is characterized by the ejection of material in the form of jets/outflows. External UV irradiation can potentially have a significant impact on the excitation conditions within these outflows. High-resolution observations in the mid-infrared allow us to investigate the details of those energetic processes through the emission of shock-excited H$_2$ . Our aim is to spatially resolve H$_2$ and ionic/atomic emission within the outflows of low-mass protostars, and investigate its origin in connection to shocks influenced by external ultraviolet irradiation. We analyze spectral maps of 5 Class I protostars in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). Four out of five protostars show strong H$_2$, [\ion{Ne}{II}], and [\ion{Fe}{II}] emission associated with outflows/jets. Pure rotational H$_2$ transitions from S(1) to S(8) are found and show two distinct temperature components on Boltzmann diagrams with rotational temperatures of $\sim$500-600 K and $\sim$1000-3000 K respectively. Both $C$-type shocks propagating at high pre-shock densities (n$_\text{H} \ge$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$) and $J$-type shocks at low pre-shock densities (n$_\text{H} \le$10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$) reproduce the observed line ratios. However, only $C$-type shocks produce sufficiently high column densities of H$_2$, whereas predictions from a single $J$-type shock reproduce the observed rotational temperatures of the gas better. A combination of various types of shocks could play a role in protostellar outflows as long as UV irradiation is included in the models. The origin of this radiation is likely internal, since no significant differences in the excitation conditions of outflows are seen at various locations in the cloud.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar populations of quasar host galaxies with MFICA decomposition</a><span class="id">[2509.10271]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy evolution theories require co-evolution between accreting supermassive black holes (SMBH) and galaxies to explain many properties of the local galaxy population, yet observational evidence for the mechanisms driving this co-evolution is lacking. The recent star-formation histories of the host galaxies of accreting SMBHs (Active Galactic Nuclei, AGNs) can help constrain the processes that feed SMBHs and halt star formation in galaxies, but are difficult to obtain for the most luminous AGNs (quasars). We introduce Mean-Field Independent Component Analysis (MFICA) to decompose quasar spectra and obtain recent star formation histories of their host galaxies. Applying MFICA to quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 Quasar Catalogue in the redshift range $0.16 \leq z \leq 0.76$, we find that 53 per cent of quasar host galaxies are star-forming, 17 per cent lie in the green-valley, while only 5 per cent are quiescent. This contrasts with 14, 11, and 74 per cent of a mass-matched control sample that are star-forming, green-valley, and quiescent, respectively. We find that $\sim25$ per cent of quasars are hosted by post-starburst galaxies, an excess of $28\pm1$ compared to our control sample. While the heterogeneity of recent star formation histories implies multiple SMBH feeding mechanisms, the excess of post-starburst host galaxies demonstrates the link between accreting SMBHs and a recent starburst followed by rapid quenching. Given that massive post-starburst galaxies are predominantly caused by gas-rich major mergers, our results indicate that $30-50$ per cent of quasars originate from merger-induced starbursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is cosmic dust porous?</a><span class="id">[2509.10292]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There is a long-standing discussion in the astrophysical/astrochemical community as to the structure and morphology of dust grains in various astrophysical environments (e.g., interstellar clouds, protostellar envelopes, protoplanetary and debris disks, and the atmospheres of exoplanets). Typical grain models assume a compact dust core which becomes covered in a thick ice mantle in cold dense environments. In contrast, less compact cores are likely to exhibit porosity, leading to a pronounced increase in surface area with concomitant much thinner ice films and higher accessibility to the bare grain surface. Several laboratory experimental and theoretical studies have shown that this type of dust structure can have a marked effect on several physico-chemical processes, including adsorption, desorption, mobility, and reactivity of chemical species. Porous grains are thus thought to likely play a particularly important and wide-ranging astrochemical role. Herein, we clarify what is meant by porosity in relation to grains and grain agglomerates, assess the likely astrochemical effects of porosity and ask whether a fractal/porous structural/morphological description of dust grains is appropriate from an astronomical perspective. We provide evidence for high porosity from laboratory experiments and computational simulations of grains and their growth in various astrophysical environments. Finally, we assess the observational constraints and perspectives on cosmic dust porosity. Overall, our paper discusses the effects of including porosity in dust models and the need to use such models for future astrophysical, astrochemical and astrobiological studies involving surface or solid-state processes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10387" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The large-scale kinematics of young stars in the Milky Way disc: first results from SDSS-V</a><span class="id">[2509.10387]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a first large-scale kinematic map of $\sim$50,000 young OB stars ($T_{\rm eff} \geq 10,000$ K), based on BOSS spectroscopy from the Milky Way Mapper OB program in the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V). Using photogeometric distances, line-of-sight velocities and Gaia DR3 proper motions, we map 3D Galactocentric velocities across the Galactic plane to $\sim$5 kpc from the Sun, with a focus on radial motions ($v_R$). Our results reveal mean radial motion with amplitudes of $\pm 30$ km/s that are coherent on kiloparsec scales, alternating between inward and outward motions. These $\bar{v}_R$ amplitudes are considerably higher than those observed for older, red giant populations. These kinematic patterns show only a weak correlation with spiral arm over-densities. Age estimates, derived from MIST isochrones, indicate that 85% of the sample is younger than $\sim300$ Myr and that the youngest stars ($\le 30$ Myr) align well with density enhancements. The age-dependent $\bar{v}_R$ in Auriga makes it plausible that younger stars exhibits different velocity variations than older giants. The origin of the radial velocity features remains uncertain, and may result from a combination of factors, including spiral arm dynamics, the Galactic bar, resonant interactions, or phase mixing following a perturbation. The present analysis is based on approximately one-third of the full target sample. The completed survey will enable a more comprehensive investigation of these features and a detailed dynamical interpretation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10435" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistic of stars with poor astrometric solutions of Gaia DR3 in open star clusters</a><span class="id">[2509.10435]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We performed counts of stars with poor astrometric solutions of Gaia DR3 in the regions of open star clusters: NGC 188, NGC 1039, NGC 2287, NGC 2301, NGC 2360, NGC 2420, NGC 2527, NGC 2548, NGC 2682 (M 67), NGC 3114, NGC 3766, NGC 5460, NGC 6649.

We take stars with two-parameter solutions, with the parameter RUWE&gt;1.4, as well as with large relative parallax errors that fall within the Hess diagram region for probable cluster members. The radii of clusters based on stars with poor astrometric solutions and the number of such possible cluster members were estimated. The number of stars with poor astrometric solutions relative to the number of stars from the Hunt &amp; Reffert sample N_bad/N varies very widely with a median average of approximately 30%. This means that when one selects probable cluster members based on precise astrometric data from Gaia DR3, an average of about 23% of cluster members may be lost. Among the lost stars there may be a significant number of unresolved binary and multiple systems.

With Euclid, clusters are resolved into individual stars across the main bodies and haloes of both galaxies. Visual inspection of $I_E$ images uncovers 30 new cluster candidates in NGC 6822 and 16 in IC 10, from compact to extended clusters. We re-evaluate literature candidates, producing combined catalogues of 52 (NGC 6822) and 71 (IC 10) clusters with confidence-based classifications. We present homogeneous photometry in $I_E$, $Y_E$, $J_E$, $H_E$, and archival UBVRI data, alongside size measurements and properties from BAGPIPES SED fitting. Synthetic cluster injection shows our sample is $\sim 50$% complete to $M \lesssim 10^3 M_\odot$ for ages $\lesssim 100$ Myr, and to $M \lesssim 3\times10^4 M_\odot$ for $\sim 10$ Gyr.

Both dwarfs host several old massive ($\gtrsim 10^5 M_\odot$) clusters, including an exceptional $1.3 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ cluster in NGC 6822's outskirts. In NGC 6822, we identify a previously undetected, old, extended cluster ($R_h = 12.4 \pm 0.11$ pc). Using well-defined criteria, we identify 11 candidate GCs in NGC 6822 and eight in IC 10.

We confront the uncertain landscape by jointly analyzing new measurements of the gas distribution around groups and clusters – DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect profiles and eROSITA X-ray gas masses – with mean halo masses characterized by galaxy-galaxy lensing. Across a wide range of halo masses ($M_{500}=10^{13-14}M_\odot$) and redshifts ($0&lt;z&lt;1$), we find evidence of more efficient gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$ than predicted by most state-of-the-art simulations. A like-with-like comparison reveals all kSZ and X-ray observations are inconsistent with the fiducial 1 Gpc$^{3}$ hydrodynamical FLAMINGO simulation, which was calibrated to reproduce pre-eROSITA X-ray gas fractions: eROSITA X-ray gas fractions are $2\times$ lower than the simulation, and the kSZ measurements are combined $&gt;8 \sigma$ discrepant. The FLAMINGO simulation variant with the most gas expulsion, and therefore the most suppression of the matter power spectrum relative to a dark matter only simulation, provides a good description of how much gas is expelled and how far it extends; the enhanced gas depletion is achieved by more powerful but less frequent AGN outbursts. Joint kSZ, X-ray, and lensing measurements form a consistent picture of gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$, implying a more suppressed matter power spectrum than predicted by most recent simulations. Complementary observables and next-generation simulations are critical to understanding the physical mechanism behind this extreme gas expulsion and mapping its impact on the large-scale matter distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02306" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bridging the micro-Hz gravitational wave gap via Doppler tracking with the Uranus Orbiter and Probe Mission: Massive black hole binaries, early universe signals and ultra-light dark matter</a><span class="id">[2406.02306]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the recent announcement by NASA's \textit{Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032}, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated.

We develop a methodology to stack tracking data and account for time varying detector geometry, thereby constructing the sensitivity of the mission to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-4}$ Hz. We find that the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories.

The magnitude of this scatter as a function of galaxy mass and redshift contains valuable information about the origin of SMBHs and the physical nature of their co-evolution with galaxies. In this work, we highlight this connection by studying the scatter in the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_\star$ relation for massive galaxies in the Illustris, TNG100, and EAGLE cosmological simulations. We find that TNG100 shows significantly lower scatter than Illustris and EAGLE, reflecting different BH feedback models. Using numerical experiments, we separate different contributions to the scatter, including an intrinsic component. At $z=0$, Illustris and EAGLE show $\sim 0.3$ dex intrinsic scatter dominated by BH accretion, while the smaller scatter in TNG100 is dominated by hierarchical merging, implying more tightly quenched massive galaxies. BH seed mass variations can add scatter, though their impact at $z=0$ depends on the feedback model. Without AGN feedback the scatter is much larger for low-mass galaxies ($\gtrsim 0.5$ dex for $\log M_\star &lt; 10^{10.5},\mathrm{M_\odot}$ at $z=0-3$), underscoring the crucial role of feedback in SMBH-galaxy co-evolution. In contrast, hierarchical merging of quenched systems is the main factor reducing scatter for massive galaxies.

We present a set of seven realisations of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy with the Auriga galaxy formation model. All realisations share the same initial conditions and code parameters, but draw different random numbers for the inherently stochastic parts of the model. We show that global galaxy properties at $z=0$, including stellar mass, star formation history, masses of stellar bulge and stellar disc, the radius and height of the stellar disk change by less than $10\%$ between the different realisations, and that magnetic field structures in the disc and the halo are very similar. In contrast, the star formation rate today can vary by a factor of two and the internal morphological structure of the stellar disc can change. The time and orbit of satellite galaxies and their galaxy properties when falling into the main halo are again very similar, but their orbits start to deviate after first pericenter passage. Finally, we show that changing the mass resolution of all matter components by a factor of $8$ in the Auriga model changes galaxy properties significantly more than the intrinsic variability of the model, and that these changes are systematic.

We find that QGs with an IR counterpart (i.e., dusty galaxies) are found to host a substantial HI content, on average just 40% lower than SFGs. In contrast, color-selected QGs still hold HI, but lower than SFGs by a factor 3. Among dusty objects, we find morphology to have a mild impact on the atomic gas content, with spirals hosting approximately 15-30% more HI than spheroids. Environmental effects are also present, with low-density regions hosting galaxies that are HI-richer than in high-density ones, by approximately 30% for spirals and 60% for spheroids. We suggest that, in general, HI content is driven by several factors, including quenching mechanisms and ISM enrichment processes. Also, quiescent galaxies - and especially dusty systems - seem to yield HI more consistently than in the Local Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning Classification of COSMOS2020 Galaxies: Quiescent vs. Star-Forming</a><span class="id">[2509.03039]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurately distinguishing between quiescent and star-forming galaxies is essential for understanding galaxy evolution. Traditional methods, such as spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, can be computationally expensive and may struggle to capture complex galaxy properties. This study aims to develop a robust and efficient machine learning (ML) classification method to identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies within the Farmer COSMOS2020 catalog. We utilized JWST wide-field light cones from the Santa Cruz semi-analytical modeling framework to train a supervised ML model, the CatBoostClassifier, using 28 color features derived from 8 mutual photometric bands within the COSMOS catalog. The model was validated against a testing set and compared to the SED-fitting method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and execution time. Preprocessing steps included addressing missing data, injecting observational noise, and applying a magnitude cut (ch1 &lt; 26 AB) along with a redshift range of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 to align the simulated and observational datasets. The ML method achieved an F1-score of 89\% for quiescent galaxies, significantly outperforming the SED-fitting method, which achieved 54%. The ML model demonstrated superior recall (88% vs. 38%) while maintaining comparable precision. When applied to the COSMOS2020 catalog, the ML model predicted a systematically higher fraction of quiescent galaxies across all redshift bins within 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 compared to traditional methods like NUVrJ and SED-fitting. This study shows that ML, combined with multi-wavelength data, can effectively identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies, providing valuable insights into galaxy evolution. The trained classifier and full classification catalog are publicly available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of a septuple stellar system in formation via disk fragmentation</a><span class="id">[2509.06787]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar multiple systems play a pivotal role in cluster dynamics and stellar evolution, leading to intense astronomical phenomena like X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernova, and stellar mergers, which are prime sources of gravitational waves. However, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a septuple protostellar system embedded in a Keplerian disk within the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6334IN, with close separations of 181-461 AU. The stability analysis reveals that the disk surrounding the septuple system is dynamically unstable, indicating that the septuple system formed via disk fragmentation. Previous studies have typically found only 2–3 members forming via disk fragmentation in both low- and high-mass star-forming regions. Our findings provide compelling observational evidence that the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk is a viable mechanism for the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity, confirming what was previously only a theoretical concept. The results shed new light on the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity in cluster environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auriga Streams III: the mass-metallicity relation does not rule out tidal mass loss in Local Group satellites</a><span class="id">[2509.06859]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The mass-metallicity relation is a fundamental galaxy scaling law that has been extended to the faintest systems in the Local Group. We show that the small scatter in this relation, which has been used to argue against tidal mass loss in Local Group satellites, is consistent with the level of disruption in the Auriga simulations. For every accreted system in Auriga, we compute stellar masses and metallicities two ways: considering the total system (bound + lost material) and only considering the progenitor. Accreted systems in Auriga have a tight relation between total stellar mass and metallicity, with scatter at a fixed stellar mass driven by age. When only considering the progenitor, the tidally evolved mass-metallicity relation has similar scatter ($\sim$0.27 dex) as observed for the Local Group satellites ($\sim$0.23 dex). Satellites that lie above the relation have experienced substantial mass loss and typically have low metallicity for their total stellar mass. Even satellites that fall exactly on the evolved relation can lose over half of their stellar mass. Only satellites substantially below the evolved relation are reliably intact. Based on their offset from the observed relation, we predict which Milky Way and M31 satellites have tidal tails waiting to be discovered.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LMC+: Large-scale mapping of [CII] and [OIII] in the LMC molecular ridge, I.

This process, by which galaxies evolve, is also closely connected to the intrinsic properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). To study the role that different molecular and atomic phases of the ISM play in star formation, and to characterize their physical conditions, we zoom into our nearest neighboring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 50 kpc). The LMC offers a view of the ISM and star formation conditions in a low metallicity environment similar to, in that regard, the epoch of the peak of star formation in the earlier universe. We present an unprecedentedly detailed analysis of a well-known star-forming regions (SFRs) at a spatial resolution of a few pc. We mapped a 610pcx260pc region in the LMC molecular ridge in [CII] and the [OIII] using the FIFI-LS instrument on the SOFIA telescope. We compare the data with the distribution of the CO (2-1) emission from ALMA, the modeled TIR luminosity as well as Spitzer/MIPS continuum and Halpha. We also provide a detailed description of the observing strategy and the data reduction. We find that [CII] and [OIII] emission is associated with the SFRs in the molecular ridge, but also extends throughout the mapped region, not obviously associated with ongoing star formation. The CO emission is clumpier than the [CII] emission and we find plentiful [CII] present where there is little CO emission, possibly holding important implications for CO-dark gas. We find a clear trend of the [CII]/TIR ratio decreasing with increasing TIR. This suggests a strong link between the [CII]-deficit and the local physical conditions instead of global properties.</p></div></details></article>

The design is optimized to be operated in harsh environments, particularly at the South Pole. The setup will consist of seven telescopes in a so-called fly's eye configuration, increasing the field of view to 36^\circ, and an additional telescope 200m apart for stereoscopic observations. Rigorous testing procedures have been performed before deployment to ensure that operation under these conditions is possible, e.g. night sky observations and cold temperature tests. Furthermore, on-site calibrations are used to verify the accuracy and reliability of the installation. We derive the geometric alignment of each IceAct telescope by comparing the directional reconstruction of muons measured with IceCube to the corresponding primary particle direction reconstruction from IceAct. This contribution presents these testing procedures.

Medium-resolution IFS, such as MUSE at the VLT, are equipped to detect the emission lines of faint accreting companions when associated with dedicated stellar halo subtraction methods. We recently proposed a new approach based on polynomial modulations of a stellar spectrum estimate across the field of view, with orthogonal polynomials and lines masking. Aims. We seek to highlight and quantify analytically and on real data the benefits of this new approach over the one classically used, particularly with regard to distortions of the extracted spectra. Methods. We carried out analytical calculations based on simple toy models. Simulations of the most extreme situations identified were used to highlight these problems and corrections. Archival VLT/MUSE data of the young PDS70 and HTLup systems were used to vet the detection and characterization capabilities using on-sky observations. New images of the YSES1 planetary system were used to further illustrate the gains. Results. We show that the state-of-the-art method, based on low-pass filtering, can lead to the self-subtraction of the emission lines and modify the neighboring continua. We show that the proposed technique corrects these characterization problems, while maintaining the same detection capabilities. The two protoplanets PDS70 b and c were detected with 5sigma significance. The Halpha line estimate of the HTLup B stellar companion was improved by  30% for the integrated flux and by  8% for the 10%-width. As for YSES1 b, we found it uniquely displays a combination of Halpha, Hbeta, CaII H&amp;K triplet, and HeI lines in emission. Conclusions. The proposed method better preserves the spectral information, notably the emission line fluxes and profiles, while achieving similar detection performance. Based on a linear and parametric approach, it can be extended and/or combined with additional faint signal search algorithms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astroclimes – measuring the abundance of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ in the Earth's atmosphere using astronomical observations</a><span class="id">[2509.10258]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Monitoring the abundance of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) and methane (CH$_4$) is necessary to quantify their impact on global warming and climate change. Although a number of satellites and ground-based networks measure the total column volume mixing ratio (VMR) of these gases, they rely on sunlight, and column measurements at night are comparatively scarce. We present a new algorithm, Astroclimes, that hopes to complement and extend nighttime CO$_2$ and CH4 column measurements. Astroclimes can measure the abundance of GHGs on Earth by generating a model telluric transmission spectra and fitting it to the spectra of telluric standard stars in the near-infrared taken by ground-based telescopes. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on an extensive dataset from the CARMENES spectrograph showed that Astroclimes was able to recover the long term trend known to be present in the molecular abundances of both CO$_2$ and CH$_4$, but not their seasonal cycles. Using the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global greenhouse gas reanalysis model (EGG4) as a benchmark, we identified an overall vertical shift in our data and quantified the long term scatter in our retrievals. The scatter on a 1 hour timescale, however, is much lower, and is on par with the uncertainties on individual measurements. Although currently the precision of the method is not in line with state of the art techniques using dedicated instrumentation, it shows promise for further development.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Differentiable Surrogate Model for the Generation of Radio Pulses from In-Ice Neutrino Interactions</a><span class="id">[2509.10274]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The planned IceCube-Gen2 radio neutrino detector at the South Pole will enhance the detection of cosmic ultra-high-energy neutrinos.

In our work, we focus on the aspect of signal generation, and propose a modularized deep learning architecture to generate radio signals from in-ice neutrino interactions conditioned on the shower energy and viewing angle. The model is capable of generating differentiable signals with amplitudes spanning multiple orders of magnitude, as well as consistently producing signals corresponding to the same underlying event for different viewing angles. The modularized approach ensures physical consistency of the samples and leads to advantageous computational properties when using the model as part of a bigger optimization pipeline.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The CHARA Array Polarization Model and Prospects for Spectropolarimetry</a><span class="id">[2509.10451]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polarimetric data provide key insights into infrared emission mechanisms in the inner disks of YSOs and the details of dust formation around AGB stars. While polarization measurements are well-established in radio interferometry, they remain challenging at visible and near-infrared due to the significant time-variable birefringence introduced by the complex optical beamtrain. In this study, we characterize instrumental polarization effects within the optical path of the CHARA Array, focusing on the H-band MIRC-X and K-band MYSTIC beam combiners. Using Jones matrix formalism, we developed a comprehensive model describing diattenuation and retardance across the array. By applying this model to an unpolarized calibrator, we derived the instrumental parameters for both MIRC-X and MYSTIC. Our results show differential diattenuation consistent with &gt;= 97% reflectivity per aluminum-coated surface at 45 deg incidence. The differential retardance exhibits small wavelength-dependent variations, in some cases larger than we expected. Notably, telescope W2 exhibits a significantly larger phase shift in the Coude path, attributable to a fixed aluminum mirror (M4) used in place of deformable mirrors present on the other telescopes during the observing run. We also identify misalignments in the LiNbO_3 birefringent compensator plates on S1 (MIRC-X) and W2 (MYSTIC). After correcting for night-to-night offsets, we achieve calibration accuracies of $\pm$ 3.4% in visibility ratio and $\pm$ 1.4 deg in differential phase for MIRC-X, and $\pm$ 5.9% and $\pm$ 2.4 deg, respectively, for MYSTIC. Given that the differential intrinsic polarization of spatially resolved sources, such as AGB stars and YSOs, typically greater than these instrumental uncertainties, our results demonstrate that CHARA is now capable of achieving high-accuracy measurements of intrinsic polarization in astrophysical targets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next generation direct RF sampling LLRF control and monitoring system for linear accelerators</a><span class="id">[2509.09905]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The low-level RF (LLRF) systems for linear accelerating structures are typically based on heterodyne architectures.

The integrated RF data converters in RFSoC sample and generate the RF signals directly without any analogue mixing circuits, which significantly simplified the architecture compared with the conventional LLRF systems.

In this work, we derive the velocity-dependent corrections to the gravitational wave response. We analyze the contribution of the velocity-terms for MBHBs in the mass range $[10^6,10^8]\:\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ using a modified version of the state-of-the-art response simulator lisagwresponse. We find that corrections introduce residual SNRs up to $\sim 2$ for the loudest events and fractional differences up to $0.04\%$, compared to lisagwresponse.

In this process, an incident photon deposits a fraction of its energy at the point of incidence and continues onwards with a change in direction that depends on the amount of energy deposited. By using a pair of detectors to detect the point of incidence and the direction of the scattered photon, we can calculate the scattering direction and angle. The position of a source in the sky can be reconstructed using many Compton photon pairs from a source. We demonstrate this principle in the laboratory by using a pair of Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) detectors sensitive in the energy range of 20-200 keV, similar to those used in $\textit{AstroSat}$/CZT Imager (CZTI). The laboratory setup consists of the two detectors placed perpendicular to each other in a lead-lined box. The detectors are read out by a custom-programmed Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 FPGA board, and data are then transferred to a personal computer (PC)}. There are two key updates from CZTI: the detectors are read concurrently rather than serially, and the time resolution has been improved from $20~\mu$s to $7.5~\mu$s. We irradiated the detectors with a collimated $^{133}\mathrm{Ba}$ source and identified Compton scattering events for the 356 keV line. We run a Compton reconstruction algorithm to correctly infer the location of the source in the detector frame, with a location-dependent angular response measure of $16°-30°$. This comprises a successful technology demonstration for a Compton imaging camera in the hard X-ray regime. We present the details of our setup, the data acquisition process, and software algorithms, and showcase our results. We also quantify the limitations of this setup and discuss ways of improving the performance in future experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ImageMM: Joint multi-frame image restoration and super-resolution</a><span class="id">[2501.03002]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A key processing step in ground-based astronomy involves combining multiple noisy and blurry exposures to produce an image of the night sky with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. Typically, this is achieved via image coaddition, and can be undertaken such that the resulting night sky image has enhanced spatial resolution. Yet, this task remains a formidable challenge despite decades of advancements. In this paper, we introduce ImageMM: a new framework based on the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm for joint multi-frame astronomical image restoration and super-resolution. ImageMM uses multiple registered astronomical exposures to produce a nonparametric latent image of the night sky, prior to the atmosphere's impact on the observed exposures. Our framework also features a novel variational approach to compute refined point-spread functions of arbitrary resolution for the restoration and super-resolution procedure. Our algorithms, implemented in TensorFlow, leverage graphics processing unit acceleration to produce latent images in near real time, even when processing high-resolution exposures. We tested ImageMM on Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) exposures, which are a precursor of the upcoming imaging data from the Rubin Observatory. The results are encouraging: ImageMM produces sharp latent images, in which spatial features of bright sources are revealed in unprecedented detail (e.g., showing the structure of spiral galaxies), and where faint sources that are usually indistinguishable from the noisy sky background also become discernible, thus pushing the detection limits. Moreover, aperture photometry performed on the HSC pipeline coadd and ImageMM's latent images yielded consistent source detection and flux measurements, thereby demonstrating ImageMM's suitability for cutting-edge photometric studies with state-of-the-art astronomical imaging data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20949" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapid Construction of Joint Pulsar Timing Array Datasets: The Lite Method</a><span class="id">[2503.20949]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA)'s second data release (IPTA DR2) combines decades of observations of 65 millisecond pulsars from 7 radio telescopes. IPTA datasets should be the most sensitive datasets to nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs), but take years to assemble, often excluding valuable recent data. To address this, we introduce the IPTA &quot;Lite&quot; analysis, where a Figure of Merit is used to select an optimal PTA dataset to analyze for each pulsar, enabling immediate access to new data and preliminary results prior to full combination. We test the capabilities of the Lite analysis using IPTA DR2, finding that &quot;DR2 Lite&quot; can be used to detect the common red noise process with an amplitude of $A = 4.8^{+1.8}_{-1.8} \times 10^{-15}$ at $\gamma = 13/3$. This amplitude is slightly large in comparison to the combined analysis, and likely biased high as DR2 Lite is more sensitive to systematic errors from individual pulsars than the full dataset. Furthermore, although there is no strong evidence for Hellings-Downs correlations in IPTA DR2, we still find the full dataset is better at resolving Hellings-Downs correlations than DR2 Lite. Alongside the Lite analysis, we also find that analyzing a subset of pulsars from IPTA DR2, available at a hypothetical &quot;early&quot; stage of combination (EDR2), yields equally competitive results as the full dataset. Looking ahead, the Lite method will enable rapid synthesis of the latest PTA data, offering preliminary GW constraints before the superior full dataset combinations are available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitigation of the Flexing-Filtering Effect in Time-Delay Interferometry</a><span class="id">[2506.04316]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In early 2024, ESA formally adopted the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space mission with the aim of measuring gravitational waves emitted in the millihertz range. The constellation employs three spacecraft that exchange laser beams to form interferometric measurements over a distance of 2.5 million kilometers. The measurements will then be telemetered down to Earth at a lower sampling frequency. Anti-aliasing filters will be used on board to limit spectral folding of out-of-band laser noise. The dominant noise in these measurements is laser frequency noise which does not cancel naturally in LISA's unequal-arm heterodyne interferometers. Suppression of this noise requires time-shifting of the data using delay operators to build virtual beam paths that simulate equal-arm interferometers. The non-commutativity of these delay operators and on-board filters manifests as a noise (flexing-filtering) that significantly contributes to the noise budget. This non-commutativity is a consequence of the non-flatness of the filter in-band. Attenuation of this noise requires high-order and computationally expensive filters, putting additional demands on the spacecraft. The following work studies an alternative method to reduce this flexing filtering noise via the introduction of a modified delay operator that accounts for the non-commutativity with the filter in the delay operation itself. Our approach allows us to reduce the flexing-filtering noise by over six orders of magnitude whilst reducing the dependency on the flatness of the filter. The work is supplemented by numerical simulations of the data processing chain that compare the results with those of the standard approach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08773" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for GEMS: The Occurrence of Giant Planets orbiting M-dwarfs within 100 pc</a><span class="id">[2509.08773]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from a systematic search for transiting short-period Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars (GEMS; $P &lt; 10$ days, $R_p \gtrsim 8~R_\oplus$) within a distance-limited 100 pc sample of 149,316 M-dwarfs using TESS-Gaia Light Curve (TGLC) data. This search led to the discovery of one new candidate GEM, following spectroscopic vetting of 12 additional candidates to eliminate astrophysical false positives and refine our occurrence rate estimates. We describe the development and application of the \texttt{TESS-miner} package and associated vetting procedures used in this analysis. To assess detection completeness, we conducted $\sim$ 72 million injection-recovery tests across $\sim$ 26,000 stars with an average of $\sim$3 sectors of data per star, subdivided into early-type (M0–M2.5), mid-type (M2.5–M4), and late-type (M4 or later) M-dwarfs. Our pipeline demonstrates high sensitivity across all M-dwarf subtypes within the injection bounds. We estimate the occurrence rates of short-period GEMS as a function of stellar mass, and combine our measured occurrence rates with those derived for FGK stars and fit an exponential trend with stellar mass, consistent with core-accretion theory predictions. We find GEMS occurrence rates of $0.067\% \pm 0.047\%$ for early-type M-dwarfs, $0.139\% \pm 0.069\%$ for mid-type, and $0.032\% \pm 0.032\%$ for late-type M-dwarfs, with a mean rate of $0.065^{+0.025}_{-0.027}\%$ across the full M-dwarf sample.

This work lays the foundation for future occurrence rate investigations for GEMS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reconstruction of the depth of the shower maximum of air showers with the SD-750 surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory using neural networks</a><span class="id">[2509.09328]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the intriguing mysteries in astroparticle physics. In order to identify their sources, we need precise knowledge of the mass composition of UHECRs. The direct detection of UHECRs is not feasible at energies above 0.1 PeV, necessitating the use of mass-sensitive observables of extended air showers induced by UHECRs interacting with the atmosphere. One way to achieve high statistics for these mass-sensitive observables is to use ground-based detector arrays, such as the Surface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD consists of three sub-arrays of independent detector stations arranged in triangular grids with different spacings. Recently, it has been shown that neural networks (NNs) can extract mass-sensitive observables from data taken by the SD-1500, the largest sub-detector of the SD. In this contribution, we demonstrate the feasibility of using NNs to reconstruct a high-level shower observable, the depth of the shower maximum, from data simulated for and observed by the SD-750, the second-largest detector array nested within the SD-1500. A simulation study shows that the SD-750 NN exhibits behavior similar to that of an SD-1500 NN and outperforms the latter in the energy range [1, 10) EeV. Moreover, we show that, after performing a correction and calibration procedure, the predictions of the SD-750 NN are consistent with the measurement of the depth of the shower maximum obtained by the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16079" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Distribution-Free Approach to Testing Models for Angular Power Spectra</a><span class="id">[2504.16079]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A novel goodness-of-fit strategy is introduced for testing models of angular power spectra with unknown parameters. Using this strategy, it is possible to assess the validity of such models without specifying the distribution of the angular power spectrum estimators. This holds under general conditions, ensuring the method's applicability in diverse applications. Moreover, the proposed solution overcomes the need for case-by-case simulations when testing different models, leading to notable computational advantages.</p></div></details></article></body>
