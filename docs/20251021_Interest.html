<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the potential of ChatGPT for feedback and evaluation in experimental physics</a><span class="id">[2510.16137]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study explores how generative artificial intelligence, specifically ChatGPT, can assist in the evaluation of laboratory reports in Experimental Physics. Two interaction modalities were implemented: an automated API-based evaluation and a customized ChatGPT configuration designed to emulate instructor feedback. The analysis focused on two complementary dimensions-formal and structural integrity, and technical accuracy and conceptual depth. Findings indicate that ChatGPT provides consistent feedback on organization, clarity, and adherence to scientific conventions, while its evaluation of technical reasoning and interpretation of experimental data remains less reliable. Each modality exhibited distinctive limitations, particularly in processing graphical and mathematical information. The study contributes to understanding how the use of AI in evaluating laboratory reports can inform feedback practices in experimental physics, highlighting the importance of teacher supervision to ensure the validity of physical reasoning and the accurate interpretation of experimental results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why every solar eclipse viewing event needs a disco ball</a><span class="id">[2510.16169]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar eclipses offer unparalleled opportunities for public engagement in astronomy. Large groups of people often gather to view eclipses, and these events require affordable and easy to use tools to safely observe the Sun. One unique way to observe a solar eclipse is by using a disco ball. Here, we present an analysis of the experiences of educators who used a disco ball as a solar projector during various public outreach events. Through a survey conducted shortly after the April 2024 total solar eclipse and the March 2025 partial solar eclipse, we collected data on the use, engagement, and perceived educational value of a disco ball projector from 31 individual events. The results suggest that disco balls were not only affordable and safe, but also popular and educational.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhancing Kinematics Understanding through a Video Game Based on Real-Time Motion Graphs</a><span class="id">[2508.19119]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although physics has become increasingly computational, with computing even being considered the third pillar of physics [1], it is still not well integrated into physics education [2]. Research suggests that integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into physics enhances conceptual understanding and strengthens students' ability to model and analyze phenomena [3]. Building on this, we designed a didactic sequence for K9 students to foster specific CT practices while reinforcing fundamental kinematics concepts. The activity revealed students' ability to apply CT skills and is well suited for use in introductory kinematics courses.</p></div></details></article></body>
