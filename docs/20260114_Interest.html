<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07883" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: Experimental Predictions</a><span class="id">[2601.07883]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the experimental predictions of the local scale invariant, non-Hermitian pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) formulation of quantum theory introduced in arXiv:2601.03567 . We use Weyl's definition of gravitational radius of charge to obtain the fine-structure constant for non-integrable scale effects $\alpha_S$. The minuteness of $\alpha_S$ relative to $\alpha$ ($\alpha_S/\alpha \sim 10^{-21}$) effectively hides the effects in usual quantum experiments. In an Aharonov-Bohm double-slit experiment, the theory predicts that the position probability density depends on which slit the particle trajectory crosses, due to a non-integrable scale induced by the magnetic flux. This experimental prediction can be realistically tested for an electrically neutral, heavy molecule with mass $m \sim 10^{-19} \text{g}$ at a $\sim 10^6 \text{ esu}$ flux regime. We analyse the Weyl-Einstein debate on the second-clock effect using the theory and show that spectral frequencies are history-independent. We thereby resolve Einstein's key objection against local scale invariance, and obtain two further experimental predictions. First, spectral intensities turn out to be history-dependent. Second, energy eigenvalues are modified by tiny imaginary corrections that modify spectral linewidths. We argue that the trajectory dependence of the probabilities renders our theory empirically distinguishable from other quantum formulations that do not use pilot-wave trajectories, or their mathematical equivalents, to derive experimental predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bohmian mechanics: A legitimate hydrodynamic picture for quantum mechanics, and beyond</a><span class="id">[2601.07932]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Since its inception, Bohmian mechanics has been surrounded by a halo of controversy. Originally proposed to bypass the limitations imposed by von Neumann's theorem on the impossibility of hidden-variable models in quantum mechanics, it faced strong opposition from the outset. Over time, however, its use in tackling specific problems across various branches of physics has led to a gradual shift in attitude, turning the early resistance into a more moderate acceptance. A plausible explanation for this change may be that, since the late 1990s and early 2000s, Bohmian mechanics has been taking on a more operational and practical role. The original hidden-variable idea has gradually faded from its framework, giving way to a more pragmatic approach that treats it as a suitable analytical and computational tool. This discussion explores how and why such a shift in perspective has occurred and, therefore, answers questions such as whether Bohmian mechanics should be considered once and for all a legitimate quantum representation (i.e., worth being taught in elementary quantum mechanics courses) or, by extension, whether these ideas can be transferred to and benefit other fields. Here, the Schrödinger equation and several specific numerical examples are re-examined in the light of a less restrictive view than the standard one usually adopted in quantum mechanics.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Convergence in divergent series related to perturbation methods using continued exponential and Shanks transformations</a><span class="id">[2409.05438]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Divergent solutions are ubiquitous with perturbation methods. We use continued function such as continued exponential to converge divergent series in perturbation approaches for energy eigenvalues of Helium, Stark effect and Zeeman effect on Hydrogen. We observe that convergence properties are obtained similar to that of the Padé approximation which is extensively used in literature. Free parameters are not used which influence the convergence and only first few terms in the perturbation series are implemented.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Architected Structural Material Design Inspired by Diatoms: Merging Nature's Beauty With Engineering Through Biomimetics</a><span class="id">[2601.08761]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Imagine a world where beauty and technology move in perfect harmony, revealing tiny masterpieces hidden in the water. This world is Nature, and diatoms are the stars. Masters of assembling complex hierarchical glass structures, these microscopic algae are true technological gems, and their potential is boundless when it comes to transforming our world. From pharmaceutical applications to biomaterial synthesis, water purification to advanced optical systems, solar cells to the production of new fuels, architecture to design objects, diatoms teach us that Nature's potential is limitless, proving to be invaluable allies for innovation and sustainable development. But how can organisms so small hold such immense potential? In this chapter, we will explore the key characteristics of diatoms and unveil the hidden secrets behind their beauty and multifunctionality, offering an interdisciplinary vision that celebrates the interaction between art and science. We provide concrete examples of structural materials that demonstrate how diatoms can serve as the meeting point between artistic creativity and technological innovation, inspiring new design paradigms and reshaping how we approach materials science and engineering.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elastic overtones: an equal temperament 12 tone music system with &quot;perfect&quot; fifths</a><span class="id">[2601.08074]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The impossibility of a transposable 12 semitone tuning of the octave arises from the mathematical fact that $2 \times 2^{7/12} \neq 3$ i.e., the second harmonic of the fifth can not exactly match the third harmonic of the fundamental. This in turn, stems from the whole number harmonic structure of western music, and the subsequent fundamental character of the octave interval as multiples of 2 in frequency, a property inherited by our music system from the physics of instruments with vibrating elements being to a good approximation one dimensional. In the current era of electronic music, one can relax the above assumptions to construct an analogous music system where all the structural properties of the standard music system are preserved, but where harmonics are not whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency, and the octave is no longer a factor of 2 in frequency. This now allows to construct a transposable 12 semitone music system where the second harmonic of the fifth exactly matches the third harmonic of the fundamental. The enhanced harmonic qualities of this system recover to a good approximation the musical qualities of Just Intonation, whilst retaining by construction all the versatility and modulating ability of 12TET.</p></div></details></article></body>
