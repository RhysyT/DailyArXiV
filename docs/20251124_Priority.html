While the CO-to-$\mathrm{H}_2$ conversion factor is often assumed to be constant across the disks of galaxies, deviations are observed in extreme environments such as the central molecular zone (CMZ) in galactic nuclei. Here we present the first estimate of the CO-to-$\mathrm{H}_2$ conversion factor on sub-kpc scales. We calculate CO-to-$\mathrm{H}_2$ conversion in the Milky Way's Circumnuclear Disk/Ring (CND/CNR) at $\sim 1$ pc radius around the Galactic Center black hole. We derive a conversion factor of $\alpha_\mathrm{CO} \simeq 4.5\pm2.5 \, M_\odot (\mathrm{K \, km \, s^{-1} pc^2})^{-1}$ or X[CO] $\simeq (2.1\pm1.1)\times 10^{20} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} (\mathrm{K \, km \, s^{-1}})^{-1}$. This value is consistent with the Galactic disk but higher than CMZ.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIDES – I. The population and diversity of HI-rich 'dark' galaxies in the Hestia and Auriga simulations</a><span class="id">[2511.16726]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present our investigation of HI-rich 'Dark' galaxiEs in Simulations (HIDES), specifically using the Hestia and Auriga simulations in this work. We select galaxies that are faint ($M_g &gt; -10$) and contain sufficient HI ($M_\mathrm{HI} &gt; 10^5\,M_\odot$), and identify 89 such objects, only one of which is completely starless. Their demographics generally converge across simulations of different resolution, with $M_{200} \sim 10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{gas} \sim 10^{7.4}\,M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{HI} \sim 10^{6.5}\,M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{*} \sim 10^{5.6}\,M_\odot$, low gas metallicity, little or no current star formation, and a mean stellar age of $\sim$ 11 Gyr, and with some of them can survive in dense environments as close as $\sim$ 300 kpc from a Milky-Way mass neighbor. We find a large scatter in their HI density profiles and $M_\mathrm{HI} - M_\mathrm{*}$ relation, which cannot be fully explained by current halo mass or concentration, but can be attributed to ram pressure stripping in dense environments, past mergers, and stellar feedback. In particular, close encounters with massive halos and dense environments can reshape the HI content, which may explain the asymmetric HI map of an intriguing observed analogue, Cloud-9. An empirical fit, $n = 0.25 \left(d_\mathrm{MW}/{1\,\mathrm{Mpc}}\right)^{-1.4}\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$, based on their number density extended to 3.7 Mpc in constrained local volume simulations, is also provided to aid observational forecasts. We conclude that both mass assembly history and environmental history play a crucial role in the formation and subsequent diversity of these galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio-Continuum Spectra of Pulsars with Free-Free Thermal Absorption</a><span class="id">[2511.16728]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The radio continuum spectra of pulsars (PSRs) exhibit a wide variety of shapes, that are interpreted as pure and broken power laws, power laws with turnovers or cut-offs, and logarithmic-parabolic profiles. A notable fraction of these have well-defined power laws with $\nu^{-2.1}$ exponential turnovers, indicative of free-free thermal absorption along the line-of-site. We analyse a sample of 63 PSRs with such spectral shapes, compiled from four previously published studies, to investigate their statistical properties. We normalise each spectrum to a characteristic frequency and flux density of its own, facilitating a consistent treatment across the four sub-samples. We show these two fitted parameters are correlated by a power law, with its slope reflecting the median spectral index ($\alpha\sim -2.0$) of PSR emission. We found that the turnover frequencies in our sample are typically high, clustering around 558 MHz, implying notably high emission measures ($EM \sim 10^{5}$ pc cm$^{-6}$) for an inferred thermal absorbing medium with electron temperature of $T_{\mathrm{e}}=8000$ K. Moreover, by combining these $EM$ with dispersion measures (DM) derived from pulse time delays, we break the degeneracy between electron density and path length of the absorbers. This reveals a discrete near-in population of absorbers characterised by small sizes ($L \sim 0.1\,\text{pc}$) and high electron densities $(n_{\mathrm{e}} \sim 10^{3}\,\text{cm}^{-3} $)), which exhibit a clear size-density anticorrelation reminiscent of that observed in Galactic and extragalactic H$_\rm{II}$ regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A search for cold molecular outflows in cosmic noon galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.16733]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The flow of baryons in and out of galaxies is the primary driver for galaxy evolution. In addition to depleting the gas reservoir of galaxies, outflows also enrich their circumgalactic medium (CGM) with processed gas – which can further impact the next stages of gas accretion, resulting in the presence of molecular gas beyond the stellar component of galaxies, out to CGM scales. Here, we aim to search for cold molecular gas (MH2) in the CGM of typical main-sequence (MS) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at cosmic noon (zmed=1.3), where we expect outflows to be particularly prominent. Using Band 3 CO(2-1) data from the Atacama Large Millimeter and submillimeter Array (ALMA), we study the spatial extent of the MH2 of a sample of 26 SFGs, via stacking techniques. We compare this extent to that of the stacked stellar emission of our sample traced by UltraVISTA Ks band data. We also search for broad wings in the stacked spectrum which can be indicative of ongoing outflows. Within the noise level of the observations, we find that the total intrinsic MH2 of our sample spatially extends to scales of  12 kpc, similarly to the stellar emission ( 13 kpc). We do not find broad wings in the stacked spectrum that could hint at ongoing molecular outflows, but we find a tentative minor excess of CO(2-1) emission at negative velocities that might be indicative of outflows, where the redshifted gas is optically thick. The absence of high-velocity molecular gas suggests that molecular outflows traced by CO(2-1) emission are weak in MS SFGs at cosmic noon. These weak outflows thus fail to expel a significant amount of molecular gas to CGM scales, as indicated by the absence of molecular emission extending beyond the stellar emission region. This lack of CO emission at large radii could also imply that the molecular gas does not survive at such distances.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A continuous parameterization of the cosmic web</a><span class="id">[2511.16744]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The intrinsic properties of galaxies are influenced by their environments, underscoring the environment's critical role in galaxy formation and evolution. Traditionally, these environments are categorized into four fixed classifications: knots, filaments, walls, and voids, which collectively describe the complex organization of galaxies within large-scale structures. We propose an alternative description that complements the traditional quadripartite categorization by introducing a continuous framework, allowing for a more nuanced examination of the relationship between the intrinsic properties of galaxies and their environments. This complementary description is applied using one of the most prevalent methodologies: categorization using the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix extracted from the matter density field. We integrated our findings into a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, combined with cosmological numerical simulations, to analyze how the intrinsic properties of galaxies are influenced by environmental changes. In our study, we find a continuous distribution of eigenvalue ratios, revealing a clear dependence of galaxy properties on their surrounding environments. This method allowed us to identify critical values at which transitions in the behavior of key astrophysical galaxy properties become evident.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finding He II: Testing Novel Models of Binary Populations across Cosmic Time</a><span class="id">[2511.16752]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Our understanding of massive stars remains incomplete. Many high-z galaxies and nearby analogs exhibit strong He II emission, indicating an abundance of photons with energies &gt;54.4 eV that standard single-star population models cannot explain. Recent studies show that binary evolution and non-solar abundance patterns are required to explain the distinct spectra of high-z galaxies observed by JWST. However, treatments of these properties vary drastically between models. We present the first results from a comparison of models with different treatments of binaries, including BPASS and novel stripped star models, with rest-UV-optical spectra of high-z galaxies' local analogs. This type of investigation can provide insights into which aspects of binary evolution are important to reproduce observations and identify priorities in ongoing efforts to improve models. By constraining the properties of massive stars at high redshift, we can learn about the processes at play in high-z galaxies and massive star evolution more broadly.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16753" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ViSta method for stacking in the Fourier domain and its application to the dusty star-forming galaxies in the ALMA Science Archive</a><span class="id">[2511.16753]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present ViSta, a Visibility Stacking method to combine interferometric observations in the Fourier domain at radio to sub-millimeter wavelengths for galaxies. The goal of our method is to maximize the exploitation of available archival interferometric data. By stacking visibilities of galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts directly in the Fourier domain and transforming them into the rest-frame, we can enhance the stacked signal, suppress noise, and improve image reconstruction thanks to an extended coverage of the visibility domain. The ViSta method is highly flexible, allowing stacking of visibilities regardless of the array configuration or spectral setup. It is effective for both targeted sources and spurious detections offset from the phase center, whether unresolved or extended, within the field of view of the telescope. We validated the method using simulated interferometric datasets. For point-like sources, we can reconstruct the true emission with approximately 90% accuracy, obtaining similar results to classical image-plane stacking. In contrast, for faint and extended sources below the noise level, our method can provide a more accurate estimate of the signal compared to traditional image-based approaches. Finally, we applied ViSta to a sample of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to detect the CO(3-2) emission line. As for the simulated case, we demonstrated that our tool performs better than image-plane stacking when the signal from individual sources is no longer easily detectable, achieving higher SNR. Finally, we outline potential future applications of this stacking approach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16892" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING). XI. Azimuthally averaged star formation rate and stellar mass relation with molecular gas amount</a><span class="id">[2511.16892]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study investigated the relation between the surface density of star formation rate (SFR) ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$), stellar mass ($\Sigma_{M_{\ast}}$), and molecular gas mass ($\Sigma_{M_\mathrm{mol}}$) on nearly 1 kpc scales averaged over concentric tilted rings using the $^{12}$CO $J=1-0$ mapping data of 92 nearby galaxies obtained in the CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING) project. We categorized these galaxies into three groups based on the deviation of each global SFR from the star-forming main sequence (MS), $\Delta$MS: upper MS (UMS), MS, and lower MS (LMS). UMS galaxies tend to be less massive or barred spiral galaxies, exhibiting molecular gas fraction ($f_{\mathrm{gas}}$) comparable to those of MS galaxies but higher star formation efficiency (SFE). In contrast, the LMS galaxies tend to be massive or active galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Their $f_{\mathrm{gas}}$ values are lower than those of MS galaxies, and their SFEs are slightly lower or comparable to those of MS galaxies in the inner region. These trends indicate that enhanced SFE contributes to higher $\Delta$MS values, whereas reduced $f_{\mathrm{gas}}$ results in lower $\Delta$MS values. The less prominent bulge or the presence of a bar structure in UMS galaxies induces disk-wide star formation, consequently increasing the SFE. In LMS galaxies, the molecular gas is exhausted, and their star formation activity is low. Environmental effects, such as tidal gas stripping, may also reduce gas supply from the outer regions. Furthermore, our sample galaxies show that both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and $f_{\mathrm{gas}}$ decrease in the central region in LMS galaxies but did not change in the same region in UMS galaxies. These results seem to support the inside-out quenching of star formation although the dominant cause of depletion remains uncertain.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A deep ALMA Band 3 survey of HDFS/MUSE3D: Survey description and initial results</a><span class="id">[2511.16909]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>(abridged) After more than 10yr of ALMA operations, the community interest in conducting deep, extra-galactic, millimetre surveys resulted in varying strategic compromises between areal size and map depth to survey the sky. The current bias leans towards a galaxy population found in the field or towards rich star-bursty proto-cluster groups, both tendentiously surveyed at coarse spatial resolutions. Here, we describe a deep 3mm ALMA survey in long-baselines on a 1x1arcmin2 region in the Hubble Deep Field South, also covered by the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) in order to assess resolved molecular gas properties in galaxies in group environments at z&gt;1. ALMA observations comprising a 4-pointing mosaic with a single Band3 (3mm) spectral tuning were conducted to cover CO transitions from different groups identified by MUSE. This work consists in a total effective time on source of 61h in configurations with up to 15km baselines. The final data-set yields an angular resolution of 0.15&quot;-0.2&quot; (imaging weights dependent) and maximum recoverable scales of 1&quot;-2&quot;. The final continuum map reaches a sensitivity of rms 2uJy/beam, allowing the detection of three sources at 3mm (only one showing multi-wavelength counterparts). Moreover, we detect six line emitters associated with CO J=2-1 at zspec=1.284, one of them previously undetected by MUSE and none detected in 3mm continuum. The inter-stellar medium gas masses range from  2E9 to  9E10 Msun (adopting alphaCO=4Msun/( this http URL ), including Helium). Overall, this galaxy group is quite diverse with no two galaxies alike, some showing clear physical offsets with respect to Hubble imaging tracing rest-frame ultra-violet emission. We also derive cosmic molecular gas mass densities using this sample as a reference for group environments, and we find that these yield comparable densities as the galaxy population found in field environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16971" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Dark Matter Substructure with Image Number Anomaly in Strong Lensing Systems</a><span class="id">[2511.16971]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational lensing observables, including anomalies in image positions, flux ratios, and time delays, serve as usual probes of dark matter (DM) substructure. When dark matter substructure possesses sufficient perturbations, it may lead to the formation of extra images in otherwise canonical doubly or quadruply imaged systems. With the advent of increasingly precise observational instruments, previously undetectable images may become measurable and image number anomalies therefore could be an increasingly viable method. In this paper, we utilize the gravitational lensing phenomenon of image number anomaly to derive constraints on dark matter substructure. We present the extra images induced by distinct forms of DM substructure, specifically primordial black holes (PBHs) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and show that higher angular resolution observations increase the probability of detecting additional lensed images. Based on a null detection of image number anomalies in a sample of 3500 lens systems generated from the \textit{Strong Lensing Halo model-based mock catalogs} (SL-Hammocks), we derive upper limits on the abundance of PBHs. At the 95\% confidence level, the PBH abundance is constrained to $\lesssim 0.125\%$, $0.08\%$, and $0.04\%$ for PBH masses in the range $\sim 10^{7}$–$10^{9}~M_{\odot}$, corresponding to angular resolutions of $0.1''$, $0.05''$, and $0.01''$, respectively. Similarly, we exclude particle masses below $0.4$, $0.6$, and $3.5 \times 10^{-22} \ \mathrm{eV}$ for FDM at the same confidence level for the respective resolutions. Furthermore, the abundance of PBHs $\lesssim 0.9\%$ could be constrained at an angular resolution of $0.5''$ for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Observations. Finally, we discuss methodologies for identifying image number anomalies in special cases and demonstrate feasibility using a fitting procedure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16978" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TRAO Survey of the Nearby Filamentary Molecular Clouds, the Universal Nursery of Stars (TRAO-FUNS). IV. Filaments and Dense Cores in the W40 and Serpens South Regions of Aquila</a><span class="id">[2511.16978]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the results of molecular line observations toward the W40 and Serpens South regions of the Aquila molecular cloud complex, conducted as part of the TRAO-FUNS project to investigate the role of filamentary structures in the formation of dense cores and stars in molecular clouds. We performed a Gaussian decomposition of the C$^{18}$O spectra to disentangle multiple velocity components along the line-of-sight and a `Friends-of-Friends' algorithm on these decomposed components to identify 24 velocity-coherent filaments in the observed region. The `FellWalker' algorithm is applied on the N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ integrated intensity map to identify the dense cores embedded within the filaments. Many of the filaments previously identified from the Herschel survey are found to contain multiple velocity-coherent filaments. Virial analysis indicated that all of our identified filaments are thermally supercritical and gravitationally bound. Velocity gradients are observed along the filaments in the vicinity of embedded dense cores, indicating the presence of longitudinal flows that contribute to core formation. The median mass flow rate across the observed region is estimated to be $\sim$35 M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, with Serpens South showing a rate $\sim$40\% higher than W40. The analysis of non-thermal motions revealed that the dense cores mainly show subsonic to transonic motions, while their host filaments are mostly supersonic, suggesting that the turbulent motions in filaments may dissipate on smaller scales, allowing core formation. These findings highlight the essential role of the filaments' criticality, mass flow, and turbulent dissipation in the formation of dense cores within the filaments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17028" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiphase Astrophysics to Unveil the Virgo Environment (MAUVE)</a><span class="id">[2511.17028]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Multiphase Astrophysics to Unveil the Virgo Environment (MAUVE) project is a multi-facility programme exploring how dense environments transform galaxies.

Compared with the mergers in the TNG100-1-Dark simulation without baryons, the matched mergers in the TNG100-1 simulation have similar infall time, but have statistically earlier merger times and therefore shorter merger timescales. The merger orbits for the matched pairs in the TNG100-1 and the TNG100-1-Dark simulations are similar right after infall, and both evolve to more head-on orbits at final stages, with smaller changes in the hydrodynamical simulation. In the final 2 Gyr before merger, the collision angles that represent merger orbits quantitatively are smaller in TNG100-1 than those in TNG100-1-Dark, by around 6$^\circ$ to 10$^\circ$, depending on the mass ratios and galaxy masses investigated. Our results demonstrate that the presence of baryons accelerates a bit the merger processes, and results in more spiral-in orbits for both major and minor mergers in galaxies with various stellar masses. These effects are less obvious in simulations with lower resolutions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RUBIX: Differentiable forward modelling of galaxy spectral data cubes for gradient-based parameter estimation</a><span class="id">[2511.17110]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although integral-field spectroscopy enables spatially resolved spectral studies of galaxies, bridging particle-based simulations to observations remains slow and non-differentiable.

We used the Large Binocular Telescope under sub-arcsec seeing conditions to resolve for the first time the outer regions of KK 153 into individual stars, reaching the red giant branch. The magnitude of the red giant branch tip was used to measure a distance of D=3.06 (+0.17/-0.14) Mpc, much more accurate and precise than the estimate previously available in the literature, based on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (D=2.0 (+1.7/-0.8) Mpc). The new distance places KK 153 clearly beyond the boundaries of the Local Group, and, together with a new measure of the integrated magnitude, implies a stellar mass of M_*=2.4 \pm 0.2 X 10^6 M_{\sun}. The dwarf populates the extreme low-mass tail of the M_* distribution of gas-rich galaxies but it is significantly more massive than the faintest local gas-rich dwarfs, Leo T and Leo P. In analogy with similar systems, the star formation history of KK 153 may have been impacted by the re-ionisation of the Universe while keeping a sufficient gas reservoir to form new stars several Gyr later.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arp@VST: Legacy Survey of the Arp Peculiar Galaxies with the VST</a><span class="id">[2511.17175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Arp@VST is a public observing programme, conducted at the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) hosted at ESO's Paranal Observatory.

In this domain, galaxy emission consists of thermal dust, free-free and synchrotron emissions with a possible additional contribution from anomalous microwave emission (AME) peaking near 1 this http URL aim of this study is to accurately characterize the integrated spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies in the mm-cm range. We used COBE-DIRBE, IRAS, Planck, and WMAP all-sky surveys, brought to the same resolution of $1^\circ$, to cover 18 photometric bands from 97$\mu$m to 1.3 cm. Given the low angular resolution and mixing with foreground and background emission that hampers the detection of the galaxy, our sample consists of 6 of the brightest, nearby galaxies: LMC, SMC, M31, M33, NGC 253 and NGC 4945. We subtract Milky Way dust emission, distant unresolved galaxies, and foreground point sources in the fields. We fit each integrated SED with a model of thermal dust, free-free, synchrotron, AME and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature fluctuations. The integrated SEDs of our sample of galaxies are well fitted by the model within the uncertainties, although degeneracies between the different components contributing to the mm-cm emission complicate the estimation of their individual contributions. We do not clearly detect AME in any of our target galaxies, and AME emissivity upper limits are weak compared to Galactic standards, suggesting that the signal of AME might be diluted at the scale of a whole galaxy. We infer positive CMB fluctuations in the background of 5 out of our 6 galaxies. This effect might be related to the degeneracy between the dust emissivity index and CMB fluctuations in the background, or linked to the specific spatial distribution of CMB fluctuations coupled with the low resolution and small number statistics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular clustering and bias of photometric quasars in the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 4</a><span class="id">[2511.17311]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the angular clustering and effective bias of photometrically selected quasars in the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 4 (KiDS DR4). We update the previous photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) of the KiDS quasars using Hybrid-z, a deep learning framework combining four-band KiDS images and nine-band KiDS+VIKING magnitudes. Hybrid-z is trained on the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 quasars matching with KiDS, and achieves average bias $\langle \delta z \rangle &lt; 0.01$ and scatter $\sim 0.04(1 + z)$ on a test sample. The updated catalog of $\sim 157k$ quasars over $777~\mathrm{deg}^2$ is divided into four tomographic bins spanning $0.1 \leq z_{\mathrm{phot}} \leq 2.7$. In each bin, we measure the angular two-point correlation function and compare it with theoretical predictions for dark matter clustering. We estimate the best-fit scale-independent quasar bias, which increases from $b \approx 1.6$ at $z \approx 0.6$ to $b \approx 4.0$ at $z \approx 2.2$, and is well matched by a quadratic relation in redshift. Our clustering analysis indicates that KiDS quasars reside in dark matter halos of mass $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{eff}}/h^{-1}M_\odot)$ in the range $\sim 12.7$–$12.9$ and effective peak heights $\nu_{\mathrm{eff}}$ rising from $\sim 1.5$ to $2.9$ over our redshift span. We study two systematics that could affect the bias derivation: stellar contamination and the redshift distribution assumed in the theoretical modeling. The former has a negligible effect, whereas the latter significantly impacts the derived $b(z)$, emphasizing the importance of redshift calibration. Our work is the first cosmological application of quasars selected from KiDS and paves the way for future extensions in the final KiDS DR5, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, or the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the baryon budget in the X-ray-emitting circumgalactic medium of Milky Way-mass galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.17313]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations with SRG/eROSITA have revealed the average X-ray surface brightness profile of the X-ray-emitting circumgalactic medium (CGM) around Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies, offering valuable insights into the baryon mass in these systems. However, the estimation of the baryon mass depends critically on several assumptions regarding the gas density profile, temperature, metallicity, and the underlying halo mass distribution. Here, we assess how these assumptions affect the inferred baryon mass of the X-ray-emitting CGM in MW-mass galaxies, based on the stacked eROSITA signal. We find that variations in temperature profiles and uncertainties in the halo mass introduce the dominant sources of uncertainty, resulting in X-ray-emitting baryon mass estimates that vary by nearly a factor of four ($0.8-3.5\times10^{11} M_\odot$). Assumptions about metallicity contribute an additional uncertainty of approximately $50\%$. We emphasize that accurate X-ray spectral constraints on gas temperature and metallicity, along with careful modeling of halo mass uncertainty, are essential for accurately estimating the baryon mass for MW-mass galaxies. Future X-ray microcalorimeter missions will be crucial for determining the hot CGM properties and closing the baryon census at the MW-mass scale.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17334" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulating Disky Broad Line Region Reverberation</a><span class="id">[2511.17334]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Variability studies of the broad emission lines of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and quasars show stochastic radial velocity variations (i.e., fluctuations in the centroid of the line), 'jitter', on timescales of weeks to months. This jitter may be intrinsic as the broad-line emitting region (BLR) reverberates from the AGN continuum. There are also coordinated variations in the width of the broad emission lines and the luminosity of the central source ('breathing' or 'anti-breathing') which remain unexplained. These can be used as a tool for testing models of the BLR. We have constructed a pipeline to simulate a disk-like BLR geometry that reverberates in response to various chosen continuum light curves and produce synthetic emission line profiles. These profiles can then be characterized by measured shape parameters (centroid velocity shift, velocity dispersion, and Pearson skewness coefficient) and compared to observed time series of those same parameters. We have found that through our pipeline, we can recreate the velocity jitter at similar variations found in observations. The computational tools presented in this paper will also be applicable to case studies of quasars observed under the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Black Hole Mapper reverberation mapping program. This paper is the first in a series of papers – in this paper, we present the model and pipeline, and in future papers, we will present applications.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17385" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovering periodic and repeating nuclear transients in the XMM-Newton archives</a><span class="id">[2511.17385]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The regions around massive black holes can show X-ray variability on timescales from seconds to decades.

X-ray catalogues with hundreds of thousands of detections are treasure troves of such sources, which require innovative methods to identify these black holes. We present the current XMM-Newton catalogues available and describe several examples of tidal disruption events (TDEs) and quasi-periodic eruption sources that have been found whilst mining this data. We describe preliminary work on a search for periodic variables in the XMM-Newton EPIC archival data, with the example of finding new massive black hole binaries.

We find a steady increase in the correlation length $r_0$ with redshift, i.e. $r_0 = 6.8 \pm 0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $0 \leq z &lt; 1$, $r_0=8.0 \pm 0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $1 \leq z &lt; 2$, $r_0=10.8 \pm 0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $2 \leq z &lt; 3$, and $r_0=13.9 \pm 1.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $3 \leq z &lt; 4$, and slopes consistent with $\gamma \approx 2$. Our measurements suggest a slightly weaker clustering signal at $z&gt;3$ than previous studies, and thus we find a smooth, monotonic rise in clustering strength. Using a bias-halo mass relation and a step-function for the halo occupation distribution, we infer characteristic minimum halo masses of quasar hosts of $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{min}}/M_\odot) \approx 12.8$ across all redshifts. Combining these with the observed quasar number densities yields duty cycles that rise from $f_{\mathrm{duty}} \approx 2\%$ to $\approx 7\%$ with increasing redshift, corresponding to integrated quasar lifetimes of $t_{\rm QSO}\sim10^8$ years. These results suggest that both the characteristic halo mass of active quasars and their typical lifetimes have remained remarkably stable over more than $12 \sim$ Gyr of cosmic time, implying a self-regulated growth process largely independent of epoch.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effect of local environment on Ly$α$ line profile in DESI/ODIN LAEs</a><span class="id">[2511.17498]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Lyman-Alpha Emitters (LAEs) are star-forming galaxies with significant Ly$\alpha$ emission and are often used as tracers of large-scale structure at high redshift. We explore the relationship between the Ly$\alpha$ line profile and environmental density with spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) of LAEs selected with narrow-band photometry through the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey. We use LAE surface density maps in the N419 (z $\sim$ 2.45) and N501 (z $\sim$ 3.12) narrow bands to probe the relationship between local environmental density and the Ly$\alpha$ line profile. In both narrow bands, we stack the LAE spectra in bins of environmental density and inside and outside of protocluster regions. The N501 data shows $\sim$15% higher Ly$\alpha$ line luminosity for galaxies in protoclusters, suggesting increased star formation in these regions. However, the line luminosity is not appreciably greater in protocluster galaxies in the N419 band, suggesting a potential redshift evolution of this effect. The shape of the line profile itself does not vary with environmental density, suggesting that line shape changes are caused by local effects independent of a galaxy's environment. These data indicate a potential relationship between LAE local environmental density, ionized gas distribution, and Ly$\alpha$ line luminosity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06221" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tantalizing Case of the Quasar J0950+5128 – I.

The line profile also becomes broader over time, necessitating careful measurements. We present robust H$\beta$ velocity shift measurements obtained via cross correlation, applied to both the full spectra and to isolated broad H$\beta$ components derived from spectral decomposition. Alongside the spectroscopic analyses, we examine the light curves for variability consistent with the spectroscopic trends. Using Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis we find no significant periodic signal. We consider several interpretations for the observed changes, including a binary supermassive black hole, dust-cloud obscuration, outflows, a recoiling black hole, and a single perturbed, disk-like broad-line region. Of these, we disfavor all but the binary and perturbed broad-line region scenarios. As the binary explanation is the only one testable with current data, we incorporate radial velocity ”jitter” to emulate typical quasar variability, and fit the radial velocity curve with a Keplerian orbit model. Within the binary framework, the available observations trace only a segment of the putative orbit. Thus, the fit yields a period of 33 years (observed frame) and an eccentricity of 0.65, with lower limits on the semi-major axis and black hole mass of $10^{-2}\;$pc and $10^7\;{\rm M}_\odot$, respectively. Thus, J0950$+$5128 is a compelling supermassive binary candidate. The single, perturbed broad-line region interpretation remains viable but requires additional observations and modeling for further testing. Continued monitoring is essential to further evaluate the credentials of this quasar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04457" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A systematic search for AGN obscuration variability in the Chandra archive</a><span class="id">[2506.04457]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nature of the obscuring material in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be studied by measuring changes in the line-of-sight column density, $N_{\rm H,los}$, over time. This can be accomplished by monitoring AGN over long periods of time and at all timescales. However, this can only be done for a few selected objects as it is resource intensive. Therefore, the best option currently is to focus on population statistics based on the available archival data. In this work, we study 79 Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies from the Milliquas catalog to estimate a lower limit on the fraction of sources in the local $(z&lt;0.1)$ universe that display spectral variability among observations. We find that 43 sources $(54\pm11\%)$, show indications of $N_{\rm H,los}$ variability at 90% confidence level. Interestingly, we also find that the variable fraction is similar for both Seyfert 1 $(f_{\rm Sy1}\sim61^{+13}_{-15}\%)$ and Seyfert 2 $(f_{\rm Sy2}\sim47\pm15\%)$ galaxies. The slightly higher $f_{\rm Sy1}$ fraction could be due to either a physical difference in the obscurers or the higher data quality in the Sy1 population. We also search for potential dependencies on the timescale between variable and non-variable observation pairs within a given source. In agreement with previous studies, we find evidence that more variability occurs on longer timescales than on shorter timescales. We present the 43 variable sources as a promising sample for future $N_{\rm H}$ variability studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The properties of primordially-seeded black holes and their hosts in the first billion years: implications for JWST</a><span class="id">[2506.08116]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have opened a tantalising new window onto possible black holes as early as redshifts of $z \sim 10.4$. These show a number of puzzling properties including unexpectedly massive black holes in place by $z \sim 10$ and inexplicably high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.1$. These pose a serious challenge for &quot;astrophysical&quot; seeding and growth models that we aim to explain with “cosmological&quot; primordial black holes (PBHs) in this work. We present PHANES, an analytic framework that follows the evolution of dark matter halos, and their baryons in the first billion years, seeded by a population of PBHs with seed masses between $10^{0.5}-10^6 M_\odot$. PBH seeded models yield a black hole mass function that extends between $10^{1.25-11.25} ~(10^{0.75-7.25})M_\odot$ at $z \sim 5 (15)$ for the different models considered in this work. Interestingly, PBH-seeded models (with spin $s=0$ or $-1$) naturally result in extremely high values of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.25$ at $z \sim 5-15$. For a typical stellar mass of $M_* =10^9 M_\odot$, we find an average value of $M_{\rm BH}/M_* \sim 0.4~ (1.6)$ for $s=0~(-1)$ at $z=5$, providing a smoking gun for PBH-seeded models. Another particularity of PBH-seeded models is their ability of producing systems with high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios that are extremely metal poor ($Z \leq 10^{-2}~Z_\odot$). Yielding a PBH-to-dark matter fraction $\leq 10^{-9}$ and a stellar mass function that lies four orders of magnitude below observations, our model is in accord with all current cosmological and astrophysical bounds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational lensing of fast radio bursts: prospects for probing microlens populations in lensing galaxies</a><span class="id">[2507.20305]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational lensing by a stellar microlens of mass $M$ forms two images separated by micro-arcseconds on the sky and has a time delay of $2\times10^{-5}(M/{\rm M_\odot})$ seconds. Although we cannot resolve such micro-images in the sky, they could be resolved in time if the source is a fast radio burst (FRB). In this work, we study the magnification ($|\mu|$) and time delay ($t_d$) distributions of micro-images led by different microlens populations. We find that, in microlensing of typical strongly lensed (macro-)images in galaxy lenses, micro-images stemmed from a population of stellar mass microlenses in the $[0.08, 1.5]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range and a second (dark) microlens population in $[10^{-3} - 10^{-2}]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range reside in different parts of $|\mu|-t_d$ plane. For the global minimum macro-image, due to low stellar mass density, we find that the stellar population leads to peaks in autocorrelation at ${&gt;}10^{-6}$ seconds, whereas the secondary population leads to peaks at ${&lt;}10^{-6}$ seconds, allowing us to differentiate different microlens populations. However, an increase in stellar density introduces new peaks at ${&lt;}10^{-6}$ seconds, which can pollute the inference about the presence of multiple microlens populations. In addition, we also show that the number of micro-images, hence the number of peaks in the autocorrelation, is also sensitive to the underlying stellar mass function, allowing us to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) with FRB microlesning in the future. This work is a first step towards using FRB lensing to probe the microlens population within strong lenses, and more detailed studies are required to assess the effect of various uncertainties that we only discussed qualitatively.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Death by Impact: Evidence for Merger-Driven Quenching in a Collisional Ring Galaxy at Cosmic Noon</a><span class="id">[2509.12308]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The role of interactions and mergers in the rapid quenching of massive galaxies in the early Universe remains uncertain, largely due to the difficulty of directly linking mergers to quenching. Collisional ring galaxies provide a unique opportunity, as their morphology allows precise dating of the interaction, which can then be compared to quenching timescales inferred from star formation histories. We study a gravitationally bound system at $z=1.61$ in the UDS field, composed of a Host galaxy ($M_\star = 10^{11.4} M_\odot$) with a collisional ring and an X-ray AGN, and the Bullet galaxy ($M_\star = 10^{11.2} M_\odot$), located at a projected distance of $\sim 8$ kpc. Combining JWST and HST imaging with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, we find compelling evidence for an ongoing starburst in the Host concurrent with rapid quenching in the Bullet. The ring, $\sim 20$ kpc in diameter, is expanding at $127^{+72}_{-29}$ km s$^{-1}$, implying the galaxies first collided 47–96 Myr ago. This timeline is consistent with the Host's current starburst and the Bullet's sudden quenching, strongly suggesting both phenomena were triggered by the interaction. Crucially, the Bullet shows no evidence of a preceding starburst, ruling out rapid gas consumption as the primary quenching channel. Instead, we suggest that merger-driven processes – such as enhanced turbulence and disk instabilities – may have suppressed star formation. An additional possibility, which we term the “Dragon Effect,” is that AGN-driven outflows from the Host disrupted the Bullet's low-density molecular gas, thereby preventing efficient star formation and accelerating quenching.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08815" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LATIS Data Release: $\sim4200$ Spectra of $z \sim 2-3$ Galaxies, Redshifts, and Intergalactic Medium Tomography Maps</a><span class="id">[2510.08815]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the data release of the Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), one of the largest optical spectroscopic surveys of faint high-redshift galaxies.

Although PAHs are known to form in the circumstellar envelopes of post-AGB stars, their formation and evolution are still not well-understood. We aim to understand how pristine complex hydrocarbons and PAHs in circumstellar environments transition to the PAHs observed in the ISM. The mid-infrared PAH spectra (5-18 micron) of the planetary nebula, NGC 7027, are investigated using spectral cubes from JWST MIRI-MRS. We report the first detection of spatially-resolved variations of the PAH spectral profiles across class A, AB, and B in all major PAH bands (6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.2 micron) within a single source, NGC 7027. These variations are linked to morphological structures within NGC 7027. Clear correlations are revealed between the 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 micron features, where the red components (6.26, 7.8, 8.65 micron) exhibit a strong correlation and the same is found for the blue components of the 6.2 and 7.7 (6.205 and 7.6 micron). The blue component of the 8.6 (8.56 micron) appears to be independent of the other components. We link this behaviour to differences in molecular structure of their PAH subpopulations. Decomposition of the 11.2 micron band confirms two previously identified components, with the broader 11.25 micron component attributed to emission from very small grains of PAH clusters rather than PAH emission. We show that PAH profile classes generally vary with proximity to the central star's UV radiation field, suggesting class B PAHs represent more processed species while class A PAHs remain relatively pristine, challenging current notions on the spectral evolution of PAHs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06755" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redshift-Frame Systematics and Their Impact on the Hubble Constant from Pantheon+ Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2511.06755]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform a full-sky, covariance-weighted quantification of redshift-frame systematics in the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova sample with the explicit goal of determining whether such effects can meaningfully bias the inferred Hubble constant.

The observations are part of the MeerKAT Fornax Survey and cover a 4 x 4 deg^2 field, corresponding to   Rvir. The 3$\sigma$ detection limit is log(MHI/Msun) = 5.7 for a 50 km/s-wide point source. We detect HI in 35 galaxies and 44 clouds with no optical counterparts. Using deep optical images from the Fornax Deep Survey, we show that the clouds are a distinct population, separated by a four magnitude gap from the faintest HI-detected galaxies. The majority (33 out of 44) of the clouds are associated with the two galaxies with the most HI in the cluster – NGC 1365 and NGC 1427A, although the clouds contribute a negligible amount to the total MHI budget. By performing a SNR analysis and computing the Rauzy statistic on the HI detections, we demonstrate that our catalogue is complete down log(MHI/Msun) = 6, and we are therefore able to probe the HIMF down to this level. We find an abrupt drop of the number density of HI-detected galaxies at log(MHI/Msun) = 7, signifying a clear absence of galaxies between 6 &lt; log(MHI/Msun) &lt; 7. We use the modified maximum likelihood method to fit a Schechter function down to log(MHI/Msun) &gt; 7, the range where the HIMF follows a power-law. The measured low-mass slope is $\alpha$ = -1.31 $\pm$ 0.13, with a characteristic knee mass of log(M*/Msun) = 10.52 $\pm$ 1.89. The low-mass slope matches the slope in the field, while the knee is defined by a single galaxy and is unconstrained. Below log(MHI/Msun) = 7, there is a sharp departure from a Schechter function, and we report the first robust measurement of the collapse of a HIMF. For the HIMF below log(MHI/Msun) = 7 to follow a power-law, tens of galaxies are needed – a factor   six higher than what is observed. The collapse of the Fornax HIMF is likely due to the rapid removal of HI from low-mass galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24897" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observable signature of magnetic tidal coupling in hierarchical triple systems</a><span class="id">[2510.24897]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study hierarchical triple systems formed by a compact binary orbiting a supermassive black hole (SMBH), focusing on the role of relativistic magnetic tidal interactions.

We therefore advocate for investigations of formation conditions that establish planetary chemistry, and by extension, habitability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16749" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Validation of optical pathlength stability in a LISA test-bench demonstrator</a><span class="id">[2511.16749]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observatory is a future L3 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) to detect gravitational waves, set to launch in 2035. The detector constellation will conduct interferometry to picometer stability over an unprecedented arm length of 2.5 million km. In this paper, we present the development and testing results for the Zerodur interferometer (ZIFO), an optical demonstrator built to validate critical technology for the test setup of the interferometric core of LISA. Optical path length stability measurements on the ZIFO demonstrate successful reduction of bench noise to maintain the 10 pm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ specification across the 1 mHz to 1 Hz frequency band. We also identify and characterize dominant noise sources from phasemeters and correlations of beam tilt into the path length that were observed during the test campaign.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16750" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLAWDIA: A dictionary learning framework for gravitational-wave data analysis</a><span class="id">[2511.16750]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Deep-learning methods are becoming increasingly important in gravitational-wave data analysis, yet their performance often relies on large training datasets and models whose internal representations are difficult to interpret. Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) offers a complementary approach: it performs well in scarce-data regimes and yields physically interpretable representations of gravitational-wave morphology. Here we present CLAWDIA (Comprehensive Library for the Analysis of Waves via Dictionary-based Algorithms), an open-source Python framework that integrates SDL-based denoising and classification under realistic detector noise. We systematise previously isolated SDL workflows into a unified, modular environment with a consistent, user-friendly interface. The current release provides several time-domain denoising strategies based on LASSO-regularised sparse coding and a classifier based on Low-Rank Shared Dictionary Learning. A companion toolbox, GWADAMA, supports dataset construction and realistic conditioning of real and simulated interferometer data. We demonstrate CLAWDIA's performance by denoising the signal from binary neutron star event GW170817 and by classifying families of instrumental glitches from LIGO's third observing run, highlighting robustness at low signal-to-noise ratios. CLAWDIA is intended as a community-driven, interoperable library extensible to additional tasks, including detection and parameter estimation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16754" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data-Driven Stellar Spectral Modelling with GSPICE</a><span class="id">[2511.16754]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spectral data reduction pipelines deal with a wide variety of challenges including masking cosmic rays, calibrating wavelength solutions, and estimating background noise while trying to remain model-agnostic. Traditional methods rely on hardware-specific code or pre-calculated stellar model templates to solve this problem, making them model-dependent and not suitable for large datasets that may contain new classes of objects. To solve this problem, we present a flexible, data-driven method: the GausSian PIxelwise Conditional Estimator (GSPICE) that models an ensemble of spectra as a multivariate Gaussian and estimates the expected value and expected variance of each pixel in each spectrum conditional on others. GSPICE compares observed fluxes and errors to its own flux and error estimates to reveal outliers, which then can be completely masked or replaced by their estimates. We apply GSPICE to 3.9 million stellar spectra from the LAMOST survey, and show that variations of the method can directly identify and correct both individual pixel-level outliers (e.g., from cosmic ray hits) as well as extended systematic features (e.g., from incorrect wavelength calibrations), while still providing a novel characterization of the true per-pixel measurement uncertainties. We also demonstrate how GSPICE can take advantage of data partitioning with an application to diffuse interstellar bands. Implementations of GSPICE in both Python and IDL can be found here this http URL .</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Investigation of Systematic Effects from Background Priors on PSR J0740$+$6620 Radius Estimates using Synthetic NICER and XMM-Newton Data</a><span class="id">[2511.16759]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurate and precise measurements of neutron star radii provide invaluable information about the cold, dense matter in neutron star cores. Analyses of synthetic X-ray pulse waveform data similar to the data obtained from non-accreting neutron stars using the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) have indicated that mass and radius estimates made using such data are robust against some systematic errors that may be made when modeling these data, such as errors in the assumed pattern of the thermal X-ray emission from the surface of these stars. A potentially important but so far unexplored source of systematic error is misparameterization of unmodulated background components, which can bias the inferred radius, particularly when data from different telescopes are used in the analysis. In this study, we investigate the effects of the background model on radius estimates by jointly analyzing synthetic NICER and XMM-Newton data, using the $\sim 2.1~M_\odot$ pulsar PSR J0740$+$6620 as a prototypical example. Our analysis shows that even if the background assumed in the model underestimates the actual background by a factor of more than five, the resulting shift of the radius posterior from the true value of the radius corresponds to only $\sim1\sigma$. In all the cases we examined, the Bayesian evidence for the correct background model is greater than for the incorrect background model. These results add to the evidence that analyses of NICER-like data provide accurate measurements of neutron star radii when the statistical sampling is thorough and the model fits the data well.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord of the (sub-)Rings : Mapping the surface reflectance and spin-axis of Ajisai</a><span class="id">[2511.16780]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Active debris removal techniques are posed to become an important tool in maintaining the safety of the near-Earth space environment. These techniques rely on a clear understanding of the rotational motion of the debris targets, which is challenging to constrain from unresolved imaging. The Ajisai satellite provides an ideal test case for developing and demonstrating these techniques due to its simple geometry and well constrained spin behaviour. We present four observations of the Ajisai satellite taken with SuperWASP in August of 2019, where high cadence photometry was extracted from streaked images as a part of a larger survey of Low Earth Orbit. We develop an MCMC-driven method to determine the spin-state of Ajisai by comparing the alignment between a map of modelled mirror positions and a novel derived map of surface reflectivity. We generally find good agreement within the expectation and uncertainties set by empirical models and our determined spin-state solutions align the surface reflectivity map and modelled mirror location well. Our results show that streak photometry can be used to recover the spin-axis and rotation period of fast-spinning objects such as Ajisai using modest ground-based instrumentation, making it readily scalable to a wider range of targets and observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSpyNetTreeS: a machine learning solution for glitch localization in time and frequency</a><span class="id">[2511.16861]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Data from ground-based gravitational wave detectors are often contaminated by non-Gaussian instrumental artifacts or detector noise transients. Unbiased source property estimation relies on the ability to correctly identify and characterize these artifacts and remove them if necessary. To this end, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has implemented candidate vetting for all significant candidates to identify the presence of artifacts and assess the need for mitigation. The current candidate vetting process requires human experts to identify the frequency ranges and the time windows associated with any data quality issues present. Differences in judgment between human experts may cause inconsistency, making results difficult to reproduce across gravitational wave events. We present GSpyNetTreeS, an extension to GSpyNetTree based on the You Only Look Once algorithm, for the automatic detection, classification, and time-frequency localization of detector noise transients. As a proof of concept, we tested GSpyNetTreeS's performance on the data collected by the LIGO detectors during the third observing run for gravitational waves as well as common detector glitch classes included in GSpyNetTree: Blip, Low frequency blip, Low frequency line and Scratchy. We also demonstrated that GSpyNetTreeS is capable of accurately identifying common glitch classes and capturing the frequency and time information associated with detected detector noise transients, establishing its potential as an automatic event validation tool for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's observing runs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast far-sidelobe modeling for centimeter to sub-millimeter astrophysical observations</a><span class="id">[2511.16967]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Next-generation centimeter to sub-millimeter telescopes require exquisite control over instrumental far-sidelobe response to accurately measure faint signals like the Cosmic Microwave Background B modes.

The next frontier for science archives is to enable searches not only on observational metadata, but also on the content of the observations themselves. As a step in this direction, we have implemented morphological image similarity search into the ALMA Science Archive (ASA). To achieve this we use self-supervised contrastive affine-transformation-independent representation learning of source morphologies with a deep neural network. For a given image on the ASA web interface, astronomers are presented with a summary view of the morphologically most similar images. Each time an astronomer selects an additional image from that view, the display is instantly updated to show the images most similar to the combination of the selected images. Each selection thus refines the similarity display according to the scientific needs of the astronomer. This is the first time image similarity search has been offered in an astronomical science archive.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Ground to Space: An Overview of the JEM-EUSO Program for the Study of UHECRs and Astrophysical Neutrinos</a><span class="id">[2511.17139]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The JEM-EUSO (Joint Exploratory Missions for Extreme Universe Space Observatory) collaboration is an international initiative studying ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and related phenomena. These particles, with energies exceeding 10$^{20}$ eV, provide insights into extreme astrophysical processes but remain challenging to detect due to their low flux. At the heart of JEM-EUSO's technology is an ultra-fast, highly sensitive UV camera capable of detecting EASs in the atmosphere with exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. A dedicated Cherenkov camera has been developed to evaluate the viability of the Earth-skimming technique from high altitudes. Fluorescence and Cherenkov detectors can be used together to create a hybrid detection surface. This innovative approach enables detailed studies of fluorescence and Cherenkov light from cosmic ray and neutrino interactions. The JEM-EUSO technology will allow for observations from space to significantly increase the exposure to these rare phenomena. The collaboration employs a multi-platform strategy with ground-based experiments like EUSO-TA calibrating detection systems and validating models, and balloon-borne missions such as EUSO-Balloon and EUSO-SPB1/SPB2 demonstrating observations from the stratosphere and testing technologies. Space-based missions, particularly Mini-EUSO on the ISS, have provided valuable data on UV backgrounds, TLEs, and meteoroids, as well as demonstrating the potential for future space-based detection. While we are developing a cross-platform methodology, we are ultimately moving towards space-based measurements. Future efforts include the POEMMA space mission, designed for stereoscopic observations of UHECRs and multi-messenger phenomena, the PBR experiment, which integrates radio detection and is scheduled to fly in 2027, and the M-EUSO satellite mission, proposed to ESA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO): Options for robust Deep Spectral Line Imaging in the SKA-Era</a><span class="id">[2511.17307]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The data storage requirements for deep spectral line observations with next-generation radio interferometers like the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are extremely challenging. The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\% of the true {\HI} flux. In contrast, our \textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17363" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Learning Analysis of Ions Accelerated at Shocks</a><span class="id">[2511.17363]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the application of deep learning techniques to the analysis and classification of ions accelerated at collisionless shocks in hybrid (kinetic ions–fluid electrons) simulations.

These classifications were used to train deep learning models to predict which particles are injected into the acceleration process with high accuracy (&gt;90%), using only time series of the local magnetic field they experienced during their initial interaction with the shock.

The de-facto standard algorithm, the Cotton-Schwab CLEAN, is iteratively switching between computing a deconvolution (minor loop) and subtracting the model from the visibilities (major loop). The next generation of radio interferometers is expected to deal with much higher data rates, image sizes and sensitivity, making an acceleration of current data processing algorithms necessary. We aim to achieve this by evaluating the potential of various well-known acceleration techniques in convex optimization to the major loop. For the present manuscript, we limit the scope to study these techniques only in the CLEAN framework. To this end, we identify CLEAN with a Newton scheme, and use this chain of arguments backwards to express Nesterov acceleration and conjugate gradient orthogonalization in the major and minor loop framework. The resulting algorithms are simple extensions of the traditional framework, but converge multiple times faster than traditional techniques, and reduce the residual significantly deeper. These improvements achieved by accelerating the major loop are competitive to well-known improvements by replacing the minor loop with more advanced algorithms, but at lower numerical cost. The best performance is achieved by combining these two this http URL remains among the fastest and most robust algorithms for imaging in radio interferometry, and can be easily extended to an almost an order of magnitude faster convergence speed and dynamic range. The procedure outlined in this manuscript is relatively straightforward and could be easily extended.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Performance Simulations for Kola: Achieving High-Resolution, Visible-Light AO Correction Over a 1 Arcminute Field</a><span class="id">[2511.17488]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present performance simulations for a proposed visible-light, multi-conjugate adaptive optics system for the 10-meter W.

Generating a 10 x 10 pixel map of a 1 R_E world at 10 pc demands  0.85 uas angular resolution and photon-collection sufficient for SNR &gt;= 5 per micro-pixel. We derived diffraction-limit and photon-budget requirements for: (1) large single-aperture space telescopes with internal coronagraphs; (2) external starshades; (3) space-based interferometry (nulling and non-nulling); (4) ground-based ELTs with extreme AO; (5) pupil-densified &quot;hypertelescopes&quot;; (6) indirect reconstructions (rotational light-curve inversion, eclipse mapping, intensity interferometry); (7) diffraction occultation by Solar System bodies. Even though these approaches serve their primary goals – exoplanet discovery and initial coarse characterization – each remains orders of magnitude away from delivering a spatially resolved image. In every case, technology readiness falls short, and fundamental barriers leave them 2-5 orders of magnitude below the angular-resolution and photon-budget thresholds to map an Earth analog even on decadal timescales. Ultimately, an in-situ platform delivered to &lt;= 0.1 AU of the target could, in principle, overcome both diffraction and photon-starvation limits – but such a mission far exceeds current propulsion, autonomy, and communications capabilities. By contrast, the Solar Gravitational Lens – providing on-axis gain of  1e10 and inherent uas-scale focusing once an imaging spacecraft reaches heliocentric distances beyond &gt;= 550 AU – is uniquely capable of simultaneously meeting both the resolution and photon-budget requirements. Once mission-specific risks (coronal calibration, focal-plane scanning, deconvolution) are retired, the SGL enables true, resolved surface images and spatially resolved spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood.</p></div></details></article></body>
