Properties of SMC late-O and B supergiants reveal the metallicity dependence of winds in the Magellanic Clouds</a><span class="id">[2602.20239]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Considering the physics of radiation-driven winds of massive stars, the wind properties should depend on the metal content of the stellar atmosphere. Therefore, studying the winds of massive stars in different metallicities provides a sanity check on prescriptions that are widely used in evolutionary calculations. We obtained the stellar and wind properties of a sample of 20 late-O and B supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) from a quantitative combined UV and optical spectroscopic analysis using CMFGEN. By comparing these properties with those of a Large Magellanic Cloud counterpart study, which has a similar sample and data, and employed the same modelling techniques used in this study, We derived a metallicity-dependent recipe for wind momentum, which is applicable for $5.4 \leq \log{L_{\rm bol}/L_{\odot}} \leq6.1$ and $14 \leq T_{\rm eff}/{\rm kK} \leq 32$. We find a significant dependence of the wind momentum on the metallicity, which is largely due to the mass-loss rates. We do not find any evidence of a discontinuity in either the mass-loss rate or the ratio of the terminal wind velocity to the escape velocity between $25$ and $21$ kK, which could be attributed to the bi-stability jump. Stellar parameters are consistent across different methods and radiative transfer codes, whereas mass-loss rates differ significantly, with our values being generally lower. We find a discrepancy between the evolutionary and spectroscopic masses in $40\%$ of our sample, with the evolutionary mass usually being systematically higher. The mass-loss rates of blue supergiants are far too low to strip the stellar envelope and the subsequent formation of classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, leading to the conclusion that luminous blue variable eruptions or binary interactions are necessary to explain the characteristics of the WR population in the SMC.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMA Central Molecular Zone Exploration Survey (ACES) II: 3mm continuum images</a><span class="id">[2602.20240]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ALMA Central Molecular Zone Exploration Survey, ACES, has mapped $\gtrsim1000$ square arcminutes at 3 mm toward the center of our Galaxy. ACES provides the first large-scale, high-resolution ($\sim2.5$&quot;) view of the central $\sim200$ parsecs of the Milky Way. In this work, we describe the continuum data processing and present the continuum data products. In the combined mosaic of 45 individual ALMA mosaics, the typical RMS noise achieved is $\sim0.1$ mJy per $\sim2.5$&quot; beam, though there is a tail of substantially higher noise toward regions with bright continuum structure, especially around Sgr A* and Sgr B2. In-band spectral indices are measurable for a small fraction of the brightest and most compact sources, enabling distinction between dust-dominated and free-free- or synchrotron-dominated sources. To recover emission on large angular scales, we present the GBT MUSTANG-2 Three millimeter Extended Nucleus Survey (TENS), a new 10&quot;resolution survey of the CMZ, which we combine with the ACES image by feathering. To demonstrate the quality and reliability of the ACES data, we compare to previously-published ALMA data obtained with higher resolution and sensitivity, finding overall good agreement with past results, but some disagreement toward the brightest sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20241" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: Chemical Abundance Comparison Between the ISM and CGM of Main-Sequence Galaxies at z=4-6</a><span class="id">[2602.20241]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gaseous halos around galaxies play an important role in galaxy evolution. The exchange of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the circumgalactic medium (CGM) are caused by the formation, feedback, and/or merging history of galaxies. We study the variation in chemical composition between the ISM ($\lesssim3\,$kpc) and CGM ($\sim5-10\,$kpc) for a sample of $M_{\star}&gt;10^{9.5}\,M_{\odot}$ main-sequence galaxies at $4&lt;z&lt;6$ with both JWST and ALMA observations. Using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy, we derive the optical line ratios from the ISM and the CGM for our sample focusing on the typical optical lines used for metallicity studies. Our comparison shows that the ISM and the CGM have similar chemical abundances. This indicates that the CGM of these typical $4&lt;z&lt;6$ galaxies is enriched to the level of their ISM in the early universe. Using statistical tests, we find that some of the line ratios show marginal differences between the ISM and CGM. Combined with \texttt{Cloudy} modeling, our results suggest that a difference in ionization level (higher for the ISM) is the dominant reason for the observed ratio difference of oxygen line ratios. There is also indication of a deficit in the nitrogen abundance with respect to oxygen in the CGM, which suggests a delay in redistribution of secondary nitrogen. Finally, an enhanced $F_{[\rm CII]\rm 158\mu m}/F_{\rm H\alpha}$ ratio is observed in the CGM, suggesting that feedback and/or mergers play a key role in metal mixing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical friction on binary stars in dark matter dominated environments</a><span class="id">[2602.20245]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study binary stars moving through a uniform dark matter background and experiencing dynamical friction. The centre-of-mass motion of the pairs is taken into account. We derive formulas and timescales for the secular evolution of the orbital parameters for both wide and close binaries. We apply these results to environments typical of dark matter dominated ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and show that some binaries undergo significant eccentricity oscillations, while their semi-major axes decrease more gradually. We consider a simple binary star population and find that dynamical friction, notably, can enhance the bias from unresolved binaries in velocity dispersion measurements. With future, more detailed theoretical studies and improving observational capabilities, binary stars may serve as a tool to probe the dark matter content of some of the faintest galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Red Dots: One Photometric Tag Concealing Diverse Spectroscopic Flavors of Massive Star Formation and Black Hole Activity</a><span class="id">[2602.20247]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We compile JWST/NIRSpec prism and MIRI data for 249 Little Red Dots (LRDs) at $2.3&lt;z&lt;9.3$, forming a representative spectroscopic subset of NIRCam-selected LRDs. We derive a median stacked spectrum covering rest-frame 0.09-1.2 $\mu$m, with MIRI photometry extending the spectral energy distribution to 4 $\mu$m. Four additional stacks for subsamples defined by optical-to-UV luminosity ratios show that LRDs form a heterogeneous population spanning diverse continuum slopes and line properties. Assuming LRDs host super-massive black holes (BHs) surrounded by dense gas clouds, and stars accompany this core, we infer masses of $M_{BH}\sim10^{6.0-6.5}$ M$_\odot$ and $M_\bigstar\sim10^{8.3}$ M$_\odot$, corresponding to BH-to-stellar mass ratios of 1-2%. The stacks show ubiquitous UV and optical FeII emission, indicating a direct view of the broad-line region and high (but sub-Eddington) accretion ($\lambda_{Edd}=0.6\pm0.2$). We find a significant stellar contribution in the far-UV, reaching $\sim80$% in the bluest systems. Possible Wolf-Rayet features (HeII$\lambda$4687, nitrogen lines) are identified, tracing a young (3-7 Myr) compact starburst event. We also detect strong Balmer breaks and atypical Balmer, Paschen, [OIII], and optical and near-infrared HeI line ratios, and an absorption at $\sim4550$ Angstrom (probably linked to FeII), all consistent with radiative-transfer effects in high-density gas with warm temperatures (4000-7000 K). We find a diversity of LRD flavors modulated by the luminosity ratio between between a short ($\lesssim20$ Myr) and intense phase of BH activity, the most extreme stage lasting $\sim3-7$ Myr, characterized by near-Eddington-limit radiation, and a nuclear and compact starburst dominated by massive stars (even super-massive, $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{SMS}\sim10^{5}$ M$_\odot$), all embedded in dense gas with modest dust content producing a variety of optical depths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess from a Generic Triaxial Halo</a><span class="id">[2602.20252]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent studies of Galactic surveys, such as Gaia, have revealed that the Milky Way's gravitational potential comes from a matter distribution that is triaxial and rotated with respect to the Galactic center-Sun axis. This, in turn, could mean that the dark matter halo also shares these properties. In this work, by fitting to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations, we test the compatibility of the morphology of the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) from dark matter annihilation with a triaxial dark matter halo. In particular, we consider both untilted triaxial halos and halos whose principal axes are tilted with respect to the Galactic disk. In our fits of the Fermi-LAT data, by testing over a large library of galactic diffuse emission models, we quantify how the halo triaxiality and tilt affect the line-of-sight-integrated annihilation signal and, consequently, the preferred GCE spatial templates. We find that the GCE spectrum and inner cuspiness are robust against variations in the triaxiality and tilt of the dark matter halo. However, in terms of its overall morphology, the GCE in the gamma-ray data can discriminate between choices for the dark matter halo's triaxiality and tilt. Finally, we find that the GCE is more compatible with originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of dark matter than originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of stars, a result important for understanding the GCE's origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The First Systematic Survey of Stellar Halos in High-Inclination Galaxies Reveals Unusually Quiescent Merger Histories of Nearby Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2602.20258]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar halos are the only major stellar component of disk galaxies that lack systematic observational characterization, yet they encode critical information about galaxy merger histories. We present the first systematic census of stellar halos in a large, flux-limited sample of 169 high-inclination central galaxies with stellar masses 7.3 &lt;= log Mstar/Msun &lt;= 11.0 and redshift z &lt; 0.1, using HSC-SSP Deep optical images. Stellar halos are detected in 93 galaxies, primarily through their low isophotal ellipticities in the outskirts, improving upon conventional methods of stellar halo identification. The halo detection rate reaches   50% at log Mstar/Msun &gt; 9.9 and &gt;= 70% for Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. We derive halo surface brightness profiles, colors, and masses, finding that stellar halos generally follow power-law radial profiles. Higher-mass galaxies, on average, exhibit smaller power-law indices and larger halo mass fractions, indicating more extended halos and more active merger histories. A significant stellar halo color-mass correlation, driven mainly by the mass-metallicity relation, suggests dominance by a few massive accretion events. MW-mass galaxies have a median stellar halo fraction of 10% +/- 5%. Among nearby galaxies with halo measurements within 25 Mpc, two thirds (including the MW) lie below the mean stellar halo fraction-galaxy mass relation. Overall, the nearby galaxies show a median halo deficit of   0.3 dex, implying unusually quiescent merger histories. We show that this deficit follows a broader trend in which typical halo fractions increase with heliocentric distance, tracking the gradual rise in matter density toward the cosmic average by z &lt;= 0.07.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMA Central molecular zone Exploration Survey (ACES) VI: ALMA Large Program Reveals a Highly Filamentary Central Molecular Zone</a><span class="id">[2602.20262]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way is the way station that primarily controls how much gas flows from the disk of the Galaxy towards the central nucleus. While this region is well documented to have extreme gas properties that clearly distinguish it from the rest of the Galaxy, the properties of the bulk molecular gas at high angular resolution are relatively unexplored. Band 3 data from the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array) large program ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) reveal the highly filamentary nature of CMZ molecular gas at high resolution (3&quot; or 0.1pc) across the entire CMZ. Visual inspection of these data suggests that there are at least two general classes of elongated structures, which we identify as: i) large-scale (10 pc) filamentary structures (LFs) and ii) a ubiquitous population of small-scale (about 1 pc) filamentary structures (SFs). We present detailed morphological and kinematic properties towards three structures in each category, as well as their association with magnetic fields and the correlation of HNCO 4(0,4)-3(0,3) with other molecular species. Our investigation reveals that these structures are largely coherent in position-position-velocity space. The alignment with the magnetic field structure is mixed, with some parallel, some perpendicular, and some intermediate alignments. We find that LFs likely trace pieces of contiguous CMZ orbital structures and are a manifestation of global CMZ dynamics. The second class, SFs, are pervasive and may be the result of complicated turbulence and shearing dynamics in the CMZ gas flows, as seen in numerical simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20272" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Willman 1 Revisited: The Kinematics, Chemistry, and Orbital Properties of a Potentially-Disrupting Dwarf Galaxy</a><span class="id">[2602.20272]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ultra-faint Milky Way satellite Willman 1 (W1; $M_V = -2.6$; $r_{\rm half} \sim27$ pc) was the first stellar over-density found via resolved stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, yet its classification as either a dwarf galaxy or star cluster remains ambiguous. Using new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy, HST/ACS photometry, and orbital modeling, we re-examine the nature of W1. From our updated sample of 57 member stars, we find that past analyses included four binaries and seven non-members, identified here using Gaia proper motions and updated velocities. We continue to find a velocity dispersion consistent with previous analyses, measuring $\sigma_v = 4.7^{+1.5}_{-1.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ from 49 stars out to $3~r_{\rm half}$. If W1 is in equilibrium, this suggests a dynamical mass of $5.9^{+3.7}_{-3.4} \times 10^5~M_{\odot}$ and a mass-to-light ratio of $(M/L)_V = 660 \pm 590$. Based on Ca II triplet measurements, we estimate an iron abundance of [Fe/H] $= -2.45^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ and a metallicity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} = 0.30^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ dex. We confirm that W1 does not exhibit mass segregation inside $\sim1~r_{\rm half}$. Our best-fit orbital model predicts that W1 is at apocenter, implying that W1 has been closer to the Milky Way in the recent past, reaching a pericentric distance $\lesssim 25$ kpc from the Galactic center $\sim0.3$ Gyr ago. Given its internal kinematics, metallicity spread, and lack of mass segregation, we conclude that W1 is a galaxy. However, given its orbit and structural properties, which suggest that W1 might be tidally disrupted, and the difficulty of identifying a pure member sample, we caution that the measured internal velocity dispersion may not accurately reflect the dynamical mass of this system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMA Central molecular zone Exploration Survey (ACES) III: Molecular line data reduction and HNCO and HCO$^{+}$ data</a><span class="id">[2602.20276]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ALMA Central molecular zone Exploration Survey (ACES) large program has observed the inner   200 pc of the Milky Way at 3 mm (Band 3) using ALMA's 12m, 7m, and Total Power arrays. With an angular resolution of   2&quot;, ACES provides a contiguous, multi-scale view of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) via the dust continuum and a suite of molecular lines. We present an overview of the molecular line data processing for ACES and describe the first data release. We showcase the HNCO (4-3) and HCO$^{+}$ (1-0) data, which were targeted at high spectral resolution (0.2 km s$^{-1}$) to trace the kinematics of the molecular gas in the CMZ. The HNCO and HCO$^{+}$ maps are compared with previous single-dish CMZ surveys and discrete ALMA observations of CMZ clouds to demonstrate the quality of the data. We highlight the ubiquity of parsec-scale, linear absorption features traced by HCO$^{+}$. Their origin is unknown, and ACES provides the first opportunity to study these enigmatic features throughout the CMZ. We release the HNCO and HCO$^{+}$ cubes for all 45 ACES fields, along with the full cube mosaics which combine all fields into a contiguous mosaic of the CMZ. We additionally provide advanced products of these full mosaics, including integrated and peak intensity, noise, and position-velocity maps. These products provide substantial legacy value for the community, offering an unparalleled view of the physical and kinematic structure of the dense gas in the CMZ.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BASS LVI. Connecting X-ray variability with AGN physical properties and a new path to Cosmological distances</a><span class="id">[2602.20315]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray variability is a well-established characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known to correlate inversely with both the supermassive black hole mass and luminosity, although the degree of each remains a topic of debate. The potential of X-ray variability as a proxy for MBH or for intrinsic LX has led to proposals to use AGN as standard candles to test cosmological models. However, the large intrinsic dispersion in these relations has limited their practical applications. In this work, we investigate the dependence of X-ray variability on AGN physical properties using a sample of 134 Seyfert 1 galaxies from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), which is the largest sample to date, more than three times larger than those used in previous studies. Contrary to earlier findings, we observe that X-ray variability correlates with luminosity just as strongly as with MBH. Furthermore, we still do not find evidence for the expected anti-correlation between variability and Eddington ratio, even when using refined bolometric luminosities from SED fitting to compute the Eddington ratio. From a cosmological perspective, the increased sample size reduces the scatter in the log(L)-log(exvar) relation to  0.63 dex - a significant improvement over previous results, but still too large to serve as competitive standard candles, when compared to SNIa (uncertainties on distances of  5-10%) or the L(X)-L(UV) relation in quasars (uncertainties of 10-12%). We tested including the width of broad emission lines as additional parameters, but found that this does not significantly lower the observed dispersion, contrary to previous studies on smaller samples. Finally, we discuss how future X-ray missions such as AXIS and NewAthena will improve this scenario by enabling precise variability measurements for thousands of AGN up to redshift z 3, thereby enabling it as a new cosmological probe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quasars behind the disk of M31 galaxy</a><span class="id">[2602.20318]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We aim to increase the limited number of quasars behind M31, necessary for probing the chemical content of the gas and for proper motion reference, with reliable and homogeneous redshift measurements from emission lines.

We confirm 23 quasars: two are new discoveries (J004029.727+403705.68 and J004215.489+412031.52) and the rest were reported elsewhere, but with somewhat deficient analysis; 16 spectra are published for the first time. We report new homogeneous redshifts for 34 quasars (from 40 spectra, adding 17 from archives) and summarize all available information about bona-fide quasars with reliable redshift, bringing their number to 124 within the mu_B=26 mag/arcsec^2 isophote. We carried out a comparison of redshifts from different sources and excluded some objects with redshifts derived from low-resolution spectra. We derive the reddening for them from the color excess with respect to dereddened counterparts with similar redshifts in the field. Comparisons of our reddenings with M31 reddening maps found no significant correlations. Most QSOs behind M31 show low reddening and do not probe high-extinctions underlining the need to identify fainter quasars behind nearby galaxies, especially behind higher extinction regions – probably due to a bias towards following up brighter and less extinct candidates. Finally, the redshifts derived from low-resolution spectra must be treated with caution, because they can contain significant errors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20340" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMA Central Molecular Zone Exploration Survey (ACES) I: Overview</a><span class="id">[2602.20340]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The mass flows and energy cycles within the inner regions of galaxies exert a powerful influence on the evolution of the galaxy population. The centre of the Milky Way is the only galactic nucleus for which it is possible to resolve the physical mechanisms that drive these cycles, namely star formation and feedback, while also tracing global (&gt;100 pc) processes which determine where and when star formation and feedback occur. We present an overview of ACES, the 'Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CMZ Exploration Survey', a  1.5&quot; angular resolution, 0.2-3 km/s spectral resolution ALMA Band 3 (85-102 GHz), survey of the 'Central Molecular Zone' (CMZ) – the inner-100 pc of the Galaxy (l = 359.4 deg to 0.8 deg). ACES spectral setup is tuned to observe optimal tracers of the physical, chemical, and kinematic conditions in over 70 spectral features (e.g. HCO+, HNCO, SiO, H40alpha, complex molecules) of the gas in the CMZ, to derive the properties of all potentially star-forming Galactic Centre gas, from global scales (100 pc) to dense  0.05 pc structures that are expected to host individual star-forming cores, down to sub-sonic (&lt;0.4 km/s) velocity resolution. In this overview paper, we provide the scientific justification for the ACES survey, explain the choice of observational setup, and describe the data legacy products. Finally, we show some of the initial ACES data which highlight the power of ACES' combination of high angular resolution, unprecedented spatial dynamic range, sensitivity, spectral resolution and spectral bandwidth as an illustration of how ACES aims to understand how global processes set the location, intensity, and timescales for star formation and feedback in the CMZ.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An automated activity classification tool for optical galaxy spectra</a><span class="id">[2602.20343]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reliable, versatile galaxy activity diagnostics are essential for understanding galaxy evolution. Traditional methods frequently necessitate extensive preprocessing, such as starlight subtraction and emission line deblending (e.g., H{\alpha} and [N II]), which can introduce substantial biases and uncertainties due to their model-dependent nature. In this work we developed an automated, diagnostic tool capable of distinguishing between star-forming (SF), active galactic nuclei (AGN), low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), composite, and passive galaxies. We developed a diagnostic tool based on a support vector machine trained on data from optical emission-line ratios and color selection criteria. From literature studies and exploring combinations of discriminatory feature schemes, we found that the equivalent widths of H{\beta}, [O III]{\lambda}5007, and H{\alpha}+[N II]{\lambda}6548,84 as key diagnostic features. Additionally, galaxies classified as AGN can be distinguished into broad- and narrow-line AGN by measuring the full quarter at the half-maximum of H{\alpha} and [N II] complex. We have developed a diagnostic tool that encompasses all activities of galaxies while achieving high performance scores across all of them. Our diagnostic achieves overall accuracy of 83% and recall of 79% for SF, 94% for AGN, 85% for LINER, 77% for composite, and 96% for passive galaxies. Our diagnostic tool significantly improves upon existing diagnostics as it eliminates the need for preprocessing (i.e., starlight subtraction or flux calibration) and spectral line fitting, includes all activity classes under one scheme, and distinguishes the two main AGN types. In addition, omitting starlight subtraction does not significantly reduce performance. Furthermore, Its narrow wavelength requirement enables use across a wide redshift range, making it ideal for high-z studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20374" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Observation of CO$_2$ Emission and foreground absorption Toward the Galactic Center with JWST</a><span class="id">[2602.20374]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>CO$_2$ is an important, stable, and abundant molecule in the Universe, but it is very difficult to detect because it has no observable pure rotational transitions. The unique sensitivity and resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provide a fresh way to investigate it. CO$_2$ is typically found in the solid phase (ice) on grain mantles in dense molecular clouds, but is less commonly detected in the gas phase (compared to common molecules such as CO and H$_2$O) and has mostly been found in protostellar and proto-planetary environments. Here, we report and characterize the first observations of gas-phase CO$_2$ absorption toward two IR-bright regions of the Galactic Center, thanks to the high sensitivity of JWST. Using an LTE model we find a CO$_2$ gas excitation temperature between 20 and 50 K, a column density around 2$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a radial velocity consistent with 0. We also report: 1) simultaneous detections of C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN absorption bands (near 13.7 and 14.0 $\mu$m, respectively), with column densitiy ratios of 1:3 and 3:2 with respect to gas-phase CO$_2$, and 2) CO$_2$ ice absorption with a ice-to-gas ratio of 90, consistent with previous findings. We conclude that the absorbing medium is likely in the foreground, most likely from one or more somewhat clumpy cloud(s), located between 0.15 and 4 kpc away from Earth. Additionally, we detected point-like CO$_2$ emission likely associated with a Galactic Center star (IRS 11SW), which is also spatially coincident with a previously reported X-ray source, raising the possibility that the system is a symbiotic binary.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glance: A Comprehensive Framework for Galactic Archaeology</a><span class="id">[2602.20389]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A central topic in extragalactic astronomy is understanding the formation and evolutionary histories of galaxies. These systems often comprise multiple structural components with distinct physical and dynamical properties, making it challenging to disentangle their individual contributions. Aiming at investigating the true structure of the inner stellar disk, we have developed a comprehensive pipeline for the chronochemical and dynamical analysis of galaxies (Glance: Galactic archaeoLogy via chronochemicAl &amp; dyNamiCal modElling). The presented pipeline employs several state-of-the-art techniques by integrating them into a single, automated pipeline, enabling streamlined analysis of integral-field spectroscopy data, by allowing users to easily and directly extract valuable information on stellar populations, kinematics, dynamics, and gas properties. It automates multiple analysis techniques, including stellar population synthesis (Fado, Starlight, post-processing with RemoveYoung, kinematic extraction (pPXF, Bayes-LOSVD), and dynamical modelling (Dynamite). It handles tasks such as Galactic extinction correction, de-redshifting, Voronoi binning, and nebular continuum correction, while offering extensive customization options. Parallel processing significantly reduces computational time. When applied to MUSE data sampling the central region of NGC 1566, this methodology reveals that its stellar disk significantly deviates from the conventional exponential model, challenging the assumption of universality in disk morphology. In summary, this work presents a powerful, publicly available pipeline for conducting galactic archaeology, designed to advance our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20393" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spatially-resolved interstellar dust properties in the face-on spiral galaxy M 99 as observed by NIKA2</a><span class="id">[2602.20393]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large dust grains in thermal equilibrium dominate the far-infrared and contribute to the millimetre continuum of star-forming galaxies, but constraining their properties is difficult due to free-free and synchrotron contamination. We study spatial variations in the dust spectral index, mass, and grain properties in the nearby face-on spiral galaxy M 99. We use new 1.15 and 2 mm continuum observations from NIKA2 on the IRAM 30 m telescope (IMEGIN Guaranteed Time Large Programme) combined with multiwavelength data from UV to radio. The infrared-to-radio SED is decomposed into dust, free-free, and synchrotron components using the hierarchical Bayesian code HerBIE. Dust is modelled via a modified blackbody (MBB) with variable millimetre spectral index beta and the THEMIS dust model with fixed beta. We perform spatially-resolved analysis at scales  1.75 kpc ( 25”), covering the centre, spiral arms, and inter-arm regions. MBB fits reveal beta variations from  1.6-1.7 in diffuse regions to  2.3-2.5 in dense star-forming areas, likely due to grain coagulation and changes in silicate-to-carbonaceous ratios. Dust masses from variable beta are up to  4x higher than fixed-beta models, which systematically bias dust-to-stellar and dust-to-gas ratios. The small grain fraction rises from  10% in the centre to  15% in the diffuse disc, anti-correlated with the interstellar radiation field; gas-phase metallicity plays a minor role within 8 kpc. Synchrotron spectral index ranges from  0.6-0.7 in star-forming regions to  1.2 in the diffuse medium, consistent with cosmic-ray electron ageing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Sub-Galactic Relationship Between Star Formation and the Hot Interstellar Medium in NGC 4254</a><span class="id">[2602.20397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the relationship between star formation and X-ray emission from the hot interstellar medium (ISM) on $\sim$kpc scales in NGC 4254 (M99) by combining spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs) and Bayesian X-ray spectral fitting. We measure sub-galactic star formation rates (SFR) by modeling spectrophotometric UV-IR data with flexible SFHs, and we produce point-source-subtracted maps of the diffuse X-ray emission using Chandra data. We extract and fit the spectra of 5 regions selected by their SFR density $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, deriving hot gas luminosities and plasma temperatures. We examine the sub-galactic $kT-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and $L^{\rm gas}_X-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ scaling relations in NGC 4254, and compare to predictions from simple models of the feedback into the ISM from core collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The hot gas emission from NGC 4254 is consistent with thermalization of $\approx 40-50\%$ of the energy from CCSNe in the ISM, and mass-loading of the CCSNe ejecta which decreases as $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{-1/3}$. Our optimized model implies a temperature and X-ray production efficiency that scale as $kT = (0.72^{+0.26}_{-0.18}~{\rm keV}) \Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.34\pm0.10}$ and $\eta = (0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}) \Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.34\pm0.18}$, respectively, for $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} = 0.01-0.13~{\rm M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}}$. We also compare the properties of the hot ISM to other ISM phases using data from the PHANGS program. The diffuse X-ray emission of a given region is on average 200 times fainter than the H$\alpha$ emission, and we see evidence that the hot ISM is over-pressurized compared to the large-scale dynamical equilibrium pressure of the galaxy, consistent with expansion of the hot ISM into the ambient medium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Highly Efficient Selection of High-Redshift Emission-Line Galaxies for future DESI-like surveys with Deep Multi-band Imaging</a><span class="id">[2602.20405]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Emission-line galaxies (ELGs) are an important tracer of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and large-scale structure (LSS) at $z &gt; 1$.

Using Hyper Supreme-Cam $grizy$ photometry and COSMOS2020 many-band photometric redshifts, we designed simple color cuts guided by a probabilistic random forest classifier to select galaxies at $z = 1.1$–$1.6$. We then empirically tested and refined these color cuts using two samples of galaxies with deep spectroscopy and broad color coverage obtained with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Compared to DESI ELGs at $z = 1.1$–$1.6$, we achieve a higher redshift measurement success rate (89% versus 69%), a much higher correct redshift range success rate (84% versus 34%), and a far higher net surface density yield (1372 $\mathrm{deg^{-2}}$ versus 660 $\mathrm{deg^{-2}}$). Combining our sample with current DESI ELGs would increase the net ELG number density by a factor of $\sim3$, moving it out of the shot-noise limited regime and reducing the uncertainties on the BAO scale parameter at $z = 1.1$–$1.6$ by a factor of $\sim 2$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chandra X-ray Observations of Quasars with Velocity-Offset Broad Lines: Assessing the Binary Supermassive Black Hole Hypothesis</a><span class="id">[2602.20438]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During the final stages of a galaxy merger, dynamical friction acting on the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the post-merger remnant can lead to the formation of a gravitationally bound binary SMBH. In the event that at least one of these SMBHs is actively accreting, the system can appear phenomenologically as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a broad line region (BLR) kinematically offset from the host galaxy rest frame. Such velocity offsets have been interpreted as signatures of binary SMBHs, recoiling SMBHs, or BLR gas dynamics within a single-SMBH system. We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of five nearby (0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.2) Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars whose broad emission lines are Doppler-shifted relative to their host galaxies' systemic velocities, along with archival Chandra observations of 11 additional sources from the same sample. Using our Chandra data, we constrain SMBH masses with multiple independent techniques. We find systematic, method-dependent differences among black hole mass estimates, with masses inferred from the fundamental plane of black hole activity generally lower and single-epoch virial masses typically higher than those obtained using other methods. We also compare the X-ray photon indices and optical-to-X-ray spectral indices of our quasars to the broader quasar population. While we find no strong differences in optical-to-X-ray spectral indices, we do find systematically harder X-ray photon indices than typically observed in comparable quasars. These results constrain competing physical models but do not provide conclusive evidence for or against a binary SMBH origin of the velocity-offset BLRs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20445" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMA Central Molecular Zone Exploration Survey (ACES)-IV.

Despite numerous observational efforts over the past decade, a statistically robust sample of &quot;satellite planes&quot; across the diversity of host galaxy environments is lacking. To guide future observing strategies, we construct a controlled suite of mock observations of on-sky positions and line-of-sight (LOS) velocities of isolated L* host galaxies and their satellite systems, based on samples drawn from the Illustris TNG100-1 cosmological simulation to build a statistical sample. In these mock systems, satellite planes are defined by three key parameters: the number of satellites ($N_{\mathrm{sat}}$), the fraction residing in a thin co-rotating plane ($f_{p}$), and the orientation angle relative to the observer ($\theta_{\mathrm{rot}}$). We evaluate the sensitivity of three observational metrics, $N_{\mathrm{cor}}$ (number of co-rotating satellites), $b/a$ (projected flattening of the satellite distribution), and $v_\mathrm{los}$ (mean absolute LOS velocity), to the presence of such planes. Our results show that detection rates are strongly dependent on $\theta_{\mathrm{rot}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{sat}}$. Satellite planes that are viewed nearly edge-on or face-on, are the most readily detected. In contrast, intermediate orientations and systems with fewer satellites yield low detection success rates. Generally, only satellite planes with $N_{\mathrm{sat}}&gt;20$ have high chances of being detected. These findings provide a practical framework for prioritising observational targets and designing future surveys aimed at detecting and characterising satellite planes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine-learning cosmological parameters by eROSITA data</a><span class="id">[2602.20483]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: We present the first Cosmological Parameter inferences from eROSITA X-ray observations of galaxy clusters using a Machine Learning algorithm. Methods: We train a Random Forest using mock catalogs of clusters from Magneticum multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations. We apply the trained ML algorithm to observed X-ray features (gas luminosity, mass, and temperature) at different redshifts from the eROSITA eFEDS and eRASS1 catalogs. Results: We obtain cosmological constraints with precision comparable to those from standard analyses, such as weak lensing and cluster abundances. We infer $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.30^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $\sigma_8=0.81\pm0.01$, and $h_0=0.710\pm0.004$. The recovered parameters show no tension in the $\Omega_{\rm m}-\sigma_8$ space, but a significant deviation of $h_0$ from the Planck estimates. These inferences remain rather stable against variations of the input observable set and parameter space coverage. These results indicate that correlations among intracluster properties contain cosmological information beyond that encoded in the cluster abundance alone, which can be captured by machine learning trained on multi-cosmology simulations. Conclusions: ML algorithms trained on multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations can effectively infer cosmological parameters directly from galaxy cluster data. This is a change of paradigm in the context of cosmological parameter inferences. This approach complements traditional cluster-count analyses and is particularly suited to large upcoming surveys, where systematic uncertainties in mass calibration may otherwise dominate the error budget. It also highlights the potential of large-scale X-ray surveys to deliver independent tests of the standard cosmological model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of dusty clumps in the torus of active galactic nuclei</a><span class="id">[2602.20484]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The putative dusty torus is a key ingredient of the unification scheme of active galactic nuclei (AGN), but its origin remains a mystery. Here we put forward a new physical model to explain how a large number of small dusty gas clumps form and they collectively appear as a geometrically thick dynamic dusty torus. The circumnuclear hot gas flows towards the central black hole (BH) and forms a rotating disk on sub-pc scales. A fraction of inflowing hot gas condenses to form small cold clumps due to thermal instabilities, when the accretion rate is sufficiently high. These cold dusty gas clumps are irradiated by the central accretion disk and re-radiate as dust emission mostly in the infrared. We propose that the dusty torus in AGN consists of such cold clumps vertically supported by the radiation force against gravity. For clumps with suitable column density, the vertical component of the BH gravity is in quasi-static equilibrium with the infrared radiation force together with the vertical component of the disk radiation force. Our model is robust in the sense that for any reasonable range of parameters concerning clump vertical dynamical equilibrium a torus exists. We further show that the hot gas in the rotating flow condenses to cold clumps only if its accretion rate is higher than about one percent of the Eddington rate. The radiation force is unable to lift the cold gas clumps up away from the mid-plane when the luminosity of the disk surrounding the BH is lower than 0.1 percent of the Eddington luminosity. These two features of our model may provide a physical explanation for the lack of evidence of dusty tori in low-luminosity AGNs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20690" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of first star clusters under the supersonic gas flow – III.

Models often assume that Pop III stellar masses in different minihaloes are stochastic realisations of a single universal initial mass function (IMF). We use 138 cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamics simulations to test this assumption and to map the first-star IMF across redshift, halo mass, and baryon-dark matter streaming velocity (SV). We construct a dense-cloud merger tree and assign first-star masses by mapping the radial gas accretion-rate profile to stellar mass, yielding per-halo stellar mass functions without imposing any a priori IMF. The high-mass tail and multiplicity increase systematically with redshift, halo mass, and SV. Low-mass, low-SV haloes form only one or a few first stars, whereas massive, high-SV haloes host rich first star clusters and commonly produce very massive ($\gtrsim10^3$-$10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$) first stars. Even in a fixed environment, halo-to-halo scatter remains substantial. Nevertheless, group-averaged IMFs converge to well-defined forms, ruling out a single universal IMF at the halo level across the range of environments probed here. Mapping our seeds onto the redshift-mass plane, we show that high-SV and massive haloes preferentially populate the heavy-seed regime relevant to luminous high-redshift sources. At the same time, low-SV environments are consistent with single/few-event enrichment signatures in metal-poor stars. Our results deliver a practical, physically motivated prescription for per-halo IMF.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple protostellar outflows from a single protostar with a misaligned disk</a><span class="id">[2602.20691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate how misalignment between the core angular momentum and the large-scale magnetic field affects protostellar outflows, and whether a single protostellar system can drive multiple outflow components. We perform three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized rotating cores, focusing on the formation of a protostar, a circumstellar disk, and magnetically driven outflows. The initial angle between the core angular-momentum vector and the magnetic field is systematically varied from $0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$. All models launch a classical magnetocentrifugal disk wind (DW) roughly along the local disk normal. For large misalignment, the system also develops a spiralflow (SF) component that propagates parallel to the disk plane. In a representative model with a $60^\circ$ misalignment, the outflow transitions from a DW-dominated to an SF-dominated phase, with the SF becoming more massive and more extended than the DW, and the two components intermittently coexisting. Across the model suite, the maximum mass and size ratios of SF to DW, as well as the relative lifetimes of the two components, increase for misalignment angles $\gtrsim60^\circ$. We propose that secondary, misaligned outflows (or their fossil remnants) observed in some protostellar systems can be interpreted as the SF component, while the main bipolar outflow traces the DW from the same misaligned system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy evolution in the cosmic web: the relative impact of nodes and filaments in the EAGLE simulation</a><span class="id">[2602.20733]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxies evolve within the intricate geometry of the cosmic web, yet the distinct roles of its primary components - nodes and filaments remain incompletely understood. Using the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we investigate how distances to filament spines and cluster-scale nodes jointly and independently influence galaxy evolution. Galaxies are classified into red, green, and blue populations through a fully data-driven entropic thresholding technique, and the nodes and filaments are identified using DisPerSE. We find that red galaxies preferentially reside near filament cores and nodes, whereas blue galaxies dominate the outskirts. This spatial segregation reveals two characteristic transition scales: a node-related crossover at $\sim 2.5~\mathrm{Mpc}$ and a filament-related crossover at $\sim 0.75~\mathrm{Mpc}$. To further quantify environmental influence, we adopt an information-theoretic approach and measure the normalised mutual information between dominant mass component and galaxy colour across the $d_{\mathrm{f}}$-$d_{\mathrm{n}}$ plane. The mass-colour coupling increases with distance from nodes at fixed filament proximity, indicating a weakening of this relation in cluster-scale environments and a stronger coupling within filamentary regions. This behaviour is strongly mass dependent, with low-mass galaxies exhibiting a more pronounced environmental modulation than high-mass systems. These results support a scale-dependent view of galaxy evolution across the cosmic web, highlighting the distinct and complementary influence of nodes and filaments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2024abvb: a Type Ibn/Icn supernova with evidence of helium and an extreme offset from its host galaxy</a><span class="id">[2602.20775]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present spectroscopic and photometric observations and analysis of SN 2024abvb, a peculiar transitional Type Ibn/Icn supernova located at an unusually large projected distance from its host galaxy (21.5 kpc). SN 2024abvb displays an extended rise time in the $g$- and $o$-bands (10.1 and 10.6 days respectively), followed by a linear decline in all photometric bands. Comparisons with other supernova subclasses show that the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024abvb are distinct from Type Ibn and Type Icn events, with a higher peak $r$-band luminosity and lower blackbody temperatures. Spectra reveal an initial blue continuum and narrow P-Cygni profiles, with C {\sc ii} $\lambda$5890 dominating in emission, persisting at late phases, and showing a rapid decline in the expansion velocity. Weak He {\sc i} $\lambda$5876 features are tentatively detected at early times. Analysis of progenitor scenarios rules out thermonuclear origins based on incompatible light curve shapes and spectral signatures. A rare massive star progenitor appears unlikely given the low local star formation rate. The most plausible origin is an ultra-stripped supernova scenario involving a binary system; this best explains the observed separation from the host, the low circumstellar material mass, the fast photometric evolution and the low nickel production, although a discrepancy in model versus observed ejecta mass remains. These results reinforce the classification of SN 2024abvb as a distinctive Type Ibn/Icn event and highlight the diversity of progenitor channels for interacting supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A multi-wavelength study of nearby starburst galaxy M 82</a><span class="id">[2602.20786]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a multi-wavelength study of the nearby starburst galaxy M 82 by combining high-resolution Far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat and archival Chandra X-ray observations.

The stellar mass follows a multi-Gaussian expansion light model with a free global mass-to-light ratio and an allowed radial $M/L$ gradient, while the dark matter is described by an elliptical generalised NFW halo. The double-source-plane geometry provides additional leverage against the mass-sheet transformation and helps constrain the radial mass profile. Despite allowing both a radial stellar $M/L$ gradient and a generalised NFW halo, the data prefer the canonical picture: an approximately constant stellar mass-to-light ratio with a Salpeter-like IMF normalisation, and a dark matter halo consistent with NFW. We infer $M_{\star} = 4.4^{+0.25}_{-0.39}\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ and an inner halo slope $\gamma_{\rm in}^{\rm halo} = 1.04^{+0.10}_{-0.14}$.

At fixed halo mass, the inferred stellar mass lies $\sim0.1$ dex above typical literature stellar halo mass relations at similar redshift, which is comparable to the intrinsic scatter of these relations.

One is a broad (with a width of sigma = 3000 km/s) and redshifted (+3400 km/s) component, originating at D = 0.02 pc from the central black hole. The other two components are narrow (with a width of sigma = 500 km/s) and exhibit redshifted and blueshifted velocities (+2600 km/s and -1500 km/s), originating from more distant regions (D = 0.1 pc). The photo-ionized model explains the broader component, while the two narrower components can be explained by either photo-ionization or collisional ionization. One interpretation is that the broader component is an outflow at  10^2 R_S (R_S; Schwarzschild radius) and the narrow component is a shock-heated plasma close to the torus, with a possible connection to the JWST-discovered outflow outside the torus. Two blueshifted absorption lines are detected at  7.1 keV ( 10^4 km/s) and  10.6 keV ( 10^5 km/s). The line significance of the 10.6 keV line is above 98%. The absorption line components might be attributed to the broad emission component.

We utilize a subsample of X-ray non-detected LRDs to test the compatibility of collision-based BH formation scenarios and constrain physical parameters like metallicity and column this http URL results indicate LRDs are ideal birthplaces for massive BHs, particularly given a mass-radius relation $R_{gal} \propto M_{gal}^{0.6}$. Collision-based models suggest seed masses larger than those in the local Universe, consistent with high-redshift BH mass-radius relations. We modeled BH seed formation and X-ray emission (0.3-7 keV) against observed upper limits. We find that mass-radius exponents $&gt; 0.55$ favor the collision-based scenario; however, consistency with stacked X-ray analysis requires specific accretion and obscuration parameters. Constant or increasing SFR scenarios with high Eddington ratios are feasible but necessitate larger column densities or higher metal enrichment. Alternatively, moderate sub-Eddington accretion reconciles massive seeds with observed masses and X-ray weakness. We conclude that even if LRDs began as starbursts, they should eventually evolve into AGNs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HINORA II: Testing the Existence of the Council of Giants in ΛCDM simulations</a><span class="id">[2602.21008]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of the galaxy ring known as the Council of Giants (CoG) highlights the need to explain such structures in the Local Universe. In the first paper of this series we presented HINORA - a code to locate (ring-like) structures in 3D point sets - and used it to identify the CoG in the most complete observations of the Local Volume. Here, in Part II, we apply the same method to cosmological simulations to quantify the possible existence of such objects in the LCDM model of structure formation. We analyze DM-only simulations with random and constrained initial conditions, selecting regions that reproduce the properties of the Local Group and Volume, respectively. In order to use the same selection criteria as previsouly done for observations, we relate K-band luminosities to halo masses through semi-empirical relations. After confirming that the selected regions from the simulations match the observed mass function and density of the Local Universe, we use HINORA to search for ring-like structures in them. We find that the existence of CoGs in LCDM simulations is a rather unusual phenomenon. The observed CoG represents an anomaly of more than 2.7 sigma from what is expected in the distribution of massive galaxies in LCDM. These results hint that the CoG could either be a rare chance configuration or the imprint of physical processes at intermediate scales that standard DM-only simulations fail to capture.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21014" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Catalog of 486 Barium Stars Identified in GALAH DR4</a><span class="id">[2602.21014]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a catalog of 486 Ba stars identified in the GALAH DR4 survey using high-resolution spectra and precise abundance measurements. The sample was selected based on s-process enrichment criteria involving the abundances of Ba and La relative to Eu, and further refined using the signed-distance method, resulting in the largest sample of Ba stars to date, including five newly identified Ba dwarfs. Using astrometric and kinematic parameters from Gaia DR3 and StarHorse, we derived the Galactic velocity components for 367 Ba stars and found that most belong to the thin or thick disk, while 18 exhibit halo-like kinematics. Chemical abundance analysis suggests that most Ba stars are of in situ origin, whereas two stars (4077588766331013248 and 6692980582560946304) display signatures of accreted populations. The E-Lz diagram further shows that star 4077588766331013248 lies within the region of substructure ED-8. The observed decline of [Ba/Fe] and [La/Fe] with increasing metallicity implies that s-process elements originate from nucleosynthetic sites distinct from those of iron-peak elements, while the decreasing [hs/ls] ratio toward higher metallicity indicates higher neutron capture efficiency at lower metallicity. Both giant and dwarf Ba stars-except for 6053735173729807872-are confirmed binaries hosting white dwarf companions. Moreover, we estimated the masses of the former asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companions to these Ba stars based on the good agreement between the FRUITY AGB model predictions and their observed abundance patterns.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21058" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulations of the 21cm emission line for upcoming large-scale HI galaxy surveys</a><span class="id">[2602.21058]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Upcoming galaxy surveys with the SKA Observatory will detect neutral hydrogen (HI) across unprecedented volumes, and their scientific return will crucially depend on predictive models for HI observables.

HII region evolution has been simulated in a 30 pc$^3$ box, in distinct models with pre-placed overdensities in the ambient medium and overdensities that have been generated with driven turbulence. We find that when these overdensities are seeded in the ambient medium before the birth of the ionizing source, the photoionized plasma stripped off of these dense blobs is funneled into long filaments along the magnetic field lines. The length and emission measure of these ionized gas filaments are similar to the filaments observed in the Central Molecular Zone.

In this study, we investigated the surface reactions of solid CS$_2$ with hydrogen (H) atoms on amorphous solid water (ASW) using laboratory experiments supported by computational calculations. Our results show that CS$_2$ reacts with H atoms through quantum tunneling in the initial step, followed by successive H addition reactions, with or without activation barriers, on icy surfaces. These processes lead to the formation of several sulfur-bearing species, including hydrogen sulfide (H$_2$S), methyl mercaptan (CH$_3$SH), and small amounts of dithioformic acid (HC(S)SH) and methanedithiol (CH$_2$(SH)$_2$). The observed reactivity of CS$_2$ with H atoms provides a plausible explanation for the non-detection of CS$_2$ in interstellar ices.

Here we show that such scattering reaches a steady-state distribution function of stellar eccentricity, after which eccentricity increases and decreases occur at equal rates. The implication is that clump/cloud scattering recircularizes eccentric stellar orbits, keeping the stellar velocity dispersion in a limited range. This re-circularization regulates disk heating and maintains kinematic coherence, contributing to the longevity of disk structures. The eccentricity distribution function and the presence of recircularizing cloud-star interactions are independent of cloud mass but the timescale to reach equilibrium decreases with increasing mass. The calculations are made in the simplest possible disk system to highlight the effects of scattering without contamination from spiral waves, star formation, and other processes. The calculations also reveal a bifurcation in the disk evolutions whereby in a minority of cases temporary asymmetries in the clump spatial distribution drive the disks to an end state of increased velocity dispersion and orbital eccentricity corresponding to early type disks. Overall the models emphasize an important physical process that can make and maintain an exponential stellar disk in all galaxies with a cloudy interstellar medium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The JWST Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science Program.

Here, we utilize archival HST/ACS and JWST/NIRCam observations of the nearby dwarf star-forming galaxy WLM to study RR Lyrae in JWST filters. We independently identify RR Lyrae in HST and JWST imaging in order to evaluate JWST's efficacy at characterizing RR Lyrae in the near-IR. We use an MCMC template-fitting technique to obtain periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes from the RR Lyrae time-series data. The spatially overlapping HST and JWST observations allow us to directly compare the same sources observed with the instruments, and calibrate the NIRCam F090W and F150W RR Lyrae period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relation to the Gaia-consistent HST PWZ. We additionally assess the epoch-to-epoch consistency of NIRCam photometry, and find evidence of burn-in. We conclude that the zero-point offset is negligible compared to the uncertainties from the template fitting. We conduct an MCMC fit of the PWZ with both HST and JWST data. Our results are three-fold. First, we find that we can reliably identify RR Lyrae in NIRCam data, but light-curve template fitting proves difficult on short-baseline observations. Second, the HST PWZ fit yields a distance modulus to WLM of $\mu = 24.85\pm0.05$ ($0.93\pm0.02$ Mpc). This is closer than previous measurements, primarily attributed to consistency with the Gaia scale. Lastly, although the JWST PWZ fit has large uncertainties and a poorly-constrained slope, it represents a first-of-its-kind PWZ calibration in NIRCam filters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cool-Core Destruction in Merging Clusters with AGN Feedback and Radiative Cooling</a><span class="id">[2412.13595]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core (NCC) dichotomy of galaxy clusters remains uncertain. Previous simulations have found that cluster mergers are effective in destroying CCs but fail to prevent overcooling in cluster cores when radiative cooling is included. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a promising mechanism for balancing cooling in CCs; however, the role of AGN feedback in CC/NCC transitions remains elusive. In this work, we perform three-dimensional binary cluster merger simulations incorporating AGN feedback and radiative cooling, aiming to investigate the heating effects from mergers and AGN feedback on CC destruction. We vary the mass ratio and impact parameter to examine the entropy evolution of different merger scenarios. We find that AGN feedback is essential in regulating the merging clusters, and that CC destruction depends on the merger parameters. Our results suggest three scenarios regarding CC/NCC transitions: (1) CCs are preserved in minor mergers or mergers that do not trigger sufficient heating, in which cases AGN feedback is crucial for preventing the cooling catastrophe; (2) CCs are transformed into NCCs by major mergers during the first core passage, and AGN feedback is subdominant; (3) in major mergers with a large impact parameter, mergers and AGN feedback operate in concert to destroy the CCs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09854" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chasing the Light: Shadowing, Collimation, and the Super-Eddington Growth of Infant Black Holes in JWST BLAGNs</a><span class="id">[2501.09854]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift broad-line active galactic nuclei (BLAGNs) characterized by moderate luminosities, weak X-ray emissions, and faint high-ionization lines. We propose that a subset of these BLAGNs, the so-called &quot;Little Blue Dots” (LBDs) are accreting at super-Eddington rates and use geometrically thick, non-advective disk models to investigate photon scattering and shadowing within the polar funnel. Our models predict extremely-blue optical-UV continuum slopes and highly collimated radiation fields where isotropic-equivalent luminosities exceed the Eddington limit in the polar direction while shadowing suppresses emission at higher inclinations. This &quot;searchlight&quot; configuration naturally generates a stratified ionization structure: coronal and high-excitation narrow lines are produced along the symmetry axis, while the equatorial broad-line region (BLR) remains shielded from the hardest ionizing photons. We show that the anisotropic illumination of the BLR explains the observed faintness of high-ionization lines despite strong Balmer emission. For M_BH=10^7.5–10^8 Msun accretors at Eddington ratio  10, standard BLR conditions predict HeII lambda 4686/Hbeta in the range 0.08–0.28. Notably, because inherently blue disk spectra provide a much higher ratio of ionizing to optical photons than standard quasar composites, the observed large Balmer equivalent widths are matched with typical BLR covering factors without invoking enshrouded geometries. Taken together, these findings support the view that super-Eddington accretion flows, shaped by thick disk geometries, may naturally account for the ionizing SED and emission line diagnostics of high-z LBDs, while offering a plausible pathway to rapid black hole growth at cosmic dawn.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Detection of Circumgalactic Dust at Megaparsec Scales with Maximum Likelihood Estimation</a><span class="id">[2503.04098]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the more surprising astrophysical discoveries of the last decade has been the presence of enormous quantities of dust at megaparsec distances from galaxies, which has important implications for galaxy evolution, the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium, and observational cosmology. In this work, we present a novel method for studying these vast halos of circumgalactic dust: a maximum-likelihood estimator for dust-induced extinction of background galaxies. This estimator can accommodate a broad range of archival photometric data and can incorporate different dust reddening prescriptions, making it applicable to diverse galaxy types and redshifts. We apply the estimator to the redMaGiC catalog of luminous red galaxies, selected for their tight dispersion in color and well-constrained photometric redshifts, and measure the resulting extinction as a function of projected distance from WISExSuperCOSMOS and redMaGiC foreground galaxies. We detect significant dust-induced extinction profiles extending to at least 1 megaparsec from galactic disks, with noticeable differences between star-forming and quiescent galaxies: star-forming galaxies exhibit a pronounced rise in extinction within the inner 50 kiloparsecs and a steep decline beyond 1 megaparsec, while the quiescent galaxies host little dust in the inner halo but have detectable extinction out to 30 megaparsecs. We test the robustness of our results using star catalogs and inverted foreground and background samples and find no evidence for significant systematic error.

A key challenge in refining star-formation models is the lack of precise mapping of these dense molecular hydrogen clouds, where traditional tracers often yield inconsistent results. We demonstrate how, in the near future, neutrinos will emerge as a robust mass tracer due to worldwide advancements in neutrino telescopes. Neutrinos are produced alongside gamma-rays when cosmic-rays interact with molecular clouds. The neutrino production rate is proportional to the gas density without dependence on the complex properties of a cloud. Neutrinos also have the advantage of negligible absorption and unambiguous production channels, making it a method with the lowest systematic uncertainties. In an optimistic case where most gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Centre region originates from pion decays, we expect several tens of muon neutrinos to be detected in about two decades. Neutrinos from the CMZ will provide indications on the biases of traditional mass tracers and thus indirectly enhance the accuracy of gas measurements in far galaxies from which a neutrino signal is not detectable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the presence of a fifth force at the Galactic Center</a><span class="id">[2504.02908]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aims: The presence of a Yukawa-like correction to Newtonian gravity is investigated at the Galactic Center, leading to a new upper limit for the intensity of such a correction.

We use Ly$\alpha$ and UV continuum imaging data from the Lyman alpha and Continuum Origins Survey (LaCOS), targeting 42 nearby ($z \simeq 0.3$), star-forming galaxies with LyC observations (escape fractions of $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC} \simeq 0.01-0.49$).

We unveil a significant anti-correlation between $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ and the Ly$\alpha$ Halo Fraction (HF, or contribution of the halo to the total Ly$\alpha$ luminosity), that we propose as a new LyC indicator. Our observations show that halo scale lengths and HFs both scale positively with the optical depth of the neutral gas in the ISM, revealing a picture in which Ly$\alpha$ and LyC photons in LCEs either emerge directly from the central starbursts or escape isotropically and, in the case of Ly$\alpha$, minimize the number of scattering interactions in a less-extended CGM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights into the structure and kinematics of a Milky Way-like galaxy</a><span class="id">[2506.13560]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding how the large-scale kinematics of the MW shape the formation and evolution of the interstellar medium remains challenging from an observational perspective, and numerical models that can reproduce the observed structure and kinematics of the MW are much needed in order to infer how the MW might work as a star formation engine.

Despite the ongoing inflow, the galaxy remains quiescent, with an upper limit to the star formation rate of $0.2 \, M_\odot \, \rm{yr}^{-1}$. Moreover, its star formation history suggests that the galaxy has remained quiescent during the past $\sim1$ Gyr, with half of its stars formed by redshift $z_{50}=11^{+18}_{-3}$. We discuss that the inflow is not massive, dense, or long-lived enough to ignite significant star formation, or it is fueling low-level AGN activity instead. This is direct evidence that quiescent galaxies can accrete cold gas after their quenching while keeping their star formation subdued.

The LINER region in the SE cone appears more irregular, with inter-cone LINER points likely shaped by both local ISM structure and shocks. Our findings highlight the complex interplay of different AGN feedback mechanisms in the ISM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling Binary Lenses and Sources with the BAGLE Python Package</a><span class="id">[2512.03392]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational microlensing is a powerful tool that can be used to find and measure the mass of isolated and dark compact objects. In many microlensing events, the lens, the source, or both may be a binary system. In this work, we introduce binary source and lens models into the gravitational lensing formalism encoded in the Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events (BAGLE) python software package. These new binary models in BAGLE account for Keplerian orbits. We also add binary models with fewer parameters that describe the binary orbital motion as acceleration, linear, or stationary motion of the secondary companion; these are useful when the orbit has a very low eccentricity or the orbital period is much longer than the microlensing timescale. The model parameterizations based on these binary lensing equations will enable joint fitting of photometric and astrometric data sets. Consequently, binary microlensing events with complex astrometric trajectories can be used to uniquely determine physical parameters like mass and distance, unlike photometry-only microlensing which often yield ambiguous solutions. These binary models will be used to fit microlensing event data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope, and other surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05622" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Statistical Detection of MgII-traced Cool Gas Outflows with JWST Towards Cosmic Dawn</a><span class="id">[2512.05622]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galactic-scale outflows are a crucial component of galaxy evolution, yet their properties in the early universe remain poorly constrained. We present the first statistical investigation of \ion{Mg}{2}-traced cool gas outflows in galaxies spanning a wide cosmic timeline from $z \approx 1$ to $z &gt; 6$ (with sample coverage extending to $z \sim 10$). Using thousands of public JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we employ a signal-to-noise weighted spectral stacking technique on the \ion{Mg}{2} $\lambda\lambda2796, 2803$ absorption doublet. We robustly detect blueshifted \ion{Mg}{2} absorption in nearly all stellar mass and redshift bins, with the exception of the lowest-mass systems at $z \sim 1-2$. The outflow equivalent width exhibits a positive correlation with stellar mass ($M_*$) at all epochs, with the fitted slope of $1.21 \pm 0.35$. Our work provides the first statistical constraints on \ion{Mg}{2}-traced cool outflows in the low-mass ($M_* \lesssim 10^{9.5} \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$), high-redshift ($z &gt; 3$) regime. We also find that the outflow velocities generally remain below the host halo escape velocities, consistent with a galactic fountain scenario. The consistency of the stellar mass-outflow equivalent width relation across $z \sim 2-6$ suggests a persistent, unevolving feedback mechanism governing the baryon cycle towards cosmic dawn.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09384" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2022ngb: A faint, slowly evolving Type IIb supernova with a low-mass envelope</a><span class="id">[2512.09384]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>An extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign of the Type IIb SN 2022ngb is presented in the article. Through detailed modeling of this dataset, we aim to constrain the key physical parameters of the explosion, infer the nature of the progenitor star and its environment, and probe the dynamical properties of the ejecta. We analyze photometric and spectroscopic data of SN 2022ngb. By constructing and modeling the bolometric light curve with semi-analytic models, we estimate the primary explosion parameters. The spectroscopic data are compared with those of well-studied SNe IIb and NLTE models to constrain the properties of the progenitor and the structure of the resulting ejecta. SN 2022ngb is a low-luminosity SN IIb with a peak bolometric luminosity of L_bol = 7.76 (+1.15/-1.00) x 10^41 erg/s and a V-band rising time of 24.32 +/- 0.50 days. Light curve modeling indicates an ejecta mass of  2.9-3.2 M_sun, an explosion energy of  1.4 x 10^51 erg, and a low synthesized 56Ni mass of  0.045 M_sun. Nebular phase spectra exhibit asymmetric line profiles, pointing to a non-spherical explosion and an anisotropic distribution of radioactive material. Our analysis reveals a relatively compact stripped-envelope progenitor with a pre-SN mass of approximately 4.7 M_sun (corresponding to a 15-16 M_sun ZAMS star). Our analysis suggests that SN 2022ngb originated from the explosion of a moderate-mass relatively compact, stripped-envelope star in a binary system. The asymmetries inferred from the nebular phase spectral line features suggest a non-spherical explosion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinematics of H I and O VI Absorbers: Insights into the Turbulence Driver of the Multiphase Circumgalactic Medium</a><span class="id">[2512.12958]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate large-scale gas kinematics in the multiphase circumgalactic medium (CGM) using the observed correlation between line width (Doppler $b$ parameter) and column density ($N$) for H I and O VI absorbers. Leveraging extensive public galaxy survey data at $z\lesssim0.1$, we construct a new galaxy sample based on the availability of background Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSOs) with far-ultraviolet spectra from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). By combining this FUSE-galaxy sample with literature collections, we find that H I absorbers exhibit a clear inverse correlation between Doppler width and column density over nearly five orders of magnitude in $N_{\rm HI}$, from $N_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ to $N_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{18}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, while O VI absorption follows a positive correlation across $N_{\rm OVI}\approx 3\times10^{13}$-$10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$.We develop a model framework to interpret these contrasting trends and show that H I absorbers are best described as systems of approximately constant total column density ($N_{\rm H}$), whereas O VI traces regions of roughly constant spatial density ($n_{\rm H}$ and $n_{\rm OVI}$). Under the latter scenario, the observed $b_{\rm OVI}$-$N_{\rm OVI}$ relation maps directly to a velocity-size relation consistent with a Kolmogorov-like turbulent spectrum. Together, these findings reveal a coherent physical picture in which H I and O VI trace a continuous turbulent cascade spanning more than five orders of magnitude in spatial scale-from cool, photoionized clumps to warm, highly ionized halo gas – with accretion in the halo outskirts likely driving the turbulent energy injection that sustains the multiphase CGM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLiMB: A Domain-Informed Novelty Detection Clustering Framework for Galactic Archaeology and Scientific Discovery</a><span class="id">[2601.09768]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In data-driven scientific discovery, a challenge lies in classifying well-characterized phenomena while identifying novel anomalies. Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms do not always fully address this duality, often assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using metric-adaptive constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms CLiMB's superior data efficiency, showing monotonic improvement as knowledge increases. Finally, the framework successfully isolates three distinct dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, and the Galactic Disk) in the unlabelled field, validating its potential for scientific discovery.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19866" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of Galactic center ejected star in DESI DR1</a><span class="id">[2601.19866]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are stars ejected from the Galactic Centre (GC) through tidal interactions with the central supermassive black hole. Formed in the immediate vicinity of Sgr A$^\ast$, these stars are accelerated to velocities high enough to escape the GC and be observable in the Galactic halo. Using spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and astrometry from Gaia, we conducted a six-dimensional search for HVSs and identified a compelling candidate, hereafter DESI-312, whose bound trajectory can be confidently traced back to the central 2 kpc of our galaxy. The star resides in the inner halo and exhibits supersolar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 0.27\pm 0.09$), distinct from other known stellar populations with radial orbits. Its inferred GC ejection velocity of $698^{+35}_{-27}$ is consistent with a Hills mechanism ejection, supporting an origin in the innermost regions of the Milky Way. We considered alternative origins for the star, including disk ejections from young clusters and globular clusters, but these scenarios fail to explain both its orbit and metallicity. Unlike previously identified A- and B-type HVSs, DESI-312 is a $\sim 1\,M_{\odot}$ star on the main sequence or early subgiant branch, thus enabling a detailed chemical analysis of its atmosphere and offering a rare window - unobscured by dust and crowding - into the composition of the central regions of the Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19524" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SMMAN: quasi-Simultaneous Multi-wavelength Monitoring of gamma-ray-loud AGNs with the Nanshan 26-m radio telescope</a><span class="id">[2602.19524]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are characterized by strong temporal flux density variability across the electromagnetic spectrum, offering insights into the complex physical processes governing accretion and plasma outflows. To systematically investigate AGNs flux density variability in radio bands, a long-term program was initiated in late 2016: quasi-Simultaneous Multiwavelength Monitoring of gamma-ray-loud AGNs with the Nanshan 26-m radio telescope (SMMAN). This work presents the first data release of the SMMAN program, spanning over eight years from 2016 to 2024 with observations at 4.8 and 23.6 GHz. The SMMAN sample includes 131 northern ($\delta &gt;\sim0^{\circ}$) sources selected from the Fermi Large Area Telescope third source catalog. The characteristics of variability, spectral index, luminosity, and $\gamma$-ray loudness factor are examined for different AGN classes within the sample. Target sources exhibit stronger variability at 23.6 GHz compared to 4.8 GHz, with BL Lac objects being more variable than flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). BL Lacs generally have flatter radio spectra, while FSRQs, blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs), and radio galaxies (RDGs) span a wider range from flat to steep. FSRQs are more radio-luminous than BL Lacs and other classes, with BCUs intermediate and RDGs generally fainter. FSRQs and BL Lacs have higher $\gamma$-ray loudness factors than RDGs, while BCUs have intermediate values. The SMMAN dataset, incorporated with other historical and ongoing monitoring programs, will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of spectral energy distributions, search for quasi-periodic oscillations, and analyze supermassive black hole binary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The morphological stability of open clusters: a new 2D perspective</a><span class="id">[2602.19746]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Open clusters (OCs) usually evolve gradually as the number of their members changes, which can be manifested in their morphological characteristics. We aim to investigate the morphological stability of 1,490 OCs and further explore the potential change of morphological stability of the OCs at different spatial positions, using the OC catalog from the literature. We define for the first time a new morphological stability parameter Ncore/Nouter, a ratio of member numbers between cluster core and outer areas within tidal radii, which has a significant positive correlation against N, with a slope of 1.140$\pm$0.039, significantly steeper than the 0.720$\pm$0.026 measured for Score/Souter. This demonstrates that the stellar density in the core is a more sensitive tracer for morphological stability than geometry. Spatially, the radial sample OCs have larger slopes of Ncore/Nouter and Score/Souter against N, with 1.083$\pm$0.116 and 0.733$\pm$0.080, respectively, whereas those in the tangential direction 1.013$\pm$0.110 and 0.529$\pm$0.075, respectively, which means that the impact on sample OCs from tidal forces directed toward the Galactic center is possibly stronger than that from the shear force caused by the differential rotation of the Galactic disk. Besides, the sample OCs younger than 30 Myr display a shallow slope of 0.751$\pm$0.166, with those older than 800 Myr (1.442$\pm$0.128), reflecting that young OCs likely endure both internal disruptions, such as early dynamical heating weakening core binding and more severe external disturbances, compared to older OCs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marginal IR running of Gravity as a Natural Explanation for Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2509.05246]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose that the infrared (IR) running of Newton's coupling provides a simple and universal explanation for large-distance modifications of gravity relevant to dark matter phenomenology.

We show that the marginal case $\eta = 1$ is singled out by renormalization group (RG) and dimensional arguments, leading to a logarithmic potential and a $1/r$ force law at large distances, while smoothly recovering Newtonian gravity at short scales. The logarithmic correction is universal and regulator independent, indicating that the $1/r$ force arises as the robust IR imprint of quantum-field-theoretic scaling.

CSs, whose detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength $\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating pattern or time-separated exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a wide region of parameter space.</p></div></details></article>

Bayesian statistics offers a natural remedy, letting us update our knowledge of physical models as new data arrive, without re-analyzing existing data. However, doing so requires the posterior probability density of model parameters for previous observations, which is typically intractable. Here, we use variational neural posterior estimation to rapidly update the inferred population of binary black holes as data are observed in gravitational-wave detectors. We apply this approach to real and simulated catalogs analyzed with both low- and high-dimensional population models, testing the reliability of three update cadences: with new catalogs of sources, month by month during an observing run, and as each new signal arrives. We investigate the success and failure modes of neural sequential updates, finding that the robustness of updating is sensitive to the information contained in each update and that updating is most effective when performed with larger segments of data. We outline one additional scientific application enabled by Bayesian updating: identification of events that are individually informative about the population. Neural Bayesian updates to astrophysical population models also provide efficient likelihood representations for joint analyses with other data, e.g., standard-siren cosmology, and similar methods can be used to perform Bayesian stochastic background searches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20298" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compute System Organization for High Frequency High Order Wavefront Sensing and Control</a><span class="id">[2602.20298]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Maintaining long-term wavefront stability is critical for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), which targets contrasts approaching $10^{-10}$ and therefore requires continuous dark-zone maintenance using high-order wavefront sensing and control (HOWFSC).

Compact jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) are commonly assumed to be in equipartition between particle and magnetic-field energy densities at the regions where the radio emission dominates at centimetre wavelengths. This assumption has significant implications for both jet physics and the accuracy of VLBI-based astrometry and geodesy. Aims. We tested the validity of the energy equipartition hypothesis in AGN cores at centimetre wavelengths by analysing the blazar 1803+784 using simultaneous broadband full-polarization observations with the VLBI Global Observing System (VGOS). Methods. We present VGOS observations of the blazar 1803+784 covering the 3-11 GHz frequency range. The data were processed using a dedicated calibration pipeline, followed by model fitting and multi-frequency imaging analysis. We measured the frequency-dependent core shift and mapped the spectral index and rotation measure (RM) across the source. Results. We find a core-shift power-law index of $k_r = 0.73^{+0.12}_{-0.19}$, significantly deviating from the expected equipartition value of $k_r = 1$. This indicates that either the equipartition condition or the conical jet geometry, or both, are not fulfilled in the centimetre-wavelength core region. The wide frequency coverage of VGOS also allows us to decouple the Faraday rotation of the core into an internal component (${\rm RM}_I = 121 \pm 8$ rad m$^{-2}$, produced in the core region) and an external component (${\rm RM}_E = -44 \pm 9$ rad m$^{-2}$, associated with a distant, extended medium that may also affect the polarization in downstream regions of the jet at larger scales). Conclusions. These results demonstrate the power of VGOS for high-fidelity simultaneous multi-frequency polarimetric studies of compact AGN jets, and underline the need to account for non-equipartition effects in both jet astrophysics and geodetic VLBI.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20906" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaia Data Release 4: Modelling of drift-scan related effects in Gaia's point spread function</a><span class="id">[2602.20906]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>An accurate model of the point spread function is required in order to estimate positions and brightnesses of stars in digitized images. The PSF of the Gaia space telescope is unusual due to the use of drift-scan mode and time-delayed integration, in which the satellite spins and precesses while images are captured. This induces several systematic and periodic distortions in the PSF that are unique to Gaia. These include systematic variations in the stellar image drift rate with respect to the charge transfer rate, and spatial variations in the CCD response that are, contrary to expectations, not marginalised by the use of TDI mode. These must be incorporated into the PSF model in order to reduce systematic errors in Gaia's data products. We have developed a semi-analytic model of the PSF, in which the blurring effects of along- and across-scan stellar image motion are modelled analytically, and dependences of the PSF shape on source colour and position within the CCD are calibrated empirically. Constraints on the PSF origin are introduced in order to break a degeneracy with the geometric instrument calibration. Our new PSF model leads to significant improvements in the modelling of observations, particularly around the 11-13 magnitude range in G. This will contribute to reductions in the astrometric and photometric uncertainties in the derived data products. Our PSF model was deployed in the Gaia cyclic data processing systems and used in the production of the forthcoming Data Release 4. The linear part of Gaia's PSF is now well understood. Future development work will focus on the handling of several nonlinear effects that depend on the signal level, including charge transfer inefficiency and the brighter-fatter effect. This work will provide a useful reference for users of Gaia data and for other missions that use the same observing principles, such as the proposed GaiaNIR mission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Likelihood-Based One-Class Scoring in CWT Latent Space for Confusion-Limited LISA Gravitational-Wave Detection</a><span class="id">[2602.20212]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study one-class scoring for resolvable-source detection in confusion-limited LISA time-series data represented as continuous-wavelet-transform (CWT) scalograms.

The pursuit of this low-energy sensitivity through ionization-only signal detection has so far been hindered by excessive electron backgrounds observed across experiments. Much of this background is attributed to the plate-out of $^{222}$Rn decay chain isotopes on the high voltage electrode grid surfaces that span the full cross section of the TPC. This work presents a first-principle model constructed for this background, the predictions of which are consistent with data from the LZ and LUX experiments. We then discuss mitigation strategies of this background in future dual-phase TPCs and the possibility of applying this grid background model to ionization-only dark matter searches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calibrating Bayesian Tension Statistics using Neural Ratio Estimation</a><span class="id">[2407.15478]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When fits of the same physical model to two different datasets disagree, we call this tension. Several apparent tensions in cosmology have occupied researchers in recent years, and a number of different metrics have been proposed to quantify tension. Many of these metrics suffer from limiting assumptions, and correctly calibrating these is essential if we want to successfully determine whether discrepancies are significant. A commonly used metric of tension is the evidence ratio R. The statistic has been widely adopted by the community as a Bayesian way of quantifying tensions, however, it has a non-trivial dependence on the prior that is not always accounted for properly. We show that this can be calibrated out effectively with Neural Ratio Estimation. We demonstrate our proposed calibration technique with an analytic example, a toy example inspired by 21-cm cosmology, and with observations of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find no significant tension between DESI and SDSS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the accuracy of posterior recovery with neural network emulators</a><span class="id">[2503.13263]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neural network emulators are widely used in astrophysics and cosmology to approximate complex simulations inside Bayesian inference loops. Ad hoc rules of thumb are often used to justify the emulator accuracy required for reliable posterior recovery. We provide a theoretically motivated limit on the maximum amount of incorrect information inferred by using an emulator with a given accuracy. Under assumptions of linearity in the model, uncorrelated noise in the data and a Gaussian likelihood function, we demonstrate that the difference between the true underlying posterior and the recovered posterior can be quantified via a Kullback-Leibler divergence. We demonstrate how this limit can be used in the field of 21-cm cosmology by comparing the posteriors recovered when fitting mock data sets generated with the 1D radiative transfer code ARES directly with the simulation code and separately with an emulator. This paper is partly in response to and builds upon recent discussions in the literature which call into question the use of emulators in Bayesian inference pipelines. Upon repeating some aspects of these analyses, we find these concerns quantitatively unjustified, with accurate posterior recovery possible even when the mean RMSE error for the emulator is approximately 20% of the magnitude of the noise in the data. For the purposes of community reproducibility, we make our analysis code public at this link this https URL .</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeepVoid: A Deep Learning Void Detector</a><span class="id">[2504.21134]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present DeepVoid, an application of deep learning trained on a physical definition of cosmic voids to detect voids in density fields and galaxy distributions. By semantically segmenting the IllustrisTNG simulation volume using the tidal tensor, we train a deep convolutional neural network to classify local structure using a U-Net architecture for training and prediction. The model achieves a void F1 score of 0.96 and a Matthews correlation coefficient over all structural classes of 0.81 for dark matter particles in IllustrisTNG with interparticle spacing of $\lambda=0.33 h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$. We then apply the machine learning technique of curricular learning to enable the model to classify structure in data with significantly larger intertracer separation. At the highest tracer separation tested, $\lambda=10 h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$, the model achieves a void F1 score of 0.89 and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.6 on IllustrisTNG subhalos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15991" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulation-Based Inference for Direction Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays with Radio Arrays</a><span class="id">[2508.15991]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) observatories require unbiased direction reconstruction to enable multi-messenger astronomy with sparse, nanosecond-scale radio pulses. Explicit likelihood methods often rely on simplified models, which may bias results and understate uncertainties. We introduce a simulation-based inference pipeline that couples a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) to a normalizing-flow posterior within the Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference framework. Each event is seeded by an analytic plane-wavefront fit; the GNN refines this estimate by learning spatiotemporal correlations among antenna signals, and its frozen embedding conditions an eight-block autoregressive flow that returns the full Bayesian posterior. Trained on about $8,000$ realistic UHECR air-shower simulations generated with the ZHAireS code, the posteriors are temperature-calibrated to meet empirical coverage targets. We demonstrate a sub-degree median angular resolution on test UHECR events, and find that the nominal 68% highest-posterior-density contours capture $71\% \pm 2\%$ of true arrival directions, indicating a mildly conservative uncertainty calibration. This approach provides physically interpretable reconstructions, well-calibrated uncertainties, and rapid inference, making it ideally suited for upcoming experiments targeting highly inclined events, such as GRAND, AugerPrime Radio, and BEACON.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21306" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND): the GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger prototypes</a><span class="id">[2509.21306]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a proposed multi-messenger observatory of Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) particles of cosmic origin. Its main goal is to find the long-sought origin of UHE cosmic rays by detecting large numbers of them and the secondary particles created by their interactions like gamma rays and neutrinos. The GRAND Collaboration plans to achieve this using large arrays of radio antennas that look for the radio signals emitted by the air showers initiated by the interactions of the UHE particles in the atmosphere. Since 2023, three small-scale prototype GRAND arrays have been in operation: GRAND@Nançay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and GRANDProto300 in China. Together, their goal is to validate the detection principle of GRAND under prolonged field conditions, achieving efficient, autonomous radio-detection of air showers. We describe the hardware, software, layout, and operation of the GRAND prototypes. Using their data, we show a first characterization of the local electromagnetic environment of each site and a measurement of the Galactic synchrotron emission. Despite challenges, the successful operation of the prototypes confirms that the GRAND instrumentation is apt to address the goals of the experiment and lays the groundwork for its ensuing stages.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18510" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experimental and numerical modeling of liposome congregation in meteorite craters of Early Earth</a><span class="id">[2602.18510]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper provides experimental and numerical evidence supporting the occurrence of liposome congregation at the floors of meteor craters on Early Earth. This work builds on our earlier research, which demonstrated that liposomes submerged in a shallow Archean pond are protected from harmful UV radiation. This protection allows them to survive long enough for autocatalytic replication of amphiphiles and for mutation and selection of assemblies that maximize membrane stability. For liposomes to fuse, grow, exchange contents and membranes, and divide, they need to establish a population, which means forming a dense conglomerate that enables close physical contact. The study demonstrates that such a congregation is feasible in bowl-shaped meteor craters on Early Earth, especially under periodic seismic disturbances.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HelioSpectrotron 5000: An interactive multi-resolution solar spectral atlas</a><span class="id">[2602.20101]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>HelioSpectrotron 5000 (HS5000) is an interactive, multi-resolution solar spectral atlas designed to facilitate direct comparison between high-resolution reference spectra and observations obtained with a wide range of ground-based instruments.

A key novelty of GraviBERT is its staged training: a BERT-style self-supervised pretraining phase to learn transferable representations, followed by supervised fine-tuning on labeled data. GraviBERT demonstrates consistent transfer learning across detector configurations and waveform models. On in-domain data, pretraining reduces the MAE by up to $31\%$ and accelerates convergence by $\sim 6.6 \times$, with mean relative precision for point estimates reaching the few-percent level and MAE in effective spin of $\sim 10^{-3}$ at SNR = 10. For domain adaptation to new detector noise profiles, the pretrained model converges up to $15\times$ faster on small target datasets and reduces estimation errors by up to $\sim 47\%$, demonstrating detector-agnostic learning. Cross-waveform approximant transfer achieves up to $44\%$ MAE reductions and up to $15\times$ training speedups, with $R^2$ scores consistently exceeding $0.9$ for mass parameters at SNR = 10 compared to $0.74$ - $0.87$ when training from scratch. GraviBERT works directly with noisy waveforms, and in its current form quantifies predictive uncertainty through MC dropouts. After pretraining, the regression head could be adapted to multiple downstream inference tasks in gravitational-wave astronomy.</p></div></details></article></body>
