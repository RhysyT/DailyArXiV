These appear to confirm theoretical predictions that the relation between central black hole mass $M$ and spheroid velocity dispersion $\sigma$ has the same form $M \propto \sigma^4$ in spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and cluster ellipticals, but has differing normalizations. These arise from the need for longer black hole accretion episodes to expel the gas otherwise potentially able to feed the holes in the latter two types of host. In a sample drawn from a mixture of galaxy host types the fitted power of $\sigma$ will slightly exceed the theoretically-derived value of 4 because of the differing normalizations. The observed hole masses do not currently reach the theoretical maximum values possible for disc accretion, set by the equality of the ISCO and self-gravity radii, probably because the host galaxies have insufficient gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13385" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling Globular Cluster Stellar Streams with a Basis-Expansion N-body Code</a><span class="id">[2602.13385]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Globular cluster stellar streams probe galaxy-formation processes and can potentially reveal the distribution of dark matter in galaxies. In many theoretical studies, streams are modeled with particle-spray or direct N-body codes. But particle-spray methods abstract away the internal dynamics of the progenitor by making strong assumptions about the escape physics, while direct N-body is prohibitively expensive for realistic (N&gt;10^5) systems. In this paper, we present the stream-modeling capabilities of KRIOS, a new basis-expansion N-body code for collisional stellar dynamics, that bridges this runtime vs. accuracy gap. We show that KRIOS reproduces NBODY6++GPU cluster models, and their associated streams, more accurately than particle spray in a fraction of the NBODY6++GPU wall-clock time. We then compare KRIOS to various particle-spray methods on 10 orbits similar to known Milky Way streams. The morphology and kinematics of these streams most disagree when the progenitor is tightly bound to the host, as these systems are often subject to stronger tidal forces. Finally, we discuss which elements of the progenitor physics are most important for modeling stellar streams and how these might be incorporated into particle-spray methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterizing Lyman alpha emission from high-redshift galaxies</a><span class="id">[2602.13389]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Lyman $\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) line from high-redshift galaxies is a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) can significantly attenuate the emergent Ly$\alpha$ line, even in the damping wing of the cross-section. However, interpreting this damping wing imprint relies on our prior knowledge of the spectrum that escapes from the galaxy and its environs into the IGM. This emergent spectrum is highly sensitive to the composition and geometry of the interstellar and circumgalactic media, and so exhibits a large galaxy to galaxy scatter. Characterizing this scatter is further complicated by non-trivial selection effects introduced by observational surveys. Here we build a flexible, empirical model for the emergent Ly$\alpha$ spectra. Our model characterizes the emergent Ly$\alpha$ luminosity, the velocity offset of the Ly$\alpha$ line with respect to the systemic redshift, and the H$\alpha$ luminosity, with multivariate probability distributions conditioned on the UV magnitude. We constrain these distributions using $z\sim5-6$ galaxy observations with VLT MUSE and JWST NIRCam, forward-modeling observational selection functions together with galaxy parameters. Our model results in Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width distributions that are a better match to (independent) Subaru observations than previous empirical models. The extended distributions of Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths and velocity offsets we obtain could facilitate Ly$\alpha$ transmission during the early stages of the EoR. We also illustrate how our model can be used to identify GN-z11-like outliers, potentially originating from merging systems. We publish fitting functions and make our model publicly available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13391" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining Binary Neutron Star Populations using Short Gamma-Ray Burst Observations</a><span class="id">[2602.13391]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The landmark multi-messenger observations of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 provided firm evidence that such mergers can produce short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). However, the limited number of BNS detections by current gravitational-wave (GW) observatories raises the question of whether BNS mergers alone can account for the full observed sGRB population. We analyze a comprehensive set of 64 BNS population synthesis models with a Monte Carlo-based framework to reproduce the properties of sGRBs detected by Fermi-GBM over the past 16 years. We consider three jet geometry scenarios: a universal structured jet calibrated to GW170817, a universal top-hat jet, and a non-universal top-hat jet with distributions of core opening angles. Our results show that models characterized by low local BNS merger rates ($R_{BNS}(0) \lesssim 50$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) predict too few observable sGRBs to reproduce the Fermi-GBM population, effectively disfavoring them as sole progenitors. Even when relaxing assumptions on jet geometry, low-rate models remain viable only for wide jets ($\theta_c \ge 15^\circ$), in tension with the narrow jet cores ($\theta_c \approx 6^\circ$) inferred from sGRB afterglow observations. In contrast, models with local merger rates of order $R_{BNS}(0) \approx 100$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ successfully reproduce the observed sGRB population, assuming a plausible fraction of BNS mergers launch relativistic jets and realistic jet geometries. This analysis highlights the power of combining GW observations of BNS mergers with electromagnetic observations of sGRBs to place robust constraints on the BNS merger population and to assess their role as progenitors of sGRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARCHITECTS I: Impact of subgrid physics on the simulated properties of the circumgalactic medium</a><span class="id">[2602.13392]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy evolution is shaped by star formation and stellar feedback at scales unresolved by current high-resolution cosmological simulations. Precise subgrid models are thus necessary, and different approaches have been developed. However, they are degenerate and often primarily calibrated to reproduce stellar masses from observations. To explore these degeneracies, we perform three cosmological zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the same galaxy within a $5\times10^{11}\rm\ M_\odot$ dark matter halo at $z\sim1$, each with a different subgrid model: mechanical feedback, a combination of mechanical feedback and thermal feedback, and delayed cooling. We calibrate the simulations to match in stellar mass, isolating the effect of the models on the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Our findings demonstrate that despite producing galaxies with comparable stellar masses, the three models lead to distinct feedback modes, resulting in notable variations in the CGM properties. The delayed cooling run is dominated by ejective feedback and exhibits high burstiness, whereas mechanical and the hybrid models primarily feature preventive feedback, respectively acting at the galaxy and halo scales. Delayed cooling reduces the baryon mass to half the universal baryon fraction while mechanical feedback retains most baryons, with the hybrid model standing in between. Delayed cooling also ejects significantly more metals into the CGM than both other models. While for delayed cooling and mechanical feedback metals are almost evenly distributed in the CGM, they are concentrated around satellites in the hybrid model. These discrepancies emphasize the need to design an appropriate subgrid model to understand how stellar feedback regulates galaxy growth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARCHITECTS II: Impact of subgrid physics on the observable properties of the circumgalactic medium</a><span class="id">[2602.13394]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy evolution is driven by star formation and stellar feedback on scales unresolved by current high-resolution cosmological simulations, requiring robust subgrid models. However, these models remain degenerate, often calibrated primarily to match observed stellar masses. To explore these degeneracies, we conduct three state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations of the same galaxy, each incorporating different subgrid models: mechanical feedback, a combination of mechanical and thermal feedback, and delayed cooling. We compare their circumgalactic media (CGM) through quasar absorption sightlines of HI, MgII, CIV, and OVI. Our findings demonstrate that despite producing galaxies with the same stellar masses, the models lead to distinct feedback modes and CGM properties. Column densities and covering fractions serve as effective diagnostics of subgrid models, with all four ions providing strong constraints as they trace diverse gas phases, exhibit complementary spatial distributions, and originate from different mechanisms. Although all simulations bracket observed column density distributions, direct comparisons are limited by scarce detections and significant scatter in absorption strengths. Covering fractions of weak absorbers provides the most robust constraints. All models fail to reproduce HI and MgII covering fractions, and delayed cooling overproduces OVI covering fractions, while the other models underproduce them. The simulation including mechanical feedback reproduces the observed CIV covering fractions well, whereas the other models show slight offsets. We argue that this discrepancy is likely driven by unresolved thermal structures for HI and MgII, and insufficient metals for CIV and OVI, arising from missing physics such as AGNs or cosmic rays.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MeerKAT discovery of a high-redshift strongly-lensed hydroxyl gigamaser</a><span class="id">[2602.13396]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>At low redshifts, hydroxyl megamasers (OHMs) have been shown to trace galaxy mergers, obscured starbursts, high molecular gas densities, and candidate dual supermassive black hole systems. Given this astrophysical utility, exploring these sources at larger cosmological look-back times is therefore of key interest. While previous OHM surveys have been limited to redshifts of $z \lesssim 0.25$, the ability to expand the OHM frontier is significantly enhanced with new high-sensitivity radio facilities such as MeerKAT. In this Letter, we report the discovery of an OHM in the gravitational lens system HATLAS J142935.3-002836 at $z = 1.027$, the most distant OHM source yet detected. The spectrum has blended 1667 and 1665 MHz emission and exhibits a highly complex profile, with spectral components ranging in widths of $&lt;8$ km s$^{-1}$ to $\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$. The integrated (magnification uncorrected) luminosity of log($L_{\rm OH} / L_{\odot}$) = 5.51 $\pm$ 0.67 makes this the most apparently luminous OHM known to date. In the same wide-band dataset, we have also detected a previously unknown ${\rm H I}$ absorption line. The signal-to-noise ratio of over 150 with just a 4.7 h observation highlights the potential that MeerKAT and the future Square Kilometre Array mid-frequency array offer to explore the high-redshift OHM universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revising the Milky Way Cepheid Calibration: Quantifying and Correcting for Previously Undetected Distance Modulus Errors in the Gaia-based Multi-Wavelength Period-Luminosity Relations</a><span class="id">[2602.13397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine the multi-wavelength period-luminosity-color relations for Cepheid variables in the Large and Small magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way. From first-principles stellar physics, the luminosity of a Cepheid is determined by its radius and surface temperature, yielding a fundamental PLC relation whose observational proxies are pulsation period and intrinsic color. Using Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds, we show that the PLC relation recovers the known geometries and line-of-sight tilts of their disks, confirming its ability to detect true distance-modulus variations that are achromatic and consistent across all filters. Surprisingly, for Milky Way Cepheids with individually determined reddenings and HST and Gaia parallaxes, the residuals from multi-wavelength PL fits are also found to be achromatic, identical in sign and amplitude across all passbands, in this case indicating that parallax errors are the dominant source of scatter. Applying bandpass-averaged corrections to individual Cepheids recovers the theoretically expected wavelength-dependent narrowing of the instability strip, and results in revised parallaxes with a median improvement in precision of roughly a factor of two. In addition, they show no statistically significant correlation with metallicity over the range -0.2 &lt; Fe/H &lt; 0.05 dex. The final extinction- and reddening-corrected PLC relation yields an rms scatter of 0.04 mag, corresponding to 2 percent precision in distance per star. Use of a physically grounded PLC will provide a more robust foundation for the Cepheid-based extragalactic distance scale and the determination of the Hubble constant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surveying the Giant HII Regions of the Milky Way with SOFIA: VIII. W43 Main</a><span class="id">[2602.13470]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this eighth paper of the SOFIA-FORCAST series on Milky Way GHII regions, we present an analysis of the massive star-forming complex W43 Main. We compared our 11 - 37 micron maps with multi-wavelength observations from the near-infrared to radio, and investigated the physical nature of compact sources and dust substructures. We applied SED fitting to constrain properties of the compact infrared objects, and examined the evolutionary states of the extended subregions. We identified 20 compact infrared objects, 16 (80%) of which we classify as massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) or candidate MYSOs. W43 Main resides at the junction of the Scutum spiral arm and the Galactic Bar, a location where enhanced turbulence is anticipated and has been proposed as a potential influence on star-formation activity. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that its Lyman continuum photon production rate, the mass of its most massive MYSO, and its MYSO density are all consistent with the survey-wide median values. We therefore conclude that, despite W43 Main's unique Galactic environment, its present star formation activity appears broadly consistent with that of an average Galactic GHII region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Dynamical Measurements from a Lensed Quasar Sample: Joint Analysis Constrains the Mass Profile Evolution of Lens Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2602.13578]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a systematic study of the internal mass structure of early-type galaxies (ETGs) based on 106 galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses with background quasars, all having spectroscopic redshifts. From this parent sample, we select 24 systems with high-quality ancillary data for joint analysis of strong lensing geometry and stellar kinematics. A key contribution is the derivation of new single-aperture stellar velocity dispersions for 11 lens galaxies via an iterative spectroscopic fitting procedure that mitigates quasar contamination, providing previously unavailable data. We model the total mass-density profile as a power law, $\rho \propto r^{-\gamma}$, and parameterise its logarithmic slope as $\gamma = \gamma_0 + \gamma_z \cdot z_l + \gamma_s \cdot \log \tilde{\Sigma}$, where $z_l$ is the lens redshift and $\tilde{\Sigma}$ the surface mass density. Within a flat $\Lambda$CDM framework and using DESI BAO measurements as a prior, we constrain the parameters via Monte Carlo nested sampling to $\gamma_0 = 1.62^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$, $\gamma_z = -0.35^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$, and $\gamma_s = 0.37^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ ($68\%$ confidence intervals). Our results robustly demonstrate that $\gamma$ increases with surface mass density ($\gamma_s &gt; 0$) and decreases with redshift ($\gamma_z &lt; 0$). This implies that, at fixed redshift, galaxies with denser stellar cores have steeper mass profiles, while at fixed density, profiles become shallower at higher redshifts. By successfully applying the joint lensing–dynamics method to a substantial, independently acquired sample of lensed quasars, this work provides crucial validation of structural trends previously observed in galaxy–galaxy lensing systems, reinforcing the established evolutionary picture for massive ETGs and establishing lensed quasars as a potent probe of galaxy structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13580" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modelling the non-equilibrium chemistry of the Milky Way's cold nuclear wind</a><span class="id">[2602.13580]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cold atomic and molecular gas are commonly observed in the winds of both external galaxies and the Milky Way, yet the survival and origin of these cool phases within hot galactic winds is poorly understood. To help gain insight into these problems, we carry out time-dependent chemical modelling of cool clouds in the Milky Way's nuclear wind, which possess unusual molecularto-atomic hydrogen ratios that are inconsistent with both disc values and predictions from chemical equilibrium models. We confirm that CO and Hi emission comparable to that in the observed nuclear wind clouds cannot be produced by gas in chemical equilibrium, but that such conditions can be produced in a molecule-dominated cloud that has had its atomic envelope rapidly removed and has not yet reached a new chemical equilibrium. Clouds in this state harbour large reservoirs of molecular gas and consequently have anomalously large CO-to-H2 conversion factors, suggesting that the masses of the observed clouds may be significantly larger than suggested by earlier analyses assuming disc-like conversions. These findings provide a new framework for interpreting cold gas in galactic winds, providing strong evidence that cold outflows can originate from the galactic disc molecular clouds that survive acceleration into the wind but lose their diffuse atomic envelopes in the process, and suggesting that the Milky Way's nuclear outflow may be more heavily mass-loaded than previously thought.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AT 2025abao: the fourth luminous red nova in M 31</a><span class="id">[2602.13678]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of luminous red nova (LRN) AT 2025abao, the fourth discovered in M 31. The LRN, associated to the AGB star WNTR23bzdiq, was discovered during the fast rise following the minimum phase. It reached the peak at $g=15.1$ mag ($M_g=-9.5\pm0.1$ mag), and then it settled onto a long-duration plateau in the red bands, lasting 70 days, while it was slowly linearly declining in the blue bands. The object showed similarities at peak with the canonical LRNe V838 Monocerotis, V1309 Scorpii, and with the faint and fast-evolving AT 2019zhd, the third LRN in M31, though the later evolution is different. Spectroscopically, AT 2025abao evolved as a canonical LRN: the early spectra present a blue continuum with narrow Balmer lines in emission; at peak, the spectral continuum has cooled to a yellow colour, with a photospheric temperature of 6000 K. Balmer lines have weakened while absorption lines from metals (Fe I, Fe II, Sc II, Ba II, Ti II) have developed, and in particular broad (FWHM$\sim$700 km/s) from the UV Ca II H&amp;K lines. Medium- and high-resolution spectra reveal a counter-P Cygni absorption profile in H$\alpha$. Finally, late time spectra show an orange continuum ($T\sim$4000-5000 K), a return in strength of the Balmer lines and the formation of molecular absorption bands. AT 2025abao is the rare case of a LRN with detailed archival information regarding the progenitor system. For the first time, we obtained the spectral energy distribution in the infrared of the precursor of a LRN, which is consistent with that of an M giant/AGB. We propose that the dichotomy of light curve behaviour in LRNe (two peaks vs. plateau) can be explained by the extent and H-richness of the common envelope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13683" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modelling the Break in the Specific Angular Momentum within the Envelope-Disk Transition Zone</a><span class="id">[2602.13683]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The observations of protostellar systems show a transition in the radial profile of specific angular momentum (and rotational velocity), evolving from $j\sim{\rm constant}$ ($v_{\phi}\sim r^{-1}$) in the infalling-rotating envelope to $j\propto r^{1/2}$ ($v_{\phi}\sim r^{-1/2}$) in the Keplerian disk. We employ global MHD disk simulations of gravitational collapse starting from a supercritical prestellar core, that forms a disk and envelope structure in a self-consistent manner, in order to determine the physics of the Envelope-Disk Transition Zone (ENDTRANZ). Our numerical results show the transition from the infalling-rotating envelope to Keplerian disk happens through a jump in the $j-r$ profile over a finite radial range, which is characterized by the positive local gravitational torques. The outer edge of the ENDTRANZ is identified where the radial infall speed ($v_r$) begins a sharp decline in magnitude and $j$ begins a transition from $j\sim{\rm constant}$ toward $j\sim r^{1/2}$. Moving radially inward, the centrifugal radius ($r_{\rm CR}$) is defined where $v_{\phi}$ first transitions to Keplerian velocity at the disk's edge. Farther inward of $r_{\rm CR}$, model disk develops a super-Keplerian rotation due to self-gravity. The inner edge of the ENDTRANZ is defined at the centrifugal barrier ($r_{\rm CB}$) where $v_r$ drops to negligible values. Inside $r_{\rm CB}$, a net negative gravitational torque drives mass accretion onto the protostar. On observational grounds, we identify a jump in the observed $j-r$ profile in L1527 IRS for the first time using the ALMA eDisk data. Comparison with the numerical radial behavior from our MHD disk simulations suggests the observed $j-r$ jump can be used as a kinematical tracer for the existence of ENDTRANZ. Our results offer insights into the observable imprint of angular momentum redistribution mechanisms during star-disk formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsars and Millisecond Pulsars III: Tracing Compact Object Dynamics in Globular Clusters with NBODY6++GPU</a><span class="id">[2602.13688]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutron stars in globular clusters follow complex evolutionary pathways shaped by binary interactions, mass transfer, and dynamical exchanges. Direct N-body simulations such as NBODY6++GPU successfully model stellar dynamics and compact object formation, but they usually do not track pulsar spin evolution or magnetic field decay explicitly. Building on Papers I and II of this series, we identify this gap and present a case study from an existing simulation with N = 105000 particles, showing how a neutron star forms and evolves for 200 Myr without any pulsar-physics tracking. We compare this situation with recent implementations and outline a seven-scenario framework that includes magnetic dipole spin-down, exponential magnetic field decay, environmental torques, accretion-driven spin-up, gravitational-wave emission, and merger-driven evolution. As an example, the neutron star we label Pulsar973 forms at t = 800 Myr with a post-supernova mass of 5.35 solar masses and evolves to 2.52 solar masses by t = 1000 Myr, but still lacks period P, period derivative Pdot, magnetic field B, and scenario classification. We provide mathematical formulations and specific integration points within NBODY6++GPU (Hermite scheme, Ahmad-Cohen neighbors, KS regularization, and BSE stellar evolution) to enable scenario-based pulsar evolution within direct N-body simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13754" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dust and Ices in the SNR</a><span class="id">[2602.13754]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The presence of dust in supernova remnants (SNRs) is confirmed by extensive infrared data from observatories such as Spitzer, Herschel, and JWST, alongside theoretical models of dust formation.

We quantify this expectation by mapping time dependent habitable zones (HZs) for solar-metallicity stars with initial masses of $0.8$-$120\,M_\odot$. From rotating and non-rotating \textsc{GENEC} tracks we derive bolometric “climate” HZ boundaries and enforce XUV energy-limited escape and wind ram-pressure retention constraints for a dipole-magnetized Earth analogue. The operational inner edge is set by the most restrictive limit, and we measure the annulus lifetime, the longest continuous residence at fixed orbit, and the maximum number of dynamically packed terrestrial planets it can host. We find a sharp main-sequence ceiling: while a $9\,M_\odot$ star sustains an operational HZ for $\sim 30$ Myr at $\sim 70$-$130$ AU, the main-sequence annulus becomes brief and extremely narrow by $12\,M_\odot$ and disappears by $15\,M_\odot$. Post main-sequence evolution can reopen HZs up to $\sim 25$-$30\,M_\odot$, but only for $\sim 0.03$-$1.5$ Myr at hundreds to $\sim 10^3$ AU, disappearing by $\sim 40\,M_\odot$. Rotation modestly increases habitable lifetimes near the upper main sequence without altering the high mass ceiling. Initial Mass Function (IMF) weighting shows that massive stars contribute only $\sim 10^{-4}$ of the habitable planet-time budget. Even so, they still add of order a few $10^{5}$ operationally habitable Earth analogues to the Milky Way at any instant.

The hyperfine ratios for \nthp are in their optically thin, LTE, values, but for \hcn\ they are not; the $F=1 \to 1$ hyperfine line shows abnormally weak intensities. A simple two-component model shows that self-absorption of the background $F = 1 \to 1$ hyperfine line by the main $F = 2 \to 1$ hyperfine line of a cold, foreground, redshifted cloud can reproduce the observed \hcn hyperfine intensities and match the \hcn and \hcop line profiles. All of these results are consistent with self-absorption of the optically thick lines on the red side of the profile, as expected for collapsing clumps. A simple two-cloud model suggests that this sample represents dense clumps with extreme collapse velocities, $V_{inf} \sim 2.4$ \kms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VENUS: Strong-lensing model of MACS J1931.8-2635 – revealing the farthest multiply imaged supernova</a><span class="id">[2602.14074]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a parametric strong-lensing model for the galaxy cluster MACS J1931.8-2635 ($z_l = 0.35$), accompanying the detection of the spectroscopically confirmed SN Eos at $z = 5.13$ (Coulter et al. 2026). We identify 10 new multiple-image systems in recent VENUS JWST/NIRCam imaging, so that the model is constrained with a total of 19 robust multiple-image systems – nine of which also have a spectroscopic redshift. For the point-like source corresponding to SN Eos, our model predicts a total of five images, with the observed radial image pair having a similar magnification of $\mu \simeq 25 - 30$ and a small time delay of $&lt; 5$ days, in agreement with their simultaneous observation. According to the model, the other three predicted images arrived earlier, with time delays of $3.7 \pm 0.7$, $3.5 \pm 0.7$ and $54.0 \pm 10.8$ years prior to the two observed images, and with magnifications of $12.9 \pm 2.6$, $13.0 \pm 2.9$ and $2.2 \pm 0.4$, respectively. The absence of detections at the predicted positions, where the host galaxy's images are also visible, confirms the transient nature of the source. SN Eos and its host galaxy are studied in separate articles, and we here focus on the lens model. The final model reaches a very good $r.m.s.$ distance between model and observations of $0.44''$. We present the lens-modeling results, including newly identified systems such as a triply imaged, grand-design spiral galaxy candidate at $z \simeq 3.65_{-0.09}^{+0.04}$, and briefly discuss the potential of using high-redshift lensed SNe for cosmography.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14087" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S-PLUS: Beyond Spectroscopy IV.

The precisions of the abundance estimates range from 0.05-0.10 dex for metallicity in the relatively metal-rich range ([Fe/H] $&gt; -1.0$) to 0.10-0.30 dex in the metal-poor regime ([Fe/H] $&lt;-1.0$), 0.10-0.20 dex for [C/Fe], and 0.05 dex for [$\alpha$/Fe]. The stellar parameters for LMC and SMC member stars are somewhat less precise than those from the S-PLUS main survey, primarily because of the effect of high reddening. The use of both metallicity- and carbon-sensitive filters provides unbiased measurements of both [Fe/H] and [C/Fe], of particular importance for very low-metallicity ([Fe/H] $&lt; -2.0$) stars, where carbon enhancement can lead to systematically high estimates of [Fe/H] when only a single metallicity-sensitive filter is employed. Furthermore, multiple narrow-band filters enable metallicity estimates down to [Fe/H] $\sim -4.0$ with an accuracy of around 0.3 dex, exceeding the precision typically achieved by low/medium-resolution spectroscopy. This extensive photometric dataset, combined with the other three datasets in this series, will serve as a valuable legacy resource for Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective Magnetic Susceptibility of Dust Grains with Superparamagnetic Inclusions and Implications</a><span class="id">[2602.14101]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic properties of dust grains play a fundamental role in their alignment with ambient magnetic fields and magnetic dipole emission. In the radiative torque (RAT) paradigm, superparamagnetic inclusions (SPIs) embedded within dust grains are expected to significantly enhance magnetic susceptibility and alignment efficiency. Previous studies have generally assumed SPIs of a single characteristic size. In this work, we develop an effective superparamagnetism model that explicitly accounts for a power-law size distribution of SPIs. We show that the effective zero-frequency susceptibility can be described by the superparamagnetic susceptibility of uniform-sized inclusions evaluated at the critical blocking size, reduced by a factor $F_{\rm eff}\sim 0.1$. It exhibits a slight increase with dust temperature $T_{d}$, in contrast to the rapid decrease for the case of single-size SPIs. For rotating grains at angular frequency $\omega$, we identify a characteristic resonance size of SPIs that dominates the magnetic response, $N_{\rm res} = (T_{d}/T_{\rm act}) \ln (\nu_{0}/\omega)$ with $T_{\rm act}$ activation temperature and $\nu_{0}$ the characteristic attempt frequency of SPIs. The frequency-dependent effective susceptibility is well described by the maximum susceptibility $\chi_{\rm eff}^{\rm max}(\omega)$ at $N_{\rm res}$, reduced by a factor $G_{\rm eff}\sim 0.1$. Unlike models assuming uniform-sized inclusions, we find that the effective susceptibility exhibits a nearly flat spectrum for frequency below $\nu_{0}$, arising from the progressive activation of larger inclusions at lower frequencies. This effective superparamagnetism model based on the SPI size distrbution has important implications for magnetic grain alignment, dust polarization, and magnetic dipole emission across diverse environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14192" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LIGHTS.

We estimate that the progenitor had a stellar mass of $\sim 3.7\times 10^7$ M$_\odot$. Despite an intriguing apparent offset between the centroid of the host galaxy and the apparent center of the stream orbit, we find that we can reproduce the morphology, including this apparent off-centering, with simple models and standard assumptions about the host (thin disk centered within a canonical spherical dark matter halo) and the progenitor satellite orbit. We identify a number of detailed features of the stream, such as changes in curvature and density, that will require more complex models to reproduce. Even this rather simple system provides a rich set of constraints with which to explore the accretion history and gravitational potential of an otherwise unremarkable late-type galaxy. Given the depth of the LIGHTS images, this system is an example of the types of stellar stream that could be found in a majority of nearby giant galaxies with the 10-year stack of Rubin/LSST data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pre-perihelion Volatile Evolution of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Indicating Significant Contribution from Extended Source in the Coma</a><span class="id">[2602.14218]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interstellar comets provide rare opportunities for probing the diversity of refractory and volatile inventory around other stars.

Identifying these stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and in NGC4258 (for all three of which there are published geometric distances) we find that the marginalized luminosity functions are each well approximated by single-peaked Gaussians, having one-sigma dispersions of +/- 0.22 mag, +/- 0.25 mag and +/- 0.24 mag, respectively.

While optical abundance determinations rely on extensively validated line lists and modeling frameworks, infrared measurements still face larger uncertainties, largely driven by the choice of atmospheric models and the quality of the available atomic data. In this work, we aim to deliver a homogeneous and reproducible set of atomic absorption lines in the Y, J, and H bands (9800 - 18000 (Angstrom)), based exclusively on laboratory atomic data. We analyse CRIRES spectra of six Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars spanning a wide range in effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical composition. Synthetic spectra are computed using the benchmark stellar parameters, and each transition is evaluated independently in every star through a quantitative sequence that examines line depth, saturation, blending (purity), and the agreement between observed and synthetic line profiles. We identify a set of robust atomic transitions in these bands that remain consistent across the full range of stellar parameters represented in our sample. Lines of alpha-elements such as Mg I, Si I, and Ca I, together with several Fe I transitions, satisfy all robustness criteria. Among the neutron-capture species explored, only Sr II provides lines that consistently meet our requirements. Beyond the specific list of accepted transitions, this study demonstrates that a fully quantitative, multi-criteria framework provides a transparent and reproducible foundation for near-infrared line validation as laboratory data, stellar atmosphere models, and instrumentation continue to improve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I-Band Asymptotic Giant Branch (IAGB) Stars: II.

This first exploratory, large-sample comparison is independent of any extinction (foreground or internal) that may be shared by these two populations. The marginalized luminosity functions used to determine the modal value of the {\it IAGB } population are well fit by a single, symmetric Gaussian. The difference in the two apparent magnitudes (in the sense IAGB minus TRGB) is -0.589 mag, with a combined standard deviation of +/- 0.119 mag. Adopting M_I = -4.05 mag for the TRGB stars, the modal absolute magnitude of the IAGB is then calculated to be M_I(IAGB) = -4.64 +/- 0.12 mag. The ensemble dispersion quoted above gives a standard error on the mean of +/- 0.012 mag (based on the full sample of 92 galaxies). Independently, the three geometry-based zero points for I-band AGB stars are found (in Paper I) to be M_I = -4.49 +/- 0.003 mag in the LMC (4204 stars), M_I = -4.67 +/- 0.008 mag, for the SMC (916 stars) and M_I = -4.78 +/- 0.030 mag for NGC4258 (62 stars), leading to a global zero-point (weighted) average of &lt;M_I&gt; = -4.64 +/- 0.15 mag (stat). The scatter found in the anchors is comparable to the scatter in the field sample discussed here, but the calibration sample is small. The application of this method to galaxies well outside of the Local Group, shows that these standard candles can readily be found and measured out to at least 9 Mpc, using already available archival data</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14496" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Back to Normal Again: Possible Destinies of JWST overmassive SMBHs and &quot;Little Red Dots&quot; in the View of Shin-Uchuu Simulation</a><span class="id">[2602.14496]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled the discovery of hundreds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at redshifts $z\gtrsim 4-7$. A non-negligible fraction of these SMBHs are hosted in galaxies with BH-to-galaxy mass ratios ($M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$) being excessively larger than that for local SMBHs by $\sim 1-2$ dex. The origin of these “overmassive” BHs remains elusive, demanding either a heavy seed formation scenario or rapid growth of seed BHs. Their deviation from local scaling relations challenges our understanding of how SMBHs and their host galaxies coevolve across cosmic time. In this paper, we apply phenomenological modelings for BHs and galaxies to dark matter halo merger histories from N-body simulations to investigate the subsequent evolution of JWST-discovered “overmassive” SMBHs. We find that early evolution of “overmassive” SMBHs is dominated by stunted accretion leading to gradual decreases in $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios. In contrast, less massive SMBHs experience super-Eddington accretion during their early evolution, resulting in a slow increase of mass ratios toward $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star \sim 0.01$. Convergence occurs at $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^8~M_\odot$ with $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star \sim 0.01$. At lower redshift, nearly all SMBHs evolve onto local relations, as expected given that our models adopt empirical relations derived from low-redshift observations. This suggests that the global feedback mechanisms regulating the coevolution of $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios are implicitly encoded in local relations in terms of star-formation rate distribution, black hole accretion rate distribution and their active (quiescent) fractions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infrared spectra of methane-containing ice mixtures for JWST data analysis</a><span class="id">[2602.14604]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Solid methane (CH$_4$) is an important molecule in interstellar and planetary environments, serving as a precursor to complex organic compounds and a potential biosignature in exoplanetary studies. Despite its significance, laboratory data on low-temperature phase of methane below 10 K remain limited. Aims. We aim to obtain spectra of methane in binary mixtures at 10 K and compare it to the spectra obtained at 6.7 K. These temperatures correspond to phases II and II* of pure methane and are representative of dark molecular clouds and protostars at early stages. We also aim to test the obtained data applicability to JWST data interpretation. Methods. Laboratory reference spectra were obtained on the ISEAge setup via FTIR spectroscopy in transmission mode. A weighted $\chi^2$ minimization is used for the fitting. Results. We present infrared spectra with corresponding band strengths of pure methane and binary mixtures with methane: CH$_4$:H$_2$O,CH$_4$:CO$_2$, CH$_4$:CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$:NH$_3$ at 6.7 K and 10 K showing a 20\% increase in mixtures compared to commonly used 10 K band strength value of pure methane. We also test the usability of the spectra on open JWST data by probing the spatial distribution of methane in B335. We also present additional experiments concerning the phase transition of methane between phase II* and phase II. Conclusions. Our results reveal distinct spectral features for methane in non-H$_2$O environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of JWST observations. The dataset of spectra, publicly available on Zenodo, can be used for fitting JWST data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14628" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large-scale and local environmental drivers of quenching: tracing H$α$ concentration in X-ray and optical galaxy groups</a><span class="id">[2602.14628]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To explore the environmental mechanisms causing quenching in nearby star-forming galaxies, we study the variation with local and large-scale environments of a star formation concentration index, C-index $\equiv\log{(r_{50,{\rm H}\alpha}/r_{50,\rm cont}})$, that traces the spatially-resolved distribution of H$\alpha$ emission. Our analysis combines (i) GAMA spectroscopic redshift survey data to optically select galaxy groups and reconstruct the cosmic web, (ii) eROSITA data to identify X-ray-emitting groups, and (iii) SAMI Galaxy Survey data to characterise spatially-resolved star formation. We find that galaxies in X-ray+optical groups exhibit the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to optical groups and the field (independently of group or stellar mass). Star-forming galaxies in more X-ray luminous groups at fixed dynamical mass show more concentrated star formation. At large scales, nodes show the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to filaments and voids, which have similar C-index distributions. C-index correlates most strongly with the distance to the closest node, leaving no significant role for other local or large-scale environment metrics. Finally, regular star-forming galaxies tend to have spins aligned parallel to filaments, consistent with smooth gas accretion, while centrally-concentrated galaxies tend have spins aligned perpendicular to filaments, likely driven by mergers and associated with bulge growth. These results suggest that multi-scale environmental processes, i.e. locally and at large-scale, act to concentrate star formation toward galaxy centres, via gas-related mechanisms in nodes and ram-pressure stripping in X-ray+optical groups.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14804" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carbon chain diversity in L1544 and IRAS 16293-2422: an astrochemical pathfinder study for the SKAO</a><span class="id">[2602.14804]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Astrochemical observations have revealed a surprisingly high level of chemical complexity, including long carbon chains, in the earliest stages of Sun-like star formation. The origin of these species and whether they undergo further growth, possibly contributing to the molecular complexity of planetary systems, remain open questions. We present recent observations performed using the 100-m Green Bank Telescope of the prestellar core L1544 and the protostellar system IRAS 16293-2422. In L1544, we detected several complex carbon-bearing species, including $\mathrm{C_2S}$, $\mathrm{C_3S}$, $\mathrm{C_3N}$, $\mathrm{c\text{-}C_3H}$, $\mathrm{C_4H}$, and $\mathrm{C_6H}$, complementing previously reported emission of cyanopolyynes. In IRAS 16293-2422, we detected $\mathrm{c\text{-}C_3H}$ and, for the first time, $\mathrm{HC_7N}$. Thanks to the high spectral resolution, we refine the rest frequencies of several $\mathrm{c\text{-}C_3H}$ and $\mathrm{C_6H}$ transitions. We perform radiative transfer analysis, highlighting a chemical difference between the two sources: IRAS 16293-2422 shows column densities 10-100 times lower than L1544. We perform astrochemical modeling, employing an up-to-date chemical network with revised reaction rates. The models reproduce the general trends, with cyanopolyyne and polyynyl radical abundances decreasing as molecular size increases, but they underestimate the abundances of cyanopolyynes longer than $\mathrm{HC_5N}$ by up to two orders of magnitude. Current models, which include the dominant neutral-neutral formation routes, cannot account for this discrepancy, suggesting that the chemical network is incomplete. We propose that additional ion-molecule reactions are crucial for the formation of these species. Developing a more comprehensive chemical network for long carbon chains is essential for accurately interpreting present and future observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reduction of bar fraction in paired galaxies in the SDSS</a><span class="id">[2602.14873]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the bar fraction in galaxy pairs from the SDSS to assess how galaxy interactions affect bar structures. Compared to isolated galaxies, close pairs exhibit a significantly reduced bar fraction at projected separations within 25 kpc. This reduction is driven almost entirely by systems showing clear merger or disturbance signatures, indicating that tidal interactions suppress bars. The decline is dominated by a decrease in weak bars, while the fraction of strong bars remains largely unchanged. Bar suppression is primarily associated with major mergers and is strongest in massive host galaxies. A weaker but statistically significant suppression is detected in minor mergers only for massive galaxies with small bulges. In contrast, no significant dependence of bar suppression on the relative orientation between pair members is found.

Within this same inner radius, the surface brightness and density of the ICM is sharply peaked, and the cooling time falls to $t_\mathrm{cool}=280^{+150}_{-120}$ Myr. A novel forward-modeling analysis of the XMM data extends imaging and spectroscopic measurements of this system out to $r_{500}$, constraining the redshift to $z=1.50\pm0.03$, with a mean temperature of $kT = 7.3\pm1.1$ keV and an emission-weighted mean metallicity of $Z/Z_\odot = 0.43^{+0.46}_{-0.25}$.

However, at metallicities below [Fe/H] $&lt; -0.5$, stellar surfaces are altered by a poorly understood process known as extra mixing, which modifies [C/N] in a mass- and metallicity-dependent manner. This effect complicates the application of the traditional [C/N]-age relation in metal-poor regimes. Within the MW, constraining the mass dependence of extra mixing is particularly challenging because stars at [Fe/H] $&lt; -0.5$ are predominantly old and therefore low-mass, leading to strong degeneracies between mass and metallicity. In this work, we explore the potential of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) to disentangle these effects and constrain extra mixing as a function of age and metallicity. By comparing empirical corrections calibrated in the MW with predictions from thermohaline mixing models, we isolate the mass dependence of extra mixing in the MCs down to [Fe/H] $\sim-0.7$. We find that the empirical calibration performs well for lower-mass stars ($&lt; 1.25$ $M_{\odot}$), while theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed mass dependence down to $\sim$ 1.25 $M_{\odot}$. We further present the first observational evidence that extra mixing becomes ineffective above $\sim$ 1.8 $M_{\odot}$ at [Fe/H] $\sim -0.7$. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of deriving [C/N]-based ages for individual stars in external galaxies. Future observations targeting higher-$\log g$ or fainter stars in the MCs will provide stronger constraints on extra-mixing processes and enable the calibration of [C/N]-age relation that can be applied to low-metallicity individual stars in the MW or external galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-frequency mapping of the S255IR region at a wavelength of 1 mm</a><span class="id">[2602.14956]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The results of interferometric observations of the star-forming region S255IR in the frequency range 210–250 GHz are presented. The observations were carried out with the antenna array SMA (Hawaii, USA). Fifty-three molecules were detected, including complex organic molecules (COMs) such as CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, and many others. Typical rotational temperatures in the hot core SMA1 fall in the range 100–200 K. Optical depths in the lines of methanol and some other molecules in the cores SMA1 and SMA2 were estimated. In SMA1, the optical depth of one of the strongest methanol lines, $5_{-1}-4_{-1}E$, proved to be $23.8 \pm 1.5$. Based on this value, one can assume that the lines of other oxygen-containing COMs, such as CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, which are typically much less abundant in hot cores than methanol, are optically thin in SMA1. Most of the detected molecules can be roughly divided into two groups. The molecules of the first group emit exclusively toward the hot core SMA1, while some or all lines of the molecules of the second group, in addition to SMA1, can be seen toward a ring-like structure to the west of SMA1. This structure is most likely associated with the walls of a cavity formed by high-velocity outflows driven by young stellar objects (YSOs) in molecular cores SMA1, SMA2, and possibly SMA3. The gas temperature and density in the cavity walls were estimated using methanol lines. The temperature was found to be about 50–60 K, and the density about $10^7-10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. The column density of methanol near the brightness peaks in the lines of this molecule is about $5\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$. The column densities of other COMs in the ring-like structure will be determined in future studies with increased sensitivity achieved by spectral line stacking.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generalization from Low- to Moderate-Resolution Spectra with Neural Networks for Stellar Parameter Estimation: A Case Study with DESI</a><span class="id">[2602.15021]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cross-survey generalization is a critical challenge in stellar spectral analysis, particularly in cases such as transferring from low- to moderate-resolution surveys. We investigate this problem using pre-trained models, focusing on simple neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), with a case study transferring from LAMOST low-resolution spectra (LRS) to DESI medium-resolution spectra (MRS). Specifically, we pre-train MLPs on either LRS or their embeddings and fine-tune them for application to DESI stellar spectra. We compare MLPs trained directly on spectra with those trained on embeddings derived from transformer-based models (self-supervised foundation models pre-trained for multiple downstream tasks). We also evaluate different fine-tuning strategies, including residual-head adapters, LoRA, and full fine-tuning. We find that MLPs pre-trained on LAMOST LRS achieve strong performance, even without fine-tuning, and that modest fine-tuning with DESI spectra further improves the results. For iron abundance, embeddings from a transformer-based model yield advantages in the metal-rich ([Fe/H] &gt; -1.0) regime, but underperform in the metal-poor regime compared to MLPs trained directly on LRS. We also show that the optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on the specific stellar parameter under consideration. These results highlight that simple pre-trained MLPs can provide competitive cross-survey generalization, while the role of spectral foundation models for cross-survey stellar parameter estimation requires further exploration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamics of powerful radio galaxies</a><span class="id">[2307.08341]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Analytical models describing the dynamics of lobed radio sources are essential for interpretation of the tens of millions of radio sources that will be observed by the Square Kilometre Array and pathfinder instruments.

The most recent generation of analytical models combines these limiting cases for a more comprehensive description. We extend the mathematical formalism of historical models to describe source expansion in non-uniform environments, and directly compare different model classes with each other, and with hydrodynamic numerical simulations.

Previous simulations have found that cluster mergers are effective in destroying CCs but fail to prevent overcooling in cluster cores when radiative cooling is included. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a promising mechanism for balancing cooling in CCs; however, the role of AGN feedback in CC/NCC transitions remains elusive. In this work, we perform three-dimensional binary cluster merger simulations incorporating AGN feedback and radiative cooling, aiming to investigate the heating effects from mergers and AGN feedback on CC destruction. We vary the mass ratio and impact parameter to examine the entropy evolution of different merger scenarios. We find that AGN feedback is essential in regulating the merging clusters, and that CC destruction depends on the merger parameters. Our results suggest three scenarios regarding CC/NCC transitions: (1) CCs are preserved in minor mergers or mergers that do not trigger sufficient heating, in which cases AGN feedback is crucial for preventing the cooling catastrophe; (2) CCs are transformed into NCCs by major mergers during the first core passage, and AGN feedback is subdominant; (3) in major mergers with a large impact parameter, mergers and AGN feedback operate in concert to destroy the CCs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GA-NIFS: interstellar medium properties and tidal interactions in the evolved massive merging system B14-65666 at z=7.152</a><span class="id">[2412.15027]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of the z=7.152 galaxy system B14-65666, as part of the GA-NIFS survey. Line and continuum emission in this massive system (log10(M*/Msol)=9.8+/-0.2) is resolved into two strong cores surrounded by diffuse emission, as seen in recent JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our dataset contains detections of [OII]3726,3729, [NeIII]3869,3968, Balmer lines, [OIII]4959,5007, HeI5875, and weak [OIII]4363. Each spectrum is fit with a model that consistently incorporates interstellar medium conditions (i.e., electron temperature, Te, electron density, ne, and colour excess, E(B-V)). The resulting line fluxes are used to constrain the gas-phase metallicity (Zg 0.2-0.3 solar) and HBeta-based SFR for each region. Common line ratio diagrams (O32-R23, R3-R2, Ne3O2-R23) reveal that each line-emitting region lies at the intersection of low- and high-redshift galaxies, suggesting low ionisation and higher metallicity compared to the predominantly lower-mass galaxies studied with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU so far at z&gt;5.5. Spaxel-by-spaxel fits reveal evidence for both narrow (FWHM&lt;400 km s-1) and broad (FWHM&gt;500 km s-1) line emission, the latter of which likely represents tidal interaction or outflows. Comparison to ALMA [CII]158um and [OIII]88um data shows a similar velocity structure, and we explore optical-far-infrared diagnostics. The two core galaxies both lie on the mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;4, but show contrasting properties (e.g., M*, Zg), suggesting distinct evolutionary pathways. Combining the NIRSpec IFU and ALMA datasets, our analysis opens new windows into the merging system B14-65666.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy mergers classification using CNNs trained on Sérsic models, residuals and raw images</a><span class="id">[2502.16603]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy mergers are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, and with large upcoming datasets, automated methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are essential for efficient detection. It is understood that CNNs classify mergers by identifying deviations from the regular, expected shapes of galaxies, particularly faint features that are indicative of a merger event. In this work, we present a novel investigation of the relative importance of different morphological components, namely faint residual features and position and spatial structure, in CNN-based binary classification of galaxies into merger and non-merger classes. Using mock images from the IllustrisTNG simulations processed to mimic Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations, we fit Sérsic profiles to each galaxy and generate three datasets: original images, model images containing only smooth Sérsic profiles, and residual images highlighting faint features after model subtraction. We train three identical CNNs on these datasets: CNN1 on original images, CNN2 on model images, and CNN3 on residual images. CNN1, trained on full images, achieves the highest accuracy of 74 percent. CNN2, using only shape information including source position, achieves 70 percent, while CNN3, using only faint residual features, achieves 68 percent. We find that galaxy merger classification is possible using either faint features or the position and Sérsic profile information present in residual and model images, respectively. Our results demonstrate that not only faint features but also source position information play complementary roles in merger classification. This has important implications for the design and interpretation of machine learning methods for galaxy morphology, particularly in regimes where specific image components may be enhanced or suppressed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MUSE-DARK-I: Dark matter halo properties of intermediate-z star-forming galaxies</a><span class="id">[2506.19721]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>[Abridged] We analyse the dark matter (DM) halo properties of 127 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) down to low stellar masses (8&lt;log(Mstar/Msun)&lt;11), using data from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey and photometry from HST and JWST.

We perform a disk-halo decomposition with a 3D parametric model that includes stellar, gas, and DM components, with pressure support corrections. We validate our methodology on mock data cubes generated from idealised disk simulations. We select the best-fitting DM model among six density profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White and the generalised alpha-beta-gamma profile of Di Cintio et al. (2014, DC14). Our Bayesian analysis shows that DC14 performs as well as or better than the other profiles in &gt;80% of the sample.

For 66% of SFGs, we infer a DM inner slope, gamma &lt; 0.5, indicating cored DM profiles, but no correlation is found between gamma and star formation rate of the sample. The stellar- and concentration-mass relations agree with theoretical expectations, but with larger scatter. We confirm the anticorrelation between halo scale radius and DM density. The halo scale radii and DM surface densities increase with Mstar, while DM densities stay constant. We find tentative evidence of an evolution of the DM density with z, which suggests that the DM halos of intermediate-z systems are denser than those of local galaxies. In contrast, the halo scale radii are z-invariant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00736" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A normalizing flow approach for the inference of star cluster properties from unresolved broadband photometry I: Comparison to spectral energy distribution fitting</a><span class="id">[2508.00736]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Estimating properties of star clusters from unresolved broadband photometry is a challenging problem that is classically tackled by spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting methods that are based on simple stellar population models. However, because of their exponential scaling, grid-based methods suffer from computational limitations. In addition, nuisance parameters in the model can make the computation of the likelihood function intractable. These limitations can be overcome by modern generative deep learning methods that offer flexible and powerful tools for modeling high-dimensional posterior distributions and fast inference from learned data. We present a normalizing flow approach for the inference of cluster age, mass, and reddening from Hubble Space Telescope broadband photometry. In particular, we explore our network's behavior on an inference problem that has been analyzed in previous works. We used the SED modeling code CIGALE to create a dataset of synthetic photometric observations for $5 \times 10^6$ mock star clusters. Subsequently, this data set was used to train a coupling-based flow in the form of a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) to predict posterior probability distributions for cluster age, mass, and reddening from photometric observations. We predicted cluster parameters for the 'Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS' (PHANGS) Data Release 3 catalog. To evaluate the capabilities of the network, we compared our results to the publicly available PHANGS estimates and found that the estimates agree reasonably well. We demonstrate that normalizing flow methods can be a viable tool for the inference of cluster parameters, and argue that this approach is especially useful when nuisance parameters make the computation of the likelihood intractable and in scenarios that require efficient density estimation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14350" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Insight from the James Webb Space Telescope on Variable Active Galactic Nuclei</a><span class="id">[2508.14350]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Variability detected in galaxies is usually attributed to their active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While all AGNs are intrinsically variable, the AGN unification model predicts that type 2 AGNs rarely vary because their engines are blocked by dust tori. Previous UV-to-near-IR variability studies largely support this expectation. Here, we present a variability study by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveals a more subtle picture. Using NIRCam imaging data from three surveys over $\sim$140 arcmin$^2$ in the COSMOS field, we found 117 galaxies with $\geq 4$$\sigma$ variability in the F356W band across $\sim$2-year baseline. Cross-matching with the existing JWST spectroscopic data, we identified five of them at $z=0.19$–3.69 (F356W corresponding to rest-frame $\lambda\approx0.76-2.97$ $\mu$m), which were all coincidentally observed by a NIRSpec program almost contemporaneously with the last imaging epoch. One additional variable was identified at $z=0.90$ using the archival Keck telescope data. These six objects form our spectroscopic subsample. Interestingly, two reside in close-pair environments, while two others form a close pair themselves. Most of their light curves can hardly be explained by nuclear transients, and AGN variability is a more plausible cause. However, among these six objects, (1) only one shows broad Bracket and Pfund series permitted lines ($\Delta v &gt; 1000$ km s$^{-1}$) indicative of a type 1 AGN; (2) two show narrow permitted lines (H$\alpha$ and/or He I$\lambda10830$) consistent with type 2 AGNs, with another one likely type 2 based on the host galaxy properties; and (3) two others, which form a pair, show no emission lines. Our results add more challenges to the unification model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the spatially-resolved capabilities of the J-PAS survey with Py2DJPAS</a><span class="id">[2509.12327]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Py2DJPAS, a Python-based tool to automate the analysis of spatially resolved galaxies in the \textbf{miniJPAS} survey, a 1 deg$^2$ precursor of the J-PAS survey, using the same filter system, telescope, and Pathfinder camera.

While previous studies found that galaxies closer to filaments tend to be more massive and quenched, it remained unclear whether these trends reflect intrinsic environmental effects or changes in the galaxy population mix. To address this, we focus exclusively on star-forming galaxies, robustly selected using both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas depletion timescale criteria, in order to isolate the direct impact of the cosmic web on star-forming galaxies. We reconstruct the 3D cosmic web skeleton using DisPerSE and compute each galaxy's distance to its nearest filament. After removing mass dependencies, we examine deviations in star formation rate (SFR), sSFR, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales, and gas fractions as a function of this distance. We find a clear and redshift-dependent modulation of star formation with filament proximity: at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 2$), galaxies closer to filaments show enhanced SFR and gas accretion, reflecting efficient filament-fed growth. At $z=0$, we observe a V-shaped trend in the sSFR and depletion timescales, with minima at intermediate distances ($\sim 0.25$ cMpc) and a surprising upturn very close to the filament cores, suggesting a resumed accretion in the densest environments. These effects are not driven by mergers and are primarily associated with satellite galaxies at low redshift. Our results demonstrate that large-scale cosmic web proximity modulates star formation in star-forming galaxies through a combination of gas supply regulation and environmental processing, with different mechanisms dominating across cosmic time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05067" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral Properties of Anomalous Microwave Emission in 144 Galactic Clouds</a><span class="id">[2510.05067]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) is a diffuse microwave component thought to arise from spinning dust grains, yet remains poorly understood. We analyze AME in 144 Galactic clouds by combining low-frequency maps from S-PASS (2.3 GHz), C-BASS (4.76 GHz), and QUIJOTE (10-20 GHz) with 21 ancillary maps. Using aperture photometry and parametric SED fitting via MCMC methods without informative priors, we measure AME emissivity, peak frequency, and spectral width. We achieve peak frequency constraints nearly three times tighter than previous work and identify 83 new AME sources. AME spectra are generally broader than predicted by spinning dust models for a single phase of the interstellar medium, suggesting either multiple spinning dust components along the line of sight or incomplete representation of the grain size distribution in current models. However, the narrowest observed widths match theoretical predictions, supporting the spinning dust hypothesis. The AME amplitude correlates most strongly with the thermal dust peak flux and radiance, showing $\sim30$% scatter and sublinear scaling, which suggests reduced AME efficiency in regions with brighter thermal dust emission. AME peak frequency increases with thermal dust temperature in a trend current theoretical models do not reproduce, indicating that spinning dust models must incorporate dust evolution and radiative transfer in a self-consistent framework where environmental parameters and grain properties are interdependent. PAH tracers correlate with AME emissivity, supporting a physical link to small dust grains. Finally, a log-Gaussian function provides a good empirical description of the AME spectrum across the sample, given current data quality and frequency coverage.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for cloud-to-cloud variations in the ratio of polarized thermal dust emission to starlight polarization</a><span class="id">[2510.15389]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The correlation between optical starlight polarization and polarized thermal dust emission can be used to infer intrinsic dust properties. This correlation is quantified by the ratio Rp/p, which has been measured to be 5.42 +/- 0.05 MJy sr^-1 at 353 GHz when averaged over large areas of the sky. We investigate this correlation using newly published stellar polarimetric data densely sampling a continuous sky region of  4 square degrees at intermediate Galactic latitude. We combine RoboPol optical polarization measurements for 1,430 stars with submillimeter data from the Planck satellite at 353 GHz. We perform linear fits between the Planck (Qs, Us) and optical (qv, uv) Stokes parameters, accounting for the differences in resolution between the two datasets as well as the distribution of clouds along the line of sight. We find that in this region of the sky the Rp/p value is 3.67 +/- 0.05 MJy sr^-1, indicating a significantly shallower slope than that found previously using different stellar samples. We also find significant differences in the fitted slopes when fitting the Qs-qv and Us-uv data separately. We explore two explanations using mock data: miscalibration of polarization angle and variations in Rp/p along the line of sight due to multiple clouds. We show that the former can produce differences in the correlations of Qs-qv and Us-uv, but large miscalibration angles would be needed to reproduce the magnitude of the observed differences. Our simulations favor the interpretation that Rp/p differs between the two dominant clouds that overlap on the sky in this region. The difference in Rp/p suggests that the two clouds may have distinct dust polarimetric properties. With knowledge from the tomographic decomposition of the stellar polarization, we find that one cloud appears to dominate the correlation of Us-uv, while both clouds contribute to the correlation of the Qs-qv data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detailed Abundance Determination of Metal-Poor Stars with X-Shooter I.

Two of these stars, including the most metal poor at [Fe/H] = $-3.89 \pm 0.07$, are kinematically associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) accretion event, increasing the number of known GSE stars with [Fe/H] $&lt; -3.5$ to eight. From the X-Shooter spectra we determine abundances for 16 elements, with the element-to-iron abundance ratios generally consistent with high-resolution studies of Galactic halo stars. Within the sample, we identify three peculiar stars: the first is a GSE nitrogen enhanced metal-poor ([N/Fe] $= 1.60 \pm 0.10$ and [C/Fe] $= 0.23 \pm 0.08$) star with unusually high Na ([Na/Fe] $= 2.26 \pm 0.07$) and Li (A(Li)$_{\rm 3DNLTE} = 1.90 \pm 0.08$) abundances, but lacking enhancements in [Al/Fe] or [Mg/Fe]. The second is a halo r-II star significantly enhanced in Sr ([Sr/Ba] $= 0.39 \pm 0.08$), suggesting mixture of r-process and s-process enrichment, uncommon for r-II stars. Whilst the third is a halo star very depleted in N ([N/Fe] $&lt; -1.11$), with low C ([C/Fe] $= -0.33 \pm 0.08$) and otherwise 'normal' [X/Fe] abundances, suggesting enrichment with Type II supernova that proceeds enrichment from massive asymptotic giant branch stars.

For concrete applications related to the Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen, we examine how fine-structure splitting and deuterium injection modify the emergent spectra, internal radiation field, and radiative force multiplier. We show that these effects leave previous conclusions about Lyman-alpha feedback in the early universe essentially unchanged. Even when direct observational diagnostics are subtle, our framework provides novel analytic and numerical insights into coupled resonance-line transport and facilitates progress in general modeling of multi-line radiative transfer in diverse astrophysical settings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing AGN Feedback in Dwarf Galaxies with Spatially Resolved NIR Coronal Lines from JWST</a><span class="id">[2512.05041]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first spatially resolved investigation of near-infrared coronal lines in dwarf galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN), using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy. Coronal lines (CLs), which are forbidden transitions from highly ionized species with ionization potentials up to 450 eV, act as sensitive tracers of the AGN ionizing continuum and feedback processes. Across four dwarf galaxies with ionized gas outflows traced by the optical [O III] lines, we report the detection of 16 unique species of near-infrared CLs. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that photoionization from the AGN dominates the excitation of CLs. We find that the coronal line region in dwarf galaxies, traced by the various CLs, extends up to 0.5 kpc, and can constitute up to 10% of their host galaxy size. Correlations between CL luminosities and [O III] ionized gas outflow properties are consistent with a scenario in which AGN-driven outflows likely facilitate the detection of CLs and contribute to their extent. Several CLs, including [Si VI], [Si VII], and [Mg VIII], exhibit a secondary broad component with W$_{80}$ (the line width enclosing 80% of the total flux)&gt; 300 km/s. If we interpret this spatially compact gas as part of an outflow, this would indicate that the outflowing gas includes a wide range of ionizations. The estimated energetics imply this highly ionized component is compact yet powerful enough to perturb gas in the central regions of the host dwarfs. These results indicate that AGN in low-mass galaxies may produce outflows capable of influencing their structure and evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11058" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) II: Discovery of five MSPs in M69 and M70</a><span class="id">[2512.11058]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper reports recent discoveries from the Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) survey, which aims to uncover pulsars in the globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). Utilising the Band-4 (550$-$750 MHz) and Band-3 (300$-$500 MHz) receivers, the survey targets GCs accessible to uGMRT ($-53^\circ\,&lt;\,\delta\,&lt;\,-17^\circ$), excluding the declination range that can be covered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The survey focuses on GCs that have not previously been searched with comparable sensitivity in these radio frequencies. In this paper, we present the discovery of the five MSPs in two GCs, $-$ NGC 6637 (M69) and NGC 6681 (M70), each hosting MSPs identified here for the first time. Observations of M69 led to the discovery of two MSPs: J1831$-$3220A (M69A) and J1831$-$3220B (M69B), both of which we localize with arcsecond precision using interferometric imaging. Observations of M70 resulted in three new MSPs: J1843$-$3217A (M70A), J1843$-$3217B (M70B), and J1843$-$3217C (M70C). Although direct imaging did not yield precise localizations for these MSPs, we provide initial estimates based on uGMRT beam forming and imaging analysis. Additionally, we present preliminary imaging results for other observed GCs, and in cases of non-detections, we report upper limits on pulsed emission based on the rms noise levels in the image plane.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mode Energy Partition in Partially Ionized Compressible MHD Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2512.12517]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate how neutral-ion collisional damping modifies the spectral properties and energy partition of compressible MHD turbulence using a suite of 3D two-fluid simulations. By systematically varying the neutral-ion coupling strength and decomposing the turbulent velocity field into Alfvén, slow, and fast (polarization) modes, we quantify how each mode responds to the transition from strong to weak coupling. In the strong-coupling regime, the Alfvén and slow modes follow nearly Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ spectra and dominate the kinetic energy budget, while fast modes exhibit a steeper spectrum and contribute $\sim$10\% of the total energy. As the coupling weakens and neutral-ion damping becomes significant, all mode spectra steepen, approaching a dissipation-dominated $k^{-4}$ spectrum, except that the slope mode's spectrum parallel to the mean magnetic field has a power-law slope shallower than -4. While the total kinetic energy is reduced in the weak coupling regime, the slow-mode energy fraction increases substantially toward small scales, whereas the Alfvén-mode fraction decreases correspondingly. In contrast, the fast-mode energy fraction remains largely insensitive to coupling strength. These results demonstrate that partial ionization not only steepens the turbulent spectra but also reshapes the mode energy distribution, enhancing the relative importance of the slow mode while suppressing Alfvén mode in the damping regime. Our findings have important implications for turbulence-driven processes in the partially ionized interstellar medium, including cosmic-ray transport and acceleration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17885" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asymptotic behaviour of galactic small-scale dynamos at modest magnetic Prandtl number</a><span class="id">[2512.17885]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic fields are critical at many scales to galactic dynamics and structure, including multiphase pressure balance, dust processing, and star formation. Dynamo action determines their dynamical structure and strength. Simulations of combined large- and small-scale dynamos have successfully developed mean fields with strength and topology consistent with observations but with turbulent fields much weaker than observed, while simulations of small-scale dynamos with parameters relevant to the interstellar medium yield turbulent fields an order of magnitude below the values observed or expected theoretically. We use the Pencil Code accelerated on GPUs with Astaroth to perform high-resolution simulations of a supernova-driven galactic dynamo including heating and cooling in a periodic domain. Our models show that the strength of the turbulent field produced by the small-scale dynamo approaches an asymptote at only modest magnetic Prandtl numbers. This allows us to use these models to suggest the essential characteristics of this constituent of the magnetic field for inclusion in global galactic models. The asymptotic limit occurs already at magnetic Prandtl number of only a few hundred, many orders of magnitude below physical values in the the interstellar medium and consistent with previous findings for isothermal compressible flows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08524" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the Great Attractor: The Local Group's streamline trajectory, cosmic velocity and dynamical fate</a><span class="id">[2601.08524]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit the Great Attractor using the Manticore-Local suite of digital twins of the nearby Universe. The Great Attractor concept has been proposed as an answer to three distinct questions: what sources the Local Group velocity in the cosmic microwave background frame, where present-day velocity streamlines converge, and where the Local Group is moving to. Addressing the original motivation of the Great Attractor – explaining the Local Group cosmic velocity – we find that mass within $155~h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ accounts for only ${\sim}72\%$ of that velocity magnitude with ${\sim}38\,°$ directional offset. We show that even in the purely linear regime convergence within this volume is not guaranteed, particularly when also accounting for small-scale contributions to the observer velocity; no single structure, including the proposed Great Attractor, would be expected to dominate the velocity budget. Streamline convergence is smoothing-scale-dependent, transitioning from Virgo at small scales through the Hydra–Centaurus region at intermediate scales to Shapley at large scales; at intermediate smoothing the convergence point lies near Abell 3565 with an asymmetric basin of mass $\log( M / (h^{-1} \mathrm{M}_\odot)) = 16.4 \pm 0.1$ that excludes Norma. To address the third question, we evolve the Manticore-Local realisations to scale factor $a = 10$ in a new Beyond-Present-Time simulation suite and identify the asymptotic future location of the Local Group. We find that the dominant motion is towards Virgo, but even it contributes at most one third of the Local Group velocity. Our results demonstrate that the classical Great Attractor is not a dynamically dominant structure but an artefact of the instantaneous velocity field, and that no single attractor is likely to account for the Local Group motion in the cosmic rest frame.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The miniJPAS survey: Dissecting galaxy properties across environments with spatially resolved photometry</a><span class="id">[2601.08911]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) is an ongoing survey mapping thousands of square degrees in the Northern Hemisphere using 56 narrow-band filters, delivering IFU-like photometric data well suited for studying galaxy properties and evolution. As a precursor, the miniJPAS survey observed a 1 deg$^2$ field with the same filter system, providing an ideal testbed for the study of spatially resolved galaxies. In this work, we investigate the resolved stellar population and emission-line properties of 51 miniJPAS galaxies, classified by spectral type (red or blue) and environment (group or field), and assess the role of environment in galaxy evolution. We use the Py2DJPAS pipeline to process the data, homogenise the images to a common PSF, define galactic regions, and extract photo-spectra. Radial profiles are analysed using elliptical annuli spaced by 0.7 R_EFF, combined with an inside-out segmentation to study star formation histories. Stellar population parameters are derived with the Bayesian SED-fitting code BaySeAGal, while artificial neural networks are used to estimate the equivalent widths of the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [NII], and [OIII] emission lines. We find clear trends in a mass density-colour diagram: denser, redder regions are older, more metal-rich, and have lower specific star formation rates, while bluer, less dense regions show stronger emission lines and higher sSFRs. Red and blue galaxies are well separated in these relations, whereas environmental classification shows no clear distinction. Radial profiles support an inside-out formation scenario, with significant differences between red and blue galaxies but no strong environmental dependence. We suggest that the weak environmental effects may be due to the relatively low stellar masses of the galaxy groups in our sample.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01894" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two late-T dwarfs at kiloparsec distances revealed by JWST UNCOVER survey</a><span class="id">[2602.01894]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We conducted a search for brown dwarf candidates in a James Webb Space Telescope deep field around A2744 to investigate the space density of these objects at kiloparsec distances. Our methodology employed an initial selection based on photometric colours, followed by spectral energy distribution fitting to both stellar atmospheric models and high-redshift galaxy templates. This approach yielded two robust T dwarf candidates and one possible L subdwarf candidate. The T dwarfs have estimated Galactic heights of 0.43 and 0.86 kpc, likely residing near the outer edges of the Galactic thin and thick discs, respectively. We measure a T dwarf surface number density of 0.094 per squared arcmin in the UNCOVER field, lower than previous predictions but consistent at the order-of-magnitude level. We also provide space number density estimates for T5-T8.9 dwarfs across different effective temperature and spectral type bins, finding that T5-T7 dwarfs out to 2 kpc have significantly lower densities than their solar neighbourhood counterparts, whilst T8 dwarfs within the thick disc exhibit densities comparable to local values. Our analysis demonstrates that broad-band near- to mid-infrared photometry provides high sensitivity to late-T dwarfs but is relatively less sensitive to L and early-T dwarfs. Spectroscopy is typically required to distinguish photometric candidates of L dwarfs, early-T subdwarfs, and high-redshift galaxies in JWST deep fields. This study demonstrates the potential for expanding our understanding of brown dwarf distributions and characteristics at unprecedented distances, offering new insights into substellar populations beyond the solar neighbourhood.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The FLAMINGO Project: Exploring the X-ray–cosmic-shear cross-correlation as a probe of large-scale structure</a><span class="id">[2602.02484]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Baryonic feedback processes associated with galaxy formation directly influence the large-scale structure by redistributing gas. Recent measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and stacks of X-ray emission from optically selected galaxy clusters suggest that feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is more efficient at expelling gas from low-mass clusters than previously thought. The measurement of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and diffuse X-ray emission provides a new probe of the distribution of gas in groups and clusters. We use the FLAMINGO cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to examine the X-ray–cosmic-shear cross-correlation. The cross-correlation is most sensitive to the distribution of gas in haloes with masses $10^{14}\leq M_{200\mathrm{c}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\leq10^{15}$. It is sensitive to the strength of feedback, but the effects of variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. We compare the FLAMINGO predictions with the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps. We find that, if we neglect the X-ray emission from AGN that would remain unresolved by ROSAT, then the fiducial FLAMINGO model is in excellent agreement with the data, while models with stronger or weaker feedback are ruled out. However, if we account for unresolved AGN, either using the direct FLAMINGO predictions or by abundance matching to the observed (extrapolated) AGN luminosity function, then models with stronger feedback are preferred. We conclude that to exploit the potential of the X-ray–lensing cross-correlation, it will be necessary to resolve fainter AGN, and to use external constraints to break the degeneracy between baryonic feedback and cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Velocities of Free Floaters in a Sea of Stars</a><span class="id">[2602.12017]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the velocity evolution of free-floating planets and interstellar objects (“free floaters”) through gravitational scatterings by field stars (with the stellar mass $m$ much larger than the mass of the floater, $m_p$). We show that the equilibrium velocity – where dynamical friction balances stochastic acceleration – is given by $\sigma \sqrt{2\ln(m/m_p)}$ (where $\sigma$ is the velocity disperson of the field stars), diverging from the standard energy equipartition scaling. While the timescale to reach this equilibrium is prohibitively long, we find that slow floaters ($v \lesssim \sigma$) undergo mass-independent acceleration, doubling their velocities within a few relaxation times. Consequently, free floaters initially following the Maxwellian distribution of their parent stars develop distinctly non-Maxwellian velocity distributions on a relaxation timescale. Since the relaxation time of the Galactic disk is longer than the age, our results suggest that the kinematics of low-mass free floaters in the disk may preserve signatures of their parent stars and ejection history.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direct pathway to the Early Supermassive Black Holes: A Red Super-Eddington Quasar in a Massive Starburst Host at $z=7.2$</a><span class="id">[2602.12325]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a panchromatic optical-mm characterization of GNz7q, a recently identified X-ray weak, rapidly growing red quasar embedded within a dusty starburst galaxy at $z=7.1899$, using the full suite of JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI, and archival NOEMA observations. Our deep NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy reveals unambiguous broad Balmer emission (FWHM $=2221\pm20$kms$^{-1}$), confirming a super-Eddington accreting black hole ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}=2.7\pm0.4$) with a mass of $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot})=7.55\pm0.34$, using accretion-rate corrected BH mass estimators. After subtracting the point source, we robustly detect stellar emission from the host galaxy across multiple NIRCam and MIRI filters. Out joint morphological-spectral analysis yields a stellar mass of $\log (M_*/M_\odot)=10.5\pm0.4$ and an intense star formation rate of ${\rm SFR}=330\pm97\,M_\odot\,\rm yr^{-1}$, confirming the host as a massive, dusty starburst galaxy. We find that GNz7q lies on the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation ($M_{\rm BH}/M_*\simeq 0.001$) and is well positioned to evolve into the locus of massive SDSS quasars with $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)\approx 9$ and $M_*\approx 10^{11}\,M_\odot$ at $z\sim 6$, owing to its remarkably rapid growth in both the black hole and its host galaxy. This stands in stark contrast to many recently reported JWST AGN populations at similar redshifts, including the little red dots (LRDs), whose weak or undetected star formation makes it difficult for them to grow into the massive galaxies hosting SDSS-like quasars. These results suggest that GNz7q marks as a rare, pivotal phase of early BH-galaxy co-eolution, plausibly providing a crucial direct pathway to the supermassive black hole systems within the first billion years of the Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12460" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Simulation with Population III Stellar Feedback and Metal Enrichment I: Model Description And Convergence Test</a><span class="id">[2602.12460]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new Pop III + Pop II subgrid framework implemented in the moving-mesh code {\sc arepo}, designed to study the impact of Pop III feedback on star formation in the early universe.

We run a suite of $1c{\rm Mpc}/h$ box simulations with different initial conditions and resolutions from $z=127$ to $z=10$. The highest gas mass and spatial resolution in the fiducial simulation reach $\sim10\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and $\sim4\,{\rm pc}$, respectively. The model successfully reproduces the UV-inferred Pop II star formation rate density (SFRD) from recent JWST observations across all initial conditions, with only minor variation driven by local halo interactions and LW irradiation. We find that the volume filling factor of metal-enriched gas converges to $\sim1\%$ at $z=10$. Convergence is achieved once subhalos with $M_{\rm subhalo}\gtrsim 10^{6.5}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ are resolved, and the total stellar mass at $z=10$ is largely insensitive to initial conditions or the resolution considered in this work.

To test the contribution of massive stars to fluorine production in the early Universe, we conducted Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 5 spectroscopy of the HF(1-0) absorption line toward a dusty star-forming galaxy at $z=6.024$. This galaxy has a known gas-phase metallicity and is too young for low-mass AGB stars to have contributed significantly, providing a clean environment to isolate massive-star yields. We do not detect significant HF absorption ($\sim2\sigma$) and derive a conservative 5$\sigma$ upper limit of $N_\mathrm{HF}/N_\mathrm{H_2} &lt; 2.2\times10^{-9}$. This limit is about an order of magnitude below typical local measurements, indicating inefficient fluorine enrichment $\sim0.9$ Gyr after the Big Bang.

By investigating when and how stars formed, the star formation history (SFH) is a powerful tool to provide constraints for dynamical modeling of the system's past interactions and understand the processes of stripping and triggered star formation in tidally influenced environments. We aim to reconstruct the SFH of the Magellanic Bridge, the gaseous and stellar stream connecting the two Clouds. We used data from the deep optical STEP survey, which covers 54 $\mathrm{deg\, {^{2}}}$ across the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the Bridge, reaching stars below the oldest main sequence turnoff at the distance of the MCs. We applied the synthetic color-magnitude diagram (CMD) technique to 14 deg$^2$ of STEP data. We constructed two libraries of synthetic stellar populations based on the PARSEC-COLIBRI and BaSTI stellar evolutionary models, with metallicities in the range $-2.0\leq[$Fe/H$]\leq0$ across the whole Hubble time. We find a clear peak of recent star formation $\sim100$ Myr ago in the Magellanic Bridge, which becomes increasingly pronounced toward the SMC. The low metallicity of this population suggests that it formed from gas stripped from the SMC during its most recent close encounter with the LMC. In the eastern part of the Bridge (LMC side), the star formation peaks at earlier times, around 10 Gyr and 2 Gyr ago.

To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable.

In machine-learning pipelines, this occurs when the joint distribution of inputs and labels differs between the training (source) and application (target) domains, causing source-trained models to underperform on the target. Transfer learning and domain adaptation provide principled ways to mitigate this effect. We study a concrete simulation-to-observation case: semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) to transfer a four-class spectral classifier – high-redshift quasars, low-redshift quasars, galaxies, and stars – from J-PAS mock catalogs based on DESI spectra to real J-PAS observations. Our pipeline pretrains on abundant labeled DESI$\rightarrow$J-PAS mocks and adapts to the target domain using a small labeled J-PAS subset. We benchmark SSDA against two baselines: a J-PAS–only supervised model trained with the same target-label budget, and a mocks-only model evaluated on held-out J-PAS data. On this held-out J-PAS data, SSDA achieves a macro-F1 score (balancing precision and recall) of $0.82$ and an overall true positive rate of $0.89$, compared to $0.79/0.85$ for the J-PAS–only baseline and $0.73/0.87$ for the mocks-only model. The gains are driven primarily by improved quasar classification, especially in the high-redshift subclass ($\mathrm{F1}=0.66$ vs.\ $0.55/0.37$), yielding better-calibrated candidate lists for spectroscopic targeting (e.g., WEAVE-QSO) and AGN searches. This study shows how modest target supervision enables robust, data-efficient simulation-to-observation transfer when simulations are plentiful but target labels are scarce.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration.

Each of NIRCam's two modules (A and B) provides independent long wavelength (LW) grism spectroscopy over the 2.4-5.0 micron range, with orthogonally oriented R and C grisms. Using commissioning and calibration data from programs 01076, 01536, 01537, 01538, 01479, 01480, 04449, 04498, 06606, and 06628, we have measured the field-dependent geometry and wavelength dispersion of both first and second order spectra across the full detector area. The trace geometry was modeled using two-dimensional third-order polynomials that reproduce the observed spectral positions with an RMS accuracy better than 0.1 pixel. Wavelength calibration, derived from observations of the planetary nebula SMP LMC 58, achieves a precision of 1.6-1.9A for the +1 orders and 0.5A for the +2 orders. Absolute flux calibration, established from observations of the G-type star standard P330E, provides a consistent sensitivity function across all grisms and modules with an absolute flux accuracy of 3\%. The resulting calibration framework defines the geometric, wavelength, and photometric reference for all NIRCam WFSS observations and ensures cross-consistency between modules and grism orientations. These calibrations form the basis for accurate slitless spectroscopy with NIRCam and will support ongoing improvements to the JWST calibration pipeline and data products.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonlinearity in H4RG-10 Near-Infrared Detectors at Elevated Temperatures: Characterization and Data-Driven Correction Method</a><span class="id">[2602.13983]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report a newly identified nonlinearity in H4RG-10 near-infrared detectors operating under moderately elevated-temperature conditions (114 K). This component, that potentially arises from illumination-independent defect currents, introduces additional nonlinearity not captured by conventional correction models. To address this issue, we propose a data-driven nonlinearity correction (NLC) method that models the nonlinear behavior of both the classical response and the defect currents, using dual-illumination measurements and a dark exposure. Applied to H4RG-10 detectors on the PRIME telescope, the method significantly improves signal linearity, especially for pixels with high defect current, while maintaining comparable performance elsewhere. By selecting the optimal correction model per pixel, reliable NLC is achieved across the full array. This study characterizes a nonlinearity intrinsic to H4RG-10 detectors and demonstrates that data-driven post-processing can effectively restore linearity in the presence of large defect currents. Although these effects are unlikely to be significant under nominal operating temperatures, the approach may provide a practical calibration framework for future warm-operation scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimal polarization modulation and calibration schemes</a><span class="id">[2602.13997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We review the algebraic definition of the efficiency of a polarization modulation scheme, which is commonly adopted for solar and stellar spectro-polarimetry applications, and generalize it to allow distinct states of the modulation cycle to have arbitrary throughput and different photon-noise statistics for each state. Such a generalization becomes necessary to model and optimize the polarimetric efficiency of instruments implementing spatial polarization modulation schemes, where different optical paths are assigned to different polarization analysis states, which may be characterized by different throughput values. The proposed algebraic extension also proves essential for introducing a workable concept of the efficiency of a polarization calibration scheme, which can then be used to create a merit function for the optimization of calibration sequences, which take into account the specific characteristics of the polarimetric instrument and of its calibration optics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14006" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Image instabilities and polarization cross-talk</a><span class="id">[2602.14006]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We expand on our previous study of the impact of atmospheric seeing on polarization cross-talk, and show how the formalism that was developed in that work can be applied to treat the case of spatial modulators of polarization.

The GMCs are sensitive to the 2-50 keV energy band and have an effective area of 16 cm^2 per module at 6 keV. We verified the timing accuracy by observing the Crab Pulsar and confirmed stable timing performance within 100 microseconds. To demonstrate pulsar navigation, we applied a method that optimizes orbital parameters to maximize the significance of the pulsar X-ray pulse profile, known as the Significance Enhancement of Pulse-profile with Orbit-dynamics (SEPO) method. We observed the Crab Pulsar with a total exposure of approximately 100 ks at different epochs and analyzed the data transmitted to the ground. By comparing the optimized orbit with the satellite position derived from Global Positioning System data, we quantitatively evaluated the navigation performance. The results show that the position component along the Crab line of sight was consistently constrained within approximately 40 km, and the three-dimensional position error ranged from 27 to 370 km depending on the observation epoch. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying a CubeSat-class X-ray observatory to pulsar navigation and provide the first experimental verification that the accuracy of the SEPO method depends on the seasonal geometry between the orbital plane and the pulsar direction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14335" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predicting New Concept-Object Associations in Astronomy by Mining the Literature</a><span class="id">[2602.14335]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We construct a concept-object knowledge graph from the full astro-ph corpus through July 2025.

Because the concepts are derived from clustering and therefore overlap semantically, we apply an inference-time concept-similarity smoothing step uniformly to all methods. Across four temporal cutoffs on a physically meaningful subset of concepts, an implicit-feedback matrix factorization model (alternating least squares, ALS) with smoothing outperforms the strongest neighborhood baseline (KNN using text-embedding concept similarity) by 16.8% on NDCG@100 (0.144 vs 0.123) and 19.8% on Recall@100 (0.175 vs 0.146), and exceeds the best recency heuristic by 96% and 88%, respectively.

However, these elevation products were generated with a proprietary pipeline and have not been publicly released. We present a 0.30 m/pixel digital elevation model (DEM) of the Chandrayaan-3 Vikram landing site using a fully open workflow based on ISIS, the Ames Stereo Pipeline, and ALE, achieving sub-meter resolution comparable to mission-reported products. The reconstruction covers 2.18 x 2.24 km with 91.2% valid pixel coverage, 8.1 cm median triangulation error, and 40-50 cm relative vertical precision. The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover are individually resolved. Geodetic alignment to an LROC NAC stereo DEM achieves approximately 30 m horizontal accuracy; pixel-wise validation at 3 m resolution confirms negligible vertical bias (median dz = +0.28 m) and robust dispersion (NMAD = 2.88 m). Stable OHRC stereo convergence requires Community Sensor Model (CSM) camera models; the legacy ISIS camera model failed across two independent sites. At 0.30 m, these DEMs complement LROC NAC DTMs (approximately 1 m), resolving sub-meter hazards below the NAC detection threshold. Applied to the extensive OHRC south polar archive, this methodology provides independent capability for hazard mapping and landing site analysis for upcoming missions including Chandrayaan-4, LUPEX, and Artemis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agent Mars: Multi-Agent Simulation for Multi-Planetary Life Exploration and Settlement</a><span class="id">[2602.13291]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed robotics, healthcare, industry, and scientific discovery, yet a major frontier may lie beyond Earth. Space exploration and settlement offer vast environments and resources, but impose constraints unmatched on Earth: delayed/intermittent communications, extreme resource scarcity, heterogeneous expertise, and strict safety, accountability, and command authority. The key challenge is auditable coordination among specialised humans, robots, and digital services in a safety-critical system-of-systems. We introduce Agent Mars, an open, end-to-end multi-agent simulation framework for Mars base operations. Agent Mars formalises a realistic organisation with a 93-agent roster across seven layers of command and execution (human roles and physical assets), enabling base-scale studies beyond toy settings. It implements hierarchical and cross-layer coordination that preserves chain-of-command while allowing vetted cross-layer exchanges with audit trails; supports dynamic role handover with automatic failover under outages; and enables phase-dependent leadership for routine operations, emergencies, and science campaigns. Agent Mars further models mission-critical mechanisms-scenario-aware short/long-horizon memory, configurable propose-vote consensus, and translator-mediated heterogeneous protocols-to capture how teams align under stress. To quantify behaviour, we propose the Agent Mars Performance Index (AMPI), an interpretable composite score with diagnostic sub-metrics. Across 13 reproducible Mars-relevant operational scripts, Agent Mars reveals coordination trade-offs and identifies regimes where curated cross-layer collaboration and functional leadership reduce overhead without sacrificing reliability. Agent Mars provides a benchmarkable, auditable foundation for Space AI.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Description of 4 Spacecraft, Moving on Elliptic Kepler Orbits</a><span class="id">[2602.13604]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The four-spacecraft formation is essential for measurements of various physical fields. The use of this formation on substantially elliptical heliocentric Kepler orbits allows measuring gradients of gravitation field in Solar system. The accuracy of the measurements will be sufficient to confirm or to refute modified theories of gravity. In this paper a new approach for the description of this formation is presented. The analytical solutions of the linearized motion equations are obtained. The distinctive feature of the solutions is that they use Cartesian coordinates of one of the spacecraft, termed the chief. These solutions have a clear physical meaning. It is shown, that the volume of a tetrahedron formed by spacecraft is a polynomial of 3-rd degree of Cartesian coordinates of the chief. The polynomial's coefficients are functions of initial spacecraft coordinates and velocities and linearly depend on time. If all spacecraft have the same periods of rotation around the Sun, the volume is a polynomial of 2-nd degree of the chief coordinates with time-independent coefficients. In this case the volume can be zeroed from 0 to 4 times per the period. Suggested approach can significantly simplify planning missions for measurements of various interplanetary fields.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13961" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MarsRetrieval: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for Planetary-Scale Geospatial Retrieval on Mars</a><span class="id">[2602.13961]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Data-driven approaches like deep learning are rapidly advancing planetary science, particularly in Mars exploration.

We introduce MarsRetrieval, a retrieval benchmark for evaluating vision-language models for Martian geospatial discovery. MarsRetrieval includes three tasks: (1) paired image-text retrieval, (2) landform retrieval, and (3) global geo-localization, covering multiple spatial scales and diverse geomorphic origins. We propose a unified retrieval-centric protocol to benchmark multimodal embedding architectures, including contrastive dual-tower encoders and generative vision-language models. Our evaluation shows MarsRetrieval is challenging: even strong foundation models often fail to capture domain-specific geomorphic distinctions. We further show that domain-specific fine-tuning is critical for generalizable geospatial discovery in planetary settings.

These instrumental artifacts can affect the accuracy of optical designs conceived for high-sensitivity spectroscopy and polarimetry. We review the fundamental mechanisms that are responsible for these artifacts and the possible design pathways that allow us to mitigate them. In order to do so, we also present an approximate treatment of the problem of the transmission and reflection of light through (possibly absorptive) birefringent layers, relying on a few fundamental results that can be found in the already extensive literature on the subject. Unfortunately, many of these results remain the domain of a niche of investigators working in the field of thin films and optical coatings, and are often overlooked even by experienced designers of spectro-polarimetric instrumentation. The treatment presented in this work is limited to isotropic materials and uniaxial crystals, which are the most common types of optics employed in polarimetric instrumentation, and it fundamentally relies on the approximation of small birefringence for its implementation. An extensive set of modeling examples is provided to highlight the salient characteristics of polarization fringes, as well as to assess how approximate treatments such as this compare to exact but more computational expensive formulations of the problem such as Berreman's calculus.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Excavation of a 69-m diameter and 94-m high cavern for the Hyper-Kamiokande detector</a><span class="id">[2602.14810]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The excavation of the Hyper-Kamiokande cavern, 600 m underground, is complete.

However, detecting these radio emissions is challenging, since they are anisotropic by nature, sporadic, and of low intensity because of their great distances, and because the sky cannot be monitored continuously. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the relevance of using statistical tools to detect periodic radio signals in unevenly spaced observations, and identify the implications of the measured period. The identification of periodic radio signals is achieved here by a Lomb-Scargle analysis. We first apply the technique to simulated astrophysical observations with controlled simulated noise. This allows us to characterize the origin of spurious detection peaks in the resulting periodograms, as well as to identify peaks corresponding to real periods in the studied system, and to harmonic or beat periods. We then validate this method with a real signal, using approximately 1400 hours of data from observations of Jupiter's radio emissions by the NenuFAR radio telescope over more than six years, to detect the periodicities of Jovian radio emissions (auroral and induced by the Galilean moons). We demonstrate with the simulation that the LombScargle periodogram allows us to correctly identify periodic radio signals, even in a diluted signal. On real measurements, it correctly detects the rotation period of the strong signal produced by Jupiter and the beat period of the emission triggered by the interaction between Jupiter and its Galilean moon Io, ...</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comparative biosignatures with systemic retrievals</a><span class="id">[2505.01512]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of inhabited exoplanets hinges on identifying biosignature gases. JWST can reveal biosignature gases, though current discoveries have yet to evidence life. The central challenge is attribution: how can we confidently identify biogenic sources while ruling out, or deeming unlikely, abiotic explanations? Attribution is particularly difficult for individual planets, especially given the stochastic abiotic processes that can set atmospheric conditions. To address this, we propose a comparative multi-planet approach centred on systemic retrievals: the analysis of multiple planets within a system to empirically define the `abiotic baseline'. This baseline, constructed from obligate uninhabited planets, serves as a local reference point. Systemic retrievals enable marginalisation over inaccessible, latent, shared abiotic parameters within planet evolution models. This is possible because planets within a system are linked by their birth in the same natal disk, have been irradiated by the same evolving star, and have a linked dynamical history. Observations aligning with the abiotic baseline, where the locally-informed abiotic planet evolution models demonstrate high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, are likely non-biological. Potentially biological anomalies are identified as statistical outliers from the abiotic baseline using Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation. A comparative biosignature is thus defined: an anomaly where a biotic planetary evolution model provides a superior fit than its abiotic counterpart. Where both abiotic and biotic models yield poor predictive accuracy, the anomaly is flagged as an “unknown unknown&quot;; a signature of either unconstrained abiotic processes, or life as we don't yet know it.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24740" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SymBoltz.jl: A symbolic-numeric, approximation-free, and differentiable linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver</a><span class="id">[2509.24740]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>SymBoltz is a new Julia package for solving the linear Einstein-Boltzmann equations in cosmology. It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations, is free of approximation switching schemes, and is compatible with automatic differentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical components in a way that scales well to extended models, or alternatively written as one compact system of equations. The modeler provides their equations, and SymBoltz solves them while reducing friction in the modeling process. Symbolic knowledge enables powerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages (e.g., background and perturbations), generating analytical and sparse Jacobian matrices, and interpolating arbitrary variables from the solution. Implicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times without approximations, which greatly simplifies the code. Performance remains comparable to existing approximation-based codes due to efficient high-order implicit methods, fast generated code, optimal handling of the Jacobian, and sparse matrix methods. Automatic differentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any input, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling in large parameter spaces, Fisher forecasting, emulator training, and sensitivity analyses. The main features form a synergy that reinforces the design of the code. Output spectra agree with established codes up to 0.1% with standard precision levels. More work is needed to implement additional features and for fast reverse-mode automatic differentiation of scalar loss functions. SymBoltz is publicly available with single-command installation and extensive documentation.

This frame is non-inertial because of the stellar reflex motion, leading to indirect forces arising in the star-planet-disc system. Here we examine the impact produced by these forces on several aspects of disc-planet coupling using analytical and numerical means. We explore how neglecting indirect forces changes (1) the spatial pattern of the surface density perturbation in the disc, (2) the calculation of the torque exerted on the disc by the planet, and (3) the torque on the planet exerted by the disc. For low-mass planets, in the linear regime, the differences in the perturbation pattern are only in its $m=1$ azimuthal harmonic, with an amplitude increasing with the distance from the star. In this regime both the torque on the planet and the deposition torque density in the disc are only weakly affected by non-inclusion of indirect forces, corroborating some results of studies neglecting indirect forces altogether. For higher mass planets, a broader range of azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation are affected. Also, indirect forces have a stronger effect on the planetary torque and on planet migration in the Type II regime. We highlight the importance of including the planetary indirect force in the calculation of the torque on the disc (if disc evolution accounts for indirect force) to ensure conservation of angular momentum carried by the planet-driven density waves. The corresponding indirect torque has an oscillatory, radially-diverging character.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond the Simple Power Law: A Bayesian Analysis of 897 Pulsar Spectra</a><span class="id">[2511.18348]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive re-evaluation of pulsar radio spectra using the largest curated dataset of calibrated flux densities to date, comprising 897 pulsars, and employing a robust Bayesian framework for model comparison alongside frequentist methods. Contrary to the established consensus that pulsar spectra are predominantly simple power laws, our analysis reveals that complex spectral shapes with curvature or breaks are in fact the norm. The broken power law emerges as the most common spectral shape, accounting for 60\% of pulsars, while the simple power law describes only 13.5\%, with 68.8\% of pulsars decisively favoring curved or broken models. We further identify 74 confident gigahertz-peaked spectrum pulsars, and demonstrate that millisecond pulsars frequently exhibit spectral curvature. A key finding is that the previously reported dominance of the simple power law was largely a statistical artifact of the frequentist method used in earlier work. These findings substantially revise the prevailing view of pulsar spectra and establish a critical, model-classified foundation for future theoretical work.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frequency- and phase-resolved polarimetry of millisecond pulsars and its application to timing</a><span class="id">[2512.09220]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar timing is used for a variety of applications including tests of fundamental physics, probing the structure of neutron stars, and detecting nanohertz gravitational waves.

II: Shot-Noise-Limited Precision via Spectral Factorization</a><span class="id">[2512.23040]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We generalize the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) formalism for radial velocity extraction to cases where the underlying spectral components are unknown. The method factorizes a spectroscopic time series into principal spectra and time-dependent kernels, enabling simultaneous recovery of both. In Fourier space, each inverse-wavelength slice is decomposed by singular value decomposition, and radial velocity shifts are inferred from phase differences between epochs. In the high-SNR regime, this provides a linearized and statistically tractable estimate of differential velocities. The method is validated on synthetic and SOAP simulations and applied to EXPRES observations of HD 34411 and $\tau$ Ceti, recovering coherent signals and reaching the instrumental precision limit of  30 cm/s. Apart from p-mode modulation, the residuals show no significant long-term correlations and allow the detection of signals with semi-amplitudes down to  50 cm/s with $\lesssim10$ cm/s uncertainty. The framework thus enables extreme-precision radial velocity measurements in the presence of spectral variability, representing a step toward detecting and characterizing Earth-like planets around solar-type stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probabilistic modeling of Cherenkov emission from particle showers</a><span class="id">[2601.00944]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Subatomic particles can interact with target nuclei in matter or decay in flight, and an individual high-energy particle can induce a particle shower composed of numerous, lower-energy secondaries. These particle showers broadly exhibit universality across diverse media, including air, water, ice, and other materials, with their development governed by the Standard Model. Full Monte Carlo simulation of particle showers, where each secondary is individually tracked and propagated, can be a computational challenge to perform at scale. Experiments thus resort to parametrized approximations when efficient simulation becomes necessary. Here, we construct distributions of parameters capable of describing the Cherenkov light yield from particle showers in ice or water. Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">92.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imaging Venus-like Worlds: Spectral, Polarimetric, and UV Diagnostics for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</a><span class="id">[2602.02728]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding planetary habitability requires a comparative approach that explores the divergent evolutionary outcomes of Earth and Venus. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be uniquely positioned to conduct a statistical and physical census of terrestrial exoplanets spanning the Venus Zone (VZ) and the Habitable Zone (HZ), enabling the detection and atmospheric characterization of post-runaway greenhouse worlds (“exoVenuses”). We present an updated list of VZ exoplanets, which raises the number of known candidates to 370. We describe a science case and an observing strategy for VZ exoplanets that integrates precursor exoplanet detection data and stellar characterization with HWO direct imaging, spectroscopy across the UV/optical/IR, and spectropolarimetry. Our proposed framework emphasizes a pathway toward the diagnosis of sulfur chemistry (SO$_2$) and aerosol physics (H$_2$SO$_4$ clouds/hazes), planetary redox states (O$_2$/O$_3$ false positives from hydrogen loss), and cloud microphysics detection (rainbow polarization). We quantify implications for HWO requirements, including UV access to 0.2–0.4 $\mu$m, optical/NIR coverage to $\gtrsim$1.5 $\mu$m, inner working angle (IWA) reaching 0.3–1.5 AU around nearby Sun-like stars, and the SNR/resolution needed for key features. Finally, we outline a community-driven path to producing robust demographic inferences and target selection for optimizing HWO observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">93.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03928" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The local void model for the Hubble and BAO tensions</a><span class="id">[2602.03928]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The inconsistency between the locally inferred Hubble constant and the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model has persisted, turning into an important problem. An emergent underlying trend is that this Hubble tension is driven by data confined to the very low-redshift Universe (typically $z &lt; 0.15$). Most intermediate-redshift measurements remain mutually consistent with $H_0^\mathrm{CMB}$, the $\Lambda$CDM expectation anchored by the CMB. This Perspective examines if a large local void can explain the Hubble tension and its appearance only at low $z$. For an observer residing within a large underdensity, such as the Milky Way inside the claimed KBC void, gravitationally induced outflows and redshift can inflate the locally inferred recession scale $cz'$ despite having $H_0 = H_0^\mathrm{CMB}$. We summarise evidence suggestive of a local underdensity from multi-wavelength galaxy number counts, discuss the dynamical requirements implied by the amplitude of inferred bulk flows, and connect the solution to the emerging low-redshift BAO distance anomaly ($\alpha_{\mathrm{iso}} &lt; 1$). Previously published semi-analytic void models anticipated the observed redshift dependence of BAO deviations and predict a rapid convergence to CMB-consistent expansion for $z \gtrsim 0.2$, aligning with reconstructions of $H_0(z)$ from BAO plus uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae. We conclude by looking to future tests, including improved mapping of the local density and velocity field, fits to galaxy distance catalogues at the field level, kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints on coherent outflows, fast radio bursts, and the long-term prospect of redshift drift measurements as a direct probe of time-varying non-cosmological redshift contributions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">94.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NovaMoon: A Strategic Lunar Reference Station for Positioning, Timing, and Largely Enhanced Science in the Earth-Moon System</a><span class="id">[2602.08432]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The renewed interest in lunar exploration and the development of future lunar communication and navigation services highlight the need for a precise, stable, and interoperable geodetic and timing infrastructure on the Moon. NovaMoon, proposed as a scientific and navigation payload for ESA's Argonaut lander, is designed as a lunar-based local differential, geodetic, and timing station supporting both operational needs in the Moon's south polar region and a broad range of scientific investigations. The payload integrates a lunar laser retroreflector, a Very Long Baseline Interferometry transmitter, a receiver for navigation signals compatible with LunaNet standards, high-stability atomic clocks, and direct-to-Earth radio links – making it the first lunar station to co-locate multiple ranging, tracking, and timing techniques. NovaMoon will enable sub-metre to decimetre positioning, provide local differential corrections for lunar users, and ensure an accurate and stable realisation of position and time. Preliminary simulation studies show that this multi-technique dataset improves the lunar reference frame, orientation and ephemerides, and estimates of interior parameters like tidal response and core properties. NovaMoon will also provide the first long-duration physical realisation of a lunar time reference. Beyond its primary goals, it supports improved cartography, precise surface geolocation, and higher-resolution topography, contributing to safer landings and operations. It also enables new tests of fundamental physics, including constraints on relativity and possible deviations from classical gravity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">95.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resonant Loop Interferometers for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2510.13957]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves at kilohertz and higher frequencies offer a unique probe of the early Universe at temperatures well beyond the reach of the cosmic microwave background, corresponding to energy scales $\gtrsim 10^9$GeV. Existing detector concepts fall many orders of magnitude short of the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the stochastic background in this regime. We propose a new interferometric architecture based on closed optical loops, in which the gravitational-wave-induced phase shift accumulates coherently over many traversals. This produces sharp, narrowband resonances whose predictable comb structure provides a distinct experimental signature. For a folded loop with parameters compatible with the Einstein Telescope infrastructure, and finesse values of order 500, we project sensitivity that approaches and even surpasses the BBN bound up to tens of kilohertz after one year of integration. Such loop interferometers thus open a realistic and distinctive path toward exploring high-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">96.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinematic Anisotropies in PTA Observations: Analytical Toolkit</a><span class="id">[2512.24055]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The reported evidence for an isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) from pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has motivated searches for extrinsic and intrinsic anisotropies. Kinematic anisotropies may arise as a consequence of a boosted observer moving with respect to the frame in which the GWB appears isotropic. In this work, we present an analytical toolbox to describe the effects of kinematic anisotropies on the overlap reduction function. Our analytical results differ from previous findings at the quadrupole order and are detailed in three appendices. For the first time, we also derive the corresponding auto-correlation using two approaches, taking the pulsar distances to be infinite or finite, respectively. Our formulas can be used in forecasts or Bayesian analysis pipelines.</p></div></details></article></body>
