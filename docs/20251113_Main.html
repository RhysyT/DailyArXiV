Using nine-epoch VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy, we investigated the multiplicity of 929 massive stars. Our findings reveal contrasting binary properties across evolutionary stages: O-type stars show an intrinsic close-binary fraction of $70\%$, and early B-type dwarfs/giants reach ${\sim80}\%$, exceeding higher-metallicity samples. In contrast, B0-B3 supergiants drop to ${\sim40}\%$, and A-F supergiants to ${\sim8}\%$; intrinsic variability likely inflates the latter, so the true multiplicity may be lower. OBe stars display distinct binary properties consistent with a post-interaction origin. These results have profound implications for massive-star evolution at low metallicity, including the production of exotic transients, gravitational-wave progenitors, and ionising radiation in the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation-mediated shocks in gamma-ray bursts: spectral evolution</a><span class="id">[2511.08684]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radiation-mediated shocks (RMS) occurring below the photosphere in a gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet could play a crucial role in shaping the prompt emission. In this paper, we study the time-resolved signal expected from such early shocks. An internal collision is modeled using a 1D special relativistic hydrodynamical simulation and the photon distributions in the resulting forward and reverse shocks, as well as in the common downstream region, are followed to well above the photosphere using a designated RMS simulation code. The light curve and time resolved spectrum of the resulting single pulse is computed taking into account the emission at different optical depths and angles to the line-of-sight. For the specific case considered, we find a light curve consisting of a short pulse lasting $\sim 0.1$ s for an assumed redshift of $z = 1$. The efficiency is large, with $\approx 23$% of the total burst energy being radiated. The spectrum has a complex shape at very early times, after which it settles into a more generic shape with a smooth curvature below the peak energy, $E_p$, and a clear high-energy power law that cuts off at $\sim 5$ MeV in the observer frame. The spectrum becomes narrower and softer at late times with $E_p$ steadily decreasing during the pulse decay from $E_p \approx 250~$keV to $E_p \approx 100$ keV. The low-energy index, $\alpha$, decreases during the bright part of the pulse from $\alpha \approx -0.5$ to $\alpha \approx -1$, although the low-energy part is better fit with a broken power law when the signal-to-noise ratio is high. The high-energy power law is generated by the reverse shock at low optical depths ($\tau &lt; 30$) and has an index that decreases from $\beta \approx -2$ to $\beta \approx -2.4$. These results provide support for RMSs as potential candidates for the prompt emission in GRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No TiO detected in the hot Neptune-desert planet LTT-9779 b in reflected light at high spectral resolution</a><span class="id">[2511.08691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>LTT-9779 b is an inhabitant of the hot Neptune desert and one of only a few planets with a measured high albedo. Characterising the atmosphere of this world is the key to understanding what processes dominate in creating the hot Neptune desert. We aim to characterise the reflected light of LTT-9779 b at high spectral resolution to break the degeneracy between clouds and atmospheric metallicity. This is key to interpreting its mass loss history which may illuminate how it kept its place in the desert. We use the high resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy technique on four half-nights of ESPRESSO observations in 4-UT mode (16.4-m effective mirror) to constrain the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b. We do not detect the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b despite these data having the expected sensitivity at the level 100 ppm. Injection tests on the post-eclipse data indicate that TiO should have been detected for a range of different equilibrium chemistry models. Therefore this non-detection suggests TiO depletion in the western hemisphere however, this conclusion is sensitive to temperature which impacts the chemistry in the upper atmosphere and the reliability of the line list. Additionally, we are able to constrain the top of the western cloud deck to $P_{\text{top, western}}&lt;10^{-2.0}$ bar and the top of the eastern cloud deck $P_{\text{top, eastern}}&lt;10^{-0.5}$ bar, which is consistent with the predicted altitude of MgSiO$_3$ and Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ clouds from JWST NIRISS/SOSS. While we do not detect the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b, we have verified that this technique can be used in practice to characterise the high spectral resolution reflected light of exoplanets so long as their spectra contain a sufficient number of deep spectral lines. Therefore this technique may become an important cornerstone of exoplanet characterisation with the ELT and beyond.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isolating the gravitational influence of Uranus's winds requires close passages inward of the rings</a><span class="id">[2511.08698]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Close orbits by a Uranus Orbiter and Probe (UOP) could be used to deduce Uranus's multipolar gravity field to higher precision and angular degree than the J2 and J4 currently measured from ground-based ring occultations and the Voyager 2 flyby. We examine Jn sensitivity limits obtained from simulations of candidate UOP trajectories, pairing these with Uranus interior and wind models to perform retrievals from the gravity moments. We consider zonal wind profiles derived from recent feature-tracking data, assuming that zonal winds extend into the planet along cylinders, with a radial decay function similar to those that explain Jupiter and Saturn gravity. Present knowledge of J2 and J4 permits a fairly wide range of possible wind depths in Uranus, up to 1,800 km or 7% by radius. Measuring additional gravity moments is essential to separate this unknown wind depth from other interior properties of interest, but J6 is found to be too dominated by bulk rotation to be a useful probe of the wind depth. Odd moments arising from Uranus's observed north-south asymmetric flow are strong functions of the wind depth, but the usefulness of J3 is hindered by its sensitivity to present uncertainties in the wind profile. The even moment J8, or the odd moments J5 and J7, are the best probes of the depth of Uranus's winds. J8, and most likely J5 and J7, are measurable in a highly inclined orbit making &gt; 10 pericenter passages inward of the $\zeta$ ring, approximately 1,000-2,500 km above Uranus's cloud tops.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conservation laws in non-inertial frames and non-conservation of energy of relative motion in two-body problem</a><span class="id">[2511.08709]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dynamics of systems of multiple gravitationally interacting bodies is often studied in a frame attached to one of the objects (e.g. a central star in a planetary system). As this frame is generally non-inertial, indirect forces appear in the equations describing the motion of bodies relative to the reference object. According to the convention adopted in celestial mechanics, the associated indirect acceleration is defined to be different for every object under consideration, whereas the gravitational coupling between each body and the reference object is described via the effective two-body potential, which does not obey the equivalence principle. Here we point out that a slightly different and more physically motivated definition of the indirect acceleration provides significant benefits when interpreting relative motion in a non-inertial frame. First, the indirect acceleration ends up being the same for all objects in the system. Second, the non-conservation of momentum, angular momentum, and energy of the whole system in a non-inertial frame naturally follow from the action of the indirect acceleration on the system as an external force. We also argue that the vis viva integral of the classical two-body problem should not be interpreted as a statement of energy conservation. In fact, the energy of relative motion is not conserved due to the work done on the two-body system by the indirect force. These results can be useful for interpreting dynamics in various astrophysical contexts, in particular the physics of disc-planet coupling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D MHD simulations of coronal loops heated via magnetic braiding I. Continuous driving</a><span class="id">[2511.08726]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nature and detailed properties of the heating of the million-degree solar corona are important issues that are still largely unresolved. Nanoflare heating might be dominant in active regions and quiet Sun, although direct signatures of such small-scale events are difficult to observe in the highly conducting, faint corona. The aim of this work is to test the theory of coronal heating by nanoflares in braided magnetic field structures. We analyze a 3D MHD model of a multistrand flux tube in a stratified solar atmosphere, driven by twisting motions at the boundaries. We show how the magnetic structure is maintained at high temperature and for an indefinite time, by intermittent episodes of local magnetic energy release due to reconnection. We forward-modelled optically thin emission with SDO/AIA and MUSE and compared the synthetic observations with the intrinsic coronal plasma properties, focusing on the response to impulsive coronal heating. Currents build up and their impulsive dissipation into heat are also investigated through different runs. In this first paper, we describe the proliferation of heating from the dissipation of narrow current sheets in realistic simulations of braided coronal flux tubes at unprecedented high spatial resolutions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D MHD simulations of coronal loops heated via magnetic braiding II. Automatic detection of reconnection outflows and statistical analysis of their properties</a><span class="id">[2511.08730]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations of fast and bursty “nanojets” suggest novel diagnostics of nanoflare heating in the solar corona. The aim of this work is to investigate the presence and properties of reconnection outflows, similar to observed nanojets, in numerical simulations, and explore their relationship with the nanoflare properties. This work explores their potential as diagnostics for nanoflare heating in observations. We developed an algorithm of Reconnection Outflows Automatic Detection (ROAD) in 3D MHD simulations of coronal loops. We applied the algorithm to a 3D MHD stratified coronal loop model heated by magnetic reconnection and analyzed the statistical properties of the jets produced at reconnection sites, over about one solar hour. The magnetic structure is maintained at high temperature and for an indefinite time by intermittent episodes of local magnetic energy release due to reconnection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symbolic Regression Is All You Need: From Simulations to Scaling Laws in Binary Neutron Star Mergers</a><span class="id">[2511.08784]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave sources with electromagnetic counterparts have highlighted the need for predictive, interpretable models linking the parameters of compact binary systems to post-merger remnants and mass outflows. In this work, we explore AI-driven symbolic regression (SR) frameworks to derive updated analytical relations for disk ejecta mass in binary neutron star mergers, trained on state-of-the-art numerical relativity simulations. Our method reveals a set of compact equations that outperform existing fitting formulae across multiple statistical metrics while remaining physically interpretable. Notably, SR also enables alternative predictor sets (e.g., $\{M_1,M_2,\tilde{\Lambda}\}$) that match or exceed the accuracy of models relying solely on compactness of the lightest neutron star ($C_1$), enabling new parameter constraints from electromagnetic observations. Unlike traditional black-box machine learning models, these closed-form expressions generalize robustly to regions of the parameter space not represented in the training data, offering a physics-informed tool for multimessenger observations and constraints on the neutron star equation of state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Reveals Carbon-rich Chemistry in a Transitional Disk</a><span class="id">[2511.08816]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present JWST-MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) observations of the Classical T Tauri stars GM Aur and RX J1615.3-3255 (J1615), both hosting transitional disks. Despite their similar stellar and disk properties, the two systems differ strikingly in their carbon-bearing molecular emission. Using local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) slab models to analyze spectral lines within the 13.6-17.7 micron wavelength range, we find that J1615 exhibits strong emission from H2O, HCN, C2H2, 12CO2, 13CO2, OH, and 13C12CH2, whereas GM Aur shows only H2O and OH. We measure the accretion rates of both objects using contemporaneous optical spectra and find that J1615's accretion rate is lower than that of GM Aur. We constrain the properties of the dust in both disks using SED modeling and find elevated amounts of crystalline silicates and larger dust grains in the disk of J1615. The enhanced carbon emission in J1615 may result from a combination of lower accretion rate and larger and more processed dust grains in the inner disk, conditions that together may allow carbon-rich gas to persist and be detected. These results expand the sample of protoplanetary disks around solar-mass stars with strong CO2 and C2H2 emission and identify J1615 as a carbon-rich transitional disk, providing new insights into the chemical diversity of planet-forming environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08820" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytical Description of Baryonic Matter Fluctuations Using Jeans Filtering Functions in Second-Order Cosmological Perturbation Theory</a><span class="id">[2511.08820]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmological perturbation theory provides the fundamental framework for describing the evolution of the matter-energy density field in an expanding Universe and serves as the basis for understanding the formation of large-scale structures within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. We present an analytical approach to describe the evolution of fluctuations in a mixed fluid composed of cold dark matter (CDM) and baryonic matter. Assuming that the Universe is governed by General Relativity, we employ the Vlasov equation to derive the general equations of motion for this mixed cosmological fluid, incorporating baryonic effects through the stress tensor by considering only the contributions from baryonic pressure. We introduce the Jeans filtering functions as a biasing tool that allows us to describe baryonic fluctuations with CDM as a tracer, and we obtain an analytical description of the fluctuations -a novel and uncommon approach compared to the accepted computational advances currently available in this field. First- and second-order solutions are obtained through a single iteration of the equations of motion, with the aim of identifying how the filtering scale behaves in a second-order theory compared to the linear one, as well as some of its impacts on the matter power spectrum without the need to compute it explicitly. For the first time, these kind of solutions are derived entirely through an analytical method. Finally, we obtain analytical expressions for baryonic fluctuations in the density and velocity fields, which can be readily evaluated and provide valuable insights into the role of baryons in the Large-scale structure of the Universe. Consequently, these results reveal how pressure effects shift the filtering scale and how including this component could influence parameters such as the filtering mass and the temperature of the pressure-supported components.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08824" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An axisymmetric shock breakout indicated by prompt polarized emission from the type II supernova 2024ggi</a><span class="id">[2511.08824]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The death of massive stars is triggered by an infall-induced bounce shock that disrupts the star. How such a shock is launched and propagates through the star is a decade-long puzzle. Some models assume that the shock can be reenergized by absorbing neutrinos, leading to highly aspherical explosions. Other models involve jet-powered shocks that lead to bipolar explosions reflected in the geometry of the shock-breakout emission. We report measurement of the geometry of the shock breakout through unprecedentedly early spectropolarimetry of the nearby type II supernova 2024ggi starting  1.2 days after the explosion. The measurement indicates a well-defined symmetry axis of the shock breakout, which is also shared by the hydrogen-rich envelope that emerged after the circumstellar matter was engulfed by the ejecta, revealing a persisting and prominent symmetry axis throughout the explosion. These findings suggest that the physical mechanism driving the explosion of massive stars manifests a well-defined axial symmetry and acts on large scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection Prospects for AGNs with the Cherenkov Telescope Array</a><span class="id">[2511.08828]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will enable detailed studies of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the very-high-energy (VHE) regime, as the next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory, designed to enhance sensitivity and energy coverage (20 GeV – 300 TeV) over current Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). In the context of the CTAO Science Collaboration, within the AGN Population working group, we developed a variability-based strategy to improve predictions of AGNs detectable by CTAO, using Fermi-LAT data and normalized excess variance (NXS) as a tracer of flux variability. By extrapolating from 30-day to 3-day timescales, we expanded the sample of sources with short-timescale variability estimates from 87 to 407. This approach allows us to identify flaring and distant AGNs that are promising CTAO targets. The results are being used to support the CTAO extragalactic science program and will be included in an upcoming Consortium publication for the AGN Population collaboration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modelling Millisecond Pulsar Populations in Globular Clusters with NBODY6++GPU</a><span class="id">[2511.08850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are neutron stars with spin periods as short as a few milliseconds, formed through mass accretion from companion stars. In the dense environments of globular clusters (GCs), MSPs are likely to originate through dynamically assembled interacting binaries. Over 300 MSPs have been detected in GCs to date, more than half of the known Galactic MSP population. In this work, we model MSP populations in intermediate-mass GCs using the direct $N$-body code \textsc{NBODY6++GPU}. We update the code by implementing pulsar spin-down due to magnetic braking and spin-up through accretion, and use this framework to model the pulsar population in the globular cluster M71 to investigate the pulsar population within and the associated gravitational wave transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring the magnetic fields in the chromospheres of low-mass stars</a><span class="id">[2511.08891]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic fields in the upper atmospheres of solar-like stars are believed to provide an enormous amount of energy to power the hot coronae and drive large-scale eruptions that could impact the habitability of planetary systems around these stars. However, these magnetic fields have never been routinely measured on stars beyond the solar system. Through decade-long spectropolarimetric observations, we have now achieved the measurements of magnetic fields in the lower and middle chromospheres of three M-dwarfs. Our results indicate that the line-of-sight component of the chromospheric magnetic fields can reach up to hundreds of Gauss, whose sign frequently opposes that of the photospheric field. The measurements highlight the magnetic field complexity and the variation with height close to the surface of these M-dwarfs. They provide critical constraints on the energy budget responsible for heating and eruptions of stellar upper atmospheres, and enable assessments of how stellar magnetic activity may affect exoplanet environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Intrinsic Ellipticity in Neutron Star Binaries</a><span class="id">[2511.08895]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel resonance mechanism that can naturally occur in neutron star binaries: a spin-orbit resonance. This resonance locks the binary into a unique state where the neutron star spin evolves alongside the orbit. The resonance requires a finite neutron star ellipticity $\epsilon$ possibly sourced by strong internal magnetic fields in magnetars, which are motivated by population study of eccentric neutron star-black hole binary GW200105. We find that the locking probability is proportional to $\sqrt{\epsilon}$. We derive the phase correction in the gravitational waveform due to this resonance locking effect, and have conducted a search in all neutron star binaries up to the O4a gravitational-wave catalog, with no positive event found so far. Observations by next-generation detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, or even the upcoming upgrade of Advanced LIGO, have the potential to detect such locking signals, enabling precise measurements of both neutron star's ellipticity and moment of inertia. Future searches should be performed to discover this resonance, or, if undetected, to place constraints on the magnetar fraction in neutron star binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JW-Flare: Accurate Solar Flare Forecasting Method Based on Multimodal Large Language Models</a><span class="id">[2511.08970]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar flares, the most powerful explosive phenomena in the solar system, may pose significant hazards to spaceborne satellites and ground-based infrastructure. Despite decades of intensive research, reliable flare prediction remains a challenging task. Large Language Models, as a milestone in artificial intelligence, exhibit exceptional general knowledge and next-token prediction capabilities. Here we introduce JW-Flare, the first Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) explicitly trained for solar flare forecasting through fine-tuning on textual physic parameters of solar active regions and magnetic field images. This method demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for large flares prediction on the test dataset. It effectively identifies all 79 X-class flares from 18,949 test samples, yielding a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.95 and a True Positive Rate (TPR) of 1.00, outperforming traditional predictive models. We further investigate the capability origins of JW-Flare through explainability experiments, revealing that solar physics knowledge acquired during pre-training contributes to flare forecasting performance. Additionally, we evaluate models of different parameter scales, confirming the Scaling_Law of Large Language Models in domain-specific applications, such as solar physics. This study marks a substantial advance in both the scale and accuracy of solar flare forecasting and opens a promising avenue for AI-driven methodologies in broader scientific domains.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Models of long-period variables of the globular cluster 47 Tuc</a><span class="id">[2511.09065]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar evolution computations were carried out for stars with a main sequence mass $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=0.86M_\odot$ and initial metal abundance $Z=0.003$ and $Z=0.004$. Selected models of evolutionary sequences were used for calculation of radial pulsations in the RGB, eAGB and TP-AGB evolutionary stages. Not all pulsating red giants of the globular cluster 47 Tuc are shown to belong to the Mira variables because the lower limit of pulsation periods at the TP-AGB stage is $\approx 70$ day, whereas during the eAGB evolutionary stage the periods of radial oscillations range from $\approx 5$ to $\approx 40$ day. Periods and luminosities of hydrodynamic models of eAGB and TP–AGB pulsating stars locate along the common period-luminosity relation. Small masses of Mira variables in the globular cluster 47 Tuc ($0.54M_\odot\le M\le 0.70M_\odot$) is the main reason for irregular large-amplitude oscillations and the dynamical instability of outer stellar layers at pulsation periods $\Pi &gt; 200$ day.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiwavelength spectral and temporal analysis of VHE Blazar 1ES 1959+650: Tracing emission mechanisms across flux states</a><span class="id">[2511.09103]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac object 1ES 1959+650 exhibited pronounced activity between MJD 60310 – 60603, including a very high energy (VHE) detection reported by LHAASO. To investigate the underlying emission mechanisms, we performed a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis using multiwavelength data from \textit{Swift}-XRT/UVOT and \textit{Fermi}-LAT, covering the optical/UV to GeV $\gamma$-ray bands. The source shows strong energy-dependent variability, with the largest fractional variability in $\gamma$-rays, followed by X-rays and UV/optical, consistent with leptonic emission scenarios. Based on the variability patterns, we identified distinct flux states (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, VHE-FX1, and VHE-FX2). The X-ray spectra exhibit a clear “harder-when-brighter” trend across these states. We modeled the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using a one-zone model incorporating synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission, implemented in \textsc{xspec} using $\chi^{2}$ minimization. During the VHE detection, the corresponding X-ray/optical emission likely resembled the F2 state. Modeling the VHE SED using F1-state data led to an SSC overprediction of the VHE flux, whereas all other states were well described within the one-zone framework. Systematic trends in physical parameters are observed across flux states, including spectral hardening, increasing break energy, rising bulk Lorentz factor, and decreasing magnetic field with increasing flux. These results suggest that enhanced particle acceleration efficiency and stronger Doppler boosting drive the observed flaring activity, while the decrease in magnetic field indicates conversion of magnetic energy into particle kinetic energy, consistent with shock-driven scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Superhot (&gt; 30 MK) flare observations with STIX: Joint spectral fitting</a><span class="id">[2511.09108]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spectroscopic analysis of large flares (&gt;X1) in the hard X-ray (HXR) range offers unique insights into the hottest (&gt; 30 MK) flare plasma, the so-called superhot thermal component. To manage the high count rates in large flares, an attenuator is typically placed in front of the HXR detectors. However, this significantly limits the spectral diagnostic capabilities at lower energies, and consequently, it restricts the analysis of the lower temperatures in flares. The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board the Solar Orbiter mission was designed to observe solar flares in hard X-rays. The imaging detectors use an attenuator during periods of high flux level. In contrast, the background (BKG) detector of STIX is never covered by the attenuator and is therefore dedicated to measure the unattenuated flux using differently sized apertures placed in front of the detector. We aim to demonstrate that joint spectral fitting using different detector configurations of STIX allows us to reliably diagnose both the hot and the superhot components in large flares. We jointly fit the HXR spectra of the STIX BKG detector and the STIX imaging detectors using SUNKIT-SPEX software package to determine the spectral parameters of both the hot and superhot thermal components in solar flares. Using joint fitting on 32 STIX flares, we corroborate that for GOES X-class flares, the HXR spectrum is better represented by two thermal components instead of an isothermal component. At the temperature peak time, the superhot HXR flux above 15 keV is typically stronger than the hot HXR flux. The GOES long-wavelength channel is dominated by the hot component with a superhot contribution up to 10%. This paper demonstrates that joint spectral fitting of the same detector type with different attenuation schemes is a simple and powerful method to monitor multithermal flare plasma.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical Simulation of Impact Cratering and Induced Seismic Waves in Sand Targets</a><span class="id">[2511.09188]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Impact cratering plays a crucial role in shaping the surfaces of small bodies, satellites, and planets, providing insights into their formation and the history of the Solar System.

Soda-lime glass and quartz sand targets were used for comparison. The developed sand model successfully reproduced the sound velocity measured in an experimental study. Using the new sand model, the crater formation was simulated using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics with a material strength parameter. The crater radius and $\pi$-scaling law derived from the numerical simulation were consistent with the experimental study. The vertical acceleration around the surface of the crater was consistent with the experimentally measured acceleration for the impact-induced seismic wave.

CMEs are theorized to play a key role in planetary atmospheric erosion, especially for planets that are close to their host star. However, such a conclusion remains controversial as there has not been an unambiguous detection of a CME from a star outside of our Sun. Previous stellar CME studies have only inferred the presence of a CME through the detection of other types of stellar eruptive events. A signature of a fast CME is a Type II radio burst, which is emitted from the shock wave produced as the CME travels through the stellar corona into interplanetary space. Here we report an analogue to a Type II burst from the early M dwarf StKM 1-1262. The burst exhibits identical frequency, time, and polarisation properties to fundamental plasma emission from a solar Type II burst. We demonstrate the rate of such events with similar radio luminosity from M dwarfs are 0.84$^{+1.94}_{-0.69} \times$10$^{-3}$ per day per star. Our detection implies that we are no longer restricted to extrapolating the solar CME kinematics and rates to other stars, allowing us to establish the first observational limits on the impact of CMEs on exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09296" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Occurrence rate of stellar Type II radio bursts from a 100 star-year search for coronal mass ejections</a><span class="id">[2511.09296]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of space weather in the Solar System, but their occurrence rate on other stars is unknown. A characteristic (deca-)metric radio burst with a time-frequency drift, known as a Type II radio burst, is a key observational signature of CMEs. We searched a total of 107 years of stellar data using time-frequency spectra that targeted all known stars within 100 parsecs in the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) up to May 2023. This resulted in the largest unbiased search for circularly polarised stellar Type II metric radio bursts to date, with a typical 3$\sigma$ sensitivity of 2.5 mJy for an integration time of 1 minute. We detected two drifting stellar radio bursts: the published 2-minute burst from the M dwarf StKM 1-1262 and a new 13-minute burst from the M dwarf LP 215-56. The new burst is characterised by a drift rate of $-0.060^{+0.002}_{-0.002}$ MHz s$^{-1}$, an average Stokes V flux density of $-4.5^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$ mJy, and a temporal duration of $63^{+31}_{-11}$ seconds. We constrained the occurrence rate of drifting stellar bursts by calculating Poisson upper and lower limits based on the two drifting bursts. We also fitted a cumulative burst luminosity distribution to the data using the burst detections and the non-detections; this yielded a power law index ($\alpha$) of $-0.7^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$ and a normalisation point (N) of one burst per year with $E&gt;6.8\times10^{13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$. We find an agreement between this and the cumulative luminosity distribution of decametric SOHO/LASCO solar Type II data ($\alpha = -0.81 \pm 0.06 \pm 0.02$), which suggests that the current scarcity of detected stellar Type II bursts is likely due to limited sensitivity rather than to the intrinsic rarity of these events. Additionally, we identify 19 circularly polarised stellar radio bursts without a time-frequency drift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A magnetic field study of two fast-rotating, radio bright M dwarfs.

The accurate interpretation of the processes underlying the radio signatures requires a detailed characterisation of the stellar magnetism. We study two M dwarfs, StKM 1-1262 (M0 type, P$_\mathrm{rot}=1.24$ d) and V374 Peg (M4 type, P$_\mathrm{rot}=0.4455$ d), which were detected with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). StKM 1-1262 exhibited a type-II radio burst, potentially resulting from a coronal mass ejection event. V374 Peg manifested low-frequency radio emission typical of an electron-cyclotron maser instability emission mechanism. We analysed spectropolarimetric observations of these M dwarfs collected with the SpectroPolarimètre InfraRouge (SPIRou). Firstly, we refined the stellar parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, and measured the average surface magnetic flux via modelling of Zeeman broadening in unpolarised spectra. We then applied Zeeman-Doppler imaging to least-squares deconvolution line profiles in circular polarisation to reconstruct their large-scale magnetic fields. StKM 1-1262 has a total, unsigned magnetic field of $3.53\pm0.06$ kG on average and the large-scale magnetic field topology is dipolar and moderately axisymmetric, with an average strength of 300 G. V374 Peg has an unsigned magnetic field of $5.46\pm0.09$ kG and the large-scale field is dipolar and axisymmetric, with an average strength of 800 G. For StKM 1-1262, we found a strong anti-correlation between the total magnetic field and the effective temperature which is reminiscent of the tight link between small-scale magnetic fields and surface inhomogeneities. For V374 Peg, we found a moderate anti-correlation, possibly due to a more even distribution of surface features.

We investigate the clumping factor using the GAMER adaptive mesh refinement cosmological hydrodynamical simulation code. We introduce a new, physically-motivated definition of the IGM based on the effective transmission factor of ionizing photons. We perform large-scale, full-box simulations with varying intensities of the uniform ultraviolet background, and we find that our physically-defined clumping factor is significantly lower than the values derived from traditional overdensity thresholds. We also introduce an analytic model that distinguishes between the volume-weighted and mass-weighted averages of the neutral fraction, and we find the difference in reionization timing of $\Delta z \sim 2$ depending on the assumed clumping factor and the relation between the volume-weighted and mass-weighted neutral fractions. Our zoom-in simulations further show that, while SN feedback increases the clumping factor locally, the effect is limited to $\sim 100$ kpc scales and does not significantly alter the global clumping factor. The substantially lower clumping factor reduces the required ionizing photon budget, potentially alleviating tension for reionization scenarios driven by rare, bright sources like active galactic nuclei.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapid-response characterization of near-Earth asteroid 2024 YR4 during a Torino Scale 3 alert</a><span class="id">[2511.09405]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>On 27 December 2024, near-Earth object (NEO) 2024 YR$_4$ was discovered by the ATLAS survey and identified as a virtual impactor.

Here we report an intensive observational campaign combining time-series photometry in the visible, broadband visible and near-infrared colors, and low-resolution visible reflectance spectroscopy to assess its physical properties. Fourier analysis of the lightcurves yields a synodic rotation period of $P = 19.46341 \pm 0.00008$ min, placing 2024 YR$_4$ among the fast rotators, even if such rotation is common for objects of similar $H$ magnitude. Its visible and near-infrared colors and spectra are most consistent with an Sq or K taxonomic classification, though some ambiguity remains. Finally, its phase curve exhibits a notably shallow slope ($G = 0.51 \pm 0.11$), from which we derive an absolute magnitude of $H_\mathrm{R} = 23.82\pm0.09$ mag.

The required hard spectrum of the source and intermediate-mass composition are consistent with previous fits of the Auger-only spectrum and composition.

To model the spectral energy distribution of these new sources, we apply the hybrid shock-turbulence acceleration framework previously developed for extreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lacs. We present three representative realizations that produce synchrotron peaks between $0.2$ and $2$ MeV and evaluate their multiwavelenght signatures. Our results show that UEHBLs would be undetectable with current GeV (Fermi) and future TeV (CTA) facilities due to severe Klein-Nishina suppression of inverse Compton scattering, but are ideal targets for proposed MeV missions such as COSI, AMEGO-X, and e-ASTROGAM. We further identify a sample of hard X-ray sources from the Swift-BAT catalogs that exhibit the expected spectral properties of UEHBLs, potentially representing the first observational hints of this population. If confirmed, UEHBLs would provide unique insight into particle acceleration in relativistic jets, imposing strong constraints on the maximum achievable electron energies. We also discuss the expected polarization and variability signatures, including the possibility of synchrotron-driven thermal instabilities leading to MeV flares. These findings underscore the critical importance of the MeV band for discovering and characterizing the most extreme accelerators among blazars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unbiased analysis of primordial non-Gaussianity: the multipoles of the full relativistic power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2511.09466]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A major goal of ongoing and future cosmological surveys of the large-scale structure is to measure local type primordial non-Gaussianity in the galaxy power spectrum through the scale-dependent bias. General relativistic effects have been shown to be degenerate with this measurement, therefore requiring a non-Newtonian approach. In this work, we develop a consistent framework to compute integrated effects, including lensing convergence, time delay, and integrated Sachs–Wolfe, along with the local relativistic projection and wide-separation corrections in the multipoles of the power spectrum. We show that, for a \textit{Euclid}-like H$\alpha$-line galaxy survey and a MegaMapper-like Lyman-break galaxy survey, ignoring these effects leads to a bias on the best fit measurement of the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity, $f_{\rm NL}$, of around $ 3\,\sigma$ and $ 20 \, \sigma$ respectively. When we include these corrections, the uncertainty in our knowledge of the luminosity function leads to further uncertainty in our measurement of $f_{\rm NL}$. In this work, we show that this degeneracy can be partly mitigated by using a bright-faint multi-tracer analysis, where the observed galaxy sample is subdivided into two separate populations based on luminosity, which provides a $15$–$20\%$ improvement on the forecasted constraints of local type $f_{\rm NL}$.

In this paper, we study the Hubble tension problem in the framework of holographic dark energy (HDE). To perform a systematic and comprehensive analysis, we select six representative theoretical models from all four categories of HDE. For the observational data, we adopt the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), a collection of alternative BAO data, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from the $Planck$ 2018, the type Ia supernovae (SN) data from the PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5 compilations. We find that HDE models that employ the Hubble scale or its combinations as the IR cutoff cannot alleviate the Hubble tension problem. In contrast, HDE models that employ the future event horizon as the IR cutoff can significantly alleviate the Hubble tension problem. It must be stressed that these two key conclusions hold true for cases of adopting different theoretical HDE models and different observational data.

Using advanced {\it ab-initio} density functional theory with r$^2$SCAN+rVV10 van der Waals functionals, we calculate adsorption energies of H$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO on carbonaceous (graphene, amorphous carbon) and silicate (MgSiO$_3$) surfaces. Results reveal fundamentally different adsorption mechanisms: weak physisorption on carbonaceous surfaces ($|\Delta\epsilon_{\rm ad}|\sim 0.1-0.2~{\rm eV}$) versus strong chemisorption on silicates ($|\Delta\epsilon_{\rm ad}|\sim 0.5-1.5~{\rm eV}$) via coordination bonds. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations incorporating these energies demonstrate divergent surface evolution: carbonaceous grains exhibit distinct condensation radius compared to silicates, while the cocrystal of H$_2$O and CO significantly increases the desorption temperature of CO. The actual radii of gas-phase molecule depletion could thus be a comprehensive result of temperatures, chemical compositions, and even evolution tracks. Meanwhile, silicates maintain chemisorbed molecular coatings throughout most disk regions. Such dichotomy in surface coverage could also provide a natural mechanism for carbon depletion in inner planetary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09489" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Distribution of the Key Species on the Surface of Europa</a><span class="id">[2511.09489]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The icy surface of Europa is continuously bombarded by ions and electrons from Jupiter's magnetosphere. The bombardment of the particles dissociates water molecules on the surface of Europa and introduces impurities to the icy surface. Such processes lead to the generation of the non-water species on the surface of Europa. Such processes lead to the generation of the nonwater species on the surface of Europa. These chemical species are closely related to the chemistry of the icy crust and the subsurface ocean, as well as Europa's habitability. However, our knowledge of the global distribution of these species is limited due to the sparse satellite and telescope observations on Europa. In this study, we combine a Europa plasma model and a chemical-transport model to simulate the global distribution of the key nonwater species on the surface of Europa. The initial results from our model agree well with the existing observations on the distributions of H2SO4 and SO2 but they show a significant discrepancy with the observed distribution of H2O2. Sensitivity tests on the reaction rate coefficients indicate that the simulated global distribution of all three species fit the observations well if the reaction rate coefficients in the ice are reduced by one order of magnitude. This finding provides a useful constraint on the rate coefficient of the chemical reactions in the ice. Furthermore, our model predicts that the O2 on the surface ice of Europa is concentrated on the leading hemisphere. The simulated global distribution of the key species on Europa may provide useful guidance for future missions to Europa, such as Europa Clipper and JUICE.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09496" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collisions in a system of conical jet/counterjet outflows</a><span class="id">[2511.09496]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stars predominantly form in compact, non-hierarchical clusters.

It operates by performing a linear combination of the shear data vector in $\ell$-space, yielding a transformed vector that is better localized in both redshift and $k$-space. BNT is particularly useful for estimating cosmological parameters while minimizing the impact of poorly understood nonlinear physics, without discarding large amounts of information as is typically done with simple scale cuts. In our previous work, we showed that BNT outperforms traditional weak-lensing analyses; however, that study did not include intrinsic alignments (IA). In the present work, we assess the robustness of our BNT-based $k$-cut framework in the presence of realistic IA models. We consider two cases: (i) when the assumed IA model used in sampling is close to, but not identical to, the true one, and (ii) when the assumed IA model is significantly mis-specified. In the first case, the $k$-cut framework yields precise and unbiased $S_8$ constraints even with limited knowledge of large-scale modes. In the second, the BNT transform serves as a powerful diagnostic tool, revealing internal inconsistencies in the assumed IA model across $k$- and redshift-space, indicating that the corresponding cosmological constraints cannot be trusted until a more accurate IA model is adopted.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abiogenesis on Different Star Types; a Dissipative Photochemical Perspective</a><span class="id">[2511.08624]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The thermodynamic dissipation theory for the origin of life asserts a thermodynamic imperative for the origin of life, suggesting that the fundamental molecules of life originated as self-organized molecular photon dissipative structures (chromophores or pigments) that proliferated over the ocean surface to absorb and dissipate into heat the Archean solar soft UV-C (205-285 nm) and UV-B light ($&lt;$320 nm) of our G-type star. Shorter wavelength hard UV-C light ($&lt;$205 nm) may, depending on atmospheric conditions, have reached Earth's surface and ionized and dissociated or otherwise degraded these carbon-based pigment molecules (as probably occurred on Mars after losing most of its atmosphere). Here we assess the possibility for an abiogenesis of life similar to ours through molecular photon dissipative structuring on planets similar to early Earth but orbiting different star types at distances normalized to the solar constant. Emission spectra of star types are analyzed to determine the ratio of integrated photon fluxes in the soft UV-C wavelength (dissipative structuring) to hard UV-C wavelength (degradation) regions. Our analysis suggests that star types favorable to the dissipative structuring of life, potentially evolving towards complex life forms such as bacteria, are only the F, G and high mass K-types, with intelligent life only possible on G-type stars. Low mass K and M-type stars are highly unlikely to harbor life.

These systems possess long lived quasinormal modes with extremely small imaginary parts, originating from the effective cavity between the photon sphere and the object's interior. We show that the excitation of such modes is strongly suppressed, scaling with the imaginary part of their frequency, and therefore they contribute to the waveform only at very late times. This hierarchy naturally explains the structure of echo signals: the prompt ringdown is dominated by standard light ring modes, the early echoes arise from moderately damped cavity modes, and only the latest echoes are governed by long lived modes. Based on this, we propose a practical ringdown waveform model based on a superposition of ordinary black hole quasinormal modes and cavity modes, which captures the complexity of the ringdown of horizonless ultracompact objects. We further demonstrate that the combination of small excitation factors and weak damping enhances the robustness of long lived modes against localized perturbations, in contrast to the spectral instabilities affecting standard black hole quasinormal modes. Finally, we extend the analysis of greybody factors to exotic compact objects and wormholes, showing that they remain stable under small deformations of the effective potential and thus represent robust observables. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding excitation, stability, and echoes in ultracompact horizonless objects, with direct implications for their spectral properties and gravitational wave signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Did our Universe Tunnel out of the Wrong Higgs Vacuum?</a><span class="id">[2511.08843]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper explores various aspects and implications of the initial configuration of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field at the beginning of our Universe. It is well known that the SM Higgs field features a deeper, more stable minimum at large field values. While it is possible that our Universe began and remained in the electroweak vacuum at all times, this scenario is extremely fine-tuned from the point of view of initial conditions. This fine-tuning can be ameliorated by the exponential expansion of spacetime during inflation: intriguingly, this requires at least $\sim 40$ e-folds of inflation, tantalizingly close to the $50-60$ e-folds expected from horizon and flatness considerations. The Higgs could thus provide the reason for a prolonged epoch of inflation in our cosmic history. Otherwise, the most natural initial state corresponds to our Universe initialized in the more stable but &quot;wrong&quot; Higgs vacuum, and subsequently driven dynamically to the weak scale vacuum during reheating. An important, hitherto unexplored aspect of this dynamics is that the barrier between the two vacua persists when the electroweak vacuum becomes energetically favorable, becoming arbitrarily small as the temperature increases, and therefore triggers a first-order phase transition. This transition produces ultra-high (megahertz to gigahertz) frequency gravitational waves (GWs), serving as a challenging but unique SM target for GW experiments. Novel pathways for various beyond the Standard Model phenomena such as the production of dark matter and baryon asymmetry also become possible in this configuration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09034" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emergent Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2511.09034]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We entertain the possibility that the phenomena typically attributed to dark matter may have a fundamentally emergent nature, rather than arising from new particle degrees of freedom. To illustrate this idea, we consider a field-theoretic model of a three-form gauge field coupled to a cosmological fluid composed of ordinary matter and radiation. In the absence of interactions, the 3-form gauge theory describes only a global, non-propagating state, which can be associated with dark energy. However, when coupled to the cosmic fluid, the theory gives rise to an emergent, dynamical in-medium state. We identify this emergent state of the 3-form gauge field with dark matter. Thus, our proposal provides a unified framework for the dark sector of the universe within the context of an interacting three-form gauge theory. Furthermore, we speculate that the three-form field may have a gravitational origin, potentially supported by the lepton-number asymmetry in the primordial plasma. If this scenario is correct, conventional direct and indirect searches for dark matter would likely be futile.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09217" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of reactor antineutrinos on the neutrino floor in low-mass WIMP-like dark matter searches</a><span class="id">[2511.09217]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The sensitivity of conventional direct dark matter searches for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is ultimately limited by coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), which produces nuclear recoils indistinguishable from WIMP signals and defines the so-called neutrino floor. While the effects of solar, geoneutrino, diffuse supernova, and atmospheric neutrinos have been extensively studied in this context, the contribution from reactor antineutrinos has received comparatively little attention. We present the first systematic evaluation of how reactor antineutrino fluxes, modeled as a function of reactor-detector distance, modify the neutrino floor for low-mass WIMP searches using SuperCDMS-like high-voltage germanium detectors. Both discovery-limit and opacity-based formulations of the neutrino floor are examined under consistent assumptions. We find that proximity to gigawatt-scale reactors within about 10 km can raise the neutrino floor by up to a few orders of magnitude, significantly reducing the sensitivity to sub-10 GeV/c^2 dark matter. Beyond roughly 100 km, the reactor contribution becomes negligible. These results establish reactor proximity as a critical site-dependent parameter in defining the neutrino floor and provide guidance for optimizing the design and siting of future low-threshold dark matter experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09379" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imaging and polarization patterns of various thick disks around Kerr-MOG black holes</a><span class="id">[2511.09379]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the imaging and polarization properties of Kerr-MOG black holes surrounded by geometrically thick accretion flows. The MOG parameter $\alpha$ introduces deviations from the Kerr metric, providing a means to test modified gravity in the strong field regime. Two representative accretion models are considered: the phenomenological radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and the analytical ballistic approximation accretion flow (BAAF). Using general relativistic radiative transfer, we compute synchrotron emission and polarization maps under different spins, MOG parameters, inclinations, and observing frequencies. In both models, the photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing $\alpha$, whereas frame dragging produces pronounced brightness asymmetry. The BAAF model predicts a narrower bright ring and distinct polarization morphology near the event horizon. By introducing the net polarization angle $\chi_{\text{net}}$ and the second Fourier mode $\angle\beta_2$, we quantify inclination- and frame-dragging-induced polarization features. Our results reveal that both $\alpha$ and spin significantly influence the near-horizon polarization patterns, suggesting that high-resolution polarimetric imaging could serve as a promising probe of modified gravity in the strong field regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conservation of magnetic-helicity fluctuations due to spatial decorrelation of fluxes in decaying MHD turbulence</a><span class="id">[2511.09543]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hosking &amp; Schekochihin (2021, Phys. Rev. X 11, 041005) have proposed that statistically isotropic decaying MHD turbulence without net magnetic helicity conserves the mean square fluctuation level of magnetic helicity in large volumes – or, equivalently, the integral over space of the two-point correlation function of the magnetic-helicity density, denoted $I_H$. Formally, the conservation and gauge invariance of $I_H$ require the vanishing of certain boundary terms related to the strength of long-range spatial correlations. These boundary terms represent the ability (or otherwise) of the turbulence to organise fluxes over arbitrarily large distances to deplete or enhance fluctuations of magnetic helicity. In this work, we present a theory of these boundary terms, employing a methodology analogous to that of Batchelor &amp; Proudman (1956, Philos. Trans. R. Soc. A 248, 369) to determine the relevant asymptotic forms of correlation functions. We find that long-range correlations of sufficient strength to violate the conservation of $I_H$ cannot develop dynamically if the evolution equation for the magnetic vector potential is chosen to be local in space. Likewise, we find that such correlations cannot develop for a wide class of gauge choices that make this equation non-local (including the Coulomb gauge). Nonetheless, we also identify a class of non-local gauge choices for which correlations that are sufficiently strong to violate the conservation of $I_H$ do appear possible. We verify our theoretical predictions for the case of the Coulomb gauge with measurements of correlation functions in a high-resolution numerical simulation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase transition during inflation and the gravitational wave signal at pulsar timing arrays</a><span class="id">[2308.00070]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The gravitational wave (GW) signal offers a promising window into the dynamics of the early universe.

The resulting potential is the Kachru-Kallosh-Linde-Trivedi (KKLT) potential $V(\phi) = V_0/[1 + (M/\phi)^n]$, where the power index is given by $n = 2(p-1)/(2-p)$.

We detail several tests to validate the capability of the DR6 parametric foreground model to describe current observations and complex simulations, and show that cosmological parameter constraints are robust against model extensions and variations. We demonstrate consistency of the model with pre-DR6 ACT data and observations from Planck and the South Pole Telescope. We evaluate the implications of using different foreground templates and extending the model with new components and/or free parameters. In all scenarios, the DR6 $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$ cosmological parameters shift by less than $0.5\sigma$ relative to the baseline constraints. Some foreground parameters shift more; we estimate their systematic uncertainties associated with modeling choices. From our constraint on the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power, we obtain a conservative limit on the duration of reionization of $\Delta z_{\rm rei} &lt; 4.4$, assuming a reionization midpoint consistent with optical depth measurements and a minimal low-redshift contribution, with varying assumptions for this component leading to tighter limits. Finally, we analyze realistic non-Gaussian, correlated microwave sky simulations containing Galactic and extragalactic foreground fields, built independently of the DR6 parametric foreground model. Processing these simulations through the DR6 power spectrum and likelihood pipeline, we recover the input cosmological parameters of the underlying cosmic microwave background field, a new demonstration for small-scale CMB analysis.

The possibility to embed this class of models in UV-finite theories and their intriguing, testable, signatures make for a compelling candidate for early acceleration. Due to the Chern-Simons coupling, gauge modes may undergo a finite tachyonic growth during which non-linearities become important. Naturally, this raises the question of whether such (self) interactions can lead to thermalization during inflation. We provide a set of useful criteria for sustained thermalization in an axion-$SU(2)$ model and chart the parameter space of the model accordingly.

A modified recombination scenario involving a time-varying electron mass has been proposed as a feasible solution to the Hubble tension without exacerbating the $S_8$ tension. Recent observations have further revealed other potential deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM framework, such as non-flat spatial curvature and an anomalous CMB lensing amplitude. In this study, we explore whether introducing a variation in the electron mass $m_e$, allowing non-zero spatial curvature $\Omega_K$, and a free lensing amplitude $A_{\rm lens}$ can resolve these persistent tensions. Using the Planck Public Release (PR) 3 and ACT power spectra, Planck PR4 and ACT lensing maps, together with BAO measurements from DESI DR2, we obtain $H_0 = 69.61^{+0.60}_{-0.55} \rm \, km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}$ and $S_8= 0.808\pm0.012$, with $\Delta m_e / m_e = 0.0109^{+0.0068}_{-0.0066}$ and $A_{\rm lens} = 1.030^{+0.039}_{-0.037}$, both exceeding the $\Lambda$CDM expectations. We find no indication of spatial curvature deviating from flatness, even when including the Cosmic Chronometers and SNe Ia samples. However, when adopting the latest Planck power spectra likelihoods, NPIPE and HiLLiPoP, we obtain lower electron masses with $\Delta m_e / m_e = -0.0063^{+0.0095}_{-0.0099}$ and $-0.0095^{+0.0078}_{-0.0079}$, relieving the $S_8$ tension only.

Their structural, morphological, kinematic, and chemical similarities to planet-forming discs suggest that these systems may act as sites of &quot;second generation&quot; planet formation. In this study, we assess whether the disc instability mechanism – a proposed pathway for rapid, giant planet formation in some protoplanetary discs - can operate in post-AGB discs; motivated by their short lifetimes. Using the Toomre criterion under well motivated assumptions for disc structure and size, mass, and thermal properties, we assess the conditions for gravitational instability. We first benchmark our analytical framework using well studied protoplanetary disc systems (including HL Tauri, Elias 2-27, GQ Lupi) before applying the same analysis to observed post-AGB discs. We find that post-AGB discs are generally gravitationally stable at present, due primarily to their low masses. Using viscous disk theory, we find that the discs were stable against collapse even in the past, when their masses were potentially higher. In contrast, several protoplanetary discs analysed in the same way show that they likely experienced gravitationally unstable phases early on. We also find that higher viscosity parameters are better aligned with expected post-AGB disc lifetimes. Finally, we revisit the planet formation scenario proposed for the post-common envelope system NN Ser, first carried out by Schleicher and Dreizler and we show that gravitational instability could be feasible under specific, high disc mass assumptions. Overall, our results provide the first systematic theoretical assessment of gravitational instability in post-AGB discs, demonstrating that this mechanism is unlikely to dominate second generation planet formation in these systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reionization optical depth and CMB-BAO tension in punctuated inflation</a><span class="id">[2509.09086]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Within the standard six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, a $2$-$3\sigma$ tension persists between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although this tension has often been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy or a sum of neutrino masses below the established minimum, recent studies suggest it may instead originate from an underestimation of the reionization optical depth, particularly when inferred from large-scale CMB polarization. Jhaveri et al. propose that a suppression of large-scale primordial curvature power could partially cancel the contribution of $\tau$ to the CMB low-$\ell$ polarization power spectrum, leading to a biased low $\tau$ measurement in standard analyses. In this work, we investigate whether punctuated inflation - which generates a suppression of primordial power on large scales through a transient fast-roll phase - can raise the inferred $\tau$ value and thereby reconcile the consistency between CMB and BAO. For simple models with step-like features in the inflaton potential, we find that the constraint on $\tau$ and the CMB-BAO tension remain nearly identical to those in the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model.

However, there is currently ambiguity about how protoplanetary discs transport angular momentum (e.g. via viscosity or winds) and the relative contributions and interplay of different dispersal mechanisms. A key difficulty is that for any given system only a handful of disc parameters are usually available to constrain theoretical models. Recent observations of the d203-504 disc in Orion, have yielded values of the stellar accretion rate, external photoevaporative mass loss rate, stellar mass and the disc size and mass. In particular, having the combination of accretion rate and external photoevaporative rate is new. Using this unique combination of observables, we run a suite of disc evolution simulations to constrain which scenarios can match the observed values. We explore both viscous and MHD wind-driven discs, finding that they best match observations when the angular momentum transport $\alpha$ parameter is $3\times10^{-4}\leq\alpha_{\nu}\leq2\times10^{-3}$ for viscous discs, and $2\times10^{-3}\leq\alpha_{\rm DW}\leq10^{-2}$ for MHD wind-driven discs, consistent with other estimates in the literature. As well constraining the disc properties and evolution, the d203-504 disc allows us to define a new irradiation age, since in order to match observations, it was required that the disc had only just appeared in the extreme UV environment it is currently exposed to (a known issue for proplyds referred to as the proplyd lifetime problem). This indicates that it is either very young, i.e. &lt;0.1 Myr, or it has been shielded until recently, which would have protected the planet forming reservoir and helped facilitate planet growth despite it now residing in a harsh UV environment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The richest clusters in the Coma and Leo superclusters: Properties and evolution</a><span class="id">[2510.19803]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the substructure, connectivity, and galaxy content of galaxy clusters A1656 and 1367 in the Coma supercluster and of A1185 in the Leo supercluster with the aim of understanding the evolution of clusters from turnaround to virialisation. We used data from the SDSS DR10 MAIN galaxy sample and from DESI cluster catalogues. The projected phase space diagram and the distribution of mass were used to identify regions of various infall stages (early and late infall, and regions of ongoing infall, i.e. regions of influence), their characteristic radii, embedded mass, and density contrasts in order to study the evolution of clusters with the spherical collapse model. We determined the substructure of clusters using normal mixture modelling and their connectivity by counting filaments in the cluster's regions of influence, analysed galaxy content of clusters, and derived scaling relations between cluster masses. All three clusters have a substructure with two to five components and up to six filaments connected to them. The radii of regions of influence are $R_\mathrm{inf} \approx 4$ Mpc, and the density contrast at their borders is $\Delta\rho_{inf} \approx 50 - 60$. The scaling relations between the masses of clusters have a very small scatter. The galaxy content of the clusters and of their regions of influence vary from cluster to cluster. In superclusters the percentage of quiescent galaxies is higher than in low-density regions between superclusters. The collapse of the regions of influence of clusters started at redshifts $z \approx 0.4 - 0.5$. Clusters will be virialised in $\approx 3.3$ Gyrs. Clusters in superclusters will not merge, and their present-day turnaround regions will be virialised in $\approx 10$ Gyrs. The large variety of properties of clusters suggests that they have followed different paths during evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of Seven Cold and Distant Brown Dwarfs with JWST RUBIES</a><span class="id">[2511.01167]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report near-infrared spectral model fits to seven distant L- and T-type dwarfs observed with the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) as part of the Red Unknowns: Bright Infrared Extragalactic Survey (RUBIES). Comparison of 0.9-2.5 $\mu$m near-infrared spectra of these sources to spectral standards indicates spectral types spanning L1 to T8 and spectrophotometric distances spanning 800-3,000 pc. Fits to three grids of spectral models yield atmosphere parameters and spectrophotometric distances largely consistent with our classifications, although fits to L dwarf spectra indicate missing components to the models. Three of our sources have vertical displacements from the Galactic plane exceeding 1 kpc, and have high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk population. Of these, the L dwarf RUBIES-BD-3 (RUBIES-EGS-3081) is well-matched to subdwarf standards, while the early T dwarf RUBIES-BD-5 (RUBIES-UDS-170428) is best fit by metal-poor atmosphere models; both may be a thick disk or halo brown dwarfs. We critically examine the 1-5 $\mu$m spectra of the current sample of 1-2 kpc mid- and late-T dwarfs, finding that temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and vertical mixing efficiency can all contribute to observed variations in near-infrared spectral structure and the strength of the 4.2 $\mu$m CO band. This work aims to guide ongoing JWST, Euclid, and other space-based spectral surveys that are expected to uncover thousands of low-temperature stars and brown dwarfs throughout the Milky Way.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07765" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Lensed Quasar Dark Matter Survey III: Dark Matter Sensitive Flux Ratios and Warm Dark Matter Constraint from the Full Sample</a><span class="id">[2511.07765]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the full sample of measurements of the warm dust emission of 31 strongly-lensed, multiply imaged quasars, observed with JWST MIRI multiband imaging, which we use to constrain the particle properties of dark matter. The strongly lensed warm dust region of quasars is compact and statistically sensitive to a population of dark matter halos down to masses of $10^6$ M$_\odot$. The high spatial resolution and infrared sensitivity of MIRI make it uniquely suited to measure multiply imaged warm dust emission from quasars and thus to infer the properties of low-mass dark halos. We use the measured flux ratios to test for a warm dark matter turnover in the halo mass function. To infer the dark matter parameters, we use a forward modeling pipeline which explores dark matter parameters while also accounting for tidal stripping effects on subhalos, globular clusters, and complex deflector macromodels with $m=1, m=3, \text{ and } m=4$ elliptical multipole moments. Adopting a comparable prior on the projected density of substructure to our previous analyses, the data presented here provide a factor of 2 improvement in sensitivity to a turnover in the halo mass function. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model galacticus we infer with a Bayes factor of 10:1, a half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.8} M_{\odot}$ (m&gt;5.6 keV for a thermally produced dark matter particle). If instead we use a prior from N-body simulations, we infer $m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.5} M_{\odot}$ (m&gt;6.9 keV). This is one of the strongest constraints to date on a turnover on the halo mass function, and the flux ratios and inference methodology presented here can be used to test a broad range of dark matter physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08266" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation. Non-Gaussianity of 2-point statistics likelihood: Precise analysis of the matter power spectrum distribution</a><span class="id">[2511.08266]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the non-Gaussian features in the distribution of the matter power spectrum multipoles. Using the COVMOS method, we generate 100 000 mock realisations of dark matter density fields in both real and redshift space across multiple redshifts and cosmological models. We derive an analytical framework linking the non-Gaussianity of the power spectrum distribution to higher-order statistics of the density field, including the trispectrum and pentaspectrum. We explore the effect of redshift-space distortions, the geometry of the survey, the Fourier binning, the integral constraint, and the shot noise on the skewness of the distribution of the power spectrum measurements. Our results demonstrate that the likelihood of the estimated matter power spectrum deviates significantly from a Gaussian assumption on nonlinear scales, particularly at low redshift. This departure is primarily driven by the pentaspectrum contribution, which dominates over the trispectrum at intermediate scales. We also examine the impact of the finiteness of the survey geometry in the context of the Euclid mission and find that both the shape of the survey and the integral constraint amplify the skewness.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the problem of initial conditions for inflation</a><span class="id">[1710.04278]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I review the present status of the problem of initial conditions for inflation and describe several ways to solve this problem for many popular inflationary models, including the recent generation of the models with plateau potentials favored by cosmological observations.</p></div></details></article></body>
