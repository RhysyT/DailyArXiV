However, their rarity and weak absorption features have hindered comprehensive studies. In this work, we present a novel dual CNN approach to detect Ca II absorption systems, analyzing over 100,000 quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16. Our primary CNN identifies Ca II features, while a secondary CNN cross-verifies these detections using five Fe II absorption lines. This approach yielded 1,646 Ca II absorption systems, including 525 previously known absorbers and 1,121 new discoveries, nearly tripling the size of any previously reported catalog. Among our Ca II absorbers, 95 are found to show the 2175Å dust feature (2DA), corresponding to 22% of strong absorbers, 7% of weak absorbers, and $\sim$12% of the overall Ca II population at $0.8 &lt; z_{\text{abs}} &lt; 1.4$. Across the full redshift range of $0.36 &lt; z_{\text{abs}} &lt; 1.4$, $\sim$1.5% of Mg II absorbers host Ca II.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modelling the nebular emission of galaxies across cosmic time with COLT</a><span class="id">[2510.13952]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extragalactic nebular emission has long been a workhorse probe of the processes driving galaxy evolution, but the richness of JWST spectroscopy has shifted the bottleneck from data acquisition to physical interpretation and modelling. In this context, we present a major update to the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code COLT to facilitate self-consistent modelling of nebular line and continuum emission from simulated galaxies. We introduce a new thermal equilibrium solver that iteratively couples to the existing ionization solver and radiation field to compute effective gas temperatures by accurately balancing photoionization heating, radiative and dielectronic recombination, collisional ionization, charge exchange, metal and primordial line cooling, free-free emission, and Compton scattering. To prevent over-cooling where non-equilibrium hydrodynamics dominate, we introduce a Courant-limited cooling prescription tied to each cell's sound-crossing time, preserving temperatures in the diffuse halo while allowing physically motivated cooling in the interstellar medium (ISM). Applied to an isolated local galaxy simulation, the equilibrium solver reshapes the ISM phase space by reducing spuriously excessive lukewarm ($T=10^3-10^4$K) gas and better resolving warm ionized and cold neutral phases, while leaving the CGM largely intact. We further implement a level population solver based on modern atomic data, enabling accurate cooling and emissivities for a large library of UV to infrared metal lines, together with newly implemented primordial nebular continuum emission from free-free, free-bound, and two-photon processes. Finally, by applying COLT to the high-redshift THESAN-ZOOM simulations, we reproduce observed emission-line ratios, establishing COLT as a robust framework for forward modelling nebular emission across cosmic time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong Evidence for Cosmic Ray-Supported $\sim$L$^{\ast}$ Galaxy Halos via X-ray &amp; tSZ Constraints</a><span class="id">[2510.13959]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many state-of-the-art galaxy simulations featuring traditional feedback modes have significant challenges producing enough extended soft X-ray ($\sim 0.5-2$ keV) emission at R $\sim 0.5-1$ R$_{\rm vir}$ observed around galaxies with stellar masses M$_{\rm \ast} \lesssim 10^{11} \rm M_\odot$, without violating galaxy mass function constraints. Moreover, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) measurements probing the thermal pressure of similar galaxies indicate it is orders-of-magnitude lower than predictions from simple halo hydrodynamics and many hydrodynamical simulations. We demonstrate that these constraints can be met congruously with a large non-thermal pressure contribution in the form of cosmic rays (CRs) from SNe and/or AGN, which lowers the tSZ signal while CR leptons produce plentiful soft X-rays via inverse Compton scattering of the CMB. The combination of these two observations is far more constraining on the pressure budget of galactic halos than either alone – if these novel tSZ and X-ray observations are borne out by future studies, then taken together they reveal \textit{the strongest evidence for CR support in halos to date}. Conversely, it is very difficult to produce the extended X-rays via traditional thermal emission without increasing the overall thermal pressure and thus tSZ signal in tandem, making these tensions even worse. Finally, tSZ &amp; X-rays together unlock a novel observational method to constrain halo CR pressure relative to thermal pressure, with implications for CR transport parameters and AGN feedback energetics across various galaxy mass scales. Taking the currently observed constraints at M$_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{\rm 12} \rm M_\odot$ imply the halo CR pressure must at least be equal to the gas thermal pressure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13974" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predictions of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Exoplanet Survey. IV. Lens Mass and Distance Measurements</a><span class="id">[2510.13974]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As part of the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) will use microlensing to discover cold outer planets and free-floating planets unbound to stars. NASA has established several science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key advantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow detection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman must measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20% precision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the GBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter uncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux, relative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of lens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code for estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated events. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that &gt;40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that the GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by comparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from detailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing events with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly 1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass and distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for Roman-era microlensing science.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ASTRID Simulation at z=0: from Massive Black Holes to Large-scale Structure</a><span class="id">[2510.13976]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the $z=0$ results for the cosmological simulation ASTRID. Hosting $2\times 5500^3\approx$ 0.33 trillion particles in a box of $370\, {\rm Mpc}$ per side, ASTRID is one of the largest cosmological hydrodynamic simulations evolved to $z=0$. ASTRID features a large population of massive black holes (MBHs), covering a wide mass range $4\times10^{4}\sim 2\times 10^{11}\ M_{\odot}$. The adopted dynamical friction model provides a relatively accurate description of MBH dynamics, making ASTRID a powerful tool to study MBH growth and mergers in a cosmological context. ASTRID successfully captures the co-evolution of MBHs and their host galaxies, producing $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\star}$ and $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relations in good agreement with observations. Notably, ASTRID generates scatter in these relations that is more consistent with observations than previous simulations, indicating a more realistic MBH diversity. The galaxy stellar mass function at $z=0$ is generally consistent with observational constraints. When dust attenuation is applied, the galaxy luminosity function also agrees well with observations, and the bimodality in galaxy colors is reproduced as well. ASTRID hosts a large population of massive galaxy groups and clusters: 7 halos have $M_{\rm 200c}&gt;10^{15}\ M_{\odot}$, and 9709 halos have $M_{\rm 200c}&gt;10^{13}\ M_{\odot}$. We quantify the stellar mass content in these halos, and find that the correlations between the stellar and halo mass match well with observational constraints. Finally, we present the $z=0$ power spectra of MBH and galaxies, as well as their bias with respect to the matter power spectrum. We find that MBHs with $M_{\rm BH}\geq 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$ and galaxies with $M_{\star}\geq 10^{10.5}\ M_{\odot}$ serve as good tracers of large-scale structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The THESAN-ZOOM project: The Hidden Neighbours of OI Absorbers during Reionization</a><span class="id">[2510.13977]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Metal absorbers represent a powerful probe of galaxy feedback and reionization, as highlighted by both observational and theoretical results showing an increased abundance of low-ionised metal species at higher redshifts. The origin of such absorbers is currently largely unknown because of the low number of galaxy counterparts detected, suggesting that they might be surrounded by low-mass faint sources that fall below the detection threshold of current instruments. We use the THESAN-ZOOM radiation hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the connection between properties of neutral oxygen (OI) absorbers and galaxies within the redshift range $z = 5 - 8$. We find that the circumgalactic medium of galaxies becomes progressively ionised with cosmic time, leading to a decrease of $\approx 0.2$ in the covering fraction of neutral oxygen, while the total oxygen covering fraction remains constant. The observable absorbers ($N_{\rm OI} \gtrsim 10^{13}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$) are not confined to haloes: at $z \geq 5$ the majority ($\gtrsim 60\%$) arise beyond $R_{\rm{vir}}$, and including these systems is essential to reproduce the observed increase in absorber incidence with redshift. The simulated absorbers preferentially reside in overdensities rich in low-mass galaxies ($M_\star \leq 10^8\,\rm{M}_\odot$), explaining the scarcity of detected counterparts, while not excluding the possibility of nearby star-forming sources ($\geq 5\,\text{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$) similar to those suggested by the latest ALMA observations and, at larger distances, by the JWST. These results establish OI absorbers as sensitive tracers of the evolving ionisation structure around faint galaxies to be probed by forthcoming deep spectroscopic surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Nephele ecosystem: stars, globular clusters, and stellar streams associated with the progenitor galaxy of $ω$ Centauri</a><span class="id">[2510.13990]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Globular clusters (GCs) and their associated stellar streams are key tracers of the hierarchical assembly history of the Milky Way. $\omega$ Centauri, the most massive and chemically complex GC in the Galaxy, is widely believed to be the remnant nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. Identifying its associated debris and that of chemically similar clusters can provide important constraints on the nature of this progenitor system. We aim to identify field stars that are chemically and kinematically linked to $\omega$ Cen and to a group of globular clusters associated with the Nephele accretion event. We analyse APOGEE DR17 data using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in a 8-dimensional chemical space to identify field stars whose abundances match those of $\omega$ Cen. We then compute the orbital energy and angular momentum of these stars and apply a second GMM, calibrated on simulations from the e-TidalGCs project, to determine kinematic compatibility with the predicted streams of $\omega$ Cen and the associated Nephele GCs. We identify 470 stars chemically compatible with $\omega$ Cen, of which 58 are also Al-rich, consistent with second-generation stars found in GCs. Of these, 6 stars show kinematics consistent with the predicted $\omega$ Cen stream, and additional stars are linked to the tidal streams of NGC 6205, NGC 6254, NGC 6273, NGC 6656, and NGC 6809. We also find overlap in chemical and kinematic properties between Nephele stars and the Gaia Sausage-Enceladus population. Our findings indicate stellar debris linked to $\omega$ Cen and its candidate globular cluster family, consistent with a shared, now-disrupted galactic progenitor. Despite residual uncertainties from disc contamination and limited sky coverage, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of combined chemical and dynamical analyses in uncovering relics of past accretion events in the inner Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14059" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Helium Reionization Through the $^{3}\mathrm{He}^{+}$ Hyperfine Transition Line</a><span class="id">[2510.14059]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the hyperfine transition of $^{3}\mathrm{He}^{+}$ as a promising probe of the IGM during the final stages of helium reionization. Utilising the most recent helium reionization simulation, we generate three-dimensional maps of the 3.5cm ($8.67$ GHz) differential brightness temperature and analyze its evolution. Our results show that the volume-averaged brightness temperature declines rapidly from $\sim 1 \mu$K at $z = 4$ to $\sim 2.5 \times 10^{-3} \mu$K by $z = 2.3$, tracing the HeII to HeIII transition driven by quasars. The power spectrum of the 3.5cm signal exhibits a scale-dependent evolution, peaking on small scales and declining as reionization progresses. We explore the cross-correlation of the 3.5cm transition line with the distribution of AGNs, which shows a transition from positive to negative correlation as ionized regions grow. We also examine the 3.5cm forest and demonstrate that absorption features persist down to $z \sim 2.90$, even when more than $85\%$ of HeII is ionized. Although current observational upper limits lie several orders of magnitude above theoretical predictions, future radio arrays such as $\mathrm{SKA-mid}$ offer promising prospects. Overall, this study highlights the $^{3}\mathrm{He}^{+}$ hyperfine transition as a sensitive tracer of the thermal and ionization history of the IGM during helium reionization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analysis of Planetary Nebulae in the Milky Way: Physical Properties, Chemical Abundances, and Galactic Distributions</a><span class="id">[2510.14149]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we investigate the physical and chemical properties of planetary nebulae (PNe) from the Milky Way Galaxy using the largest number of sources to date, with 1,449 True PNe from the HASH database. Among the Galactic components thin disk, thick disk, halo, and bulge-most PNe are concentrated in the Galactic disk, with a median angular size of 12 arcseconds (0.45 pc), while halo PNe tend to have larger sizes. Physical parameters of whole PNe, extinction coefficent c(Hbeta), electron temperature (Te), and density (Ne) show Gaussian-like distributions with medians of 1.5, 9,900 K, and 1,200 cm(-3), respectively. The abundances of He, N, O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar in PNe show Gaussian distributions with slight variations across Galactic components. PNe located in thin disk exhibit higher abundances, except for O and Ne, while PNe in halo have the lowest values for all elements. Strong correlations between elements, particularly Sulphur vs. Nitrogen (r=0.87), were identified using statistical tests. Comparisons with previous studies reveal variations ( 2 dex.) in abundance ratios, particularly in halo PNe. We also present the first detailed database in the literature, providing 7,200 abundance values for these elements, derived from 16,500 emission line measurements, to support the testing and development of theoretical models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecting outflows with radio emission in AGN at Cosmic Noon</a><span class="id">[2510.14152]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>AGN feedback is a well known mechanism in the evolution of galaxies. One open question is the driving mechanism of galaxy-scale outflows. At low redshift, radio jets often interact with the ISM, generating turbulence and driving ionized outflows. Despite this evidence at low redshift, relatively few studies have investigated the radio-ionized gas connection at cosmic noon. Thus, our main goal is to conduct a pilot study using VLA data for three quasars with moderate/high radio power, which have ionized outflows identified in observations from the SUPER survey. We used [OIII] data from SINFONI analyzed in earlier studies, along with new 6.2 GHz VLA radio observations, at comparable spatial resolution. We also incorporate radio data from the literature to explore the radio emission. We detected extended radio structure in our VLA A-array data for two quasars. The extended structure in J1333+1649 aligns with the smaller-scale emission seen in archival images, suggesting a jet propagating from nuclear to galaxy-wide scales. In all three quasars, we found that the brightest radio emission and ionized gas have comparable spatial scales. Furthermore, the position angles of the radio emission and ionized gas present small offsets for the two targets with extended structures. Given that the kinematics of the ionized gas in all three quasars is dominated by outflows, our results suggest a strong connection between radio emission and ionized outflows in typical AGN at cosmic noon. Based on energetic considerations and comparisons with archival data, radio jets could be a significant mechanism for driving outflows in AGN from cosmic noon to low redshifts. However, with the exception of one object (J1333+1649), we cannot rule out the possibility that the radio emission arises from shocks in the interstellar medium caused by disk winds or radiatively driven outflows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quasi-periodic oscillations in optical color evolutions to support sub-pc binary black hole systems in broad line active galactic nuclei</a><span class="id">[2510.14182]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with periodicity around hundreds to thousands of days have been accepted as an efficient indicator for sub-pc binary black hole systems (BBHs) in broad line active galactic nuclei (BLAGN). However, considering intrinsic variability (red noises) of BLAGN, it is still an open question on physical origin of detected optical QPOs from AGN variability or truly from sub-pc BBHs. Here, a simple method is proposed to support optical QPOs related to sub-pc BBHs by detecting QPOs in time dependent optical color evolutions of BLAGN. Periodic variations of obscurations are expected on optical light curves related to sub-pc BBHs, but there should be non-periodic variable obscurations on optical light curves in normal BLAGN. Through simulated optical light curves for intrinsic AGN variability by Continuous AutoRegressive process with time durations around 2800days (similar as time durations of light curves in ZTF), the probability is definitely smaller than $3.3\times10^{-7}$ that QPOs can be detected in the corresponding optical color evolutions, but about $3.1\times10^{-2}$ that optical QPOs with periodicity smaller than 1400days (at least two cycles) can be detected in the simulated single-band light curves. Therefore, confidence level is definitely higher than 5$\sigma$ to support the QPOs in color evolutions not related to intrinsic AGN variability but truly related to sub-pc BBHs. In the near future, the proposed method can be applied for searching reliable optical QPOs in BLAGN through multi-band light curves from the ZTF and the upcoming LSST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Molecular gas content of gravitational-lensed quasars at cosmic noon</a><span class="id">[2510.14183]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Star-forming activity in the host galaxies of high-redshift quasars is crucial to understanding the connection between supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity and galaxy evolution. While most existing studies are biased toward luminous quasars, we conduct carbon monoxide (CO) observations of 17 gravitationally lensed quasars that have four images using the IRAM 30m telescope to investigate the molecular gas content of moderate- to low-luminosity quasars. CO emissions are detected in five out of 17 quasars, corresponding to a detection rate of about 30\%. Analysis of their star formation activity reveals that these quasars live in gas-rich environments but exhibit weaker starbursts and lower star formation efficiencies compared to other luminous high-redshift quasars. In addition, the CO spectral line energy distributions of the two quasars (SDSS J0924+0219, SDSS J1330+1810) are also consistent with mild star formation instead of extreme starbursts. These results suggest that these lensed quasars reside in weaker starburst environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dust extinction map of the Galactic plane based on the UKIDSS survey data</a><span class="id">[2510.14380]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dust plays a critical role in the study of the interstellar medium (ISM). Extinction maps derived from optical surveys often fail to capture regions with high column density due to the limited photometric depth in optical wavelengths. To address these limitations, we developed the XPNICER method based on near-infrared (NIR) photometric survey data. This method combines the previously established PNICER and Xpercentile techniques, enabling effective mitigation of foreground contamination and improved handling of complex dust structures in the Galactic plane, which thus can provide more accurate extinction estimates, particularly in highly obscured regions. By applying XPNICER to the Galactic Plane Survey from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey, we have generated a series of two-dimensional (2D) dust extinction maps that span roughly 1800 deg2 of the Galactic plane (0&lt; l &lt; 110deg and 140&lt; l &lt; 232deg, |b| &lt; 5deg). These maps, with spatial resolutions between 30arcsec and 300arcsec, can trace extinction up to Av   30-40 mag. This new approach offers higher spatial resolution and better detection of high-extinction regions compared to previous large-scale dust-based maps of the Galactic plane, providing an independent and complementary measure of dust column densities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accounting for the absence of anomalous microwave emission in the M 31 halo</a><span class="id">[2510.14441]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of a temperature asymmetry in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data towards various galaxies has opened a window for a deeper comprehension of galactic halos. A crucial step forward is that of estimating the fraction of missing baryons in the halos, but it relies on understanding the real cause of the observed CMB temperature asymmetry since many effects might give a non-negligible contribution. Here, we analyzed the contribution played by the anomalous microwave emission (AME) from halo dust grains in the halo of the M 31 galaxy. Assuming either amorphous carbon and silicates dust grains with size ranging from $0.01~\mu$m to about $0.3~\mu$m and mass in the range $10^{-14} - 10^{-13}$ g, we estimated the total mass, distribution, and diffuse emission in the $100\,\mu$m band of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). Then, we estimated the temperature asymmetry induced by the rotation of the M 31 halo and compared the obtained values with the \textit{Planck}'s SMICA-processed data. We find that the AME cannot account for the measured CMB temperature asymmetry, with its contribution constrained to $\lesssim 7\%$, thereby indicating that additional physical mechanisms must be responsible for the observed signal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14529" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The variability of active galaxies: I.

X-ray light curves of unabsorbed AGN show dramatic random variability on timescales ranging from seconds to years. The power spectrum of the fluctuations is usually well-modelled with a power law that decays as $1/f$ at low frequencies, and which bends to $1/f^{2-3}$ at high frequencies. The timescale associated with the bend correlates well with the mass of the black hole and may also correlate with bolometric luminosity in the `X-ray variability plane'. Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly sampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging. In a previous paper, we introduced a new method to estimate the parameters of bending power law power spectra from AGN light curves. We apply this method to a sample of 56 variable and unabsorbed AGN, observed with XMM-Newton and Swift in the $0.3-1.5$ keV band over the past two decades. We obtain estimates of the bends in 50 sources, which is the largest sample of X-ray bends in the soft band. We also find that the high-frequency power spectrum is often steeper than 2. We update the X-ray variability plane with new bend timescale measurements spanning from 7 min to 62 days. We report the detections of low-frequency bends in the power spectra of five AGN, three of which are previously unpublished: 1H 1934-063, Mkn 766 and Mkn 279.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The multimessenger view of Pulsar Timing Array black holes with the Horizon-AGN simulation</a><span class="id">[2510.14613]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the Horizon-AGN cosmological simulation to study the properties of supermassive black hole binaries (MBHBs) contributing most to the gravitational wave background (GWB) signal expected in the pulsar timing array (PTA) band. We develop a pipeline to generate realistic populations of MBHBs, allowing us to estimate both the characteristic strain and GWB time series observable by PTA experiments. We identify potential continuous wave (CW) candidates standing above the background noise, using toy PTA sensitivities representing the current EPTA and future SKA. We estimate the probability of detecting at least one CW with signal-to-noise ratio $&gt;3$ to be $4\%$ ($20\%$) for EPTA (SKA)-like sensitivities, assuming a 10-year baseline. We find the GWB to be dominated by hundreds to thousands of binaries at redshifts in the range $0.05-1$, with chirp masses of $10^{8.5}-10^{9.5}\, M_\odot$, hosted mainly in quiescent massive galaxies residing in halos of mass $\sim 10^{13}\, M_\odot$. CW candidates have larger masses, lower redshifts and are found in even more massive halos, typical of galaxy groups and clusters. The majority of these systems would appear as AGN rather than quasars, because of their low Eddington ratios. Nevertheless, CW candidates with $f_{\rm Edd}&gt;10^{-3}$ can still outshine their hosts, particularly in radio and X-ray bands, suggesting them as the most promising route for identification. Our findings imply that optical and near-infrared searches based on light curve variability are challenging and biased toward more luminous systems. Finally, we highlight important caveats in the common method used to compare PTA observations with theoretical models. We find that GWB spectral inferences used by PTAs could be biased toward shallower slopes and higher amplitudes at $f=1/\rm yr$, thereby reducing the apparent tension between astrophysical expectations and PTA observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14667" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active galactic nucleus outflows accelerate when they escape the bulge</a><span class="id">[2510.14667]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large-scale outflows driven by AGNs are an important element of galaxy evolution. Detailed analysis of their properties allows us to probe the activity history of the galactic nucleus and, potentially, other properties of the host galaxy. A recent paper presents detailed radial velocity profiles of outflows in ten AGN host galaxies and shows a common trend of approximately constant velocity in the centre followed by rapid acceleration outside $R_{\rm tr} \sim 1 - 3$ kpc. We show that this is a consequence of the AGN-driven outflows clearing the gaseous bulges of the host galaxies and beginning to expand into a region of negligible gas density. We used a 1D semi-analytical code to calculate outflow propagation in each of the ten galaxies, assuming a constant AGN luminosity and an isothermal bulge density profile, with a finite bulge radius, and leaving the gas fraction and total mass of the bulge as free parameters. We also considered the effect of different gas density profiles, variations in bulge velocity dispersion, AGN luminosity, and the effect of outflow fragmentation. Our simplest model can fit six outflow profiles essentially perfectly, while another can be fit if the bulge gas density profile is shallower than isothermal. A shallower density profile also improves the fit in the central regions of the remaining three outflows, but they accelerate faster than our models predict; this could be evidence of significant gas cooling and star formation that reduce the total mass of outflowing gas. We conclude that a simple AGN-driven wind feedback model can explain the detailed velocity profiles of real outflows in local AGN hosts. The free parameters of our model have values that fall well within reasonable ranges. This suggests that the simple scenario we envisioned is close to the true conditions governing the general trends of large-scale outflow expansion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical Studies on the Radio Afterglows in TDE (I): Forward Shock</a><span class="id">[2510.14715]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent long-term radio monitoring of tidal disruption events (TDEs) suggests that radio afterglows are common. Most studies argue that these afterglows may arise from forward shocks (FS) produced by the interaction between the TDE outflow and the hot, diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM). Current theoretical models do not model the evolution of relativistic electrons in space, which introduces uncertainties. Here we conducted hydrodynamic simulations to study the hydrodynamic evolution of relativistic electrons, and calculated the synchrotron spectra via radiative transfer. We focus on the FS scenario with non-relativistic outflows, and various parameters of the outflow and CNM are explored. A moderate outflow with kinetic energy of several $10^{50}$ erg in a Galactic center - like CNM can produce mJy-level radio afterglows at a distance of 100 Mpc. The self-absorption frequency exhibits a slow decline at early times and a rapid decrease at late times. We derived the temporal evolution of the high-frequency radio flux, revealing its characteristic rise and decline pattern. We also find that: (1) the radio spectra for narrow outflows are clearly anisotropic along different sight lines; (2) the FS parameters inferred from radio spectra using conventional analytical formulas deviate significantly from those in simulations, in which the inferred shock radii are half of those from simulations, and the inferred energies are an order of magnitude lower.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mergers lighting the early Universe: enhanced star formation, AGN triggering, and Ly$α$ emission in close pairs at $z=3-9$</a><span class="id">[2510.14743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy mergers and interactions are often invoked to explain enhanced star formation, black hole growth, and mass build-up of galaxies at later cosmic times, but their effect is poorly understood at high redshift ($z&gt;2$). We use JADES data to analyse a mass-complete sample of 2095 galaxies at $z=3-9$ with ${\rm log}(M_\star/{\rm M_\odot}) = [8, 10]$, identifying major merger pairs (projected separation of $5-100$ pkpc, mass ratio $\geq 1/4$) using a probabilistic method. To look for signatures of enhancement in multiple physical properties, we carefully build a control sample of non-pairs that are simultaneously matched in redshift, stellar mass, isolation, and environment to the pair sample. We find a moderate enhancement in specific star formation rate (sSFR) of $1.12 \pm 0.05$ at separations $\lesssim 20$ kpc, which is weakly detectable out to $\sim50$ kpc. We find that at longer averaging timescales (50-100 Myr) the sSFR is more affected by interactions and environment, whereas at shorter timescales (5-10 Myr) it is dominated by internal feedback and burstiness. By averaging star formation histories, we find two distinct populations: pre-first passage/coalescence (monotonically rising SFR) and post-pericentre pairs (earlier peak in SFR). Finally, we find no significant excess of AGN in pairs, suggesting galaxy interactions are not effectively triggering black hole activity at separations $&gt;5$ kpc. Similarly, we also do not detect an excess in the fraction of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters in pairs, implying that at the probed separations, galaxy interactions are not efficient at enhancing Lyman-$\alpha$ photon production and escape, which may only become important at the smallest scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hidden Story of Chemical Evolution in Local Star-Forming Nuclear Rings</a><span class="id">[2510.14757]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A VLT/MUSE population synthesis study of metallicities in the nuclear star-forming rings of four disk galaxies (NGC 613, NGC 1097, NGC 3351, NGC 7552) is presented. Disentangling the spectral contributions of young and old stellar populations, we find a large spread of ages and metallicities of the old stars in the nuclear rings. This indicates a persistent infall of metal-poor gas and ongoing episodic star formation over many gigayears. The young stars have metallicities a factor two to three higher than solar in all galaxies except NGC 3351, where the range is from half to twice solar. Previously reported detections of extremely metal poor regions at young stellar age on the rings of these four galaxies are a methodological artifact of the average over all stars, young and old. In addition, it is important to include contributions of very young stars ($&lt;6$ Myr) in this environment. For each of the four galaxies, the extinction maps generated through our population synthesis analysis provide support for the infall scenario. They reveal dust lanes along the leading edges of the stellar bars, indicating the flow of interstellar material towards the circumnuclear zone. Prominent stellar clusters show little extinction, most likely because of the onset of stellar winds. Inside and on the nuclear rings, regions that are largely free of extinction are detected.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14766" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predicting the Subhalo Mass Functions in Simulations from Galaxy Images</a><span class="id">[2510.14766]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strong gravitational lensing provides a powerful tool to directly infer the dark matter (DM) subhalo mass function (SHMF) in lens galaxies.

We present a machine learning framework to infer the galaxy-specific predicted SHMF from galaxy images, conditioned on the assumed inverse warm DM particle mass $M^{-1}_{\rm DM}$. To train the model, we use 1024 high-resolution hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations from the DREAMS suite. Mock observations are generated using Synthesizer, excluding gas particle contributions, and SHMFs are computed with the Rockstar halo finder. Our neural network takes as input both the galaxy images and the inverse DM mass.

In particular, radio continuum (RC) observations offer valuable insights into cosmic ray dynamics, which play a significant role in shaping these processes. This study investigates the detectability and spectral characteristics of RC emission in a sample of 15 dwarf galaxies (11 gas-rich, star forming dwarfs and 4 blue compact dwarfs) spanning a broad range of stellar masses and star formation histories. Using multi-band RC data (L/S-, C-, and X-band) from the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we analyse the physical conditions responsible for RC emission and explore the dominant emission mechanisms within these systems. RC emission is detected in 11 out of the 15 galaxies. Our results indicate that RC emission correlates strongly with star formation rate, far-infrared, and stellar mass, while dynamic parameters such as HI and rotational velocity exhibit no significant correlation with RC detectability. Spectral analysis reveals that the RC spectral energy distribution in these galaxies frequently deviate from a simple power-law behavior, instead displaying curvature that suggests more complex underlying physical processes. Statistical model comparison confirms that a single power-law model is inadequate to capture the observed spectral shapes, emphasising the necessity of more sophisticated approaches. Additionally, the observed radio-far-infrared correlation indicates that cosmic ray electrons in lower-mass dwarf galaxies cool more rapidly than they can escape (e.g. via galactic winds), resulting in a measurable RC deficit.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The dark side of early galaxies: $\texttt{geko}$ uncovers dark-matter fractions at $z\sim4-6$</a><span class="id">[2510.14779]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy enables dynamical mass measurements for typical star-forming galaxies only a billion years after the Big Bang.

Our sample spans $\log M_{\star}\approx7$-10 and $\log M_{\rm dyn}\approx9$-11. Gas masses are estimated via scaling relations, yielding baryonic masses and dark-matter (DM) fractions $f_{\rm DM}(r&lt;r_{\rm e})$ within the H$\alpha$ half-light radius. We find high median fractions of $\langle f_{\rm gas}\rangle=0.77$ and $\langle f_{\rm DM}\rangle=0.73$, where $f_{\rm gas}$ is measured with respect to the baryonic mass and $f_{\rm DM}$ with respect to the DM+baryonic mass. About two-thirds of systems are DM-dominated within $r_{\rm e}\sim0.5-1$ kpc. Both $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ decrease with stellar mass, consistent with simulations. The stellar Tully-Fisher relation shows a tentative offset to higher $v_{\rm circ}$ at fixed $M_{\star}$ and substantial intrinsic scatter, suggesting that the relation is only beginning to emerge at $z\sim5$. We measure a negative correlation between $f_{\rm DM}$ and baryonic surface density $\Sigma_{\rm bar}$, weaker but broadly consistent with trends at cosmic noon and at $z\sim0$. Qualitatively comparing with modified NFW profiles coupled to an empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation suggests that the lowest $f_{\rm DM}$ ($\lesssim0.4$) require cored inner DM profiles, while the highest fractions favour cuspier profiles, potentially reflecting adiabatic contraction. Overall, the elevated $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ at $z\gtrsim4$ are compatible with progenitors of baryon-dominated systems at $z\sim2$ and naturally anticipate overmassive black holes at fixed $M_{\star}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey III: First data release of JCMT CO-line observations</a><span class="id">[2510.14809]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Low- to intermediate-mass ($\sim$0.8$-$8 M$_\odot$) evolved stars contribute significantly to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium in the local Universe, making accurate mass-return estimates in their final stages crucial.

We present an initial analysis of the CO-line observations, including detection statistics, carbon isotopic ratios, initial mass-loss rates, and gas-to-dust ratios. We describe a new data reduction pipeline to analyse the available NESS CO data from the JCMT, measuring line parameters and calculating empirical gas mass-loss rates. We present the first release of the available data on 485 sources, one of the largest homogeneous samples of CO data to date. Comparison with a large literature sample finds that high mass-loss rate and especially carbon-rich sources are over-represented in literature, while NESS is probing significantly more sources at low mass-loss rates, detecting 59 sources in CO for the first time and providing useful upper limits. CO line detection rates are 81% for the CO (2–1) line and 75% for CO (3–2). The majority (82%) of detected lines conform to the expected soft parabola shape, while eleven sources show a double wind. Calculated mass-loss rates show power-law relations with both the dust-production rates and expansion velocities up to $\sim 5 \times 10^{-6}$ \msunyr. Median gas-to-dust ratios of 250 and 680 are found for oxygen-rich and carbon-rich sources, respectively.

We present high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic simulations of hot outflows interacting with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), parameterised by its cold-gas volume filling fraction $f_v$, depth $L_{\rm ISM}$, and clump size $r_{\rm cl}$. We identify a universal survival criterion $f_v L_{\rm ISM} \gtrsim r_{\rm crit}$ that generalises the classical single-cloud condition ($r_{\rm cl} &gt; r_{\rm crit}$) and correctly predicts cold-gas survival across diverse ISM configurations - including scale-free - down to $r_{\rm cl}/r_{\rm crit} \sim 10^{-2}$. The surviving cold phase rapidly loses memory of the initial ISM structure and evolves toward a self-similar clump mass spectrum following Zipf's law ($\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}m \propto m^{-2}$), implying that turbulent mixing and radiative condensation universally shape multiphase outflows. Cold gas assembles into plumes or confined shells of size $\sim \chi r_{\mathrm{cl,min}}$, growing as mass is accreted from the hot phase. The interaction of a laminar wind with a clumpy ISM drives turbulence in both phases, with first-order velocity structure functions following a Kolmogorov scaling and an injection scale set by $L_{\rm ISM}$, while velocity dispersions reach $\sigma \sim c_{\rm s,cold}$. The areal covering fraction of cold gas approaches unity even for $f_v \sim 10^{-3}$, though its volume filling fraction stays low, explaining the &quot;misty&quot; appearance of observed outflows. Together, these results link small-scale cloud-wind interactions to galaxy-scale feedback, and we discuss their implications for interpreting observations and for modelling multiphase galactic winds in larger-scale simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AREPO-RSG: Aspherical Circumstellar Material and Winds from Pulsating Dusty Red Supergiants in Global 3D Radiation Hydrodynamic Simulations</a><span class="id">[2510.14875]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations have revealed a surprisingly large fraction of hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) interacting with dense confined circumstellar material (CSM), whose origin is heavily debated. Exploiting our recent implementation of a sophisticated radiation transport scheme in the moving-mesh code AREPO, we perform full-sphere 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of red supergiant envelopes. For $10\, M_\odot$ and $20\, M_\odot$ core-carbon-burning stars, we find that large-amplitude radial pulsations lift the surface material of density $10^{-14}$-$10^{-12}\; \mathrm{g\; cm^{-3}}$ to the circumstellar environment up to $3\times10^{14}$ cm, consistent with the inferred density for the interacting SN 2013fs. There, radiation acts on dust to drive highly anisotropic outflows of $10^{-6}$-$10^{-5}\, M_\odot\, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. The total CSM masses for both simulations are $\sim 0.01\, M_\odot$. Due to convection, the CSM density structure has order-of-magnitude angular variations, dominated by large-scale asymmetries. We suggest that (1) the CSM around the progenitor is bound material instead of a widely-assumed steady wind, (2) highly aspherical CSM is common and can be created by surface convection rather than only from binary interactions, and (3) 3D effects need to be incorporated in 1D SN modeling, potentially via effective clumping. Based on our simulations, we propose a 1D analytical CSM model to be directly used for SN observable modeling. We predict that progenitor pulsations (seen in SN 2023ixf) and highly-confined CSM (seen in SN 2013fs) should be common among most hydrogen-rich SNe. This can be tested with progenitor monitoring using Rubin Observatory and near-future high-cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT and UVEX.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-wavelength analysis of the progenitor of GRB 230307A via Bayesian model comparison</a><span class="id">[2510.14879]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRB 230307A is one of the brightest long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) ever detected, yet its progenitor remains uncertain due to the variety of plausible astrophysical scenarios.

Additionally, we explore three distinct central engine models powering the kilonova associated with the BNS: radioactive decay of $r$-process nuclei in a two-component ejecta model, a magnetar-driven model including magnetic dipole spin-down, and a combined model of magnetar spin-down with ${}^{56}$Ni radioactive decay. We perform Bayesian multi-wavelength light-curve analyses using physically motivated models and priors, and evaluate model performance through Bayes factors and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) scores. Our results show a statistical preference for a BNS or NS–WD progenitor producing a kilonova powered by a magnetar and ${}^{56}$Ni decay, characterized by a ${}^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim4\times10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ and an ejecta mass of $0.06\,M_{\odot}$.

Traditional techniques rely heavily on the visual expectation that GC streams are dynamically cold and thin.

Lensed gravitational waves in particular allow for unparalleled sensitivity to small scale structures within the lenses, due to the precise time resolution in combination with the continuous monitoring of the entire sky. In this work, we show two distinct ways of using strongly lensed gravitational waves to identify the presence of dark matter subhalos: \emph{i)} through higher order caustics generating high relative magnification ($\mu_r &gt; 2$), short time delay image pairs that break the caustic universality relations of single dark matter halos, which occur for $\sim 1-10$ percent of strongly lensed events in our cold dark matter models, and \emph{ii)} through the presence of more than three highly magnified images, which occur for $\sim 0.01-1$ percent of the same simulated events. We find that these results are highly sensitive to the concentrations of subhalos in our simulations, and more mildly to their number densities. The presence of low-mass subhalos increases the probability of observing wave-optics lensing in lensed gravitational waves, which is studied by solving the diffraction integral with the stationary phase approximation, as well as numerically. We also report distinct quantitative and qualitative differences in the distributions of relative magnifications and time delays for subhalo populations with increased number densities or concentrations.

At the simplest level, we distinguish centres, bars, spiral arms, interarm and discs without strong spirals. Slightly more sophisticated masks include rings and lenses, publicly released but not explicitly used in this paper. We examine trends using PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) intensity maps and tracers of star formation. The interarm regions and discs without strong spirals dominate in area, whereas molecular gas and star formation are quite evenly distributed among the five basic environments. We reproduce the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation with a slope compatible with unity within the uncertainties, without significant slope differences among environments. In contrast to early studies, we find that bars are not always deserts devoid of gas and star formation, but instead they show large diversity. Similarly, spiral arms do not account for most of the gas and star formation in disc galaxies, and they do not have shorter depletion times than the interarm regions. Spiral arms accumulate gas and star formation, without systematically boosting the star formation efficiency. Centres harbour remarkably high surface densities and on average shorter depletion times than other environments. Centres of barred galaxies show higher surface densities and wider distributions compared to the outer disc; yet, depletion times are similar to unbarred galaxies, suggesting highly intermittent periods of star formation when bars episodically drive gas inflow, without enhancing the central star formation efficiency permanently. In conclusion, we provide quantitative evidence that stellar structures in galaxies strongly affect the organisation of molecular gas and star formation, but their impact on star formation efficiency is more subtle.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments in EAGLE: lifetimes and longevity of misaligned galaxies</a><span class="id">[2412.03707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dominant processes by which galaxies replenish their cold gas reservoirs remain disputed, especially in massive galaxies. Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments offer an opportunity to study these replenishment processes. However, observed distributions of these misalignments conflict with current models of gas replenishment in early-type galaxies (ETGs), with longer relaxation timescales suggested as a possible solution. We use the EAGLE simulation to explore the relaxation of unstable misaligned gas in galaxies with masses of $M_{*}\geqslant \mathrm{10^{9.5}}$ M$_\odot$ between $0&lt;z&lt;1$. We extract misalignments from formation to relaxation providing a sample of $\sim3200$ relaxations. We find relaxation timescales tend to be short-duration, with median lifetimes of $\sim0.5$ Gyr, though with a notable population of unstable misalignments lasting $\gtrsim1$ Gyr. Relaxation time distributions show a log-linear relationship, with $\approx20$ per cent of unstable misalignments persisting for $\gtrsim3$ torquing times. Long-lived unstable misalignments are predominantly found in galaxies with higher stellar masses, lower star-forming gas fractions, higher ongoing gas inflow, and which reside in the centres of dense environments. Mergers only cause $\approx10$ per cent of unstable misalignments among galaxies at $z&lt;0.35$, and $\approx21$ per cent at $0.35&lt;z&lt;1.0$ in EAGLE. We conclude that, at least in EAGLE, unstable kinematic misalignments are not predominantly driven by gas-rich minor mergers at any redshift probed. Additionally, processes that significantly extend relaxation times are not dominant in the galaxy population. Instead, we see a diverse formation pathway for misalignments such as through hot halo cooling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do tides play a role in the determination of the pre-stellar core mass function?</a><span class="id">[2501.07436]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent studies have examined the role of tides in the star formation process. They suggest, notably, that the tides determine the characteristic mass of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by preventing the collapse of density fluctuations that would become gravitationally unstable in the absence of the tidal field generated by a neighboring central mass. However, most of these studies consider the tidal collapse condition as a 1D process or use a scalar virial condition and thus neglect the anisotropy of the tidal field and its compressive effects. In the present paper, we consider a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the envelope of a central core. This perturbation is subject to a tidal field generated by the central core. We study its evolution taking dynamical effects and the anisotropy of the tides into account. Based on the general tensorial virial equations, we determine a new collapse condition that takes these mechanisms into account. We identify two regimes: (i) a weak tidal regime in which the dynamics of the perturbation is only slightly modified by the action of the tides and (ii) a strong tidal regime in which the density threshold for collapse can potentially be increased due to the combined effects of the tides and the rotational support generated by the tidal synchronization of the perturbation with the orbital motion. In the case of a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the vicinity of a first Larson core, we show that the density threshold above which the perturbation collapses is increased only for low-mass perturbations (less than 2.7 solar mass) and only by at most a factor of 1.5. We conclude that tides likely do not play a major role in the process of star formation or in the determination of the characteristic mass of the IMF. We propose an alternative explanation for the observed value of the characteristic mass of the IMF.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14705" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disturbed cold gas in galaxy and structure formation</a><span class="id">[2502.14705]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cold and cool gas (T $\leq 10^4$ K) in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and its interaction with galaxies remain poorly understood. Simulations predict that cold gas flows into galaxies through cosmic filaments, determining the disk formation and galaxy evolution. The cold gas accretion modes in the CGM and their dependence on dark matter halo mass and redshift remain puzzling. Resolving the kiloparsec-scale kinematics and dynamics of cold gas interacting with the disk, dust, and metals in different environments is particularly lacking at z &gt; 2. Here we report two disturbed cold gas structures traced by ultra-strong MgII absorbers (rest-frame equivalent width Wr &gt; 2 Å) exhibiting high kinematic velocities (&gt; 500 km/s) and their environments at z   4.9 and z   2.6. Observations were conducted with VLT/MUSE, JWST/NIRCam, and ALMA to detect Lya and nebular emission lines, as well as dust continuum emission in the vicinity of these two absorbing gas structures. We identify two Lya emitters associated with a strong MgII absorber pair separated by  1000 km/s at z  4.87. The pair exhibits relative differences in metallicity, dust content, and ionization states, suggesting internal metal and dust exchange within the ultra-large cold gas structure. For the strong MgII absorber at z = 2.5652, we detect a dusty star-forming galaxy at a projected distance of $D = 38$ kpc. This galaxy exhibits prominent HeI, [SIII], and Paschen$\gamma$ lines, along with significant dust continuum. It has a star formation rate of   121 +/- 33 $M_{\odot}$/yr and likely harbors a rotating disk. These findings tentatively suggest that cold gas at high redshifts plays a critical role in driving disk formation and actively participates in the transfer of metals and dust within the overdense regions of the CGM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17088" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Where are the Population III star relics in the simulated Milky Way analogues?</a><span class="id">[2502.17088]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using 6 Milky Way analogues with two different numerical resolutions from the Auriga simulation, we investigate the total mass, spatial distribution and kinematics of the Population III star relics in the Milky Way analogues at $z=0$. These relics (primarily second generation stars) formed over a wide redshift range, from about $z=22$ to $z=4$, with an average formation redshift of $z \sim 10.0$, and comprise about $2\times10^{-5}$ of the entire galactic stellar population. The disk and bulge components host only a small fraction of these relics, contributing less than $12$ percent in total. The stellar halo, in particular the outer stellar halo of which galactic radius $r&gt;30$ kpc, hosts the largest fraction (about 46 percent on average), with an average of one relic star for per $4,000$ to $10,000$ stars, making it a promising region for observational searches. Additionally, around $18$ percent of the Population III star relics are found in satellite galaxies, with smaller and older satellite galaxies tending to contain a higher proportion of these stars. Thus, low-mass and early-formed satellite galaxies are also ideal targets for finding such relics, although some satellite galaxies may lack them entirely. The spatial distribution and kinematics of these stars show good numerical convergence across different simulation resolutions. Our results provide valuable guidance for searches of the Population III star relics and offer insights for interpreting findings from ongoing and future stellar archaeology surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19942" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detecting wide binaries using machine learning algorithms</a><span class="id">[2506.19942]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a machine learning (ML) framework for the detection of wide binary star systems using Gaia DR3 data.

According to current models, misaligned gas is expected to lose angular momentum and relax into the galactic plane on timescales of $\sim0.1$ Gyr, driving gas toward the central regions of the galaxy. Recent observational studies have found a higher incidence of active galactic nuclei in misaligned galaxies. We use the EAGLE simulation to explore the connection between stellar-gas misalignments and enhanced central black hole (BH) activity between $0&lt;z&lt;1$. We use a sample of $\sim5600$ galaxies with a stellar mass of $M_{*}\geqslant \mathrm{10^{9.5}}$ M$_\odot$ that feature long-lived stellar-gas alignment, counter-rotation, and unstable misalignments (non-coplanarity). Over time windows of $0.5$ Gyr, we find that galaxies experiencing an unstable misalignment have systematically enhanced BH growth during relaxation. Galaxies with long-term counter-rotation show little difference in BH growth compared to aligned galaxies. We suggest that this enhanced BH growth is driven by loss of angular momentum in unstable misaligned gas discs which is able to drive gas inward toward the vicinity of the BH. At $z\approx0.1$, we find a greater incidence of overmassive BHs in galaxies that have spent a greater fraction of time with unstable stellar-gas kinematic misalignments over the preceding $\approx2$ Gyr compared to control samples of aligned galaxies. In agreement with observations, we conclude that BH activity is enhanced in misaligned systems in EAGLE and suggest that the presence of overmassive BHs may be indicative of a past stellar-gas kinematic misalignment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights for Early Massive Black Hole Growth from JWST Detection of the [Ne v] λ3427 Emission Line</a><span class="id">[2507.10681]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the narrow [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 emission line detected in the recently published JWST spectra of two galaxies, at z = 6.9 and 5.6, to study the key properties of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in their centers. Using a new empirical scaling linking the [Ne v] line emission with AGN accretion-driven (continuum) emission, derived from a highly complete low-redshift AGN sample, we show that the [Ne v] emission in the two z &gt; 5 galaxies implies total (bolometric) AGN luminosities of order L_bol (4-8)x10^45 erg/s. Assuming that the radiation emitted from these systems is Eddington limited, the (minimal) black hole masses are of order M_BH&gt;10^7 M_sun. Combined with the published stellar masses of the galaxies, estimated from dedicated fitting of their spectral energy distributions, the implied BH-to-stellar mass ratios are of order M_BH/M_host 0.1-1. This is considerably higher than what is found in the local Universe, but is consistent with the general trend seen in some other z &gt; 5 AGN. Given the intrinsic weakness of the [Ne v] line and the nature of the [Ne v]-to-L_bol scaling, any (rare) detection of the [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 line at z &gt; 5 would translate to similarly high AGN luminosities and SMBH masses, thus providing a unique observational path for studying luminous AGN well into the epoch of reionization, including obscured sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The X-ray$-$UV Luminosity Relation of eROSITA Quasars</a><span class="id">[2508.00732]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The non-linear relation between the UV and X-ray luminosity in quasars has been studied for decades.

We present the properties of the sources collected in the eROSITA early data release (eFEDS) and those resulting from the first six months of eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1). We focus on the subset of quasars bright enough in the optical/UV band to avoid an ”Eddington bias” towards X-ray brighter-than-average spectral energy distributions. The final samples include 1,248 and 519 sources for eFEDS and eRASS1, up to redshift $z\approx3$ and $z\approx1.5$, respectively. We found that the X-ray$-$UV luminosity relation shows no significant evolution with redshift, and its slope is in perfect agreement with previous compilations of quasar samples. The intrinsic dispersion of the relation is about 0.2 dex, which is small enough for possible cosmological applications. However, the limited redshift range and statistics of the current samples do not allow us to obtain significant cosmological constraints yet. We show how this is going to change with the future releases of the eROSITA data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAP1-B is the First Observed System Consistent with Theoretical Predictions for Population III Stars</a><span class="id">[2508.03842]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, Nakajima et al. (2025) presented James Webb Space Telescope observations of the $z=6.6$ Population III (Pop III) candidate LAP1-B, which is gravitationally lensed by galaxy cluster MACS J0416. We argue that this is the first object to agree with three key theoretical predictions for Pop III stars: (1) formation in extremely low-metallicity halos with virial temperatures ranging from $T_{\rm vir}\sim 10^3-10^4~{\rm K}$, (2) a top-heavy initial mass function, and (3) formation of low-mass clusters with ${\sim}{\rm a ~few}\times 1000~M_\odot$ in massive Pop III stars. LAP1-B is consistent with recently formed Pop III stars hosted in a $\sim 5\times 10^7~M_\odot$ dark matter halo, some of which have enriched their surrounding gas either with supernovae or stellar winds. We use the semi-analytic model of Visbal et al. (2020) to predict the abundance of Pop III clusters observable at the high magnification provided by the foreground galaxy cluster MACS J0416. Using fiducial parameters unmodified from previous work, we expect about one observable Pop III galaxy similar to LAP1-B in the range $z=6-7$. At earlier times, the intrinsic abundance is higher, but Pop III systems would not have been detected because of their increased luminosity distance and lower mass dark matter halos, which would host fewer stars. Thus, we find that LAP1-B was found at the redshift theoretically expected, given current observable limits, despite the fact that most Pop III systems form much earlier.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NGC 2392 and NGC 4361: Spectroscopic Diagnostics of Planetary Nebula Evolution</a><span class="id">[2508.11202]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The study presents a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the planetary nebulae (PNe) NGC 2392 and NGC 4361 using optical spectra obtained from the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) and mid-infrared spectra from archival \textit{Spitzer} IRS data.

Elemental abundances of key species, including He, O, N, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar, were determined for both nebulae, offering insights into their nucleosynthesis history and evolutionary status. High-resolution HST and Pan-STARRS imaging further elucidate the morphological structures of the nebulae. NGC 2392 exhibits a well-defined double-shell structure and moderate excitation characteristics, while NGC 4361 displays a diffuse elliptical morphology with high-excitation conditions and a notably low nitrogen content. The observed line spectra and derived abundances point toward distinct progenitor histories for the two PNe, with NGC 2392 originating from a younger, intermediate-mass progenitor, while NGC 4361 traces an older, metal-poor Population II star.

In contrast, blue central galaxies typically exhibit almost no alignment signal, owing to a stronger internal misalignment with their halo. We investigated how the internal alignment between the principal axes of the stellar and dark matter components evolves over time as a function of the total mass of central galaxies at z=0. In particular, we aim to understand why disk-dominated, blue central galaxies often show weak or absent alignment signals with the galaxy distribution in their group and in the larger-scale cosmic structure. We used data from the IllustrisTNG300-1 run and selected a sample of bright central galaxies at z=0. We computed the principal axes of the stellar and dark matter components, along with their angular momenta, to obtain the various alignment angles analyzed in this study. Also, we used the merger trees to determine the number of major mergers between z=20 and z=0, and to track their shapes along their main branch. We examined secondary dependencies of the galaxy-halo alignment on properties such as color and merger history. We analyzed how shape alignments relate to the dynamical coupling between the angular momentum directions of the stellar and dark matter components. The results show that massive centrals tend to align with the shape of their inner halo, and they are typically red and have undergone numerous mergers. Lower-mass red centrals, and those that have experienced many mergers exhibit the strongest evolution toward alignment. Blue centrals, in contrast, are more strongly influenced by the link between the stellar and dark matter angular momenta, such that they evolve toward either alignment or misalignment with both the shape and angular momentum of the inner halo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03221" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inferring Stellar Densities with Flexible Models I: The Distribution of RR Lyrae in the Milky Way with $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3</a><span class="id">[2510.03221]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the formation and evolutionary history of the Milky Way requires detailed mapping of its stellar components, which preserve fossil records of the Galaxy's assembly through cosmic time. RR Lyrae stars are particularly well-suited for this endeavor, as they are old, standard candle variables that probe the Galaxy's earliest formation epochs. In this work, we employ a hierarchical Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to characterize the three-dimensional density distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the Milky Way. This approach provides a flexible framework for modeling complex stellar distributions, particularly in the inner Galaxy where the bulge, disk, and halo components overlap. Our analysis reveals that the inner Galaxy is dominated by a distinct prolate stellar population with axis ratio $q$=1.31. Consistent with previous work, we find the halo follows a $r^{-4}$ power-law profile that flattens within 12 kpc of the Galactic center. We also confirm the halo is oblate ($q$=0.70) with a tilt angle of $18^{\circ}$. We report for the first time that this tilt aligns the halo major axis in the direction of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. These results establish GMMs as an effective and flexible tool for modeling Galactic structure and provide new constraints on the distribution of old stars in the inner Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHILES X: Molecular and atomic gas at intermediate redshift</a><span class="id">[2510.07966]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present ALMA CO observations of 14 HI-detected galaxies from the CHILES survey found in a cosmic over-density at z 0.12.

While the HI-detected parent sample spans a range of stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR), and environments, we only directly detect CO in the highest stellar mass galaxies, log(M_*/M_Sun)&gt;10.0, with SFRs greater than  2 M_Sun/yr. The detected CO has the kinematic signature of a rotating disk, consistent with the HI. We stack the CO non-detections and find a mean H_2 mass of log(M_H2/M_Sun) = 8.46 in galaxies with a mean stellar mass of log(M_*/M_Sun) = 9.35. In addition to high stellar masses and SFRs, the systems detected in CO are spatially larger, have redder overall colors, and exhibit broader (stacked) line widths. The CO emission is spatially coincident with both the highest stellar mass surface density and star forming region of the galaxies, as revealed by the 1.4 GHz continuum emission. We interpret the redder colors as the molecular gas being coincident with dusty regions of obscured star formation. The 14 HI detections show a range of morphologies, but the HI reservoir is always more extended than the CO. Finally, we compare with samples in the literature and find mild evidence for evolution in the molecular gas reservoir and H_2-to-HI gas ratio with redshift in HI flux-limited samples. We show that the scatter in the HI, and HI-to-stellar mass ratio is too great to conclusively measure evolution below z=0.2, and is even extremely difficult below z=0.4. Detections from CHILES are likely to be the only individual galaxies detected in HI between 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.23 for the foreseeable future due to the severity of satellite radio frequency interference, and its preferential impact on short baselines which dominate contemporary HI surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using gravitational lensing to probe for bright quintessential galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization</a><span class="id">[2510.12097]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the properties of the first generation of galaxies is an ongoing challenge in observational astrophysics. While advances in deep field observation have led to the identification of large numbers of galaxies within the Epoch of Reionization, there are very few observed galaxies at this range that are sufficiently bright for high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. To this end, we analyse HST and ground-based photometry of five candidate strongly lensed galaxies, all projected behind the cores of massive clusters and with similarly red optical-NIR colors. All are characterized by a drop-off in their spectra between the near-infrared and optical wavelengths, corresponding to a Lyman-break that sets a lower bound on their redshifts. Using the open-source SED modeling software Prospector, we characterize two of these galaxies as high-z (z $\sim$ 6.5-7) while the other three are low-z (z $\sim$ 2) despite all five having similar apparent magnitudes at the observed wavelengths. We demonstrate that for the brightest dropout candidates we can distinguish high-z galaxies from red or dusty low-z galaxies using limited photometric data. The bright sources enable deep constraints on the dropout color which, in combination with flat continua measured in redder bands, require high-z solutions when searching the parameter space.

The classical swing-amplification theory can qualitatively describe the spontaneous bar instability of stellar disks. Still, it cannot quantify the bar formation process or explain why some disk galaxies do not have a bar. Recent studies found that the bar formation timescale depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction of the host galaxy (dubbed as &quot;Fujii relation&quot;), but they only explored a limited parameter space, where the physical effects of Toomre $Q$ (local disk stability parameter) and disk scale height of the host galaxies are not fully explored. In this work, we check the robustness of the Fujii relation in a higher-dimensional parameter space of disk mass fraction, Toomre $Q$, and scale height. We find that the Fujii relation holds for disk galaxies with physically reasonable Toomre $Q$ and scale height. Furthermore, the bar formation timescale also approximately linearly depends on both Toomre $Q$ and scale height, with a more prolonged bar formation in a hotter or thicker disk. We propose an empirical relation to combine the dependency of the bar formation timescale on the three parameters. Based on the empirical relation and recent observations, we estimate that the bar formation timescale in pure stellar disks ranges from $0.20_{-0.06}^{+0.09}~\mathrm{Gyr}$ to $12.20_{-2.80}^{+3.37}~\mathrm{Gyr}$ or even significantly beyond the Hubble timescale in some extreme cases.</p></div></details></article>

For CMB lensing convergence auto statistics, we compare the angular power spectra ($C_\ell$'s) to the wavelet scattering transform (WST) coefficients. For CMB lensing convergence $\times$ galaxy weak lensing convergence statistics, we compare the cross angular power spectra to wavelet phase harmonics (WPH). This work also serves as the first application of WST and WPH to these probes. For CMB lensing convergence, we find that WST and $C_\ell$'s yield similar constraints in forecasts for the $\textit{Simons}$ Observatory and the South Pole Telescope. However, WST gives a tighter constraint on $\sigma_8$ by a factor of $1.7$ for $\textit{Planck}$ data. When CMB lensing convergence is crossed with galaxy weak lensing convergence projected from $\textit{Euclid}$ Data Release 2 (DR2), we find that WPH outperforms cross-$C_\ell$'s by factors between $2.4$ and $3.8$ for individual parameter constraints. To compare these different summary statistics we develop a novel learned binning approach. This method compresses summary statistics while maintaining interpretability. We find this leads to improved constraints compared to more naive binning schemes for $C_\ell$'s, WST, and most significantly WPH. By learning the binning and measuring constraints on distinct data sets, our method is robust to overfitting by construction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamic SBI: Round-free Sequential Simulation-Based Inference with Adaptive Datasets</a><span class="id">[2510.13997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Simulation-based inference (SBI) is emerging as a new statistical paradigm for addressing complex scientific inference problems. By leveraging the representational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most informative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI methods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process towards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically implemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network training alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well suited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are commonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing model fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas of sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable manner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed during inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training proceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations incompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to round-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly reduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI achieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while maintaining inference performance. We further validate our framework on two challenging astrophysical inference tasks: characterising the stochastic gravitational wave background and analysing strong gravitational lensing systems. Overall, this work presents a flexible and efficient new paradigm for sequential SBI.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14102" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extracting latent representations from X-ray spectra.

Machine learning methods can extract compact and informative representations of data from large datasets. The Chandra Source Catalog (CSC) provides a rich archive of X-ray spectral data, which remains largely underexplored in this context. This work aims to develop a compact and physically meaningful representation of Chandra X-ray spectra using deep learning. To verify that the learned representation captures relevant information, we evaluate it through classification, regression, and interpretability analyses. We use a transformer-based autoencoder to compress X-ray spectra. The input spectra, drawn from the CSC, include only high-significance detections. Astrophysical source types and physical summary statistics are compiled from external catalogs. We evaluate the learned representation in terms of spectral reconstruction accuracy, clustering performance on 8 known astrophysical source classes, and correlation with physical quantities such as hardness ratios and hydrogen column density ($N_H$). The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with 8 latent variables. Clustering in the latent space yields a balanced classification accuracy of $\sim$40% across the 8 source classes, increasing to $\sim$69% when restricted to AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects exclusively. Moreover, latent features correlate with non-linear combinations of spectral fluxes, suggesting that the compressed representation encodes physically relevant information. The proposed autoencoder-based pipeline is a powerful tool for the representation and interpretation of X-ray spectra, providing a compact latent space that supports both classification and the estimation of physical properties. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning for spectral studies and uncovering new patterns in X-ray data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14178" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarisation Performance of Offset Phase Antennas: A Study for FARSIDE</a><span class="id">[2510.14178]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Several radio telescopes have been planned or proposed to be deployed on the Lunar farside in the coming years. These will observe the unexplored ultra-long wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum from the lunar farside's unique radio-quiet and ionosphere-free environment. One such lunar radio array is the NASA-funded concept - the Farside Array for Radio Science Investigations of the Dark Ages and Exoplanets (FARSIDE). FARSIDE will operate over 100 kHz to 40 MHz with 128 spatially non-co-located orthogonal pairs of antenna nodes distributed over a 12 X 12 km area in a four-arm spiral configuration. Being on the lunar farside, this radio interferometer will be deployed by tele-operated rovers. The rover deployment mode could lead to a phase offset between each of the two orthogonally polarised antenna elements in the array, which are typically co-located. In this paper, we quantify the effects of such antenna phase offsets on the polarisation response and imaging performance of the lunar radio array. Modelling and analysing the FARSIDE dipole beams with and without offset, we find the latter leads to additional leakages into Stokes U and V corresponding to Muller matrix terms of M2(0,1,2,3) and M3(0,1,2,3). Using a custom simulation pipeline to incorporate all four Stokes beams of spatially co-located and non-co-located dipoles, we produce visibilities and simulated images for the GLEAM (GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA) sky model through the FARSIDE array. We find that for a pure Stokes I input sky, the output image maximum Stokes V/I flux ratio for the offset case has increased to 2.5% versus 0.05% for the co-located case. The additional Stokes V needs to be corrected since the detection of Electron Cyclotron Maser (ECM) emissions from exoplanets requires high-fidelity Stokes V measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hierarchical Simulation-Based Inference of Supernova Power Sources and their Physical Properties</a><span class="id">[2510.14202]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Time domain surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are projected to annually discover millions of astronomical transients. This and complementary programs demand fast, automated methods to constrain the physical properties of the most interesting objects for spectroscopic follow up. Traditional approaches to likelihood-based inference are computationally expensive and ignore the multi-component energy sources powering astrophysical phenomena. In this work, we present a hierarchical simulation-based inference model for multi-band light curves that 1) identifies the energy sources powering an event of interest, 2) infers the physical properties of each subclass, and 3) separates physical anomalies in the learned embedding space. Our architecture consists of a transformer-based light curve summarizer coupled to a flow-matching regression module and a categorical classifier for the physical components. We train and test our model on $\sim$150k synthetic light curves generated with $\texttt{MOSFiT}$. Our network achieves a 90% classification accuracy at identifying energy sources, yields well-calibrated posteriors for all active components, and detects rare anomalies such as tidal disruption events (TDEs) through the learned latent space. This work demonstrates a scalable joint framework for population studies of known transients and the discovery of novel populations in the era of Rubin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design and Performance of the SPT-SLIM Receiver Cryostat</a><span class="id">[2510.14219]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The South Pole Telescope Shirokoff Line Intensity Mapper (SPT-SLIM) is a millimeter-wavelength line-intensity mapping experiment, which was deployed on the South Pole Telescope (SPT) during the 2024-2025 Austral summer season.

However, no unambiguous detection of an exoplanet has yet been demonstrated using optics with apertures smaller than 60 mm. Here, we investigated the detectability of exoplanet transits using the telescopic Optical Navigation Camera (ONC-T) onboard the Hayabusa2 spacecraft, which has an effective aperture of only 15 mm. We conducted transit observations of the hot Jupiters WASP-189 b and MASCARA-1 b, collecting data for ten and four events, respectively. The transit signal was detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 13 for WASP-189 b and 8 for MASCARA-1 b for each event. Stacking all events improved the SNR to 40 and 16, respectively. The transit mid-times of each event were measured with a precision of 6 minutes and were consistent with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data to within 2 minutes. The planet-to-star radius ratio was determined with an absolute precision of 0.004 (6% relative) and agreed with TESS results to within 0.002 (3% relative). The recent ONC-T and TESS data enabled an update to the planetary ephemerides. We report a 4 sigma discrepancy between the updated orbital period of MASCARA-1 b and previously reported values. ONC-T sets a new record for the smallest-aperture instrument to detect an exoplanet transit from space, advancing the frontier of exoplanet science with miniature instrumentation. Our results suggest that optics as small as ONC-T may be capable of detecting transiting long-period Jupiters: a population that remains underrepresented in current surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Precision Photometry with a scientific CMOS Camera: I Lab Testing of the Marana camera</a><span class="id">[2510.14484]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scientific CMOS cameras are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern observational astronomy. We assess the ability of CMOS image sensors technology to perform high-precision photometry with a detailed laboratory characterization of the Marana 4.2BV-11 CMOS camera. We characterise the camera in the Fastest Frame Rate (FFR) and High Dynamic Range (HDR) modes. Our evaluation includes read noise, dark current, photo response and dark signal non-uniformities, quantum efficiency and window transmittance. The read noise is found to be 1.577 e$^-$ for the FFR mode. For the HDR mode the read noise floor is measured to be 1.571 e$^-$ for signal levels below approximately 1800 e$^-$. The bias level shows dark signal non-uniformities with values of 0.318 e$^-$ and 0.232 e$^-$ for FFR and HDR mode, respectively. Pixel well capacity reached 2366 e$^-$pix$^{-1}$ for the FFR mode and 69026 e$^-$pix$^{-1}$ with a dynamic range of 93 dB for the HDR mode. The camera demonstrates good linearity, yielding linearity errors of 0.099 \% for FFR mode and 0.122 \% for HDR mode. The uniformity across the image arrays show a photo response non-uniformity of 0.294 \% for the FFR mode and 0.131 \% for the HDR mode. The dark current displays a noticeable glow pattern, resulting in mean dark current levels of $1.674\pm0.011$ \eps for the FFR mode and $1.617\pm0.008$ \eps for the HDR mode at a constant temperature of -25 $^\circ$C. We measured the quantum efficiency across the visible spectrum, with a peak of of &gt;95 \% at 560 nm. Our tests indicate that the Marana CMOS camera is potentially capable of performing precise photometry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SETI Post-Detection Protocols: Progress Towards a New Version</a><span class="id">[2510.14506]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) SETI Committee has long provided guiding principles for responding to a potential detection of a SETI signal. The foundational Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence, first formulated in 1989, has been widely recognised by the international scientific community. A supplemental set of draft protocols addressing the possibility of a reply to an extraterrestrial signal was prepared in 1995 by the IAA SETI Permanent Committee, with both documents presented in a position paper to the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in 2000. In keeping with the evolving landscape of SETI research, the IAA Declaration of Principles was streamlined and updated in 2010. Recognising the need for continued adaptation, the IAA SETI Committee established a Task Group in 2022 to re-examine the protocols in light of recent advances in search methodologies, the expansion of international participation in SETI, and the increasing complexity of the global information environment. The Group recognises the living document nature of the protocols, which will require ongoing refinement to remain relevant and effective in a rapidly changing world. A draft revised Declaration of Principles was presented at the IAC 2024 in Milan, and initial feedback was received from the community, particularly members of the IAA SETI Committee. Since then, we have continued to seek broader community input in a structured process, refining the proposed updates based on further discussions and consultations.

Photometric and photo-polarimetric data reveal a coherent modulation at the white dwarf (WD) spin period. TESS confirms periodicities of 1307.517 s (spin) and 11.803 h (orbital). Photopolarimetric and circular spectropolarimetric measurements show circular polarisation reaching  +5%, modulated with the WD spin period, consistent with cyclotron emission from an accreting magnetic pole. Time-resolved optical spectra display prominent Balmer (H$\gamma$, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$) and He\textsc{ii} $\lambda$4686 emission features and additional He\textsc{i} emissions, all exhibiting minimal radial-velocity variations. We detect red-shifted absorption dips adjacent to the He\textsc{ii} and H$\beta$ lines, modulated at the WD spin period; periodogram analysis of the emission lines also yields spin modulation. These observations indicate that the system is a disc-fed, low-inclination IP. The combination of circular polarisation and spin-modulated absorption by infalling accretion curtain material supports this classification. Its comparatively long orbital period among IPs and the detection of polarised emission render 1RXS J080114.6-462324 an appealing candidate for evolutionary studies, potentially offering insight into how magnetic accretion systems evolve toward synchronism at longer orbital periods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope.

We have developed the Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope (AIRBT) to study the dynamic infrared sky at Dome A, Antarctica, taking advantage of the superb infrared observational conditions at this site. AIRBT consists of two identical 15 cm f/3 optical tube assemblies and two cost-effective indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) cameras equipped with J and H filters, respectively. The cameras have 640 x 512 pixels with a size of 15 micrometers, providing a scale of 6.9 arcseconds per pixel and a field of view of 1.22 x 0.97 square degrees. We characterize the performance of the InGaAs cameras, including bias, readout noise, dark current, nonlinearity, and photon transfer curve. Our analysis highlights the distinct behaviors of InGaAs cameras compared with charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The bias and readout noise show temperature dependence, and the noise measured from the photon transfer curves has additional components that increase with exposure time. On-sky tests were conducted in October 2022 including system calibration, limiting depth, and photometric precision. For a single 3-second exposure, we achieved 5-sigma limiting magnitudes of 11.2 mag (Vega system) in J band and 9.7 mag in H band. The best photometric precision reached 20 millimagnitudes at the bright end, which could be further improved to sub-percent levels through image stacking. AIRBT was installed at Dome A in January 2023, and scientific observations began as soon as darkness set in.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resonant Loop Interferometers for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2510.13957]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves at kilohertz and higher frequencies offer a unique probe of the early Universe at temperatures well beyond the reach of the cosmic microwave background, corresponding to energy scales $\gtrsim 10^9$ GeV. Existing detector concepts fall many orders of magnitude short of the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the stochastic background in this regime. We propose a new interferometric architecture based on closed optical loops, in which the gravitational-wave-induced phase shift accumulates coherently over many traversals. This produces sharp, narrowband resonances whose predictable comb structure provides a distinct experimental signature. For square or triangular loops with parameters compatible with the Einstein Telescope infrastructure, and finesse values of order 500, we project sensitivity that approaches and even surpasses the BBN bound up to tens of kilohertz after one year of integration. Such loop interferometers thus open a realistic and distinctive path toward exploring high-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MHDuet : a high-order General Relativistic Radiation MHD code for CPU and GPU architectures</a><span class="id">[2510.13965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present MHDuet, an open source evolution code for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with neutrino transport.

Since the estimator is agnostic to sampling strategy and simply requires posterior samples, it can be applied to compute the evidence using any Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique, including saved down MCMC chains, or any variational inference approach. The learned harmonic mean estimator was recently introduced, where machine learning techniques were developed to learn a suitable internal importance sampling target distribution to solve the issue of exploding variance of the original harmonic mean estimator. In this article we present the use of normalizing flows as the internal machine learning technique within the learned harmonic mean estimator. Normalizing flows can be elegantly coupled with the learned harmonic mean to provide an approach that is more robust, flexible and scalable than the machine learning models considered previously. We perform a series of numerical experiments, applying our method to benchmark problems and to a cosmological example in up to 21 dimensions. We find the learned harmonic mean estimator is in agreement with ground truth values and nested sampling estimates. The open-source harmonic Python package implementing the learned harmonic mean, now with normalizing flows included, is publicly available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics</a><span class="id">[2503.07994]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diffusion models for polarimetric reconstruction of circumstellar environments</a><span class="id">[2510.12853]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we propose an approach combining diffusion models and inverse problems for the reconstruction of circumstellar disk images.

GW data is challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source properties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need for robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the development of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural networks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs simulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then extended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to distinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are evaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing it against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably distinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies above 98\%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind dataset. The remaining merger, characterized by the lowest amplitude, highlights an area for future improvement in model sensitivity. This can potentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, which we are preparing, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes.</p></div></details></article></body>
