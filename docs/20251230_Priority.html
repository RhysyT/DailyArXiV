To reduce cross-dataset systematics, we define the green valley internally using $(g-r)$ percentiles: for galaxies with $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot)&gt;10$, we select the 75th-95th percentiles (SDSS observed-frame fibre colours; simulations rest-frame synthetic colours within 30 kpc). SDSS hosts are linked to the MPA-JHU catalogue for stellar masses and aperture-corrected total SFRs. TNG green-valley centrals are almost entirely quenched, with a sharp pile-up at the imposed SFR floor and median $\log_{10}\mathrm{sSFR}\simeq-14.85$ ($\sim$3.5 dex below SDSS). EAGLE instead produces a broad, continuous distribution with median $\log_{10}\mathrm{sSFR}\simeq-11.71$ and substantial overlap with SDSS, robust to varying the lower percentile between 60 and 90. At fixed mass, TNG yields higher green-valley occupancy fractions (reaching $\gtrsim60$ per cent near $M_\star\sim10^{11}M_\odot$) than EAGLE (20-40 per cent). A simple forward model of nebular line ratios places EAGLE analogues across the star-forming and composite loci in the BPT plane, while TNG analogues concentrate in a LINER-like, low-sSFR regime. We infer that TNG's kinetic mode drives an efficient, near-binary shutdown of star formation, whereas EAGLE's stochastic thermal feedback supports a slower decline more consistent with local AGN hosts. All catalogues and analysis scripts are publicly released.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-Messenger Predictions for T Coronae Borealis: Probing Particle Acceleration in Novae</a><span class="id">[2512.22338]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The MAGIC detection of near-TeV gamma-rays from the 2021 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) has established it as a TeV-scale particle accelerator. However, the underlying production mechanism –\textit{hadronic} versus \textit{leptonic}– remains uncertain due to the non-detection of coincident neutrinos at IceCube. Indeed, the neutrino flux predicted by the hadronic model for RS Oph was below IceCube sensitivity. T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), a nova similar to RS Oph, is anticipated to undergo an outburst soon. Being closer to Earth (0.8 kpc versus 2.45 kpc for RS Oph), T CrB is expected to yield a higher neutrino flux, making the upcoming outburst a once in a lifetime opportunity to test-and potentially detect-nova neutrinos. In this work, we present the first model-based estimates of the hadronic secondary fluxes from T CrB and assess their detectability with gamma-ray (LHAASO, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, H.E.S.S., MACE, and HERD) and neutrino (IceCube and KM3NeT) telescopes. We adopt two proton-acceleration mechanisms: (i) an external shock (ES) driven mechanism at the interaction ($10^{13}$ cm) of nova ejecta and the red giant wind, and (ii) magnetic reconnection (MR) near the white dwarf surface ($10^{9}$ cm). The latter, arising deep inside the nova system, will fully absorb gamma-rays while allowing only neutrinos to escape. This could potentially produce neutrino signals hours before the ES origin photons or neutrinos-a unique temporal delay signature. For our benchmark ES model, gamma-rays are detectable across all facilities, while the neutrino detection prospect is poor. Only a tiny upper part of the ES model parameter space is above IceCube/KM3NeT sensitivity. In contrast, both observatories have significantly better prospects for detecting neutrinos in the MR scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22354" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Water Production of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS from SOHO/SWAN Observations after Perihelion</a><span class="id">[2512.22354]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Solar Wind ANisotropies (SWAN) all-sky hydrogen Lyman-alpha camera on the Solar and Heliosphere Observatory (SOHO) observed the hydrogen coma of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also called C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), beginning on November 6, 2025, 9 days after perihelion. Water production rates were calculated from each image of 3I/ATLAS using the methodology of Mäkinen &amp; Combi (2005, Icarus 177, 217) and fluorescence rates calculated using the daily solar Lyman-alpha fluxes from the LASP database corrected for solar rotation. The method has been used for over 90 comet apparitions (Combi 2022; Combi et al 2019). A water production rate of 3.17 x 10^29 s^-1 was found on November 6 when the comet was at a heliocentric distance of 1.40 au and at a sufficient solar elongation angle. It decreased over time after that, down to 1-2 x 10^28 s^-1 around 40 days post-perihelion (December 8).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interstellar Interloper 3I/ATLAS: Nucleus Size, Photometry in RGB, Af(rho) and Antitail Structure Analysis</a><span class="id">[2512.22365]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) exhibits an unusual, tightly collimated dust feature in the sunward hemisphere which has been widely described as an anti-tail.

Due to randomly triggered accretion events, the lifetime of the retriggered jet is not expected to have any connection to the time of quiescence between jets, yet we show that a correlation between the two quantities may exist, which we interpret as resulting from continued accretion through the quiescent jet phase. Despite continuous accretion, a jet is absent because its presence depends on a non-zero value of black hole spin, but accretion transitions the system from counter-rotation to corotation, and therefore through zero black hole spin where a jet cannot form. The time of jet quiescence depends on how long it takes to spin the black hole up again in corotation, which is longer for lower accretion rates. Once the black hole spin is large enough for a renewed jet, this inner jet will last longer the lower the accretion rate is. Hence, in a continuous accretion scenario, longer quiescent times tend to associate to longer inner jet times. In addition, DDRG jets are of FRII morphology which we show to result from the absence of a tilt in the accretion disk in the transition through zero black hole spin, ensuring the absence of an FRI jet in a way that connects with our understanding of X-shaped radio galaxies. Both correlated timescales as well as sameness in jet morphology offers evidence in favor of our picture.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22566" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starkindler: An Uncertainty Aware Objective for Photometric Redshift Estimation</a><span class="id">[2512.22566]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Photometric Redshift is critical for analyzing astronomical objects, but existing ML methods often overlook the aleatoric uncertainties inherent in observed data. We introduce Starkindler, a novel training objective that explicitly incorporates observational errors into the model's objective function, thereby directly accounting for aleatoric uncertainty. Unlike traditional probabilistic models that focus solely on epistemic uncertainty, Starkindler provides uncertainty estimates that are regularised by aleatoric uncertainty, and is designed to be more interpretable. We train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and compare against the Photometric redshift estimates provided by SDSS. We show improvements in accuracy, calibration and reduction in predicted outlier rate. We also conduct an ablation study which confirms that excluding observational errors significantly degrades model performance, underscoring the importance of accounting for aleatoric uncertainty. Our results suggest that Starkindler not only enhances predictive performance but also provides interpretable uncertainty estimates, making it a robust tool for astronomical data analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for a Stratified Accretion Disk Wind in AGN</a><span class="id">[2512.22617]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present observational evidence supporting the presence of a stratified accretion disk wind in active galactic nuclei (AGN), based on multi-wavelength spectroscopic analysis of broad and narrow emission lines. The diversity in emission line profiles, ionization potentials, and kinematic signatures suggests a structured outflow emerging from the accretion disk, with different zones contributing to specific spectral features. High-ionization lines (e.g., Civ {\lambda}1549) exhibit strong blueshifts and asymmetric profiles indicative of fast, inner winds, while low-ionization lines (e.g., H\b{eta}, Mgii {\lambda} 2800) show more symmetric profiles consistent with predominant emission from slower, denser regions farther out, although exhibiting systematic blueshifts in quasars radiating at high Eddington ratios. The intermediate ionization lines (e.g., Aliii {\lambda}1860) present a situation that is intermediate in terms of shift amplitudes, although in several super-Eddington candidates radial outflow velocity may reach values comparable to the ones of the high ionization lines. These results are consistent with radiatively driven wind models featuring radial stratification. We made preliminary photoionization modeling assuming unabsorbed radiation emitted from the corona and the hotter disk regions emission or absorbed by a layer of gas. Our findings provide new constraints on the geometry and physical conditions of AGN winds, providing clear evidence in favor of stratified wind emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22661" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinematical and Photometric Deconstruction of the UGC 694-IC 412 System: Evidence for a Line-of-Sight Projection</a><span class="id">[2512.22661]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study re-evaluates the previously assumed interaction between the galaxy pair UGC 694 and IC 412 through a combined kinematical and photometric approach. While morphological features such as tidal bridges have been visually identified in past surveys, our quantitative analysis using SDSS DR16 kinematical data reveals a significant radial velocity offset of approximately 8372 km/s. UGC 694 exhibits a heliocentric velocity of 12683 +/- 34 km/s, placing it at a distance of approximately 188 Mpc, whereas IC 412 is located in the foreground at approximately 62 Mpc with a velocity of 4311 +/- 46 km/s. This vast spatial separation of approximately 123.5 Mpc confirms that the perceived proximity is a line-of-sight projection effect rather than a physical gravitational encounter. Furthermore, we utilize differential photometry to analyze the structural asymmetry and color distribution of UGC 694. Our photometric findings suggest that the galaxy's disturbed morphology is not a result of a tidal encounter with IC 412, but likely originates from internal evolutionary processes or minor mergers with undetected companions. This work emphasizes the critical role of multi-wavelength validation in classifying interacting systems to avoid misinterpretation due to projection effects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22685" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lithium abundance and stellar rotation in the Galactic halo and thick disc: Contribution from low-mass giant field stars</a><span class="id">[2512.22685]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The stellar evolution of lithium-rich (Li-rich) giant stars at very low metallicities remains largely unexplored to date. Using two recent large LAMOST catalogues of field, low-mass giant stars (both Li-rich and Li-poor) with metallicities from -4.0 to -1.0, we studied the conditions for Li enrichment and the distribution of stellar rotations in the Galactic halo and thick disc. Due to the scarcity of stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -3.0, only three Li-rich RGB stars are known in this regime. The observational appearance of giants across the horizontal branch (HB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stages (with Li abundances up to 6.15 dex) has been detected for metallicities &gt; -2.5. Among these stars, we detected IR excesses indicative of giant stars losing mass, showing a recent episodic Li-enrichment process related to the Cameron-Fowler mechanism for the formation of new 7Li. Because stars with IR excesses are distributed across most metallicity values, we suggest this mechanism is at work throughout an important part of the Galaxy's evolutionary history. Based on these IR excesses, we identified three Li thresholds: about 1.5 dex for RGB stars, about 0.5 dex for HB stars, and about -0.5 dex for AGB stars, establishing a new criterion to characterise Li-rich giants. We carried out a study of stellar rotations in metal-poor giant stars, revealing that a plateau appears for velocities greater than 40 km/s up to near 90 km/s, with Li abundances from 1.02 to 1.82 dex. Among Li-rich giants with v sin i &gt; 40 km/s, increasing rotation is observed as metallicity decreases from -1.0 to -2.5. The presence of RGB and HB Li-rich giants with rotations up to 90 km/s suggests that stellar models must account for extended 3He reservoir lifetimes as a source of 7Li. The velocity around 40 km/s appears to be a new critical value.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud Properties and Star Formation in M31</a><span class="id">[2512.22698]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a catalogue of 453 molecular clouds in M31 extracted from CO J=1-0 data observed with CARMA using a dendrogram. Our clouds have the mean values of 2.8 km s$^{-1}$, 22.1 pc and 10$^{5.2}$ M$_\odot$ for the velocity dispersion, radius and mass, respectively. The velocity dispersion shows a weak anti-correlation with the galactocentric radius. The clouds in M31 show mean and median values of 2.0 and 1.4, respectively, for their virial parameters, indicating that most of them are gravitationally bound. Our dendrogram analysis identifies 35 sources with multiple velocity components, which we classify as molecular cloud complexes. We study the size-velocity dispersion and size-mass relationships for the clouds in M31, finding the slopes of 0.43$\pm$0.05 and 1.36$\pm$0.06 for the former and the latter, respectively. Our size-velocity dispersion relationship agrees with those of Milky Way (MW) and M31 clouds. The slope of our size-mass relationship is shallower than those in clouds and cloud complexes of the MW. We find offsets between the isosurfaces of the clouds and star formation rate (SFR) peaks in M31, supporting the scenario where the evolutionary state of individual sources plays a role in the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) law at parsec scales. We find a slope of 0.66$\pm$0.07 for the KS law, which is slightly lower than the values of $\sim$0.8 for MW clouds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heavy dark matter in rapidly evolving massive stars</a><span class="id">[2512.22727]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the impact of heavy dark matter (DM) captured in massive stars via scattering(s) with the star constituents. We focus on the first stars and use stellar evolution simulations to track down how DM capture evolves over time from the zero-age main sequence to the late metal-rich stages of stellar evolution. During the early hydrogen-helium-dominated phase, the capture process is well described by scattering with two targets. As a star evolves, metal production leads to the formation of a dense core surrounded by a lighter envelope. The core significantly enhances the capture of ultra-heavy DM; in this case, three distinct nuclear species are required to accurately describe multiple-scattering capture. We use the Eddington inversion method to obtain a realistic DM velocity distribution, better suited when the star is near the center of a halo, than the widely used Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We find that heavy DM would be able to thermalize and achieve capture-annihilation equilibrium within a massive star's lifetime for regions of the parameter space not excluded by direct detection. For non-annihilating DM, because of the high amount of targets available for capture and despite massive stars being short-lived, it would even be possible for DM to achieve self-gravitation and collapse to a black hole, which eventually could swallow the star from within before the expected end of the star's life, for non-excluded regions of the parameter space. Our results highlight the dependence of DM capture on the stellar evolutionary stage, composition, and halo location, demonstrating that accurate modeling of massive stars is essential for constraining heavy DM with primordial stellar populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotation and stability of the circumnuclear gas disk in the Galactic Center potential by the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES)</a><span class="id">[2512.22751]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigated the gravitational potential and mass distribution in the Galactic Center by examining the morphology and kinematics of the circumnuclear gaseous disk revealed by the molecular line data from the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES). We obtain an estimate of the shape of the potential {within the central $\sim 20$ pc} to reproduce the observed properties of the circumnuclear gas disk (CND) by simulating the motion of test particles for various axial ratios and show that the potential is approximately spherical. We construct a rotation curve by applying the terminal velocity method to the position-velocity diagrams, and calculate the mass distribution in the Galactic Center. The distribution of mass density is found to be of cusp type, approximated by $\rho_{\rm mass} \sim 1.56\times 10^5(R/1 {\rm pc})^{-1.9}~M_{\odot} {\rm pc}^{-3}$, where $R$ is the distance from the nucleus. We discuss the tidal effect caused by the gravitational potential that produces the rotation curve and show that the gas disk is stable against self-gravitational contraction within a critical radius of $ R_{\rm T}\sim 14 ~(\rho_{\rm gas}/10^5 {\rm H_2~cm^{-3}})^{-1/2}~{\rm pc}$. This suggests suppression of star formation and a top-heavy IMF in the circmunuclear region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Empirical Law to Reproduce the Galaxy Rotation Curves</a><span class="id">[2512.23008]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Profiles of galaxy's rotation velocity (rotation curves) remain unexpectedly flat at large distances, where visible matter alone should make the rotation speed decrease with radius. The usual explanation requires large amounts of unseen dark matter. Here, we introduce an empirical law in which spacetime itself appears to store additional energy when distorted by baryonic matter. The baryonic potential $\Phi_b$ made by the baryonic energy density $\rho_b$ generates an additional energy density $\rho_s = \mu_s \Phi_b^2 / c^4$, leading to a Poisson equation for the total potential $\Phi_{\rm tot}$, \[ \nabla^2\Phi_{\rm tot} = 4\pi G\,\rho_b /c^2 + 4\pi G\,\mu_s\,\Phi_b^2 / c^6. \] When assuming $\mu_s = K M_b^{-3/2}$ with a parameter $K$, we applied this equation to 91 galaxies from the SPARC database. The model reproduced quite well both the inner rise and outer flat regions of the observed rotation curves using the observed baryonic mass profiles only. The $K$ values for the 91 galaxies were found to be concentrated within a narrow range. These results suggest that dark matter is directly connected to the baryonic gravitational potential. A theoretical interpretation of the empirical law is also discussed, in which a relation between the additional energy and the cosmological constant is implied.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finding Quasars behind the Galactic Plane. IV. Candidate Selection from Chandra with Random Forest</a><span class="id">[2512.23060]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quasar samples remain severely incomplete at low Galactic latitudes because of strong extinction and source confusion. We conduct a systematic search for quasars behind the Galactic plane using X-ray sources from the Chandra Source Catalog (CSC 2.1), combined with optical data from Gaia DR3 and mid-infrared data from CatWISE2020. Using spectroscopically confirmed quasars and stars from data sets including DESI, SDSS, and LAMOST, we apply a Random Forest classifier to identify quasar candidates, with stellar contaminants suppressed using Gaia proper-motion constraints. Photometric redshifts are estimated for the candidates using a Random Forest regression model. Applying this framework to previously unclassified CSC sources, we identify 6286 quasar candidates, including 863 Galactic Plane Quasar (GPQ) candidates at |b|&lt;20°, of which 514 are high-confidence candidates. Relative to the previously known GPQ sample, our selected GPQs reach fainter optical and X-ray fluxes, improving sensitivity to low-flux GPQs. In addition, both the GPQ candidates and known GPQs display harder X-ray spectra than the all-sky quasar sample, consistent with increased absorption through the Galactic plane. Pilot spectroscopy confirms two high-confidence GPQ candidates as quasars at spectroscopic redshifts of z=1.2582 and z=1.1313, and further spectroscopic follow-up of the GPQ sample is underway. This work substantially improves the census of GPQs and provides a valuable target sample for future spectroscopic follow-up, enabling the use of GPQs to refine the reference frames for astrometry and probe the Milky Way interstellar and circumgalactic media with the absorption features of GPQs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23157" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program.

Through detailed effective volume and completeness analysis for each source, we construct the H$\alpha$ LF in two redshift bins. Thanks to the sensitivity of NIRISS WFSS and gravitational lensing magnification, our sample reaches intrinsic H$\alpha$ luminosities $\sim$10 times deeper than previous grism surveys, down to $L_{\rm H\alpha}\sim10^{40.5}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ at $z\sim1.3$ and $L_{\rm H\alpha}\sim10^{40.9}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ at $z\sim2.0$ with completeness larger than 0.8, corresponding to star formation rates of 0.4 and 1.0 $M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, respectively. We robustly constrain the faint-end slope of the H$\alpha$ luminosity function to be $-1.50^{+0.14}_{-0.08}$ at $z\sim1.3$ and $-1.60^{+0.17}_{-0.09}$ at $z\sim2.0$ after considering the cosmic variance of $\sim 20\%$, consistent with previous estimations. The emission-line samples presented here will enable further detailed studies of galaxy properties including metallicities. We find a negligible contribution from bright active galactic nuclei in our sample. We estimate integrated cosmic star formation rate densities of $0.097^{+0.015}_{-0.016}~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}$ at $z\sim1.3$ and $0.129^{+0.025}_{-0.030}~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}$ at $z\sim2.0$.

We introduce this survey by reporting the discovery of J1244-LyC1, a strong Lyman continuum (LyC) leaker at $z = 2.39$, exhibiting clear merger signatures. J1244-LyC1 has a highly significant ($10\sigma$) LyC detection, corresponding to an absolute escape fraction of $f_{\mathrm{esc}} \! =\!36\%\pm4\%$ ($1\sigma$). The LyC emission is spatially resolved into multiple peaks that coincide with the system's disturbed morphology, confirming genuine multi-site LyC leakage. With a stellar mass of $10^{10.2}{M_\odot}$, J1244-LyC1 is both the first confirmed high-redshift LyC-leaking merger and the most massive LyC emitter known to date. We interpret J1244-LyC1 as a merger-driven starburst system in which tidal interactions have disrupted the interstellar medium, creating multiple low-column-density pathways that facilitate LyC escape. This discovery provides the first direct evidence of spatially resolved LyC escape in a merging system, offering new insight into the potential role of major mergers in driving the cosmic reionization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dependence of the Extinction Coefficient on Reddening for Galactic Cepheids</a><span class="id">[2512.23311]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cepheids are fundamental distance indicators, playing a crucial role not only in the cosmic distance ladder but also in mapping the structure, kinematics, and extinction properties of the Milky Way. Using high-precision photometry and parallaxes from $Gaia$, we identify a significant anti-correlation between the $G$-band extinction coefficient and reddening for Galactic Cepheids, quantified as $R_G = 1.921 \pm 0.060 - (0.107 \pm 0.022)\,E(G_{\mathrm{BP}} - G_{\mathrm{RP}})$. We propose that this anti-correlation is partly driven by the pronounced non-linear effects inherent to the broad $Gaia$ bands, while the remaining part arise from the $R_V$ variations caused by diverse interstellar medium. Adopting a fixed $R_G$ would not only lead to an overestimation of the metallicity dependence of Cepheid luminosities, but also systematically underestimate the distances to highly reddened Cepheids. Moreover, the strong reddening dependence of $R_G$ makes Wesenheit function based on it unsuitable for highly reddened Cepheids, since the definition of Wesenheit magnitudes requires a fixed extinction coefficient. In contrast, infrared-based distances, being less affected by non-linear effects and insensitive to $R_V$, provide the most reliable Cepheid distances at present. This work emphasizes the importance of accurately determining $R_V$ for Galactic Cepheids and accounting for non-linear effects in distance measurements, particularly in the optical bands.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23384" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiO emission in the filamentary Infrared Dark Cloud G035.39-00.33: An ALMA view</a><span class="id">[2512.23384]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Filamentary infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are believed to represent the initial conditions for massive star and cluster formation. We investigate the IRDC G035.39-00.33 using SiO, H13CO+, CH3OH, and CS emission observed with ALMA at 3.5\arcsec\ resolution (0.05 pc). The SiO emission traces shock activity within the cloud, providing insights into current star formation and cloud formation mechanisms. We identify several regions with broad SiO emission clearly associated with outflows, pinpointing the locations of ongoing star formation across the cloud. The ALMA images also reveal a series of spatially extended SiO emission spots with narrow line profiles, aligned along an arc-like path that is also seen in CS and CH3OH emission. While the broad SiO emission is mainly associated with the main cloud filament, as seen in visual extinction, the narrow SiO arch is located at the edge of the cloud, far from the identified sites of star formation activity. The presence of these arc-like morphologies suggests that large-scale shocks may have compressed the gas in the surroundings of the G035.39-00.33 cloud, shaping its filamentary structure. By inspecting the large-scale radio continuum emission around G035.39-00.33, we find that this IRDC is part of a larger star-forming complex where the densest and coolest material appears at the interacting regions between a Supernova Remnant (SNR) and an expanding HII region. In particular, we hypothesize that this IRDC may be spatially coincident with the ionized expanding gas associated with the previously identified SNR G35.6-0.4. We suggest that collisions between giant molecular clouds and expanding gas flows from interacting SNRs and HII regions may be responsible for the observed arc-like structures. Such shock compressions could play an important role in the formation of IRDCs and in the potential triggering of star formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Systematic Errors in Cross-Identification of Binary Stars in Gaia</a><span class="id">[2512.23451]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using Gaia DR3 data, binary star catalogs have been created containing information on a total of more than 2.6 million pairs. This increases by more than an order of magnitude the ensemble of binary stars with known characteristics, which previously numbered about 140 thousand pairs. To perform statistical analysis of the complete ensemble of binary stars, including both previously known and newly discovered pairs, cross-identification by coordinates was carried out between the most complete pre-Gaia publication compilative binary star catalog ILB and data from binary star catalogs based on Gaia DR3 results. An analysis of the results of this identification was performed, showing the dependence of its characteristics both on the data from the source catalogs and on coordinates. It is shown that in dense stellar fields, particularly in the Galactic disk, an increase in the fraction of false positive identifications can be expected. At the same time, for systems with large proper motion, there is a high probability of a false negative outcome. Possible modifications to the identification method are proposed to reduce the role of the described systematic errors and increase the reliability of its results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23452" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detections of Compact Radio Continuum toward Methanol Maser Rings Using the VLA</a><span class="id">[2512.23452]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-mass protostars are deeply embedded in dust inside their natal cores and are not easily detectable.

In this work, we investigate the impact of spherically symmetric dark-matter distributions on black hole geometry, geodesic structure, and ringdown phenomenology. Modeling the surrounding matter through Einstein clusters, we construct self-consistent spacetimes for three widely used density profiles - the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), and Jaffe models - and examine how their near-horizon behavior modifies the location and stability of circular timelike and null geodesics, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and light rings. In the low-compactness regime, we derive analytical expressions showing that environmental effects generically shift the ISCO inward and the principal light ring outward, leading to parametric deviations in their associated orbital frequencies and Lyapunov exponents. At higher compactness, we explore the emergence of additional light rings, marginally stable orbits, and secondary horizons, identifying the regions of parameter space in which these ultracompact configurations arise. Using time-domain evolutions of scalar perturbations, we demonstrate how such structures can imprint characteristic signatures on the ringdown signal, including long-lived trapped modes and echo-like modulations associated with multiple potential barriers. Our results provide a unified framework for assessing environmental effects around black holes and highlight the importance of matter-induced corrections for interpreting upcoming electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04683" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Cosmic Reionization History with JWST: Gunn-Peterson and Ly$α$ Damping Wing Absorption at $4.5 &lt; z &lt; 13$</a><span class="id">[2504.04683]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a statistical analysis of Ly$\alpha$ absorption using 581 galaxies at $z=4.5$–13 observed with multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy programs, including JADES, UNCOVER, CEERS, and GO/DDT. We carefully construct composite spectra binned by redshift with homogeneous UV properties (UV magnitudes, UV slopes, and Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths) and identify significant Ly$\alpha$ forest signals in galaxies at $z\sim5$–6, which diminish toward higher redshifts. We also find UV continuum breaks at rest-frame 1216 Å that soften beyond $z\gtrsim6$, confirming the effects of cosmic reionization through a self-consistent transition from Gunn-Peterson to Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption in galaxies. Fair comparisons of composite spectra with matched UV magnitudes and slopes across redshift reveal that UV-faint galaxies clearly show stronger Ly$\alpha$ absorption than UV-bright galaxies towards high redshift, providing insights into the topological evolution of reionization. We estimate Ly$\alpha$ transmission at the Gunn-Peterson trough and Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption by comparing the galaxy spectra to low-$z$ ($z\sim2$-5) galaxy templates that include galactic and circumgalactic absorption and Ly$\alpha$ emission. Using these measurements together with reionization simulations, we derive volume average neutral hydrogen fractions of $\langle x_{\rm HI} \rangle$ = ${0.00}^{+0.12}_{-0.00}$, ${0.25}^{+0.10}_{-0.20}$, ${0.65}^{+0.27}_{-0.35}$, ${1.00}^{+0.00}_{-0.20}$, and ${1.00}^{+0.00}_{-0.40}$ at $z\sim5$, 6, 7, 9, and 10, respectively. These values broadly align with a reionization history characterized by a rapid transition around $z\sim7$–8, consistent with Ly$\alpha$ emitter observations. While the physical driver of this rapid reionization remains unclear, it may involve the emergence of hidden AGN populations and/or the onset of Lyman-continuum escape from galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A joint JWST and HST view of Omega Centauri: Multiple stellar populations and their kinematics</a><span class="id">[2506.21187]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We combine F115W and F277W images collected with the Near Infrared Camera of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with multi-band, multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of Omega Centauri to investigate its multiple stellar populations and internal kinematics. Our study focuses on a region spanning $\sim$0.9 to $\sim$2.3 half-light radii from the cluster center, largely unexplored by HST and JWST. Using chromosome maps, we identify the principal populations along the upper main sequence and among M-dwarfs, distinguishing lower-stream (LS) stars, chemically akin to first-generation globular cluster stars with similar metallicities, and upper-stream (US) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but oxygen-poor. Both streams also host subpopulations with varying metallicities. We find radially anisotropic motions, with US stars exhibiting significantly stronger anisotropy than LS stars. Subdividing the US into extreme and intermediate light-element populations reveals a gradient in anisotropy, with intermediate stars lying between the LS and extreme US populations. However, metal-rich and metal-poor stars within each stream show moderate kinematic differences. The LS stars show higher angular momentum and dispersion compared to US stars, and also exhibit stronger systemic rotation and tangential proper-motion skewness, further highlighting their kinematic divergence. Finally, leveraging a mass range of $\sim$0.15 - 0.7 solar masses, we detect a low degree of energy equipartition for all cluster stars, which decreases with radial distance from the cluster center.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15898" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Generative Model for Disentangling Galaxy Photometric Parameters</a><span class="id">[2507.15898]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ongoing and future photometric surveys will produce unprecedented volumes of galaxy images, necessitating robust, efficient methods for deriving galaxy morphological parameters at scale.

Our CAE is trained on a suite of realistic mock galaxy images generated via GalSim, encompassing a broad range of galaxy types, photometric parameters (e.g., flux, half-light radius, Sersic index, ellipticity), and observational conditions. By encoding each galaxy image into a low-dimensional latent representation conditioned on key parameters, our model effectively recovers these morphological features in a disentangled manner, while also reconstructing the original image.

Compressibility of the turbulent velocity field (i.e., finite Mach number effects) does not affect the contributions to the $\alpha$ tensor caused by the joint effect of inhomogeneity of turbulence and a large-scale shear. The isotropic part of the $\alpha$ tensor is independent of the exponent of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum. There is also an additional contribution to the effective pumping velocity of the mean magnetic field that is proportional to the product of the fluid density gradient and the divergence of the mean fluid velocity caused, e.g., by collapsing (or expanding) astrophysical clouds. Applications of these effects to protoplanetary discs, proto-galactic and proto-stellar clouds are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VLA FRAMEx.

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). All of the 25 sources analyzed here have previously been observed with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to probe their subparsec projected physical scales, but detected emission has only been measured for 12 of the sources at $C$ band (4.4 GHz), despite expectations. We determined that coronal emission is unlikely to be a dominant emission mechanism for the sources not detected by the VLBA, and the emission measured with the VLA is likely produced beyond parsec spatial scales. We also explore potential radiation mechanisms for the circumnuclear radio emission that is produced beyond the observable  parsec physical scales probed with the VLBA but within the $\leq30-110$ parsec spatial scales observed with the VLA. From an energetics perspective, we find that all targets have extranuclear radio emission that is compatible with AGN winds, assuming a maximum of 10% of the bolometric output can supply the mechanical energy observed. We also find that the excess emission is likely too strong for star formation alone when compared to results from optical spectroscopy, but may contribute in smaller capacities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12465" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optically thick winds of very massive stars suppress intermediate-mass black hole formation</a><span class="id">[2510.12465]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are the link between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.

In addition, we measure spatially integrated quantities (such as global gas metallicity), test different star formation rate indicators, and quantify the presence of H$\alpha$ halos. Our targeted galaxies are relatively metal rich (10-70% solar), complementary to JWST samples at lower stellar mass, and there is broad agreement between different star formation indicators.

Here, we demonstrate that the offset between galaxies and clusters arises naturally from cosmic time evolution. Using the evolving BTFR derived from the Nexus Paradigm of quantum gravity, we show that the normalization of the relation evolves as an exponential function of cosmic time., while the slope remains fixed at $\sim 4$. This provides a simple and predictive framework in which both galaxies and clusters obey the same universal scaling law, with their apparent offset reflecting their different formation epochs.

The correlation is absent in SIMBA (r = +0.01, p = 0.09), which employs a torque-limited black hole accretion model rather than the Bondi-based prescription used by the other simulations. Both TNG and EAGLE exhibit a mass-dependent sign transition: the correlation is negative or null at log(M200/Msun) &lt; 11.5 but strongly positive at higher masses. We interpret this pattern as reflecting the coupling between Bondi accretion rates and central gas density structure: halos with higher concentration have denser cores, enabling more efficient black hole growth at fixed halo mass. The absence of the correlation in torque-limited models supports this interpretation. These results suggest that halo concentration may be a fundamental parameter governing black hole-galaxy coevolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A systematic study on the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon emission features of nearby galaxies using AKARI near-IR spectra</a><span class="id">[2512.21674]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interstellar hydrocarbon dust containing aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is believed to be processed by various factors including UV radiation fields and mechanical shocks in the galactic environments. We systematically investigate the processing of hydrocarbon dust, especially the likely causes for the variations of the luminosity ratio of aliphatic to aromatic hydrocarbon emission features, using the near-infrared (IR) spectral features at wavelengths 3.3 um and 3.4-3.6 um observed with AKARI/IRC. We analyzed 243 near-IR spectra of 240 star-forming (U)LIRGs (the total IR luminosity, $L_\rm{IR}&gt;10^{11}\ L_\odot$), 119 spectra of 105 star-forming IRGs ($10^{10}\ L_\odot&lt;L_\rm{IR}&lt;10^{11}\ L_\odot$), and 94 spectra of 65 sub-IRGs ($L_\rm{IR}&lt;10^{10}\ L_\odot$), in addition to 232 spectra of 36 Galactic HII regions as a reference sample. We performed near-IR spectral model fitting to estimate the luminosities of the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon features and the HI recombination line Br$\rm{\alpha}$. The result indicates that the luminosity ratios of the aliphatic to the aromatic hydrocarbons ($L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$) in the sample galaxies show considerably large variations, compared to those in the Galactic HII regions, $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$ systematically decreasing with $L_\rm{IR}$ and $L_\rm{Br\alpha}$. We find that (sub-)IRGs with continuum colors bluer at 4 um tend to have higher $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$, which is likely to reflect the intrinsic nature of PAHs outside the HII region where the PAHs remain non-processed by strong UV radiation fields. We also find that some ULIRGs with continuum colors redder at 4 um show extremely low $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$, which is likely to be caused by blending aliphatic emission and absorption features due to the presence of an obscured galactic nucleus in merger systems.</p></div></details></article>

In this article, we present two augmentations of a stacking pipeline, both aiming to refine the sensitivity of the stack by assuming a specific observed signal shape in 2D spatial axes or 3D spatial and spectral axes, as well as stacking on source coordinates more precise than the resolution of the LIM data cube. We test these methods on a series of simplistic and complex simulations mimicking observations with the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder. We find that these fitting methods provide up to a 25% advantage in detection significance over the original stack method in realistic COMAP-like simulations. We also find that the optimal fitting profile, given our CO line model and galaxy model, is larger than the 5' width of the COMAP beam and takes on a Lorentzian shape in the spectral dimension. Our findings suggest a nuanced dependence of the optimal profile size and shape on the LIM signal itself, including redshift-space clustering and fingers-of-God effects that depend on the tracer luminosity function and bias.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Space AI: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Space to Improve Life on Earth</a><span class="id">[2512.22399]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming domains from healthcare and agriculture to finance and industry.

The method factorizes a spectroscopic time series into principal spectra and time-dependent kernels, enabling simultaneous recovery of both. In Fourier space, each inverse-wavelength slice is decomposed by singular value decomposition, and radial velocity shifts are inferred from phase differences between epochs. In the high-SNR regime, this provides a linearized and statistically tractable estimate of differential velocities. The method is validated on synthetic and SOAP simulations and applied to EXPRES observations of HD 34411 and $\tau$ Ceti, recovering coherent signals and reaching the instrumental precision limit of  30 cm/s. Apart from p-mode modulation, the residuals show no significant long-term correlations and allow the detection of signals with semi-amplitudes down to  50 cm/s with $\lesssim10$ cm/s uncertainty. The framework thus enables extreme-precision radial velocity measurements in the presence of spectral variability, representing a step toward detecting and characterizing Earth-like planets around solar-type stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two birds with one stone: simultaneous realization of both Lunar Coordinate Time and lunar geoid time by a single orbital clock</a><span class="id">[2512.23098]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Among options for definition of the lunar reference time, the option taking Lunar Coordinate Time (O1) has its simplicity but cannot be realized by any clock without steering, while another option adopting the lunar geoid (selenoid) proper time (O2) has its convenience for users on the lunar surface but would bring a new scaling of spatial coordinates and mass parameter of the Moon. Aims. We propose a ”time aligned orbit” that the readings of an ideal clock in this orbit could equal to the selenoid proper time in O2 and these readings could be converted to Lunar Coordinate Time in O1 by a known linear transformation. Methods. We show that there exist the time aligned orbit around the Moon with its semi-major axis of about 1.5 lunar radius slightly depending on its inclination. We conduct a set of numerical simulations to assess to what extent a clock on these orbits could realize O2 in a more realistic lunar environment. Results. We find that the proper time in our simulations would desynchronize from the selenoid proper time up to 190 ns after a year with a frequency offset of 6E-15, which is solely 3.75% of the frequency difference in O2 caused by the lunar surface topography. These numbers might be further reduced to 13 ns and 4E-16, if we could account for the deviation of the mean orbits in our simulations from the nominal ones. Conclusions. One might simultaneously realize O1 and O2 by deployment of a single clock in the time aligned orbit. This approach also has its scalability for other terrestrial planets beyond the Earth-Moon system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Machine Learning Models Systematically Underestimate Extreme Values II: How to Fix It with LatentNN</a><span class="id">[2512.23138]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Attenuation bias – the systematic underestimation of regression coefficients due to measurement errors in input variables – affects astronomical data-driven models. For linear regression, this problem was solved by treating the true input values as latent variables to be estimated alongside model parameters. In this paper, we show that neural networks suffer from the same attenuation bias and that the latent variable solution generalizes directly to neural networks. We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data. This bias correction is most effective when measurement errors are less than roughly half the intrinsic data range; in the regime of very low signal-to-noise and few informative features.

The high astrometric precision of the CSST Survey Camera for faint objects enables the detection of a number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs via differential astrometry in its optical survey. In this paper, we predict the number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around stars and brown dwarfs detectable with CSST astrometry. We generate synthetic samples of CSST stellar and substellar sources, and carry out companion injection-recovery simulations in the samples using different occurrence rates for FGK-dwarfs, M-dwarfs, and brown dwarfs. We calculate companion yields based on CSST astrometric precision. Our analysis reveals that over its 10-year mission, the CSST Survey Camera could barely discover giant planets and low-mass BDs around FGK-dwarfs, but is projected to detect 20 - 170 giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs within 300 pc, and 300 - 570 brown dwarf binaries within 600 pc. Therefore, CSST astrometry is likely to significantly increase the current sample of substellar companions around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This sample will deepen our understanding of planet formation and evolution around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lossless compression of simulated radio interferometric visibilities</a><span class="id">[2512.23490]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Processing radio interferometric data often requires storing forward-predicted model data. In direction-dependent calibration, these data may have a volume an order of magnitude larger than the original data. Existing lossy compression techniques work well for observed, noisy data, but cause issues in calibration when applied to forward-predicted model data. Aims. To reduce the volume of forward-predicted model data, we present a lossless compression method called Simulated Signal Compression (Sisco) for noiseless data that integrates seamlessly with existing workflows. We show that Sisco can be combined with baseline-dependent averaging for further size reduction. Methods. Sisco decomposes complex floating-point visibility values and uses polynomial extrapolation in time and frequency to predict values, groups bytes for efficient encoding, and compresses residuals using the Deflate algorithm. We evaluate Sisco on diverse LOFAR, MeerKAT, and MWA datasets with various extrapolation functions. Implemented as an open-source Casacore storage manager, it can directly be used by any observatory that makes use of this format. Results. We find that a combination of linear and quadratic prediction yields optimal compression, reducing noiseless forward-predicted model data to 24% of its original volume on average. Compression varies by dataset, ranging from 13% for smooth data to 38% for less predictable data. For pure noise data, compression achieves just a size of 84% due to the unpredictability of such data. With the current implementation, the achieved compression throughput is with 534 MB/s mostly dominated by I/O on our testing platform, but occupies the processor during compression or decompression. Finally, we discuss the extension to a lossy algorithm.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23530" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sidelobe Modification for an Offset Gregorian Reflector System using a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Equipped Subreflector</a><span class="id">[2512.23530]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In past work, we described the use of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) mounted on the rim of an axisymmetric prime focus-fed reflector to create nulls in the close-in sidelobes. In this paper, we show that similar performance is possible in an offset Gregorian reflector system using a RIS on the rim of the subreflector. Applications include radio astronomy, where offset Gregorian reflectors are common and observations are subject to deleterious levels of interference from satellites entering through sidelobes. We show that an efficient RIS replacing the outer one-third of the subreflector surface, employing passive elements with 1-bit phase-only control, can create a null in the peak of the second sidelobe in the quiescent pattern. This is achieved using a simple unconstrained optimization algorithm to set the states of the RIS elements. The algorithm yields a deep null with just 0.2 dB reduction in main lobe directivity, despite lacking any constraints on main lobe pattern. Compared to our previous approach of mounting the RIS on the rim of the main reflector, the subreflector-based approach demonstrated in this paper requires a much smaller RIS and can implemented in existing systems by replacing the subreflector.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Double to tenfold M-shell photoionization of singly charged lanthanum ions</a><span class="id">[2512.22574]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using the photon-ion merged-beams technique at the PETRA III synchrotron light source, we have measured cross sections for double and up to tenfold photoionization of La$^{+}$ ions by a single photon in the energy range 820–1400 eV, where resonances and thresholds occur that are associated with the excitation or ionization of one $M$-shell electron. These cross sections represent experimental benchmark data for the further development of quantum theoretical methods, which will have to provide the bulk of the atomic data required for the modeling of nonequilibrium plasmas such as kilonovae. In the present work, we have upgraded the Jena Atomic Calculator (JAC) and pushed the state-of-the-art of quantum calculations for heavy many-electron systems to new limits. In particular, we have performed large-scale calculations of the La$^+$ photoabsorption cross section and of the deexcitation cascades, which set in after the initial creation of a $3d$ hole. Our theoretical results largely agree with our experimental findings. However, our theoretical product-ion charge state distributions are somewhat narrower than the experimental ones, which is most probably due to the simplifications necessary to keep the cascade calculations tractable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for Annual Modulation in Combined ANAIS 112 and COSINE 100 Data using Bayesian Model Comparison</a><span class="id">[2512.23191]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform a Bayesian model comparison test between a sinusoidal modulation model and a constant value model using about three years of combined COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112 data.

We find natural log of Bayes factor for the cosine model comapred to the constant value model to be less than 1.15 for the data in both 1-6 keV and 2-6 keV energy intervals.

In this study, we investigate defect formation within NaI crystals and its impact on the dark matter detection signal. Using molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory techniques, we simulate a DM particle collision on an NaI crystal, focusing on the possible defects formation and their structural and electronic properties. Our analysis includes a detailed study of the electronic states associated with the interstitial atoms and vacancies, the energetic cost of defect formation, and the anisotropic threshold displacement energy.

In this work, we adopt the Fisher-matrix method to examine the angular-resolution performance of the newly proposed Crater Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory (CIGO) on the lunar crater rim near the north pole, together with TianQin and LISA, for monochromatic sources in the 0.1-10 Hz band. We find that above 0.1 Hz, CIGO achieves better localization accuracy than the other two space-based missions and dominates the combined detector network's performance, provided that lunar noise mitigation is achieved in the 0.1-2.87 Hz frequency range. We further explore an upgraded Tetrahedron configuration, TCIGO, with a fourth station at the bottom of a crater, which forms a regular tetrahedral constellation on the lunar surface. The result shows that TCIGO yields a five-fold improvement in angular-resolution capability over CIGO and gets better sky coverage across the target frequency band.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Use of GPS Satellites for Beam Calibration of Radio Dish Telescopes</a><span class="id">[2411.06144]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from the first application of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS; e.g., the Global Positioning System, GPS) for radio beam calibration using a commercial GNSS receiver with the Deep Dish Development Array (D3A) at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO). Several GNSS satellites pass through the main and sidelobes of the beam each day, enabling efficient mapping of the 2D beam structure. Due to the high SNR and abundance of GNSS satellites, we find evidence that GNSS can probe several sidelobes of the beam through repeatable measurements of the beam over several days. Over three days of measurements, the smallest observed difference in the primary beam's main lobe was 0.56 dB-Hz. We also compare our results in the sidelobes to simulations and find rough agreement in shape. When scaling the observations and simulations to match in the main lobe power levels, we find deviations in at least one of the first few nulls of approximately 5 dB or less. There is saturation in the main lobe for most satellites, which can likely be mitigated by better attenuation before the receiver input. We compare our work to other satellite systems that have been successful and are likely complementary to this technique. However, GNSS offers key advantages, including continuous transmission, broader frequency coverage relevant to CHORD, SKA-mid, and the DSA-2000, as well as more frequent satellite passes, making it a promising calibration method. These results also motivate further development of this technique for radio astronomy applications.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards an agnostic algorithm for sampling empirical structure models: The case of Uranus and Neptune</a><span class="id">[2512.16995]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an algorithm to efficiently sample the full space of planetary interior density profiles. Our approach uses as few assumptions as possible to pursue an agnostic algorithm. The algorithm avoids the common Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and instead uses an optimisation-based gradient-descent approach designed for computational efficiency. In this work, we use Uranus and Neptune as test cases and obtain empirical models that provide density and pressure profiles consistent with the observed physical properties (total mass, radius, and gravitational moments). We compare our findings to other work and find that while other studies are generally in line with our findings, they do not cover the entire space of solutions faithfully. Furthermore, we present guidance for modellers that construct Uranus or Neptune interior models with a fixed number of layers. We provide a statistical relation between the steepness classifying a density discontinuity and the resulting number of discontinuities to be expected. For example, if one classifies a discontinuity as a density gradient larger than 0.02 kg$\,$m$^{-4}$, then most solutions should have at most one such discontinuity. Finally, we find that discontinuities, if present, are concentrated around a planetary normalised radius of 0.65 for Uranus and 0.7 for Neptune. Our algorithm to efficiently and faithfully investigate the full space of possible interior density profiles can be used to study all planetary objects with gravitational field data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robust and scalable simulation-based inference for gravitational wave signals with gaps</a><span class="id">[2512.18290]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data stream will inevitably contain gaps due to maintenance and environmental disturbances, introducing nonstationarities and spectral leakage that compromise standard frequency-domain likelihood evaluations.

We employ Flow Matching Posterior Estimation (FMPE) conditioned on a learned summary of the data, optimized through an end-to-end training strategy. To address the computational challenges of long-duration signals, we propose a dual-pathway summarizer architecture: a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on the time domain for high precision, and a novel wavelet-based 2D CNN utilizing asymmetric, dilated kernels to achieve scalability for datasets spanning months. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on simulated Galactic Binary-like signals, showing that our joint training approach yields tighter, unbiased posteriors compared to two-stage reconstruction pipelines. Furthermore, we provide the first systematic comparison showing that FMPE offers superior stability and coverage calibration over conventional Normalizing Flows in the presence of severe data artifacts.</p></div></details></article></body>
