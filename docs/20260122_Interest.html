<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The burden of Fundamentality: Metaphysical ambiguities and the issue of Superdeterminism</a><span class="id">[2601.14316]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper we approach the problem of superdeterminism from a novel point of view, highlighting its character as a more metaphysical than scientific proposition. First, we introduce a distinction between two types of superdeterministic theories, naïve (NSD) and metaphysical (MSD), and argue how NSD presents significant epistemic flaws. We show how NSD justifies itself through claims to fundamentality, thus connoting itself as a metaphysical theory rather than a scientific one. We finally illustrate that the most developed MSD model so far, Invariant Set Theory, implicitly proposes a confused form of priority monism. Our paper thus reinforces the thesis that theories should demonstrate rather than assume fundamentality and that it is methodologically flawed for a theory to assume its own fundamentality for the sole purpose of defending against criticisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirac's Dilemma of the Economy of Inheritance: Parental Care, Equality of Opportunity, and Managed Inequality</a><span class="id">[2601.14322]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In a brief reflection on the principles of human society, P. A. M. Dirac articulated a structural tension between two widely affirmed norms: that it is good and natural for parents to improve the prospects of their own children, and that justice requires that all children have equal opportunities in life. These principles, each compelling on its own, cannot be fully realized together. This paper reconstructs Dirac's dilemma, connects it to the dynamics of compounding advantage and inheritance, and situates it within the broader history of political philosophy, including the work of Rawls, Dworkin, Cohen, Brighouse and Swift, Nozick, Murphy and Nagel, and others. The paper argues that attempts to eliminate the resulting injustices entirely risk damaging the non–zero–sum structures that generate general prosperity, and defends a position of &quot;managed inequality&quot;: a robust social floor and real mobility, combined with limits on extreme dynastic accumulation and an explicit acceptance of some residual, but constrained, inherited advantage.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Superluminal Transformations and Indeterminism</a><span class="id">[2601.15263]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quantum theory is widely regarded as fundamentally indeterministic, yet classical frameworks can also exhibit indeterminism once infinite information is abandoned. At the same time, relativity is usually taken to forbid superluminal signalling, yet Lorentz symmetry formally admits superluminal transformations (SpTs). Dragan and Ekert have argued that SpTs entail indeterminism analogous to the quantum one. Here, we derive a no-go theorem from natural assumptions, which can be interpreted as: superluminal transformations (SpTs) and finite information cannot coexist. Any theory accommodating SpTs must therefore allow unbounded information content, leading to a deterministic ontology akin to that of classical theories formulated over the real numbers. Thus, any apparent indeterminism arising from superluminal transformations reflects only probabilities arising from subjective ignorance, unlike the objective nature of probabilities in quantum theory, indicating that the claimed indeterminacy from superluminal extensions is not quantum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidential Reconfiguration as Bayesian Confirmation For Dark Matter in 1974: How Existing Data Become Evidence in New Structures</a><span class="id">[2512.12926]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 1974 papers by Ostriker et al. [1974] and Einasto et al. [1974] are considered by many to be pivotal in establishing the epistemic foundations for the dark matter hypothesis. From a theory confirmation point of view, the circumstances surrounding this pivot are difficult to reconcile with common approaches to epistemic support. First, the papers did not introduce any new observations. Second, they synthesized existing data from two separate contexts to construct a hypothesis under which the joint data became evidentially relevant. Third, this synthesis was motivated in part by non-empirical reasons. The situation excludes both temporal novelty and use novelty because already known data was used in the construction of the hypothesis. Yet, the papers are widely regarded as epistemically transformative. I argue that a Bayesian can model the epistemic significance of the 1974 papers without concession. By recognizing how the papers reconfigured the existing data to bear on a missing mass hypothesis, a novel epistemic aspect emerges. By introducing a shared halo parameterization, they made the previously disjoint data mutually constrained, thereby changing their evidential role. I develop this idea through two concepts - evidential reconfiguration and structural novelty - leveraged through Myrvold's Bayesian account of unification. The result makes Bayesianism faithful to the inferential practices in this significant part of scientific history, explains how the 1974 papers strengthened the evidential case for dark matter, and expands the Bayesian toolbox with a way to treat novel structure as epistemologically salient.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14962" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Improve Portuguese Secondary Education</a><span class="id">[2601.14962]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I share some personal thoughts on the status of Portuguese secondary education in general, and of the physics part thereof in particular, drawn from several decades of experience of organizing training activities for students and school teachers, as well as several hundred visits to secondary schools and similar numbers of interviews of secondary school students (from Portugal and elsewhere). I offer various suggestions for improving and modernising our current system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illustrating Special-Relativity Phenomena via Gaussian Ray Optics</a><span class="id">[2601.15137]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We highlight the correspondence between one-dimensional Lorentz transformations, which relate events observed from two distinct inertial reference frames, and ray transfer transformations in Gaussian optics. Specifically, we identify optical systems whose transfer matrices reproduce the mathematical structure of the Lorentz transformation. Within this framework, we show that fundamental effects of special relativity as time dilatation, length contraction and loss of synchronicity find a direct counterpart in the behavior of light rays deviated by a diverging lens, thereby providing a novel and illustrative optical equivalence of relativistic phenomena. This article is intended for a broad audience of physicists. The correspondence described is general and may interest students with a moderate background in special relativity and optics, as well as teachers in the corresponding fields.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It's Not The Plane – It's The Pilot: A Framework for Cognitive-Activated AI-Augmentation to Avoid the Boiling Frog Problem</a><span class="id">[2601.13812]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems can now reliably solve many standard tasks used in introductory physics courses, producing correct equations, graphs, and explanations. While this capability is often framed as an opportunity for efficiency or personalization, it also poses a subtle ethical and educational risk: students may increasingly submit correct results without engaging in the epistemic practices that define learning this http URL challenge has recently been described as the &quot;boiling frog problem&quot; because we may not fully recognize how rapidly AI capabilities are advancing and fail to respond with commensurate urgency. In this article, we argue that the central challenge of AI in physics education is not cheating or tool selection, but instructional design. Drawing on research on self-regulated learning, cognitive load, multiple representations, and hybrid intelligence, we propose a practical framework for cognitively activated learning activities that structures student activities before, during, and after AI use. Using an example from an introductory kinematics laboratory, we show how AI can be integrated in ways that preserve prediction, interpretation, and evaluation as core learning activities. Rather than treating AI as an answer-generating tool, the framework positions AI as an epistemic partner whose contributions are deliberately bounded and reflected upon.</p></div></details></article></body>
