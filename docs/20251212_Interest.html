We argue that it is difficult to categorise the scalar fields as either a pure aspect of the spacetime structure or a pure form of matter, by focusing on the Jordan vs Einstein frames of these theories. We present and evaluate various interpretational options available, concluding that the spacetime-matter dichotomy becomes untenable in this context. At the same time, the ontological and conceptual category of spacetime can be decoupled from that of gravity, with the latter remaining viable in the context of scalar-tensor theories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09950" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The meaning of &quot;Big Bang&quot;</a><span class="id">[2512.09950]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>What does “Big Bang” actually mean?

The much debated problems of the redshift and the photon propagation in a gravitational field is then considered and applied to the calculation of the speed of light. Many citations are given in direct quotations to avoid any misunderstandings. If the quotations are in German, an English translation is provided. Based on this speed, calculated and measured results are recalled on the deflection of light, with emphasis on the deflection near the Sun. We conclude that the speed of light and the deflection angle can be determined by energy and momentum conservation principles.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opportunities and Challenges in Harnessing Digital Technology for Effective Teaching and Learning</a><span class="id">[2512.10777]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Most of today's educators are in no shortage of digital and online learning technologies available at their fingertips, ranging from Learning Management Systems such as Canvas, Blackboard, or Moodle, online meeting tools, online homework, and tutoring systems, exam proctoring platforms, computer simulations, and even virtual reality/augmented reality technologies. Furthermore, with the rapid development and wide availability of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) services such as ChatGPT, we are just at the beginning of harnessing their potential to transform higher education. Yet, facing the large number of available options provided by cutting-edge technology, an imminent question on the mind of most educators is the following: how should I choose the technologies and integrate them into my teaching process so that they would best support student learning? We contemplate over these types of important and timely questions and share our reflections on evidence-based approaches to harnessing digital learning tools using a Self-regulated Engaged Learning Framework we have employed in our research in physics education that can be valuable for educators in other disciplines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developing and Evaluating a Large Language Model-Based Automated Feedback System Grounded in Evidence-Centered Design for Supporting Physics Problem Solving</a><span class="id">[2512.10785]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Generative AI offers new opportunities for individualized and adaptive learning, particularly through large language model (LLM)-based feedback systems. While LLMs can produce effective feedback for relatively straightforward conceptual tasks, delivering high-quality feedback for tasks that require advanced domain expertise, such as physics problem solving, remains a substantial challenge. This study presents the design of an LLM-based feedback system for physics problem solving grounded in evidence-centered design (ECD) and evaluates its performance within the German Physics Olympiad. Participants assessed the usefulness and accuracy of the generated feedback, which was generally perceived as useful and highly accurate. However, an in-depth analysis revealed that the feedback contained factual errors in 20% of cases; errors that often went unnoticed by the students. We discuss the risks associated with uncritical reliance on LLM-based feedback systems and outline potential directions for generating more adaptive and reliable LLM-based feedback in the future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A DC discharge plasma experiment for undergraduate laboratories</a><span class="id">[2512.10259]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Plasma physics offers a wide range of fundamental phenomena, making it an excellent subject for undergraduate laboratory instruction. In this work, we present the design, construction, and characterization of a DC glow-discharge plasma chamber developed for the junior-level curriculum, a project carried out by two undergraduate students. The apparatus consists of a 1-meter-long quartz tube with a movable electrode, enabling systematic exploration of plasma behavior under varying pressure, voltage, and geometry. Using this platform, we characterized the Paschen breakdown relation and the voltage-current characteristics of the plasma. We then developed Langmuir probes to map spatial distributions of electron temperature and density, and used Boltzmann plot spectroscopy to measure excitation temperatures across different plasma regions. Finally, with custom Helmholtz coils, we demonstrated magnetic focusing of electrons. We performed Runge-Kutta simulations of particle trajectories and analyzed the electron drift velocity by comparing the focal lengths. Overall, this plasma chamber provides a versatile platform for investigating fundamental plasma phenomena and offers potential for future studies, including microwave-plasma interactions and other student-driven investigations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Balancing the Byline: Exploring Gender and Authorship Patterns in Canadian Science Publishing Journals</a><span class="id">[2512.10268]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Canada is internationally recognized for its leadership in science and its commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields. Despite this leadership, limited research has examined gender disparities in scientific publishing within the Canadian context. This study analyzes over 67,000 articles published in 24 Canadian Science Publishing (CSP) journals between 2010 and 2021 to better understand patterns of gender representation. Findings show that women accounted for less than one-third of published authors across CSP journals. Representation varied by discipline, with higher proportions of women in biomedical sciences and lower proportions of women in engineering - trends that mirror broader national and global patterns. Notably, the proportion of women submitting manuscripts closely matched those published, suggesting that broader workforce disparities may play a larger role than publication bias. Women were less likely to be solo authors or to hold prominent authorship positions, such as first or last author - roles typically associated with research leadership and career advancement. These findings point to the need for a two-fold response: continued efforts to address systemic barriers to women's participation in science, and a review of publishing practices to ensure equitable access, recognition, and inclusion for all researchers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12834" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bringing together African &amp; European research communities with an inclusive astronomy conference</a><span class="id">[2411.12834]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on an international scientific conference, where we brought together African and European academic astronomers. This aimed to bridge the gap between those in position of privilege, with ease of access to international events (i.e., the typical experience of academics in Western institutions), with those historically excluded (affecting the majority of African scientists/institutions). We describe how we designed the conference around cutting-edge research problems, but with a parallel focus on building networking and professional relationships. Significant effort went into: (1) ensuring a diversity of participants; (2) practically and financially supporting those who may never have attended an international conference and; (3) creating an inclusive and supportive environment through a careful programme of activities, both before and during the event. Maintaining scientific integrity was a core commitment throughout. We summarise successes, challenges and lessons learnt from organising this conference. We also present feedback obtained from participants immediately after the conference, and a discussion of some longer-term impacts, which we identified around 1 year later. We found an overall achievement of our objectives, and multiple longer-term benefits. With this report we provide some key recommendations for groups, from any research field, who may wish to lead similar initiatives.</p></div></details></article>

Motivated by this, we propose the Eschatian Hypothesis: that the first confirmed detection of an extraterrestrial technological civilization is most likely to be an atypical example, one that is unusually &quot;loud&quot; (i.e., producing an anomalously strong technosignature), and plausibly in a transitory, unstable, or even terminal phase. Using a toy model, we derive conditions under which such loud civilizations dominate detections, finding for example that if a society is loud for only $10^{-6}$ of its lifetime, it must emit ${\gtrsim}1$% of its total observable energy budget during that phase to outrun quieter populations. The hypothesis naturally motivates agnostic anomaly searches in wide-field, multi-channel, continuous surveys as a practical strategy for a first detection of extraterrestrial technology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Techno-Economic Assessment of Wind-Powered Green Hydrogen Production for US Industrial Decarbonization</a><span class="id">[2512.10299]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study evaluates the techno-economic feasibility of supplying industrial thermal loads with green hydrogen produced via water electrolysis using two pathways off-grid systems powered by co-located wind turbines and battery energy storage (BESS), and on-grid systems that procure electricity directly from the wind farm power node and operate electrolysers in response to real-time locational marginal prices (LMPs).The optimization results show that off-grid wind-to-hydrogen configurations in high-resource regions can achieve levelized costs of hydrogen (LCOH) on the order of \$7/kg, driven by high wind capacity factors and optimized BESS sizing that ensures operational continuity .Similarly in, on-grid, price-responsive operation achieves LCOH values of \$0.5/kg, reflecting sensitivity to electricity market volatility. Overall, the results suggest that Midwest wind-rich regions can support competitive green hydrogen production for industrial heat, with grid-connected electrolysers remaining attractive in locations with frequent low LMP periods. This dual-path analysis provides a transparent framework for industrial hydrogen deployment and highlights practical transition strategies for decarbonizing U.S. manufacturing.</p></div></details></article></body>
