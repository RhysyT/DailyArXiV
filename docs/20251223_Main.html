Distributions and Spectra of PeV Cosmic Rays around Microquasars</a><span class="id">[2512.17994]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the standard Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) paradigm, protons are accelerated up to  1 PeV by Galactic sources. While supernova remnants (SNRs) have been traditionally considered as the primary accelerators, recent observations by LHAASO and HAWC have detected very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays exceeding 100 TeV from several microquasars, suggesting that these X-ray binaries can accelerate CRs beyond 1 PeV. We investigate the escape process of CRs from microquasars, focusing on the energy-dependent transport mechanisms. High-energy CRs are likely to have long mean free paths and move ballistically on scales smaller than their mean free path, while lower-energy CRs undergo diffusive propagation. This transition results in a spectral break in the CR distribution around the microquasar. We calculate CR energy spectra within a 10-30 pc radius for various diffusion coefficients and timescales. Our model predicts a spectral break and hardening at E_p  10-100 TeV when the standard diffusion coefficient for the interstellar space is assumed. However, current VHE gamma-ray observations do not show clear spectral breaks, suggesting that the diffusion coefficient may be significantly reduced near microquasars, possibly due to magnetic field amplification by CR-driven turbulence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constrained Brownian-bridge prior for neutron-star equation-of-state inference</a><span class="id">[2512.18044]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We set forth a new method for generating model-agnostic, nonparametric priors for neutron star equation-of-state inference that are stable, causal and thermodynamically consistent by construction. This generalizes Gaussian processes to include global thermodynamic constraints, specifically allowing the inclusion of any number of training points in the form $(\mu, n, p)$ while retaining thermodynamic consistency between them. The method is based on constructing constrained Brownian bridges, whose correlation properties can be tuned at will allowing flexibility between a conservative prior and a theory-informed prior. The method does not require any shooting to obey multiple constraints and provides an efficient and informed way to include both chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics constraints within the same framework.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A recurrent 70-100 minute quasi-periodic pulsation in the intermediate-aged mid-M dwarf GJ 3512</a><span class="id">[2512.18086]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of a {recurrent} quasi-periodic pulsation (QPP) in the late-M dwarf GJ 3512 (M5.5V) using multiple TESS datasets. A strong signal with a period of 70-100 minutes was detected in wavelet analyses of the two-minute cadence light curve from Sector 20. This signal was detected also in observations from Sectors 47 and 60. The QPP persisted for weeks in sector 20 and spanned nearly three years of TESS coverage. There was no significant damping between major flares. This behavior contrasts with that of previously reported stellar QPPs, which are confined to individual flares and decay on timescales of minutes to hours. The oscillation amplitude is at the milli-magnitude level. A pulsation origin is discarded since theoretical instability strips for 100-minute pulsations are restricted to pre-main sequence stars, while GJ 3512 is an intermediate age (2-8 Gyr) main-sequence dwarf. The persistence across independent TESS sectors discards an instrumental artifact origin and points to a likely coronal origin instead, such as oscillatory reconnection or thermal non-equilibrium cycles in large active regions. This represents the first detection of a likely sustained QPP with these characteristics in a late-type star, highlighting the need for further investigation into physical mechanisms behind such variability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18095" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The rotation-magnetism relationship in solar-type stars. Constraining magnetic flux emergence rates</a><span class="id">[2512.18095]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rotation-activity relationship of G-type stars results from surface magnetic fields emerging from the interior. How the magnetic flux and its emergence rate scale with rotation rate are not well understood, both observationally and theoretically. We aim at constraining the emerging magnetic flux as a function of the rotation rate in solar-type stars by numerical simulations compared to empirical constraints set by direct measurements of stellar magnetic fields. We use our Flux Emergence And Transport (FEAT) model for stars with a range of power-law slopes for the dependence of emerging flux on rotation. Complementing this with a heuristic account of the main flux components, we model the resulting mean unsigned field strength as a function of the rotation rate. We compare the results with the Zeeman-intensification measurements and spectropolarimetric data of solar-type stars. Deviations of the model from observations of G stars correlate strongly with stellar metallicity ($r=0.83$) and effective temperature ($r=-0.76$), with a combined coefficient of 0.90, reflecting the dependence of magnetic activity on these two parameters. Correcting for these effects with multilinear regression, we find that magnetic flux emergence rates must scale steeply with rotation power-law exponent of about 1.9) to reproduce observed field strengths, significantly exceeding the estimates in the literature. We also provide correction factors for metallicity and temperature for measurements of early-G-type stellar magnetic fields. Stellar magnetic flux emergence rates scale steeply with rotation, requiring active-region fields to dominate the total surface flux on rapid rotators, whereas small-scale-dynamo fields dominate for slow rotators like the Sun. Metallicity significantly influences the rotation-magnetism relationship, necessitating sample-dependent corrections for accurate stellar dynamo modelling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Double Hot Jupiter Formation through Mirrored ZLK Migration in Binary Star Systems: The Case of WASP-94</a><span class="id">[2512.18108]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To date, only a handful of binary star systems are known with at least one confirmed planet orbiting each star. Such systems, however, offer a unique perspective on the stochasticity intrinsic to planet formation and evolution – particularly in twin binary star systems, which consist of near-equal-mass stars formed contemporaneously in the same birth environment. The WASP-94 system, which includes twin F-type stars, is a striking exemplar of such systems, containing two hot Jupiters: WASP-94 Ab is a transiting, spin-orbit misaligned giant planet with a 4-day orbital period, while WASP-94 Bb is non-transiting and has a tighter 2-day orbital period. In this work, we leverage N-body simulations to show that the current double hot Jupiter configuration of the WASP-94 system can be reproduced through mirrored von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai migration. The upcoming Gaia astrometric data releases offer the potential to search for additional twin planetary systems, including double cold Jupiter systems that may serve as the progenitors for WASP-94-like configurations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Lorentz Variability of Magnetically Dominated Relativistic Outflows</a><span class="id">[2512.18323]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this Letter, we show that magnetized relativistic outflows can exhibit a relativistic effect in which Lorentz transformation maps magnetic field topology into apparent temporal variability in the observer's frame. Using a force-free Beltrami configurations as representative equilibria of magnetically dominated outflows, we demonstrate that Lorentz mapping of stationary helical magnetic field produces quasi-periodic modulation of observable electromagnetic signatures, without invoking intrinsic plasma variability. This effect may be described as an aberration of force-free magnetic fields under Lorentz transformation. The characteristic frequency of the time variability is determined by the helical wave-number of the magnetic field, the viewing angle, and the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet outflow, and scales linearly with $\Gamma$. This establishes a purely kinematic relativistic origin of variability and introduces the concept of magnetic Lorentz seismology: the inference of magnetic field structure in relativistic outflows directly from observed temporal variability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energy-Dependent Shifts of Medium-Scale Anisotropies in Very-High-Energy Cosmic Rays Observed by LHAASO-KM2A</a><span class="id">[2512.18401]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Small deviations from isotropy in the arrival directions of Galactic cosmic rays serve as a unique probe of the local magnetic environment. In this Letter, we report observations of medium-scale anisotropies (MSA) at energies above 10 TeV using the LHAASO-KM2A array. Our analysis identifies four regions of excess and four regions of deficit, each spanning angular scales of approximately ten degrees. Crucially, we detect significant energy-dependent shifts in the centroids of two excess regions: Region B and the newly identified Region $\mathrm{\widetilde{D}}$. We also characterize the energy evolution of the fractional relative intensity across both excess and deficit regions. These findings imply that the observed anisotropies are shaped by the specific realization of the local turbulent magnetic field within the cosmic ray scattering length. Such energy-dependent behaviors impose strict constraints on local turbulence models and cosmic ray propagation theories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18485" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observed Low-Plasma-$β$ Temperature Anisotropy Constraint Driven by $α$-Particle Drift</a><span class="id">[2512.18485]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Some plasma instability thresholds, derived from linear theory, constrain the observed parameters of solar wind velocity distributions, defining boundaries of “allowed” plasma parameters. These thresholds typically account for a single source of free energy, such as temperature anisotropy or a drifting secondary component with some dependence on other system parameters, e.g. the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure, $\beta$. Excursions beyond these thresholds result in the emission of energy, transferred from particles to coherent electromagnetic waves, acting to push the system toward a more stable configuration. In this work, we use linear theory to define parametric limits for a low-$\beta$ plasma that contains a drifting proton beam or helium ($\alpha$)-particle population. A sufficiently fast and dense drifting population triggers an Oblique Drift Instability (ODI). This instability decreases the velocity drift between the thermal proton and secondary populations and prevents $\beta$ from decreasing below a minimum value by heating both the core and drifting populations. Our predictions are of interest for \emph{Parker Solar Probe} observations, as they provide an additional mechanism for perpendicular heating of ions active in the vicinity of \Alfven surface. The ODI also explains the discrepancy between long-standing expectations of measurements of very low-$\beta$ plasmas with very large temperature anisotropies in the near-Sun environment and in situ observations, where $\beta$ is consistently measured above a few percent and the secondary populations drifting faster than the bulk of proton population by no more than approximately one \Alfven velocity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searches for Prompt Low-Frequency Radio Counterparts to Gravitational Wave Event S250206dm with the OVRO-LWA Time Machine</a><span class="id">[2512.18543]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on a search for prompt, low-frequency radio emission from the gravitational-wave (GW) merger S250206dm using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA). Early alerts favored a neutron-star-containing merger, making this a compelling target. Motivated by theoretical predictions of coherent radio bursts from mergers involving a neutron star, we utilized the OVRO-LWA Time Machine system to analyze voltage data recorded around the time of the event. The Time Machine is a two-stage voltage buffer and processing pipeline that continuously buffers raw data from all antennas across the array's nearly full-hemisphere instantaneous field of view, enabling retrospective beamforming, dedispersion, and fast-transient candidate identification. For this event, we analyzed a 30-minute interval beginning 3.5 minutes after the merger, which included two minutes of pre-alert data recovered by the ring buffer. We searched the 50% localization probability region with millisecond time resolution in the 69-86 MHz frequency band. No radio counterpart was detected above a 7-sigma fluence detection threshold of  150 Jy ms. Using Bayesian analysis, we place a 95% confidence upper limit on the source luminosity of L95 = 4 x 10^41 erg s^-1. These constraints start to probe the bright end of the coherent-emission parameter space predicted by jet-ISM shock processes, magnetar and blitzar-like mechanisms, and recent simulation-based scenarios for neutron-star-containing mergers. This study presents the first sensitive, large-area, millisecond-timescale search for prompt low-frequency radio emission from a GW merger with the OVRO-LWA, establishing a framework in which about ten additional events will yield stringent population-level constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harmony of the Spheres: Extension to All Points of an Algorithm for Producing a Density Field with Given Two-, Three-, and Four-Point Correlation Functions</a><span class="id">[2512.18547]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Previous work (Slepian 2024) showed that the Smith-Zaldarriaga (2011) algorithm to realize Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps with any desired harmonic-space bispectrum could be generalized to produce a 3D density field with any desired N-Point Correlation Functions (NPCFs, N = $2, 3, \ldots$) about a particular, specified set of “primary” points. This algorithm assured one of having the correct correlations if measured about these specific centers. Here, we show that this algorithm was more general than initially believed, and can in fact be used to produce a density field on a grid that has the correct, desired NPCFs as measured about \textit{every} point on the grid. This paper should be considered the second in the series, and now completes the quest to generalize the idea of “constrained realization” (Hoffman and Ribak 1991) to higher-order statistics. This algorithm will be of great use for quickly generating density fields both to produce covariance matrices, and test systematics, for current and future 3D large-scale structure surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Euclid, Spherex, and Roman.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detecting stellar flares in the presence of a deterministic trend and stochastic volatility</a><span class="id">[2512.18559]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a new and powerful method to analyze time series to rigorously detect flares in the presence of an irregularly oscillatory baseline, and apply it to stellar light curves observed with TESS. First, we remove the underlying non-stochastic trend using a time-varying amplitude harmonic model. We then model the stochastic component of the light curves in a manner analogous to financial time series, as an ARMA+GARCH process, allowing us to detect and characterize impulsive flares as large deviations inconsistent with the correlation structure in the light curve. We apply the method to exemplar light curves from TIC13955147 (a G5V eruptive variable), TIC269797536 (an M4 high-proper motion star), and TIC441420236 (AU Mic, an active dMe flare star), detecting up to $145$, $460$, and $403$ flares respectively, at rates ranging from ${\approx}0.4$–$8.5$ day$^{-1}$ over different sectors and under different detection thresholds. We detect flares down to amplitudes of $0.03$%, $0.29$%, and $0.007$% of the bolometric luminosity for each star respectively. We model the distributions of flare energies and peak fluxes as power-laws, and find that the solar-like star exhibits values similar to that on the Sun ($\alpha_{E,P}\approx1.85,2.36$), while for the less- and highly-active low-mass stars $\alpha_{E,P}&gt;2$ and $&lt;2$ respectively.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18565" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of Be stars via wind accretion: Case study on Black hole + Be star binaries</a><span class="id">[2512.18565]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Be stars are rapidly rotating main-sequence (MS) stars that play a crucial role in understanding stellar evolution and binary interactions. In this letter, we propose a new formation scenario for black hole (BH) + Be star binaries (hereafter BHBe binaries), where the Be star is produced through the Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLOF) mechanism. Our analysis is based on numerical simulations of the WRLOF process in massive binaries, building upon recent theoretical work. We demonstrate that the WRLOF model can efficiently form BHBe binaries under reasonable assumptions on stellar wind velocities. Using rapid binary population synthesis, we estimate the population of such systems in the Milky Way, predicting approximately $\sim$ {1800-3200} currently existing BHBe binaries originating from the WRLOF channel. These systems are characterized by high eccentricities and exceptionally wide orbits, with typical orbital periods exceeding 1000 days and a peak distribution around $\sim$10000 days. Due to their long orbital separations, these BHBe binaries are promising targets for future detection via astrometric {and interferometric} observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar jet-induced perturbation propagating through coronal loops and in-loop electron beam transport indicated by type II and type N radio bursts</a><span class="id">[2512.18657]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar type II radio bursts are commonly attributed to coronal shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, some metric type II bursts have occasionally been reported to occur in the absence of a CME and to be associated with weak solar activities. This study aims to identify the driver of the coronal shock in this kind of type II event. We investigate a high-frequency metric type II burst with clear band splitting, observed simultaneously by the Chashan Broadband Solar radio spectrograph and the Nançay Radioheliograph. It is associated with a C3.1-class flare and a small-scale jet, but without a detectable CME in the coronagraphs. The type II burst is preceded by multiple type III bursts, one of which exhibits characteristics of a type N burst. The type II burst source is associated with the jet-induced perturbation front propagating through nearby closed loops at a speed of $\sim$880 km s$^{-1}$, rather than the much slower jet front. This suggests that the disturbance initiated by the jet can convert to a shock wave within low Alfvénic coronal loops, providing the necessary conditions for electron acceleration and subsequent radio emission. Our findings offer new insights into the formation mechanism of high-frequency type II bursts associated with weak flares and jets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18690" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photospheric horizontal magnetic field decrease preceding a major solar eruption</a><span class="id">[2512.18690]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Significant photospheric magnetic field changes during major solar eruptions – interpreted as coronal feedback from eruptions to the photosphere – are well-observed. However, analogous short-time scale field changes preceding eruptions are rarely reported. In this study, we present the first detailed analysis of a pre-flare decrease in the photospheric horizontal magnetic field ($B_h$) associated with an X1.8 class flare, using high-cadence vector magnetic field data from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We identify a region of gradual, spatially coherent $B_h$ decrease of about 100 G along the flaring polarity inversion line (PIL) during 30 minutes preceding the flare. This decrease is accompanied by a decrease in the force-free parameter $\alpha_w$, with no significant flux emergence or cancellation observed. After the flare onset, $B_h$ exhibited contrasting behaviors in different sub-regions: a step-like increase near the PIL and a continued decrease in surrounding regions, suggesting that the pre-flare $B_h$ decrease may also have a coronal origin, like its post-flare counterparts. Coronal imaging from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard SDO reveals that the associated erupting filament underwent a slow-rise phase before the flare, whose timing and location closely matches the occurrence of the pre-flare $B_h$ decrease. We propose that the slow-rise of the pre-eruptive filament stretched overlying coronal loops, increasing their verticality and thereby reducing $B_h$ at their photospheric footpoints. The results present the first detailed analysis of a pre-flare $B_h$ decrease and suggest it as a precursor to solar eruptions, causally linked to early filament activation and its impact on the photosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addendum to &quot;Cygnus X-3 as a semi-hidden PeVatron” discussing the LHAASO 2025 data</a><span class="id">[2512.18786]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In a recent work, we have argued that the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-3 can accelerate cosmic rays (CR) beyond PeV energies.

However, statistical methods used for the characterization of variability often rely on stationary time series data, which is not fulfilled for most blazar light curves. We introduce the recurrence plot method for long-term $\gamma$-ray light curves sampled by Fermi-LAT and present our results for the BL Lac object Mkn 421 and the FSRQ PKS 1424-41. Using surrogates to determine the significance of our findings, we conclude that Mkn 421 exhibits more determinism than PKS 1424-41, and that both sources potentially show nonlinearity. However, the latter has to be tested against more advanced surrogates that are able to replicate the nonstationarity of the original light curves. In future work, we will extend our recurrence analysis to a sample of $\sim50$ $\gamma$-ray bright sources to probe the jet dynamics of different blazar classes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nanohertz Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2512.18822]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Evidence of a gravitational wave (GW) signal has emerged in pulsar timing array (PTA) data, opening a new window into the nanoHz GW Universe.

We describe how: (i) An astrophysical nanoHz GWB emerges as the superposition of individual signals from inspiralling massive black-hole binaries (MBHBs); (ii) Environment coupling, eccentricity, and sparse sampling, affect the MBHB signal spectrum and statistical properties, causing great uncertainty in theoretical predictions, but simultaneously offering a handle to discriminate a potential astrophysical origin; (iii) PTA data offers unprecedented opportunities to constrain high-energy physics beyond the standard model, by probing early Universe GWBs, originated during or after inflation; (iv) Different early Universe GWBs, typically created by non-linear and out-of-equilibrium dynamics, can explain the PTA data, as e.g. from inflation scenarios, first order phase transitions, or topological defects; (v) The PTA detection of GWs opens a new window to explore the Universe, with profound implications for astrophysics and particle physics, probing e.g. the equation of state of the early Universe, the origin of the cosmological perturbations, the nature of the dark matter, or whether exotic objects like primordial black holes or cosmic strings exist.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion geometry in neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries during the hard spectral state</a><span class="id">[2512.18839]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the accretion geometry in neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the hard spectral state. It is commonly accepted that, for low mass transfer rates, an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) is present in the inner region. But the observed relativistically broadened emission lines in the reflection spectra clearly indicate the existence of discs near the innermost stable circular orbit $(R_{\rm{ISCO}})$. We investigate the interaction between the coronal flow and the disc in neutron star LMXBs, and find that gas condensation from the dominant, coronal accretion flow to an inner disc is enhanced as compared to that in black hole LMXBs as a consequence of irradiation of the corona by the neutron star surface. Computations show that for low mass transfer rates ($\sim 0.005-0.02$ Eddington rate) a persistent weak disc can coexist with a coronal flow in the innermost region, where a pure ADAF would have been expected. The inner disc extends outwards from $R_{\rm{ISCO}}$ to $\sim 10 R_{\rm{ISCO}}$ for Eddington ratios ($L/L_{\rm{Edd}}$) as low as $\sim 0.002$, covers a larger region for higher Eddington ratios, and eventually connects to the outer disc at $L/L_{\rm{Edd}} \sim 0.02$, thereby transiting to a soft state. We demonstrate that the observationally inferred region of the broad iron lines in the hard-state sources generally lies within the extension of the inner discs predicted by the condensation model. Disappearance of the broad iron lines is predicted at very low luminosities, either caused by very low accretion rates or disc truncation by strong magnetic fields.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18876" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar Vortex Detection With Velocity Field Normalisation: Eliminating False Positives</a><span class="id">[2512.18876]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Small-scale vortices in the solar photosphere play a central role in transporting mass, energy, and momentum into the upper solar atmosphere, yet reliably detecting these structures remains rather challenging. We address this problem by introducing a simple preprocessing step that normalises the velocity field by its magnitude. Our method preserves flow topology while suppressing shear-induced artefacts that lead to spurious detections in non-uniform, high-rotation environments. For validation, we apply this approach to high-resolution Bifrost simulations and evaluate vortex detection using four commonly employed methods: IVD, the $\lambda_2$-criterion, the Q-criterion, and the $\Gamma$ method. We assess which structures exhibit physically consistent rotation by using the $d$-criterion to automatically detect rotational plasma-flow features, which we use as an approximate ground truth. We find that, in the unnormalised field, a substantial fraction of detections made by the first three methods are false positive detections. Normalisation removes most of these. The $\Gamma$ method detects true vortices but misses a large number of vortical flows. The normalisation step yields better-defined and more realistic vortex boundaries. As the $\Gamma$ method underpins most observational analyses, current studies likely capture only a subset of vortical flows. By comparison, the other three methods detect four to five times more vortices after normalisation, suggesting that the true photospheric vortex coverage may be underestimated by a similar factor. Overall, this physically motivated preprocessing step enhances the accuracy and physical realism of vortex detection and offers a practical enhancement for analysing vortical flows in turbulent flows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18882" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on the polarization angle oscillations of the Crab Nebula with the Simons Array and its applications to the search for axion-like particles</a><span class="id">[2512.18882]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a search for polarization oscillation of the Crab Nebula, also known as Tau A, at millimeter wavelengths using observations with the Simons Array, the successor experiment to POLARBEAR. We follow up on previous work by POLARBEAR using 90 GHz band data of the 2023 observing season of the Simons Array to evaluate the variability of Tau A's polarization angle. Tau A is widely used as a polarization angle calibration source in millimeter-wave astronomy, and thus it is necessary to validate the stability. Additionally, an interesting application of the time-resolved polarimetry of Tau A is to search for axion-like particles (ALPs). We do not detect a global signal across the frequencies considered in this analysis and place a median 95% upper bound of polarization oscillation amplitude $A&lt;0.12^{\circ}$ over oscillation frequencies from 3.39 year$^{-1}$ to 1.50 day$^{-1}$. This constrains the ALP-photon coupling at a median 95% upper bound of $g_{a\gamma\gamma}&lt; 3.84\times 10^{-12}\times\left(m_a/10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\right)$ in the mass range from $4.4\times10^{-22}$ to $7.2\times10^{-20}$ eV, assuming the ALP constitutes all of dark matter, its field is a stochastic Gaussian field, and it is the sole source of Tau A's polarization angle oscillation. Additionally, we do not detect signal at the frequencies where 2.5$\sigma$ hints were previously reported by POLARBEAR, but we do not exclude these signals at the 95% confidence level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weak Lensing Mass Calibration of the ACT DR5 Galaxy Clusters with the DES Year 3 Weak Lensing Data</a><span class="id">[2512.18935]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use weak gravitational lensing measurements from Year 3 Dark Energy Survey data to calibrate the masses of 443 galaxy clusters selected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 5 maps of the cosmic microwave background. We incorporate redshift and SZ measurements for individual clusters into a hierarchical model for the stacked lensing signals and perform Bayesian analyses to constrain the hydrostatic mass bias of the clusters. Our treatment of systematic uncertainties includes a prescription for measuring and accounting for the weak lensing boost factor, consideration of a miscentering effect, as well as marginalization over uncertainties in the source galaxy photometric redshift distributions and shear calibration. The resultant constraints on the normalization of the mass-observable relation have a precision of approximately 7\%, with the mean WL halo mass of $M_{\rm 500c} = 5.4 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$. We measure the bias between the true cluster mass and the mass estimated from the SZ signal based on an X-ray–calibrated scaling relation assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, to be $1-b = 0.75^{+0.04}_{-0.06}$ over the full sample. When splitting the clusters into high ($z$=0.43-0.70) and low ($z$=0.15-0.43) redshift bins, we measure $1-b = 0.58^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ and $0.82^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, respectively. When introducing additional freedom in redshift and mass to the hydrostatic bias model, we find that $1-b$ decreases with redshift (with the power law of $-2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.4}$, 99.95\% confidence), consistent with findings from other recent studies, while we do not find any significant trend in mass. We also demonstrate that our result is robust against various systematics. The weak-lensing mass calibration presented in this study will be a useful tool for using the ACT clusters as probes of astrophysics and cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$Ω_1Ω_2$-$Λ$CDM: A promising natural extension of the standard model of cosmology</a><span class="id">[2512.19000]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the $\Omega_1\Omega_2$-$\Lambda$CDM model, in which the total energy density of the universe is expanded in powers of $1+z$. This parameterization recovers the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario and introduces two additional, observationally testable contributions to the dark energy sector, $\Omega_1(1+z)$ and $\Omega_2(1+z)^2$, alongside the cosmological constant. Using Planck CMB and DESI BAO data, we find that this framework is suitable for relaxing the Hubble tension. The Planck CMB data alone allow substantial freedom in late-time dynamics, yielding $H_0 = 75.4^{+3.9}_{-2.3}\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;Mpc^{-1}}$, fully consistent with distance-ladder measurements from the SH0ES collaboration. When DESI BAO data are included in the analysis, the late-time expansion history becomes more tightly anchored, reducing the $H_0$ discrepancy to $\sim 2.5\sigma$ level. This highlights the limited constraining power of currently available low-redshift data measurements, especially in the context of the $\Omega_1\Omega_2$-$\Lambda$CDM model, where dynamical dark energy dominates the background expansion over a relatively large redshift range. The model naturally exhibits a smooth quintessence–phantom transition followed by asymptotic de Sitter behavior of the dark energy equation of state, alters late-time cosmic dynamics, and preserves standard early-universe physics. Overall, our results demonstrate that controlled late-time deviations from $\Lambda$CDM can improve cosmological concordance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Diversity of Pulsar's Frequency-Dependent Circular Polarization</a><span class="id">[2512.19056]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nature of coherent radio emission is still challenging even after more than half a century of pulsar discovery, but it is generally a consensus that single-pulse observations are essential for probing the magnetospheric dynamics, especially with the largest single-dish telescope FAST (Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope). The frequency-dependent circular polarization of single pulses, with high signal-to-noise ratios, is recorded by the FAST, which shows great diversity, and we are trying an effort to understand such circular polarization based on the wave mode coupling in the limiting polarization region, and consequently to constrain the dynamical parameters. By quantitatively comparing models with data using Bayesian analysis, it is found that the plasma multiplicity is approximately between $10^0$ and $10^{2}$, while the Lorentz factor of the particles between $10^{0.5}$ and $10^{2}$.

Using the Si layer of $13M_\odot$ zero-metal progenitor as the initial composition, we calculate the nucleosynthesis by adopting the temperature, density, neutrino flux, and duration of nucleosynthesis as arbitrary parameters and compare the results with the observed abundances ratio of Sc, Ti, and V in very metal-poor (VMP) stars taken from the Stellar Abundances for Galactic Archaeology (SAGA) database. As a result, for the first time, we identify the quantitative requirements on local physical conditions. To reproduce the abundances ratios in the VMP stars, the explosive nucleosynthesis should take place under the neutrino exposure, which is time integration of neutrino flux, of $\sigma_\nu\sim 10^{35}\,\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}}$ and temperature of $2.0\,\mathrm{GK}\leq T \leq 3.2\,\mathrm{GK}$. The dependence on the density and each value of the neutrino flux and the duration of nucleosynthesis is weak. We also discuss whether the quantitative requirements are realized during the explosion. Although the requirements are difficult to be realized in the one-dimensional simulations, the non-monotonic thermal evolution shown in recent three-dimensional simulations may satisfy them. Because the evolution is likely caused by turbulent motion stemming from the initial asphericity of the progenitor, it is important to calculate the long-term three-dimensional supernova explosion of multi-dimensional metal-free progenitor models and follow the nucleosynthesis self-consistently.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Height and Energy Evolution of X-ray Double Sources in a Solar Flare</a><span class="id">[2512.19144]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the standard model, magnetic reconnection at a vertical current sheet above the flare arcade is key to explaining many aspects of solar eruptions. The supra-arcade region is where the vertical current sheet is supposedly located, and X-ray/EUV emission therein reflects underlying energy release and transport processes, therefore providing valuable insight into the structure and evolution of the current sheet. Previous studies have focused primarily on the impulsive phase of flares, but phenomena in the decay phase are also crucial for understanding the complete flaring scenario. In this paper, we investigated an M6.7-class limb flare that occurred on August 28, 2022, combining observations from the Solar Orbiter (SolO) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Coronal X-ray sources are continually observed by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) onboard SolO for over two hours, revealing a multi-phase evolution with varying velocities and multiple substructures, with higher-energy components consistently appearing at higher altitudes. Such a height-energy relation is notably observed in a double coronal source during the decay-phase, which is dominated by thermal emission. The energy distribution of the double source distinguish itself from previous studies that showed a symmetric distribution, with the higher-energy components being closer to the center of the double source during the impulsive phase. Obtained from two opposite side-on perspectives on the supra-arcade region, these findings reveal the spatio-temporal complexity of the energy release process in the post-flare current sheet during the decay phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESI DR2 Constraints on the $R_h=ct$ Universe: Model Viability and Comparison with $Λ$CDM</a><span class="id">[2512.19175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We carry out a comparative analysis of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and the alternative $R_h=ct$ framework using recent observational data from cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernova, and baryon acoustic oscillations. The study evaluates the ability of each model to reproduce the observed expansion history of the Universe through a joint statistical assessment based on the chi-squared statistics, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), and Bayes factor. While both models yield acceptable fits, $\Lambda$CDM consistently attains lower information-criterion values and higher likelihood, indicating a superior overall performance. An examination of the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ shows that $\Lambda$CDM naturally captures the transition from early-time deceleration to late-time acceleration, where as $R_h=ct$ predicts a strictly linear expansion. We also estimate the age of the Universe within both models, finding that $\Lambda$CDM prediction agrees with the Planck 2018 result, while the linear expansion in $R_h=ct$ leads to an older cosmic age. Recent JWST observations of unexpectedly mature high-redshift galaxies have reopened the discussion regarding whether the Universe may be older than implied by the standard model; although these results remain under active investigation, they underscore that fully resolving cosmic evolution may require refinements beyond the concordance paradigm.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raman Spectroscopy of Salt Deposits from the Simulated Subsurface Ocean of Enceladus</a><span class="id">[2512.19183]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Saturn's ice-covered moon Enceladus may host a subsurface ocean with biologically relevant chemistry. Plumes released from this ocean preserve information on its chemical state, and previous analyses suggest weakly to strongly alkaline pH (approximately pH 8–12). Constraining the pH requires identification of pH-sensitive minerals in plume deposits. Several analytical techniques could provide such mineralogical information, but few are practical for deployment on planetary missions. Raman spectrometers, which have recently advanced for \textit{in situ} exploration and have been incorporated into flight instruments, offer a feasible approach for mineral identification on icy moons. However, their applicability to pH estimation from plume-derived minerals has not been investigated. In this study, we evaluate whether Raman measurements of plume particles deposited on the surface of Enceladus can be used to distinguish between weakly and strongly alkaline subsurface ocean models. Fluids with pH values of 9 and 11 were frozen under vacuum conditions analogous to those on Enceladus. The resulting salt deposits were then analyzed using a flight-like Raman spectrometer. The Raman spectra show pH-dependent carbonate precipitation: NaHCO$_3$ and Na$_2$CO$_3$ peaks were detected at pH 9, whereas only Na$_2$CO$_3$ peaks were detected at pH 11. These findings demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can distinguish pH-dependent carbonate phases. This capability allows us to constrain whether the pH of the subsurface ocean is weakly alkaline or strongly alkaline, which is a key parameter for assessing its chemical evolution and potential habitability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19186" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illuminating the Dark Sector: Understanding Modified Gravity Signatures with Cross-Correlations of Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure</a><span class="id">[2512.19186]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the synergy between large-scale structure (LSS) observations and gravitational wave (GW) events for testing modified gravity.

In this study, we utilize the newly developed Spectral Imaging Coronagraph (SICG), Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE), and AIA/SDO to analyze the morphology, temperature, Doppler shift, and non-thermal velocity of two coronal cavities observed on November 13, 2024. We find that coronal cavities are distinctly visible in SICG \ion{Fe}{14} 5303 Å and AIA 193 Å, whereas they are nearly absent in SICG \ion{Fe}{10} 6374 Å and AIA 171 Å. The spectroscopic measurements show that the two coronal cavities display asymmetric, ring-like structures in the \ion{Fe}{14} 5303 Å Doppler shift maps. The non-thermal velocities inside coronal cavities are significantly higher than those of the surrounding streamer areas. In addition, the core regions of coronal cavities, located directly above the prominences, exhibit the highest non-thermal velocities and Doppler velocities. Our results suggest the presence of waves and turbulence in coronal cavities, which are likely more intense than those in the adjacent streamer regions. We suggest that the interaction and exchange between the cold, dense prominence materials and the hot, low-density coronal materials are the main drivers of the waves and turbulence inside coronal cavities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19204" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outburst Characteristics of Transient Low Mass X-ray Binary 4U 1608-52</a><span class="id">[2512.19204]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a deep study of the long-term X-ray light curve of 4U 1608-52 by investigating the fast rising exponential decay (FRED) outbursts, low intensity state (LIS) and quiescent intervals.

Their relativistic jets, closely aligned to the line of sight from Earth, are a rich and complex environment, characterised by the presence of strong magnetic fields over parsec-scale lengths. Owing to their cosmological distance from Earth, these sources serve as ideal targets to probe non-standard gamma-ray propagation. In particular, axion-like particles (ALPs) could be detected through their coupling to photons, which enables ALP-photon conversions in external magnetic fields, leading to distinct signatures in the blazars' gamma-ray spectra. In this work, we explore a novel approach to constrain the ALP parameter space using gamma-ray observations, based on the use of machine-learning classifiers. We apply this technique to simulated observations of two bright blazars – Mrk 501 and PKS 2155$-$304 – with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), a next-generation gamma-ray facility well suited to probe such features, thanks to its improved energy resolution and point-source sensitivity with respect to present ground-based gamma-ray telescopes.

Nearby massive stars in the late stages of stellar evolution provide a promising environment for enhanced ALP production due to their high core temperatures and densities. We search for a combined signal of ALP-induced hard X-ray and soft $\gamma$-ray emission from 18 nearby pre-supernova stars using the full public 22-year INTEGRAL/SPI dataset, construct individual stellar spectra and link them in a coherent analysis. A maximum-likelihood approach is used to extract fluxes in the 20–2000 keV energy range. Stellar evolution models are employed to obtain the expected spectral shapes of ALP production processes peaking between 50–500 keV, depending on stellar mass and evolutionary stage. We construct a joint likelihood that incorporates uncertainties in stellar parameters to derive combined constraints on the coupling constants $g_{a\gamma}$ and $g_{ae}$ as a function of the ALP mass $m_a$. The hard X-ray and soft $\gamma$-ray fluxes of all selected stars are consistent with zero within uncertainties. We provide upper limits on the continuum emission and on the 511 keV and 1809 keV line fluxes. The combined upper limit on $g_{a\gamma} \times g_{ae}$ is $(0.008 - 2) x 10^{-24}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) while the ALP-photon coupling is constrained to $g_{a\gamma} = (0.13 - 1.26) x 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) for $m_a\leqq10^{-11}$ eV, depending on the time to core collapse and magnetic field assumptions. Conservative limits of $(0.27 - 1.25) x 10^{-24}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) are obtained assuming all but one star are in the early He-burning phase. These results rank among the strongest limits on ALP couplings to date and demonstrate the importance of soft $\gamma$-ray observations for probing ALPs and massive star evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19301" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optical Follow-Up Strategies for the Next Neutrino-Detected Galactic Core-Collapse Supernova</a><span class="id">[2512.19301]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are expected to produce intense bursts of neutrinos preceding the emergence of their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts.

We aim to assess the feasibility and efficiency of an optical-NIR follow-up strategy for CCSNe discovered via neutrino bursts, by modelling the spatial distribution of events and simulating realistic observational campaigns taking into account the size of the localization error box generated by triangulating the neutrino burst. We modelled the Galactic distribution of CCSNe, including the effects of interstellar extinction, and considered three main progenitor types: Wolf-Rayet stars, red and blue supergiants. We included the shock breakout in the EM signatures that could be detected following the neutrino burst. A population of CCSNe was generated and detected by different networks of neutrino observatories, including IceCube, KM3NeT, Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO. The resulting skymaps were used as input for GWEMOPT to produce optimized follow-up plans with two optical facilities: LSST and the TAROT robotic telescopes. Both LSST and TAROT exhibit comparable detection efficiencies for the simulated CCSN population. However, the TAROT network achieves similar success rates while requiring fewer pointings to cover the CCSN skymap. Our simulations demonstrate that neutrino follow-up campaigns can effectively CCSN optical counterparts using both large and small facilities. Depending on the neutrino network, the median number of pointings for the two tested optical facilities is of the order of 20 to 100 to find the EM emission. The number of images is larger for LSST than for TAROT by a factor of 2 to 4.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine learning for the early classification of broad-lined Ic supernovae</a><span class="id">[2512.19386]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Science is currently at an age where there is more data than we know how to deal with. Machine learning (ML) is an emerging tool that is useful in drawing valuable science out of incomprehensibly large datasets, identifying complex trends in data that are otherwise overlooked. Moreover, ML can potentially enhance the quality and quantity of scientific data as it is collected. This paper explores how a new ML method can improve the rate of classification of rare Ic-BL supernovae (SNe). New parameters called magnitude rates were introduced to train ML models to identify SNe Ic-BL in large datasets. The same methodology was applied to a population of SN Ia transients to see if the methodology could be reproducible with another SN class. Three magnitudes, three time differences, two magnitude rates and the second derivative of these rates were calculated using the first three available photometric data points in a single filter. Initial investigations show that the Random Forest algorithm provides a strong foundation for the early classifications SNe Ic-BL and SNe Ia. Testing this model again on an unseen dataset shows that the model can identify upward of 13% of the total true SN Ic-BL population, significantly improving upon current methods. By implementing a dedicated observation campaign using this model, the number of SN Ic-BL classified and the quality of early-time data collected each year will see considerable growth in the near future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19403" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diagnosing the AGN population origin of TeV neutrinos with their spatial correlation</a><span class="id">[2512.19403]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recent IceCube detection of TeV neutrinos from some nearby Seyfert galaxy (e.g., NGC 1068) suggests that active galactic nuclei (AGN) could make a significant contribution to the diffuse flux of astrophysical neutrinos. The absence of TeV gamma-rays from NGC 1068 indicates neutrino production in compact gamma-ray-opaque region. The vicinity of the supermassive black hole, such as disk-corona, is an ideal region, where the high radiation density leads to efficient neutrino production as well as the gamma-ray attenuation. Disk-corona models predict that the neutrino emission from AGNs correlates with X-ray emission, which traces the coronal activity. In this paper, we assess whether the X-ray AGN population origin for TeV neutrinos can be tested by using the spatial correlation between the neutrino population and X-ray AGN population with future neutrino telescopes. By performing simulations, we find that, the AGN origin of the neutrino background above 100 TeV can be tested at a confidence level of $\sim2.4\sigma$ with five-year observations of IceCube-Gen2, which has an angular resolution of $\sim0.2$ degree. With better angular resolution and sensitivity in the energy range of above $300$ TeV, a 30-${\rm km^3}$ underwater neutrino telescope, such as High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT), is expected to reach a significance of $\sim8.6\sigma$ in testing the association after five years of exposure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamics of clusters of galaxies in the presence of dark energy: Virgo cluster</a><span class="id">[2512.19436]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is shown that, owing to the interaction of baryonic matter with the carrier of dark energy, all configurations of baryonic matter acquire energy and inevitably must expand. This conclusion applies to all hierarchical levels of the baryonic universe, including galaxy clusters. We propose a simple statistical method for identifying possible radial motions of galaxies within clusters. To illustrate this method, we examined the structural features of the Virgo galaxy cluster and identified its substructure, comprising groups of galaxies of varying multiplicity. Galaxies in the substructure are somewhat brighter than those in the overall cluster, and each subgroup contains an active galaxy. Subgroups are considered to be the product of primordial ejections of matter from the central generator galaxy. It is shown that the average stellar magnitude of galaxies in subgroups positively correlates with their average velocity. This correlation can be interpreted as evidence of cluster expansion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confining nonlinear electrodynamics black holes: from thermodynamic phases to high-frequency phenomena with accretion process</a><span class="id">[2512.19448]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution arising from Einstein gravity coupled to a confining nonlinear electrodynamics model that reproduces Maxwell theory in the strong-field regime while introducing confinement-like corrections at large distances. The resulting metric function is asymptotically Schwarzschild but carries a characteristic Q^3/(9\xi^2 r^4) correction, where $Q$ is the magnetic charge and $\xi$ is the nonlinear electrodynamics parameter, with the conventional Reissner-Nordström term Q^2/r^2 absent. We analyze the horizon structure and construct three-dimensional embedding diagrams to visualize spatial geometry. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we compute the weak-field deflection angle in vacuum, cold plasma, and axion-plasmon media, finding that the nonlinear electromagnetic corrections reduce the total bending compared to Schwarzschild at fixed Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass. The gravitational redshift, Joule-Thomson expansion coefficient, and heat capacity are derived, revealing phase transitions and inversion curves that depend on the model parameters. We obtain closed-form expressions for the photon sphere radius, Lyapunov exponent, and shadow size, demonstrating their sensitivity to Q and $\xi$ along observable Intensities. Fully relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion show that the confining geometry produces a $\sim 40\%$ enhancement in mass accretion rate relative to Schwarzschild and generates quasi-periodic oscillations with stable 3:2 and 2:1 frequency ratios matching observations from black hole X-ray binaries. These results establish the confining nonlinear electrodynamics black hole as a testable model that can reproduce high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation pairs without invoking black hole spin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Low-redshift 3D Lyman-α Forest Correlations with China Space Station Telescope</a><span class="id">[2512.19474]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest traces the large-scale matter distribution over a wide range of redshift, its three-dimensional (3D) clustering at $z &lt; 2$ has not yet been measured. We investigate the prospects for measuring low-redshift Ly$\alpha$ correlations with the UV slitless spectroscopic instrument of the China Space Station Telescope (CSST). We construct mock CSST quasar spectra that reproduce the expected survey depth, spectral resolution and noise properties, and derive Ly$\alpha$ auto-correlation functions and cross-correlations with quasars (QSO) and emission-line galaxies (ELG) in the range $1.1 &lt; z &lt; 2.0$. We then interpret these three-dimensional correlation functions with a standard anisotropic redshift-space clustering model and obtain forecast constraints on the Ly$\alpha$ and tracer parameters. At an effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=1.59$ (1.58 for ELGs), the Ly$\alpha$ bias parameters will be measured with a 10-30\% precision, depending on priors on other tracer's biases. We also forecast a marginal $2.5\sigma$ ($3.7\sigma$) detection of the BAO feature, corresponding to a $\sim$10\% (7\%) constraint on the isotropic BAO scale, from the combination of Ly$\alpha$ auto- and Ly$\alpha$-QSO (ELG) cross-correlations. These results show that CSST can provide the first three-dimensional characterization of the low-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forest and a complementary Ly$\alpha$-based BAO measurement at $z &lt; 2$, helping to link galaxy clustering surveys with high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forest studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19477" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong model-agnostic constraints for twin-star solutions</a><span class="id">[2512.19477]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform a model-agnostic Bayesian analysis of the neutron-star-matter equation of state (EoS), using known ab-initio constraints and astrophysical observations to limit its behavior at intermediate densities.

We find that current observational constraints exclude all but two classes of twin stars. The first is characterized by a first-order transition occurring at a very low density, where the material properties of the system either stay largely intact or move away from the conformal limit. In the second, more interesting class, the discontinuity in the mass-radius curve emerges after a rapid crossover transition at a significantly higher density, with the speed of sound exhibiting two sharp peaks at distinct densities. Since neither class shows clear conformalization upon entering the second branch, the standard twin-star scenario linking the mass-radius discontinuity to deconfinement can be firmly ruled out, while even the remaining solutions – disfavored by per-mille Bayes factors and in tension with theoretical bounds – are likely to be excluded in the future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predicting coronal mass ejection travel times using enhanced model-guided machine learning</a><span class="id">[2512.19492]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are key drivers of space weather events, posing risks to both space-borne and ground-based systems. Accurate prediction of their arrival time at Earth is critical for impact mitigation. To this end, physics-informed artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have proven more effective than purely data-driven or physics-based methods, generally offering higher accuracy and better explainability than the former and lower computational cost than the latter. In this work, we propose a generalization of the physics-driven AI framework based on the classical drag-based model (DBM) by integrating the extended version of the drag-based model (EDBM). This enhancement allows us to include in the training process CME events whose interplanetary dynamics are incompatible with those assumed by the DBM. We achieve travel-time prediction accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We also perform a parametric robustness analysis, highlighting the stability of our approach under small variations in the drag coefficient. Furthermore, we propose a categorization of CMEs into speed regimes defined by the EDBM using a multiclass classification model based on logistic regression, which could be implemented in near-real-time operational space weather forecasting systems. The results show that the EDBM framework broadens the applicability of forecasting models while preserving good predictive accuracy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shock-induced magnetic reconnection driving Ellerman bomb emission and a spicule</a><span class="id">[2512.19547]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The mechanism that forms dynamic type II spicules has remained elusive for many years. Their dynamical behaviour has long been linked to magnetic reconnection, yet no conclusive evidence has been provided. However, one recent observational study found signs of reconnection, as traced by Ellerman bombs (EBs), at the footpoints of many spicules. The triggering of EBs is generally linked to reconnection due to flux emergence and convective motions in the photosphere. We aim to explore whether we can connect EBs to type II spicules, and to what extent we can use EBs as an observational proxy to probe reconnection in this dynamic. We also aim to provide further insight into the mechanisms that trigger EBs. We used a simulation run with the radiative magnetohydrodynamics code Bifrost to track spicules and study the physical processes behind their formation. To detect EBs and classify the spicules, we synthesised the H-alpha line using the multilevel radiative transfer code RH1.5D. We also traced shocks and current sheets to decipher the origin of EBs and spicules. We selected one type II spicule with a strong EB near its footpoint and studied their formation in detail. A magnetoacoustic shock advects the magnetic field lines towards an oppositely directed ambient field, creating a current sheet. The current sheet accelerates dense plasma via a whiplash effect generated by reconnection into the inclined ambient field, launching the spicule. Several EB profiles trace shock- and magnetic-reconnection-induced dynamics during this process at the spicule footpoint. We present a new EB triggering mechanism in which a shock-induced current sheet reconnects, triggering an EB in the lower solar atmosphere. The shock-induced current sheet generates the launch of a type II spicule via reconnection outflows. These results provide a physical origin for the observed connection between EBs and spicules.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19565" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do low-redshift observations open the doors to an open universe?</a><span class="id">[2512.19565]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of a significant deviation from a zero curvature would have profound consequences for inflationary theories and fundamental physics. Relative to high-redshift Planck's CMB measurements, indicating a $\sim 2\sigma$ evidence for a closed universe, low-redshift observations of BAO and SN Ia have the advantages of weak dependence on early universe physics, independently observational systematics, and strong redshift dependence of distances in constraining the cosmic curvature. Using the integrated observations from DESI BAO and SN Ia, we find an unexpected $2\sigma$ evidence for an open universe, regardless of the SN Ia sample employed. When considering DESI, SN Ia and the acoustic scale $\theta_\star$ data, the preference for an open universe exceeds the $3\sigma$ level, reaching $5\sigma$ for the case of DESY5 Supernovae data. Therefore, low-redshift observations favor an open universe, and this preference persists even when alternative high-redshift priors are adopted.

Isolating the characteristic $B$-mode polarization signal sourced by primordial gravitational waves is challenging for several reasons: the amplitude of the signal is inherently small; astrophysical foregrounds produce $B$-mode polarization contaminating the signal; and secondary $B$-mode polarization fluctuations are produced via the conversion of $E$ modes. Current and future low-noise, multi-frequency observations enable sufficient precision to address the first two of these challenges such that secondary $B$ modes will become the bottleneck for improved constraints on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. The dominant source of secondary $B$-mode polarization is gravitational lensing by large scale structure. Various strategies have been developed to estimate the lensing deflection and to reverse its effects the CMB, thus reducing confusion from lensing $B$ modes in the search for primordial gravitational waves. However, a few complications remain. First, there may be additional sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, for example from patchy reionization or from cosmic polarization rotation. Second, the statistics of delensed CMB maps can become complicated and non-Gaussian, especially when advanced lensing reconstruction techniques are applied. We previously demonstrated how a deep learning network, ResUNet-CMB, can provide nearly optimal simultaneous estimates of multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization. In this paper, we show how deep learning can be applied to estimate and remove multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, and we further show how this technique can be used in a likelihood analysis to produce nearly optimal, unbiased estimates of the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-local-in-time structure formation and sixth-order galaxy bias</a><span class="id">[2512.19578]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a systematic construction of the non-local-in-time galaxy bias expansion in the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure.

Starting from the general non-local-in-time expression for the galaxy overdensity, we explicitly compute the complete sixth-order basis of bias operators at leading order in spatial derivatives, finding 57 independent biases, compared to 46 in the corresponding local-in-time expansion. As previously found at fifth order, this difference implies that higher-order clustering statistics can distinguish between local- and non-local-in-time galaxy formation, and thus are sensitive, at a single redshift, to the formation time of galaxies. Along the way, we obtain recursion relations for the perturbative kernels and show that they satisfy specific multi-leg soft limits when the sum of a subset of the external momenta goes to zero.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Period Change of the Binary System WR+O V444 Cyg: Updated Ephemeris Formula</a><span class="id">[2512.19595]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>V444 Cyg is a WN5+O6 V eclipsing binary system that exhibits a secular variation in its orbital period due to the loss of matter from the Wolf-Rayet star through its powerful stellar wind.

The first model, Wess-Zumino dark radiation (WZDR), features a mass threshold in the dark sector that induces a step-like reduction in the dark radiation abundance as the dark temperature evolves. The second model, new atomic dark matter (nuADaM), introduces dark radiation that remains coupled to a subcomponent of dark matter until shortly before matter-radiation equality. Earlier analyses using Planck data demonstrated that these interactions significantly relax constraints on the dark radiation density and allow values of $H_0$ consistent with local distance-ladder determinations. Incorporating ACT DR6, which extends CMB measurements deep into the high-$\ell$ damping tail, we find that constraints on the additional radiation component tighten substantially in both scenarios, closing most of the parameter space that previously enabled higher values of $H_0$. We further analyze a generalized model including both free-streaming and self-interacting dark radiation, and show that the resulting constraints are consistent with ACT's findings for the limiting cases of purely free-streaming or purely self-interacting radiation. Overall, ACT DR6 significantly restricts interacting dark radiation as a solution to the Hubble tension.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A High-Resolution NUV Transmission Spectrum of KELT-9b: Mg II and Fe II Escaping from the Hottest Known Giant Planet</a><span class="id">[2512.19662]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-resolution NUV observations from Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) data for the hottest known gas planet, KELT-9b.

We show the clear presence of the Mg II doublet at 2800 $Å$ and Fe II at 2600 $Å$ in KELT-9b. The Mg II is measured above the planet's Roche transit radius, indicating it is escaping. We fit 1D NLTE atmospheric escape models to these features, demonstrating a significant loss of mass in KELT-9b's atmosphere ($\dot{M} \approx 10^{12} $ g/s); we also find a remarkably high line-broadening corresponding to a velocity of about $50-75$ km/s, and a net blueshift of the Mg II doublet greater than 30 km/s. Future 3D MHD modeling of the spectrum and gas kinematics is likely needed to explain these observations. We interpret these results in the context of the Mg II “Cosmic Shoreline&quot; and show that the detection of escaping Mg II in KELT-9b and the non-detection in WASP-178b are consistent with the hypothesis that stars hotter than $T_{\mathrm{eff}} \sim$ 8250 K have relatively low levels of XUV radiation due to the lack of a chromosphere. Therefore planets around such early-type stars experience a different degree of atmospheric escape. This result highlights the importance of XUV irradiation in driving atmospheric escape inside and outside the Solar System.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Are Primordial Black Holes Truly Fine-Tuned?</a><span class="id">[2512.19668]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Single-field inflationary models which generate primordial black holes through the enhancement of the curvature primordial power at small scales are commonly criticized and frequently dismissed because they require a large amount of fine-tuning in the parameters setting the ultra slow-roll phase.

Here we analyze this phase of matter within fully self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations using Skyrme-type energy density functionals for the mean field and a separable interaction in the pairing channel. The periodicity of the lattice is taken into account using Bloch boundary conditions, in order to describe the interplay between band structure and superfluidity. A relative flow between the clusters and the surrounding neutron gas is introduced in a time-independent way. As a consequence, the complex order parameter develops a phase, and in the rest frame of the superfluid one finds a counterflow between neutrons inside and outside the clusters. The neutron superfluid fraction is computed from the resulting current. Our results indicate that at densities above 0.03 fm$^{-3}$, more than 90% of the neutrons are effectively superfluid, independently of the detailed choice of the interaction, cluster charge, and lattice geometry. This fraction is only slightly lower than the one obtained recently within linear response theory on top of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approximation, and it approaches the hydrodynamic limit for strong pairing. As a consequence, it is likely that the inner crust alone can provide a sufficient superfluid angular momentum reservoir to explain pulsar glitches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting Mars' Induced Magnetic Field and Clock Angle Departures under Real-Time Upstream Solar Wind Conditions</a><span class="id">[2512.18629]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mars lacks a global intrinsic dipole magnetic field, but its interaction with the solar wind generates a global induced magnetosphere. Until now, most studies have relied on single-spacecraft measurements, which could not simultaneously capture upstream solar wind conditions and the induced magnetic fields, thereby limiting our understanding of the system. Here, we statistically re-examine the properties of Mars' induced magnetic field by incorporating, for the first time, real-time upstream solar wind conditions from the coordinated MAVEN and Tianwen-1 observations. Our results are show that both solar wind dynamic pressure and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) magnitude enhance the strength of the induced magnetic field, but they exert opposite effects on the compression ratio: higher dynamic pressure strengthens compression, while stronger IMF weakens it. The induced field is stronger under quasi-perpendicular IMF conditions compared with quasi-parallel IMF, reflecting a stronger mass-loading effect. We further investigate the clock angle departures of the induced fields. They remain relatively small in the magnetosheath near the bow shock, increase gradually toward the induced magnetosphere, and become significantly larger within the induced magnetosphere. In addition, clock angle departures are strongly enhanced under quasi-parallel IMF conditions. Their dependence on upstream drivers further shows that, within the magnetosheath, clock angle departures are minimized under low dynamic pressure, high IMF magnitude, and low Alfven Mach number conditions. These results may enhance our understanding of solar wind interaction with Mars, and highlight the critical role of multi-point observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18637" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Framework for Lorentz-Dirac Dynamics and Post-Newtonian Interaction of Radiating Point Charges</a><span class="id">[2512.18637]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine classical radiation reaction by combining the covariant Lorentz–Dirac formulation, its Landau–Lifshitz (LL) order reduction, and a post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian treatment of interacting and radiating charges.

Furthermore, we analyze the gravitational-wave echo time of the systems, which serves as a potential observational imprint. Our results indicate that the echo time can vary depending on the magnetic field configuration, suggesting that WH+NS systems may provide distinctive signals of gravitational echo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energetically-dominant Sunward-Propagating Alfvén Waves Near 1 au and Their Relation to Large-scale Magnetic Switchbacks</a><span class="id">[2512.18806]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this letter, we investigate the population of energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfvén waves (SAWs) using more than 20 years of data provided by the Wind spacecraft near 1 au. We refer to SAWs as energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfvén waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma incompressibility, and magnetic incompressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, AW modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the time scale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks (SBs) and SAWs (for a 1-hour long time scale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as SBs. For a sample of 1636 1-hour SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than one hour. The analysis lends support to the idea of switchbacks as one of the candidate sources for a portion of the SAW population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optical appearance, Hawking radiation, and Barrow thermodynamics of Letelier black hole in electromagnetic universe</a><span class="id">[2512.18881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an investigation of a static, spherically symmetric Letelier black hole (BH) immersed in an electromagnetic universe (EMU), characterized by the cloud of strings (CoS) parameter $\alpha$ and the EMU parameter $a$.

The dark sector couples to the visible sector only via gravity, and we analyze two unavoidable channels: (i) inflaton condensate annihilation, $\phi+\phi \to X+X$, and (ii) thermal scatterings, ${\rm SM}+{\rm SM}\to X+X$, both mediated by graviton exchange. Working in the Fierz-Pauli framework for a free massive spin-2 field of mass $m_2$, we derive the graviton-mediated amplitudes and perform a full helicity decomposition of the final state. The relic abundance is obtained analytically in terms of $m_2$ and the reheating temperature $T_{\rm RH}$. In the light mass regime $m_2 \ll m_\phi$ (with $m_\phi$ the inflaton mass during oscillations), production is overwhelmingly dominated by the longitudinal (helicity-0) mode: the $2\to2$ cross section is parametrically enhanced, scaling as $\sim (m_\phi/m_2)^4$, and yields efficient dark matter production despite purely gravitational couplings. Compared to lower-spin cases (spin-$0$, $1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$), massive spin-$2$ production is substantially more efficient for the same reheating history. Over most of the parameter space the inflaton condensate channel dominates the yield, while the thermal contribution is negligible. Avoiding overproduction typically requires either a relatively low $T_{\rm RH}$ or a spin-$2$ mass near threshold, $m_2 \lesssim m_\phi$. This places the spin-$2$ portal on similar footing to other higher spins in reheating scenarios, while emphasizing the central role of the helicity-$0$ mode and the reheating history in setting the dark matter density.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19437" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-high precision high voltage system for PTOLEMY</a><span class="id">[2512.19437]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The PTOLEMY project is prototyping a novel electromagnetic filter for high-precision $\beta$ spectroscopy, with the ultimate and ambitious long-term goal of detecting the cosmic neutrino background through electron capture on tritium bound to graphene.

Our analysis reveals the presence of a tidal gap between black holes, characterized by vanishing tidal deformability, and physically motivated ECOs. Prompted by this finding, we investigate the possibility that a population of maximally compact exotic objects, described by a linear equation of state (EoS), may simultaneously inhabit the lower mass gap and the sub-solar region, thus qualifying as (primordial) black hole mimickers while distinguishing themselves from the latter by their non-zero tidal deformability. Finally, considering the case of solitonic boson stars as proxies for ECOs described by a linear EoS, we discuss how it is possible to further reduce the lower limit on $\Lambda$, provided that the strong energy condition is violated (but not the dominant energy condition, and therefore causality).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutron star crust and outer core equation of state from chiral effective field theory with quantified uncertainties</a><span class="id">[2512.19593]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the order-by-order expansion of the energy per particle of asymmetric nuclear matter up to twice saturation density in chiral effective field theory (EFT) within a Bayesian framework.

We determine the amplitude of the CMB lensing power spectrum at $2.3\%$ precision ($43\sigma$ significance) using a novel pipeline that minimizes sensitivity to foregrounds and to noise properties. To ensure our results are robust, we analyze an extensive set of null tests, consistency tests, and systematic error estimates and employ a blinded analysis framework. The baseline spectrum is well fit by a lensing amplitude of $A_{\mathrm{lens}}=1.013\pm0.023$ relative to the Planck 2018 CMB power spectra best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model and $A_{\mathrm{lens}}=1.005\pm0.023$ relative to the $\text{ACT DR4} + \text{WMAP}$ best-fit model.

These results are in excellent agreement with $\Lambda$CDM model constraints from Planck or $\text{ACT DR4} + \text{WMAP}$ CMB power spectrum measurements. Our lensing measurements from redshifts $z\sim0.5$–$5$ are thus fully consistent with $\Lambda$CDM structure growth predictions based on CMB anisotropies probing primarily $z\sim1100$.

We perform a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using a combination of datasets, including Planck, BAO (SDSS and DESI DR2), Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES.

Notably, the inclusion of DESI DR2 and SH$0$ES data increases the inferred interaction strength to $\beta \sim 0.3$ (68\% C.L.) and yields weak and positive evidence in favor of the model over $\Lambda$CDM, with $\Delta\chi^2_{\rm min} = -4.75, -6.41$ and $\Delta$AIC= $-0.75, -2.41$ respectively. This model remains consistent with a phantom crossing at redshift $z\sim 0.5$, in agreement with the trend indicated by DESI observations.

In this work, we present a novel and efficient implementation of both a model for the multipole moments of the anisotropic 3-point correlation function (3PCF) and of their estimator. To evaluate the performance of our model, we compared its predictions against direct 3PCF measurements obtained with our estimator from a set of 298 dark matter halo catalogs drawn from the $z=1$ snapshots of $N$-body simulations. For the statistical analysis, we employed a covariance matrix estimated from an independent suite of 3000 mock halo catalogs at the same redshift. We then repeated the analysis by combining the 2-point correlation function (2PCF) to the 3PCF, with and without including its anisotropic part. In the 3PCF-only analysis, the addition of the anisotropic component of the 3PCF effectively breaks the degeneracy between the growth rate $f$ and the linear bias $b_1$, significantly reducing their uncertainties. It also significantly improves the precision of the Alcock-Paczynski parameter $\varepsilon$ but does not reduce the $\sim 1$% offset we find in the estimate of the isotropic dilation parameter $\alpha$. The joint 2PCF+3PCF analysis reduces, though does not fully remove, biases in the AP and isotropic dilation parameters and breaks the $f$-$b_1$-$\sigma_8$ degeneracy, leading to tighter constraints overall. The anisotropic 3PCF adds little to the joint analysis because the tree-level 3PCF model fails to capture the anisotropic information primarily encoded on small scales and in squeezed triangle configurations. A more advanced model will be required to exploit this information fully.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09297" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining primordial black hole abundance with Insight-HXMT</a><span class="id">[2412.09297]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a major candidate for dark matter and they have been extensively constrained across most mass ranges.

Migration through the circumbinary disk will quickly bring stars to the edge of a low-density cavity cleared by the binary, where the stellar orbit becomes trapped and locked with the binary decay. Here we explore the scenario where the trapped stellar orbit decays with the binary until the binary tidally strips the star in a runaway process. For Sun-like stars, this occurs preferentially for $10^4-10^6 M_{\odot}$ SMBHBs, as the SMBHB enters the LISA band. We estimate that the runaway stripping process will generate Eddington-level X-ray flares repeating on hours-to-days timescales and lasting for decades. The flaring timescales and energetics of these circumbinary-disk tidal-disruption events (CBD-TDEs) match well with the recently discovered Quasi-Periodic Eruptions. However, the inferred rates of the two phenomena are in tension, unless low-mass SMBHB mergers are more common than expected. For less-dense stars, stripping begins earlier in the SMBHB inspiral, has longer repetition times, lasts longer, is dimmer, and can occur for more massive SMBHBs. Whether CBD-TDEs are a known or a yet-undiscovered class of repeating nuclear transients, they could provide a new probe of the elusive SMBH mergers in low mass / dwarf galaxies, which lie in the sweet-spot of the LISA sensitivity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological search for sterile neutrinos after DESI 2024</a><span class="id">[2501.10785]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The question of whether the massive sterile neutrinos exist remains a crucial unresolved issue in both particle physics and cosmology.

Here, we aim to complete this gap by exploring the generic multi-axion scenario motivated in the String Axiverse context, and investigate its astronomical implications in both the linear and nonlinear regimes. In the linear regime, with linear density perturbation analysis, we provide a simplified prescription for obtaining multi-copy axion transfer functions and also identify an &quot;equivalence&quot; among all axion copies owing to the mutual coupling to the gravitational potential. As a result of this 'equivalence', we argue the suppression to LSS is governed by an effective mass $m_{eff}^{-2}=\sum_i w_i m_i^{-2}$, with $\{ w_i\}$ being fractional contributions of different copies to the full cosmic dark matter density. In non-linear regime within galaxy halos, we show that similar notions of effective mass, with expressions provided, to govern the collective wave interference and hence determine the net stellar heating rates and the substructure-induced spread of JWST transients near critical curves. Distinctive to the multi-copy scenario, the effective mass within galaxy halos is generically anticipated to be radially decreasing following the stronger concentration of heavier copies to the galactic center. Such a spatial variation leads to radially increasing spreading scales for micro-lensed transients at different radial positions, a signature that may be tested with future JWST lensing observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interacting dark energy after DESI DR2: a challenge for $Λ$CDM paradigm?</a><span class="id">[2504.00994]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the scenario of interacting dark energy through a detailed confrontation with various observational datasets.

We recommend treating model comparisons instead as relative adequacy tests, which should be supported by theoretical predictions and complementary metrics of statistical significance in order to attribute a signal to a particular gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ambiguous AT2022rze: Changing-look AGN mimicking a supernova in a merging galaxy system</a><span class="id">[2505.23731]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>AT2022rze is a luminous, ambiguous transient located South-East of the geometric center of its host galaxy at redshift z = 0.08. The host appears to be formed by a merging galaxy system. The observed characteristics of AT2022rze are reminiscent of active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal disruption events (TDEs), and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). The transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of -20.2 +- 0.2 mag, showing a sharp rise (trise,1/e = 27.5 +- 0.6 days) followed by a slow decline (tdec,1/e = 382.9 +- 0.6). Its bumpy light curve and narrow Balmer lines indicate the presence of gas (and dust). Its light curve shows rather red colors, indicating that the transient could be affected by significant host extinction. The spectra reveal coronal lines, indicative of high-energy (X-ray/UV) emission. Archival data reveal no prior activity at this location, disfavoring a steady-state AGN, although an optical spectrum obtained prior to the transient is consistent with an AGN classification of the host. Based on this, we conclude that the transient most likely represents a Changing-look AGN at the center of the smallest component of the merging system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accurate and efficient likelihood modeling for large-scale CMB data</a><span class="id">[2505.24829]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurate parameter estimation from cosmic microwave background data requires reliable likelihood modeling, particularly at large angular scales where angular power spectrum estimators exhibit non-Gaussian statistics.

We used integrated JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics from Keck and JWST for RXJ1131-1231. We also considered two samples of non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors' mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias. Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with $\Omega_{\rm m}$ constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN) dataset. In the flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM), we find $H_0=71.6^{+3.9}_{-3.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The SLACS and SL2S samples are in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on $H_0$ in flat $\Lambda$CDM to 4.6%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5 dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present constraints in the open $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, and $w_{\phi}$CDM cosmologies. The TDCOSMO $H_0$ inference is robust and consistent across all presented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree with those from the BAO and SN.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indicator Functions: Distilling the Information from Gaussian Random Fields</a><span class="id">[2506.06668]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A random Gaussian density field contains a fixed amount of Fisher information on the amplitude of its power spectrum.

We investigate which parts of the field contain the most information by smoothing and splitting the field into different levels of density (using the formalism of indicator functions), deriving analytic expressions for the information content of each density bin in the joint-probability distribution (given a distance separation). When we choose one particular distance regime (i.e., cells separated by $60$-$80h^{-1}$ Mpc), we find that the information in that range peaks at moderately rare densities (where the number of smoothed survey cells is roughly of order of magnitude 100). Counter-intuitively, we find that, for a finite survey volume (again at a particular distance range), indicator function analysis can outperform conventional two-point statistics while using only a fraction of the total survey cells, and we explain why. In light of recent developments in marked statistics (such as the indicator power spectrum and density-split clustering), this result elucidates how to optimize sampling for effective extraction of cosmological information.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02583" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring black hole spins with x-ray reflection spectroscopy: A GRMHD outlook</a><span class="id">[2507.02583]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray reflection spectroscopy has evolved as one of the leading methods to measure black hole spins.

In this work, we use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of thin accretion disks around spinning black holes for modeling the accretion process, and then we simulate NuSTAR observations to test the capability of modern reflection models in recovering the input spins. For the first time, we model the electron density and ionization profiles from GRMHD-simulated disks. Our study reveals that current reflection models work well only for fast-rotating black holes. We model the corona as the base of the jet and we find that reflection models with lamppost emissivity profiles fail to recover the correct black hole spins. Reflection models with broken power-law emissivity profiles perform better. As we increase the complexity of the simulated models, it is more difficult to recover the correct input spins, pointing toward the need to update our current reflection models with more advanced accretion disks and coronal geometries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06766" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effects of Lorentz invariance violation on charged particles and photon production in astrophysical sources</a><span class="id">[2507.06766]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on radiation processes in astrophysical sources, focusing on synchrotron and inverse Compton interactions.

It has been recently proposed that such layers, arising during flux eruption events, can power the rapid TeV flares observed from the core of M87. In this scenario, inverse Compton scattering of soft radiation from the accretion flow by energetic electron-positron pairs produced near the reconnection layer was suggested as the primary emission mechanism. However, detailed calculations show that radiation from pairs alone cannot account for the GeV emission detected by the Fermi observatory. In this work, we combine analytic estimates with 3D radiative particle-in-cell simulations of pair-proton plasmas to show that the GeV emission can be naturally explained by synchrotron radiation from protons accelerated in the current sheet. Although the exact proton content of the layer is uncertain, our model remains robust across a broad range of proton-to-pair number density ratios. While protons are subdominant in number compared to pairs, our simulations demonstrate that they can be accelerated more efficiently, leading to a self-regulated steady state in which protons dominate the energy budget. Ultimately, proton synchrotron emission accounts for approximately 5%-20% of the total dissipation power. The majority is radiated as MeV photons via pair synchrotron emission, with a smaller fraction emitted as TeV photons through inverse Compton scattering.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hurst Index of Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curves and Its Statistical Study</a><span class="id">[2509.11631]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) rank among the most powerful astrophysical phenomena, characterized by complex and highly variable prompt emission light curves that reflect the dynamics of their central engines.

Our results reveal anti-correlations between the Hurst index and the burst durations (T50, T90), and a negative trend with the low-energy spectral index \alpha.

GRB 250702B is notable for its multi-hour prompt emission, an X-ray pre-peak emission starting $\sim$1 day earlier, off-nuclear host position, and hard, rapidly variable gamma-rays. This combination is difficult to explain with standard ULGRB progenitors such as blue-supergiant collapsars, magnetar engines, or white-dwarf tidal disruptions by intermediate-mass black holes. We interpret the event as a micro-tidal disruption event ($\mu$TDE), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star partially or fully disrupts a main-sequence star. Three $\mu$TDE pathways can reproduce the observed pre-peak emission to main flare delay: (i) a dynamical (partial/repeating) disruption, in which a grazing passage yields a faint precursor and the core returns after $\sim$day for a deeper encounter; (ii) a natal-kick disruption, where the delay reflects the ballistic motion of a newborn compact object relative to its companion, leading to full disruption; and (iii) a hybrid natal-kick + partial case, in which the kick seeds the close encounter but the first passage is only partial, with the core returning on the day-scale period. Cross-section scalings imply comparable rates for partial and full outcomes in both dynamical and natal-kick scenarios. The highly variable, hard $\gamma$-ray emission supports association with a stellar-mass compact object. Fallback and viscous accretion naturally explain the ultra-long duration, energetics, and ks-scale X-ray variability. We outline observational discriminants between the three channels and argue that $\mu$TDEs offer a compelling framework for ULGRBs such as GRB 250702B.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">90.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02079" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The very faint X-ray transient Swift J174610-290018 at the Galactic center</a><span class="id">[2510.02079]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Very Faint X-ray Transients (VFXTs) are a class of X-ray binary systems that exhibit occasional outbursts with peak X-ray luminosities (L_X&lt; 1e36 erg s^-1) much lower than typical X-ray transients. On 22nd February 2024, during its daily Galactic center monitoring, Swift-XRT detected a VFXT, 7 arcmin from Sgr A* dubbing it Swift J174610–290018. We aim to characterize the outburst that occurred in 2024, and a second, distinct outburst in 2025, to understand the nature and accretion flow properties of this new VFXT. Swift-XRT light curves are used to constrain the duration of the two events. We carried out X-ray spectral analysis exploiting XMM and NuSTAR data. We used Chandra and XMM observations of the last 25 years to constrain the quiescent luminosity of the source. During the 2024 outburst, which lasted about 50 days, the source reached a luminosity in the 2-10 keV band of L_X = 1.2e35 erg s^-1 (assuming it is located at the Galactic center). The 2025 outburst is shorter (about 5 days), and reached L_X = 9e34 erg s^-1. The spectral features of the source include an excess at 6.5-7 keV, which can be associated either with a single reflection line or with the ionized Fe XXV and XXVI lines. The same source was identified in both the XMM and Chandra catalogs of point sources (known as 4XMM J174610.7–290020). During previous detections, the source displayed luminosity levels ranging from L_X= 2e32 to L_X = 3e34 erg s^-1 between 2000 and 2010. Moreover, it exhibited a potential type I X-ray burst in 2004. The analysis of the outbursts and the potential type I burst strongly suggests the neutron star low mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) nature of the VFXT. The source can be described by an accretion disk corona (as has been recently proposed by the XRISM/Xtend analysis). This scenario explains the overall low luminosity of this transient and the peculiar iron lines in the spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the statistical characterization of the synchrotron multi-zone polarization of blazars</a><span class="id">[2510.05324]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Multiwavelength polarimetric observations of blazars reveal complex, energy-dependent polarization behavior, including a decrease in polarization fraction from X-rays to millimeter bands and significant variability in the electric vector position angle (EVPA). These trends challenge simple single-zone synchrotron models and suggest a more intricate, turbulent jet structure with multiple emission zones. We develop a statistical framework to model the observed energy-dependent polarization patterns in blazars, focusing on the behavior captured by IXPE in the X-ray band and RoboPol in the optical. The goal is to statistically characterize multi-zone models in terms of the distributions of cell size and the physical parameters of the electron energy distribution (EED). A Monte Carlo approach, implemented with the JetSeT code, is used to generate synthetic multi-zone synchrotron emission from a spherical region filled with turbulent cells with randomly distributed physical properties. Simulations explore scenarios ranging from identical cells to power-law distributions of cell sizes and EED parameters with variable cutoff and low-energy slopes. The results show that a purely turbulent, multi-zone model can reproduce the observed energy-dependent polarization without requiring correlations between cell size and EED parameters. The polarization degree is primarily determined by the effective, flux-weighted, number of emitting cells, modulated by the dispersion in cell properties, particularly the EED cutoff energy at high frequencies and the low-energy spectral index at low frequencies. With a fractional dispersion in cutoff energy of about 90% and a low-energy spectral index dispersion of  0.5-1.5, the model reproduces the chromatic mm-to-X-ray polarization trends seen by IXPE and the optical polarization limiting envelope observed in the RoboPol dataset.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">92.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09766" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Dark Energy Changing?

We employ a comprehensive dataset of usual astronomical probes (Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, Hubble data, and Planck 2018 CMB) alongside future mock gravitational wave (GW) distance measurements from the Einstein Telescope. We utilize the Pad'e approximation, a versatile framework encompassing well-known DE models like constant EoS, Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization and other time-evolving DE parametrizations. Within Pad'e parametrization, we examine three specific forms (Pad'e-I, SPad'e-I, Pad'e-II) applied to both spatially flat and non-flat universes. Pad'e-II exhibits particularly interesting features in terms of the evidence of dynamical DE at many standard deviations. Our results can be summarized as follows. Flat Universe: When analyzing the combined dataset of standard probes (including CMB) with Pad'e-II in a flat universe, we find a strong preference (6.4{\sigma}) for a dynamical (time-varying) DE EoS. This preference remains significant (4.7{\sigma}) even when incorporating future GW data. Non-Flat Universe: In a non-flat universe, the combined standard datasets (without or with CMB) also indicate dynamical DE EoS at a high confidence level (6.2{\sigma} and 6.4{\sigma}, respectively). The addition of GW data slightly reduces the evidence (3.8{\sigma} and 5.1{\sigma}, respectively), but the preference persists. These results collectively suggest a robust case for dynamical DE in the dark sector. While a non-flat universe is not strongly favored, Pad'e-II hints at a possible closed universe when CMB data is included (with or without GW data).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">93.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOI-3288 b and TOI-4666 b: two gas giants transiting low-mass stars characterised by NIRPS</a><span class="id">[2510.11703]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gas giant planets orbiting low-mass stars are uncommon outcomes of planet formation. Increasing the sample of well-characterised giants around early M dwarfs will enable population-level studies of their properties, offering valuable insights into their formation and evolutionary histories. We aim to characterise giant exoplanets transiting M dwarfs identified by TESS. High-resolution spectroscopic data are obtained in the optical and nIR, combining HARPS and NIRPS. We derive RVs via the cross-correlation function and implement a novel post-processing procedure to further mitigate telluric contamination in the nIR. The resulting RVs are jointly fit with TESS and ground-based photometry to derive the orbital and physical parameters of the systems. We confirm two gas giants transiting the low-mass stars TOI-3288 A (K9V) and TOI-4666 (M2.5V). TOI-3288 A hosts a Hot Jupiter with a mass of $2.11\pm0.08~M_{\rm Jup}$ and a radius of $1.00 \pm 0.03~R_{\rm Jup}$, with an orbital period of 1.43 days ($T_{\rm eq} = 1059 \pm 20~{\rm K}$).

We identify a decrease in planetary mass with spectral type, where late M dwarfs host less massive giant planets than early M dwarfs. More massive gas giants that deviate from this trend are preferentially hosted by more metal-rich stars. Furthermore, we find an increased binarity fraction among low-mass stars hosting gas giants, which may play a role in enhancing giant planet formation around low-mass stars. The observed population trends agree with theoretical expectations, where higher metallicity can compensate for lower disk masses, and wide binary systems may influence planet formation and migration through Kozai-Lidov cycles or disk instabilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">94.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Lensing Counter Narrative: An Effective Description of Small-Scale Clustering in Weak Lensing Power Spectra</a><span class="id">[2510.18981]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new formalism to separate large- and small-scale contributions to cosmic shear through $\textit{lensing counterterms}$ (LCT) inspired by effective field theory (EFT).

It operates by performing a linear combination of the shear data vector in $\ell$-space, yielding a transformed vector that is better localized in both redshift and $k$-space. BNT is particularly useful for estimating cosmological parameters while minimizing the impact of poorly understood nonlinear physics, without discarding large amounts of information as is typically done with simple scale cuts. In our previous work, we showed that BNT outperforms traditional weak-lensing analyses; however, that study did not include intrinsic alignments (IA). In the present work, we assess the robustness of our BNT-based $k$-cut framework in the presence of realistic IA models. We consider two cases: (i) when the assumed IA model used in sampling is close to, but not identical to, the true one, and (ii) when the assumed IA model is significantly biased compared to the true one. In the first case, the $k$-cut framework yields precise and unbiased $S_8$ constraints even with limited knowledge of large-scale modes. Using Euclid-like mock data and a stringent $k$-cut of $k \le 0.1\;{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ for all tomographic bins, we found that BNT can constrain $S_8$ with a precision better than 2\% while non-BNT has lost all constraining power. In the second case, the BNT transform serves as a powerful diagnostic tool, revealing internal inconsistencies in $k$-space and redshift-space both exceeding 5$\sigma$ when the functional form of the sampling and fiducial IA models differ fundamentally.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">96.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unified Kraft Break at  6500 K: A Newly Identified Single-Star Obliquity Transition Matches the Classical Rotation Break</a><span class="id">[2511.15610]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The stellar obliquity transition, defined by a $\textit{T}_{\rm eff}$ cut separating aligned from misaligned hot Jupiter systems, has long been assumed to coincide with the rotational Kraft break. Yet the commonly quoted obliquity transition (6100 or 6250 K) sits a few hundred kelvin cooler than the rotational break ( 6500 K), posing a fundamental inconsistency. We show this offset arises primarily from binaries/multiple-star systems, which drive the cooler stellar obliquity transition ($6105^{+123}_{-133}$ K), although the underlying cause remains ambiguous. After removing binaries and higher-order multiples, the single-star stellar obliquity transition shifts upward to $6447^{+85}_{-119}$ K, in excellent agreement with the single-star rotation break ($6510^{+97}_{-127}$ K). This revision has two immediate consequences for understanding the origin and evolution of spin-orbit misalignment. First, the upward shift reclassifies some hosts previously labeled `hot' into the cooler regime; consequently, there are very few RM measurements of non-hot-Jupiter planets around genuinely hot stars ($T_{\rm eff}\gtrsim6500\,\mathrm{K}$), and previously reported alignment trends for these classes of systems (e.g., warm Jupiters and compact multi-planet systems) lose the power to discriminate the central question: are large misalignments unique to hot-Jupiter-like planets that can be delivered by high-$e$ migration, or are hot stars intrinsically more misaligned across architectures? Second, a single-star stellar obliquity transition near $6500\,\mathrm{K}$, coincident with the rotational break, favors tidal dissipation in outer convective envelopes; as these envelopes thin with increasing $T_{\rm eff}$, inertial-wave damping and magnetic braking weaken in tandem.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">97.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Exoplanetary Worlds and Elemental Survey (JEWELS) I: High-Precision Chemical Abundances of 20 FGK Planet-Hosting Stars from JWST Cycle 2</a><span class="id">[2512.04420]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-precision chemical abundances for 20 FGK stars hosting planets observed in JWST Cycle 2 GO programs.

The detailed abundance patterns show clear chemical diversity, including carbon-enhanced but mildly metal-poor stars (TOI-824, TOI-1130, GJ 9827) and $\alpha$-enhanced metal-poor stars (TOI-561, GJ 9827, TOI-824). These variations trace differences in protoplanetary disk composition and may influence planetary interiors and atmospheric chemistry. The planet-hosts show a range of [C/O] ratios, and the diverse [Mg/Si] ratios may suggest varied interior compositions for their rocky planets. This homogeneous stellar abundance, together with future uniform JWST planetary atmosphere measurements, provides a foundation for exploring the planet mass-metallicity relation and the connection between stellar chemistry and planetary formation pathways. These results constitute the first step in a larger survey spanning multiple JWST cycles to systematically examine how host star composition shapes exoplanetary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">98.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15960" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESI-DR1 $3 \times 2$-pt analysis: consistent cosmology across weak lensing surveys</a><span class="id">[2512.15960]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a joint cosmological analysis of projected galaxy clustering observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1), and overlapping weak gravitational lensing observations from three datasets: the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), the Dark Energy Survey (DES-Y3), and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC-Y3). This combination of large-scale structure probes allows us to measure a set of $3 \times 2$-pt correlation functions, breaking the degeneracies between parameters in cosmological fits to individual observables. We obtain mutually-consistent constraints on the parameter $S_8 = \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.786^{+0.022}_{-0.019}$ from the combination of DESI-DR1 and DES-Y3, $S_8 = 0.760^{+0.020}_{-0.018}$ from KiDS-1000, and $S_8 = 0.771^{+0.026}_{-0.027}$ from HSC-Y3. These parameter determinations are consistent with fits to the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background dataset, albeit with $1.5-2\sigma$ lower values in the $S_8-\Omega_{\rm m}$ plane. We perform our analysis with a unified pipeline tailored to the requirements of each cosmic shear survey, which self-consistently determines cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We generate an analytical covariance matrix for the correlation data including all cross-covariances between probes, and we design a new blinding procedure to safeguard our analysis against confirmation bias, whilst leaving goodness-of-fit statistics unchanged. Our study is part of a suite of papers that present joint cosmological analyses of DESI-DR1 and weak gravitational lensing datasets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">99.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Power of DESI for Photometric Redshift Calibration: A Case Study with KiDS-1000</a><span class="id">[2512.15964]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurate redshift estimates are a critical requirement for weak lensing surveys and one of the main uncertainties in constraints on dark energy and large-scale cosmic structure. In this paper, we study the potential to calibrate photometric redshift (photo-z) distributions for gravitational lensing using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Since beginning its science operations in 2021, DESI has collected more than 50 million redshifts, adding about one million monthly. In addition to its large-scale structure samples, DESI has also acquired over 256k high-quality spectroscopic redshifts (spec-zs) in the COSMOS and XMM and VVDS fields. This is already a factor of 3 larger than previous spec-z calibration compilations in these two regions. Here, we explore calibrating photo-zs for the subset of KiDS-1000 galaxies that fall into joint self-organizing map (SOM) cells overlapping the DESI COSMOS footprint using the DESI COSMOS observations. Estimating the redshift distribution in KiDS-1000 with the new DESI data, we find broad consistency with previously published results while also detecting differences in the mean redshift in some tomographic bins with an average shifts of Delta Mean(z) = -0.028 in the mean and Delta Median(z) = +0.011 in the median across tomographic bins. However, we also find that incompleteness per SOM cell, i.e., groups of galaxies with similar colors and magnitudes, can modify n(z) distributions. Finally, we comment on the fact that larger photometric catalogs, aligned with the DESI COSMOS and DESI XMM and VVDS footprints, would be needed to fully exploit the DESI dataset and would extend the coverage to nearly eight times the area of existing 9-band photometry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">100.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The contribution from small scales on two-point shear analysis: comparison between power spectrum and correlation function</a><span class="id">[2512.17022]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A known problem in cosmic shear two-point statistics is the apparent inconsistency between analyses performed in harmonic space (power spectrum) and real space (angular correlation). This arises mainly from two factors: first, scale cuts in one space correspond to soft cuts in the other, as the relationship between the two spaces is mediated by Bessel functions. For the same reason, astrophysical effects that are compact in one space may not be in the other, which can lead to biased parameter estimates. In this paper, we argue that these two statistics are complementary: we expect a robust theory to provide consistent constraints regardless of the chosen scale cuts. We present the consequences of pushing our analysis to smaller scales in both spaces, accounting for different models of Intrinsic Alignment and Baryonic Feedback in HSC Y3 data: we find that the harmonic-space analysis is significantly less sensitive to the specific modeling of small-scale physics, with model-choice-driven biases in $S_8$ being 2-3 times smaller than in real space. We show that using a flexible, simulation-based emulator for baryonic feedback (BACCO) in combination with the TATT model for intrinsic alignments provides the most consistent cosmological constraints between the two spaces when pushing to the smallest scales. In contrast, the standard HMCode-2016 model results in a $\sim 1.1\sigma$ tension between the two statistics. While harmonic space appears more robust for cosmological inference given current model uncertainties, real-space analyses offer a clearer separation of baryonic effects and will play a crucial role in distinguishing between baryonic feedback models in upcoming surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">101.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13035" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boosted dark matter from primordial black holes produced in a first-order phase transition</a><span class="id">[2212.13035]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During a cosmological first-order phase transition in a dark sector, fermion dark matter particles $\chi$ can form macroscopic Fermi balls that collapse to primordial black holes (PBHs) under certain conditions.

A main challenge in those experiments has been to minimize these effects, which can substantially alter the flow structure compared to the axially unbounded idealized case. Therefore, understanding and disentangling the influence of endcaps on the TC flow dynamics is essential for the unambiguous interpretation of experimental results, particularly when other dynamical processes (instabilities) in TC flows are involved. In this paper, we study the hydrodynamic evolution of a quasi-Keplerian TC flow in the presence of split endcaps for high Reynolds numbers, $Re$, up to $2\times 10^5$, which are larger than those considered in related previous studies. At these $Re$, the flow deviates from the ideal TC flow profile without endcaps, resulting in about $15\%$ deviation in angular velocity at the mid-height of the cylinders. Aside from turbulent fluctuations caused by shearing instability near the endcaps, the bulk flow remains nearly axially independent and exhibits overall Rayleigh-stability. We characterize the scalings of the Ekman and Stewartson layer sizes with $Re$ as well as examine the effect of the ratio of the outer to inner cylinders' angular velocities on the flow. The implications of these findings for ongoing magnetorotational instability (MRI) experiments based on the similar axially bounded TC setup are also discussed. Specifically, it is shown that when imposing a constant axial magnetic field in all the considered configurations, the flow profile modified by the endcaps lowers the critical threshold for the onset of MRI that in turn can facilitate its emergence and detection in those experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">103.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sound waves from primordial black hole formations</a><span class="id">[2504.12243]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a numerical investigation of primordial black hole (PBH) formation from super-horizon curvature perturbations and the subsequent generation and propagation of sound waves, which can serve as a new source of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) presented in a companion letter.

We also show that a softer equation of state suppresses the formation of compression waves. Furthermore, the comoving thickness of sound shells remains nearly constant during propagation and scales with the Hubble radius at horizon re-entry, thereby serving as a key link between the gravitational-wave peak frequency and PBH mass in the companion letter. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of PBH formation and suggest potential observational signatures of PBHs in the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from associated sound waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">104.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Possibility of Formation of Compact Boson Stars via Cosmological Evolution of a Background Scalar Field</a><span class="id">[2505.09159]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Boson stars, hypothetical astrophysical objects bound by the self-gravity of a scalar field, have been widely studied as a type of exotic compact object that is horizonless and provides a testing ground for physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, many previous works have demonstrated methods for distinguishing compact boson stars from black holes in general relativity through gravitational wave observations. However, the formation scenario of compact boson stars within the age of the universe remains unclear. In this paper, we explore a possible scenario for the formation of compact boson stars. The model we consider requires two coupled scalar fields: a complex scalar field that forms a boson star and a spatially homogeneous background field, as formation of a compact boson star cannot be achieved in a single filed model. Using the adiabatic approximation, we show that non-relativistic boson clouds can evolve into compact boson stars through the cosmological time-evolution of the background field. In our model the background field evolves to increase the effective mass of the scalar field, and as a result compact boson stars can form within the cosmological timescale, if the variation of the background field is as large as the Planck scale. However, further investigation is required because the required initial states are not the configurations that can be described by the well-studied Schrödinger-Poisson system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">105.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting Isocurvature Bounds on the Minimal QCD Axion</a><span class="id">[2506.03348]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The QCD axion has important connections to early universe cosmology. For example, it is often said that isocurvature limits rule out a combination of high axion decay constant, $f_a$, and high inflationary Hubble scale, $H_I$. High scales are theoretically motivated, so it is important to ask how robust this constraint is. We demonstrate that this constraint is naturally evaded when the quartic coupling of the complex $U(1)_\mathrm{PQ}$-breaking field is small. In this case, $f_a$ changes from a larger value during inflation to a smaller value in the later universe, suppressing isocurvature perturbations. Importantly, we show that in large parts of parameter space this solution is not jeopardised by overproduction of the axion through parametric resonance. The isocurvature bounds are thus dependent on UV physics. We have found that, even for the minimal QCD axion, large parts of UV parameter space at both high $f_a$ and high $H_I$ are in fact allowed, not ruled out by isocurvature constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">106.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boosted dark matter versus dark matter-induced neutrinos from single and stacked blazars</a><span class="id">[2507.12278]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The physics responsible for the production of observed high-energy neutrinos have not been established so far, neither for the diffuse astrophysical ones nor for those detected from single blazars. We recently proposed that both could be explained by deep inelastic scatterings between sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around blazars and protons within their jets. Here, we compute the proton-recoil signals at the neutrino detectors Super-Kamiokande, KamLAND, Borexino, JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE induced by DM that is itself boosted by the scatterings with protons in blazar jets. We do it for the four cases of vector, axial, scalar and pseudoscalar mediators of DM-quark interactions. We perform the analysis for the single blazar TXS 0506+056 and for a sample of more than 300 stacked blazars. We find that searches for such blazar-boosted DM leave room for a variety of DM models to explain observations of high-energy neutrinos. We check that the depletion of the DM spike induced by DM-proton and DM-DM interactions does not compromise the DM interpretation for high-energy neutrinos, but challenges other blazar-DM signals.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">107.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark wounds on icy moons: Ganymede's subsurface ocean as a dark matter detector</a><span class="id">[2508.00054]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter in the form of macroscopic composites is largely unconstrained at masses of $\sim 10^{11}- 10^{17}$ g. In this mass range, dark matter may collide with planetary bodies, depositing an immense amount of energy and leaving dramatic surface features that remain detectable on geological timescales. In this paper, we show that Ganymede, the largest Jovian moon, provides a prime target to search for dark matter impacts due to its differentiated composition and Gyr-old surface. We study the effects of dark matter collisions with Ganymede first with analytic estimates, finding that in a large region of parameter space, dark matter punches through Ganymede's conductive ice sheet, liberating sub-surface material. This sub-surface material may be compositionally different from the surface ice, providing a key observable with which to discriminate asteroid impacts from those caused by dark matter. We confirm our analytic estimates with dedicated simulations of dark matter impacts using iSALE, a multi-material impact code. We then discuss potential detection prospects with two missions currently en route to the Jovian system, Europa Clipper and JUICE, finding that these missions may have the ability not only to identify signs of life on the Galilean moons, but signs of dark matter as well.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">108.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00179" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eccentricity signatures in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's BNS and NSBH binaries</a><span class="id">[2508.00179]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Measurement of eccentricity in low-mass binary systems through gravitational waves is crucial to distinguish between various formation channels. Detecting eccentricity in these systems is challenging due to a lack of accurate eccentric waveform models and the high computational cost of Bayesian inferences. We access the eccentricities of six previously observed low-mass gravitational wave events using publicly available data from the first four observing runs of the LIGO and Virgo collaboration. We analyze the events using the new eccentric waveform model, SEOBNRv5EHM, and compare our results with the existing model, TEOBResumS-Dali. We also present the first eccentricity constraints for GW190814. To improve accuracy, we include higher-order modes in both models and optimize inference using efficient marginalization and parallelization techniques. We find that GW200105 exhibits non-negligible eccentricity, with a measured eccentricity of $e=0.135^{+0.019}_{-0.088}$ at 20 Hz (90% credible level) for TEOBResumS-Dali and $e=0.125^{+0.029}_{-0.082}$ for SEOBNRv5EHM, given a uniform eccentricity prior from 0 to 0.2. This provides moderate support for the eccentric hypothesis, with a Bayes factor of $\sim6-7$ in favor of the eccentric model. With a uniform log prior on eccentricity, the Bayes factor is reduced to 2.35. The remaining five sources are consistent with low eccentricity, with 90% upper limits from $e \leq 0.011$ to $e \leq 0.066$. We find no support for non-negligible eccentricity in GW190814. Finally, we discuss the challenges of performing Bayesian inference in eccentric, multi-modal parameter spaces, including issues related to sampling efficiency and waveform systematics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">109.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electron Inertia and Magnetic Reconnection</a><span class="id">[2509.14400]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of a magnetic field $\vec{B}$, the field lines of $\vec{B}$ reconnect, but the lines of a related field $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ do not. $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (c/\omega_{pe})^2\mu_0\vec{j} \right)$ with $\omega_{pe}$ the plasma frequency and $\vec{j}$ the current density.

What was the origin of these two words? It has often been said that the expression “Big Bang” began as an insult. Even if this were true, it would be just an irrelevant part of the whole issue. There are many more aspects hidden under this name, and which are seldom explained. They will be discussed in this work. In order to frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both Shakespeare and Eco have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. With the conclusion that names are, in general, just labels, simple stickers put to identify things. And this includes those given to great theorems or spectacular discoveries. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled to further substantiate those statements. These points will be at the heart of the investigation carried out here, concerning the very important concept of “Big Bang”. Everybody thinks to know what “the Big Bang” is, but only very few do know it, in fact. When Fred Hoyle first pronounced these two words together, on a BBC radio program, listeners were actually left with the false image that Hoyle was trying to destroy. That is, the tremendous explosion of Lemaître's primeval atom (or cosmic egg), which scattered all its enormous matter and energy content throughout the rest of the Universe. This image is absolutely wrong! As will be concluded, today the label “Big Bang” is used in several different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">112.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09971" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can the 3 neutrino masses really be found using SN 1987A data?</a><span class="id">[2512.09971]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutrino masses remain a significant unsolved problem in physics and their nonzero value proves the Standard Model is incomplete.

Although this seemingly preposterous idea was suggested a dozen years ago by the author, here it is demonstrated in a much more convincing manner with many new elements, including a stronger statistical treatment, and a thorough explanation of why the method used to find the three masses from supernova SN 1987A neutrino data really works. The key to finding the three neutrino masses is realizing why three normally accepted assumptions are unjustified, The three rejected assumptions are:(a) the 5-hr early LSD (Mont Blanc) neutrinos are unrelated to SN 1987A, (b) any neutrino masses $m_k&gt;1 eV/c^2$ cannot be reconciled with upper limits on the “effective mass&quot; from KATRIN and other data, and (c) the spread in neutrino emission times from SN 1987A data is too great for the method to work.

Recent work has clarified how this formalism arises from quantum field theory (QFT) and the renormalization group (RG), allowing for corrections to this formalism to be determined order by order. Yet, this description is incomplete. For example, the quantum dynamics of these fields are expected to become important when determining the tail of the probability distribution for the fluctuations. In this paper, we develop the understanding of fields in de Sitter as a quantum walk in order to bridge the gap between the classical and quantum description. We use the framework of exact RG to calculate the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix of the long wavelength fields. This master equation provides the direct map from light fields to models of quantum walks. We show how to reduce the master equation to Stochastic Inflation, and provide a new understanding of how the higher-order corrections arise. In the process, we demonstrate that divergences and secular growth in de Sitter, for both light and heavy fields, can be absorbed by (dynamical) renormalization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">114.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delayed Scaling of Multi-Type Cosmic F- and D-strings in VOS Models</a><span class="id">[2512.16821]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the velocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) model to the case of one cosmic F-string and two D-strings as color flux tubes in pure Spin($4N$) gauge theory.
