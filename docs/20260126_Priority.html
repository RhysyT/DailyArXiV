By applying the UPMASK algorithm to Gaia astrometric data for the estimation of cluster membership probabilities, it has been determined that 808 stars in NGC 869 and 707 stars in NGC 884 exhibit the highest statistical likelihood of being cluster members. The fundamental astrophysical parameters of the clusters were inferred within a Bayesian framework using Gaia data and PARSEC stellar evolutionary isochrones, through the application of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. The estimated parameters are: colour excess E(B-V) = 0.516 +0.17/-0.24 mag and 0.516 +0.22/-0.33 mag, distances 2376 +301/-278 and 2273 +230/-290 pc, ages log(t/yr) = 7.31 +0.17/-0.32 and log(t/yr) = 7.30 +0.13/-0.29, and metallicities [Fe/H] = -0.24 +/- 0.12 and [Fe/H] = -0.25 +/- 0.12 dex for NGC 869 and NGC 884, respectively. Since spectroscopic observations are not available for the clusters, SED analysis was employed for the member stars, yielding results consistent with those obtained using the MCMC method. Kinematic and Galactic orbital analyses suggest that the open clusters originated in nearby regions of the Galaxy. This interpretation is supported by their similar space velocities and Galactic orbital parameters. Furthermore, orbital integration over 1 Gyr indicates a potential interaction between the clusters within the next 11 Myr. This study provides strong evidence of a common origin and a possible future dynamical interaction, contributing valuable insights into the formation and evolution of binary open clusters in the Milky Way.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A shot in the dark: searching for dark substructures in the RX J0437+00 galaxy cluster</a><span class="id">[2601.16260]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Obtaining a census of dark matter structures at low mass ($\leq 10^9 M_\odot$) can provide strong constraints on the nature of dark matter, though identifying such structures remains difficult. In this work, we study the galaxy cluster RX J0437.1+0043, taking advantage of its powerful &quot;exotic&quot; Hyperbolic-Umbilic (HU) lensing configuration to search for substructure candidates. Using a combination of high resolution imaging, IFU spectroscopy, and gravitational lensing modelling, we report on a tentative detection of a dark matter subhalo ($m_{\rm halo} = 2.25 \pm 0.94 \times 10^9 M_\odot$) near the vicinity of one of the largest HU images. We stress that this result is still preliminary and that deeper data and more advanced modelling techniques are needed to ultimately confirm this detection. Nevertheless, this work outlines the first steps towards understanding subhalo properties in dense cluster environments, developing HU cluster lenses as a potential new tool for investigating dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TORRCH: Tomographic reconstruction of the reionization of cosmic hydrogen with Ly$α$ emitters and non-Ly$α$-selected galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.16263]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tomographic reconstruction of reionization is a long-sought goal. It would move the field beyond global summary statistics, such as the volume-averaged ionised fraction, to direct, field-level constraints on the ionization topology. With this in mind, we present TORRCH (TOmographic Reconstruction of the Reionization of Cosmic Hydrogen), a deep-learning framework that reconstructs the neutral-hydrogen fraction field during the epoch of reionization from the spatial distributions of Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) and non-Ly$\alpha$-selected galaxies (NLSGs) at luminosity limits comparable to current surveys. Using hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with radiative transfer, we train a deterministic 3D U-Net on mock surveys spanning diverse reionization scenarios and predict the neutral-fraction field. We find that TORRCH recovers the large-scale ionization morphology from synthetic data comparable to current surveys with high fidelity, and reproduces both the one-point distribution and the 2D power spectrum of projected neutral fractions. The predicted galaxy-IGM cross-correlation is also captured well, including the expected small-scale anti-correlation and its decline towards zero at large separations. Reconstruction quality depends on tracer completeness, with deep joint LAE+NLSG samples yielding the most accurate morphology, while LAE-only selections retain bubble-scale topology but with reduced fidelity. Robustness tests show that the method is stable to variations in ionization conditions between training and test data, and to realistic redshift uncertainties. Our results suggest that galaxy-based tomography can potentially deliver reliable reionization maps across realistic survey redshift windows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Binary-Based Reassessment of the Age and Stellar Properties of NGC 7789 Using Twelve Binary Components</a><span class="id">[2601.16265]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a binary-based reassessment of the age of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 7789, together with well-constrained stellar parameters for twelve components in six SB2 systems, including two eclipsing binaries. Our analysis employs a unified modelling framework that combines radial-velocity orbits, TESS light curves, and blue-to-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs), providing a robust alternative to traditional isochrone-based age determinations. By adopting common cluster-wide parameters (age, distance, and line-of-sight extinction) when solving for the stellar parameters of the binary components, we obtain a coherent set of masses, radii, effective temperatures, and luminosities for all twelve stars. The combined SED, eclipsing-binary, and radial-velocity analysis yields a well-constrained cluster age of $1.26 \pm 0.09$ Gyr and an extinction of $A_V = 0.90 \pm 0.05$ mag, while remaining consistent with the Gaia DR3 distance of $d \simeq 2.06$ kpc used as an external prior. An independent Gaia DR3 astrometric analysis gives a distance of $2082 \pm 142$ pc and confirms the membership of all six systems. The twelve binary components occupy the turnoff and subgiant regions of the cluster, enabling stringent evolutionary tests: in the radius–mass, radius–temperature, and temperature–mass diagrams, they show excellent agreement with modern stellar evolution models for the derived cluster parameters. NGC 7789 thus serves as a valuable benchmark for multi-observable, binary-based age determinations in open cluster studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A first GLIMPSE into star clusters populations across cosmic time</a><span class="id">[2601.16281]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first sample of 222 high-redshift (z&gt;0.5) star clusters, detected with JWST/NIRCam in 78 magnified galaxies from different galaxy cluster fields. The majority of the systems ( 60%) is observed in the very deep NIRCam observations of the cluster AbellS1063 (GLIMPSE program), showing the power that deep observations, combined with lensing, has to reveal these primordial stellar structures. We perform simultaneous size-flux estimates in all available NIRCam filters and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis to recover star cluster physical properties. All star cluster candidates have very high magnification. Star clusters and clumps show similar ages and redshift distributions, although noticeable differences are seen in their masses, sizes and stellar surface densities inherent to the lack of resolution in the latter group. We reconstruct the formation redshift of star clusters and find that the large majority of the observed star clusters show young ages (&lt;100 Myr) and seems to form at cosmic noon (CN,1&lt;z&lt;4). A small sample of CN star clusters is about 1 Gyr old, these potential globular clusters have formed well within cosmic reionization. Star clusters have stellar densities in the range 10^2 to 10^6 M/pc^2, with median values around 10^4 pc2. Their sizes and densities better overlap with those of nuclear star clusters in the local Universe. These intrinsic properties make high-z star clusters a viable channel to grow intermediate mass black holes. We use Bayesian inference to make first direct measurement of the star cluster mass function at z&gt;1, based on a subsample of 60 star clusters younger than 100 Myr and with masses above 2e6 Msun. The star cluster mass function is well described by a power-law with slope beta = -1.89 suggesting that a power-law -2 function might already be in place in the distant Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNCOVER/MegaScience Finds Uniform and Highly Bursty Star Formation at 3 &lt; z &lt; 9, consistent with the High-Redshift UV Luminosity Function</a><span class="id">[2601.16284]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Star formation timescales are key to understanding fundamental physics like feedback mechanisms, as well as the abundance of bright galaxies at $z&gt;10$. We investigate galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) and their evolution across $z\sim3$–9 by measuring the line-to-UV ratio (\rline) and line equivalent width (EW) of \hanii\ and \oiiihb\ directly from UNCOVER/MegaScience spectro-photometry without relying on a specific SFH or nebular line modeling. Our photometric measurements recover \rline\ and EW to $&lt;10\%$ systematic accuracy compared to spectroscopy. This allows us to construct a large mass- (and flux-) complete sample and quantitatively examine how \rline\ evolves with redshift and stellar mass. We find that the intrinsic scatter in \rline\ does not significantly evolve with redshift across $3&lt;z&lt;7$, though it may increase at $z\gtrsim8$. We build population-level toy models using \texttt{fsps} to help interpret our observations, and find that scatter in \rline\ primarily reflects the amplitude of SFH fluctuations; this implies that our observed lack of evolution in the scatter of \rline\ is due to similar star formation burstiness from $z\sim3$ to $z\sim7$. Our observations are best reproduced by a set of SFHs with rising, long-duration, and large-amplitude bursts. Finally, we demonstrate that the toy model that best describes our $z\sim6$ data can boost UV brightness by up to $\Delta M_{\rm UV}\sim-2.0\,{\rm mag}$ compared with a 200 Myr constant SFH, and naturally produces a large number of galaxies at $z&gt;10$. This suggests that no significant evolution in star formation burstiness is required to explain the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at high redshift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A differential-geometry approach to black hole characterization of megamaser systems in static spherically symmetric spacetimes</a><span class="id">[2601.16308]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a geometry-first model that maps measured thin-disk water megamaser observables–sky angles, frequency shifts, their secular drifts and the angular redshift rate–to the black hole parameters in a generic static, spherically symmetric (SSS) spacetime written in the Schwarzschild gauge. The core of the approach is local: dot-product relations in the equatorial curved geometry relate the conserved light-deflection parameter to the observed detector angle at finite distance, providing a connection between sky positions and photon constants of motion. These local identities feed a closed model for the frequency shift of photons traveling between a maser clump circularly orbiting a black hole and a finite-distance detector, making explicit the dependence on the metric at emission and detection radii. We also apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to this construction on the equatorial two-manifold as an intrinsic cross-check. This theorem provides a global consistency relation between the local emission and detection angles, helping to validate sign conventions and angle branch choices in the local setup. In this sense, the local and global perspectives on the megamaser system support each other. To supplement the instantaneous information contained in frequency shifts, we incorporate the time-domain general relativistic invariant, the redshift rapidity. We further introduce a prospective angular-domain observable, the angular redshift rate, and give its analytic expression in the SSS framework. The results are formulated for generic SSS backgrounds, providing closed relations suited for likelihood-based inference from VLBI positions and spectral monitoring. In particular, for a Schwarzschild background, the black hole mass, its distance to Earth and megamaser orbital radius are fully constrained in the language of astrophysical observables.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16335" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The detectability of bars at high redshift: a case study using Euclid-like mock observations of TNG50 simulated galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.16335]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modern surveys such as Euclid report a decline in the fraction of barred galaxies from the local Universe to $z \sim 1$, whereas the TNG50 simulation predicts higher bar fractions, in tension with observations. This discrepancy may be due to observational biases in bar detectability when comparing simulations with observations. We present a proof-of-concept study quantifying how Euclid-like observational conditions affect bar detectability in TNG50. We analysed the entire galaxy sample at $z = 0.5$ and highlight one borderline case with a bar length of 2.1 kpc and bar strength $A_2 = 0.4$. Synthetic images were produced with Monte Carlo radiative transfer and realistic post-processing, and analysed with ellipse fitting and Fourier decomposition, as well as the recently constructed Zoobot analysis. Results were compared to idealised, noise-free stellar mass maps. In the illustrative case the bar is clearly detected in the mass map and remains visible in the Euclid VIS $I_{\rm E}$ filter, where Zoobot also classifies it as barred, but becomes undetectable in $Y_{\rm E}$ and in the VIS-NISP RGB composite, with all methods failing outside VIS. Extending to the full $z = 0.5$ sample, Zoobot recovers only 31/141 galaxies, while $A_2$ and ellipse fitting perform better (80/141 and 67/141) but still miss many short or weak bars. When non-detections are counted as unbarred, the bar fraction of 44 percent falls to $12\!-\!33$ percent depending on the method. These results demonstrate the strong impact of observational effects on bar detectability and motivate bar-fraction estimates which incorporate realistic instrumental conditions across redshift in cosmological simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16395" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion flow in a stratified layer</a><span class="id">[2601.16395]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We compute the density and velocity profiles along the tail induced by a body of mass $M$, embedded in the midplane of a vertically-stratified media with scaleheight $H$, adopting a one-dimensional model as in the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton problem. In analogy to what occurs in the case of a homogeneous medium, there exist a family of solutions that satisfy the boundary conditions. A shooting method is employed to isolate those solutions that fulfill a specific set of physical and mathematical constraints. The tail is found to be both densest and slowest when the scaleheight $H$ is equal to the gravitational radius $\xi_{0}\equiv GM/v_{0}^{2}$, where $v_{0}$ its relative velocity with respect to the medium. The location of the stagnation point is evaluated as a function of $H$ and $\xi_{0}$, and an empirical fitting formula is provided. While the distance to the stagnation point is maximized when $H\simeq \xi_{0}$, the mass accretion rate attains its maximum value for $H \ll \xi_{0}$ at fixed surface density. When instead the midplane density is held constant and $H$ is varied, the accretion rate hardly changes once $H$ exceeds about $2\xi_{0}$. Additionally, we investigate how both the drag force resulting from mass accretion and the gravitational drag arising from its tail depend on $H/\xi_{0}$. We highlight how the effect of varying the degree of mixing in the tail influences the resulting drag force. Finally, for the particular case of an infinitely thin layer, we provide a simple analytical solution, which may serve as a useful pedagogical reference.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling a Thin Filament of the Cosmic Web in the Ursa Major Supergroup</a><span class="id">[2601.16408]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Filaments are crucial components of the cosmic web, representing the extensive and aligned distributions of galaxies and gas. Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we report the detection of a filament in the Ursa Major supergroup using atomic-hydrogen (HI) observations. This filament consists of sixteen various types of galaxies and five starless gas clumps, spanning a length of approximately 0.9 Mpc. Notably, it is extremely thin, with a thickness comparable to the diameter of a galaxy. We observed a galaxy-filament spin alignment and a velocity gradient within the filament. These findings strongly suggest a cold accretion flow along the filament, potentially contributing to the formation and growth of the galaxies. The thin filament, as a small group, is likely to be merged into the Ursa Major supergroup in the context of hierarchical structure formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Star formation outside galaxies undergoing gravitational and hydrodynamic interactions: dust attenuation and the star formation rate</a><span class="id">[2601.16439]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxies undergo perturbations, either gravitational or hydrodynamic in origin, which can generate extragalactic structures such as rings and tails, where in situ star formation may take place. We selected a sample consisting of JO201 and JW100, undergoing ram-pressure stripping, and NGC 5291 and NGC 7252, formed through gravitational interactions, to investigate how different perturbation mechanisms influence dust content and star formation in extragalactic features. In both cases, star formation can be observed outside the main disks of the galaxies. We present new results of dust attenuation for JO201 and JW100, while for NGC 5291 and NGC 7252 we use results from our previous study, based on high-resolution observations obtained with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope onboard AstroSat. Dust attenuation is determined from the ultraviolet continuum slope ($\beta$) calculated using the FUV-NUV colour, and the star formation rates of the star-forming knots are corrected accordingly. It is seen that dust attenuation and dust-corrected SFR densities of the knots in the ram-pressure stripped tails of JO201 and JW100 are comparable to those in the collisional ring of the NGC 5291 system and the tidal tails of the NGC 7252 system. We conclude that, though the formation scenarios of the tails of JO201 and JW100, the NGC 5291 ring, and the NGC 7252 tails are different, their dust content and star formation activity are notably similar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on the Hot Circumgalactic Medium around Nearby L* Galaxies from SRG/eROSITA All Sky Survey</a><span class="id">[2601.16499]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is a multi-phase, dynamic interface between galaxy and the intergalactic medium, providing crucial diagnostics of galaxy evolution. However, direct evidence for a hot (million-Kelvin) CGM around present-day L* galaxies remains elusive. Here, we present the first systematic search of the hot CGM around nearby (&lt; 50 Mpc) L* galaxies, by stacking their X-ray images and spectra from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. Significant diffuse X-ray emission is detected out to   50 kpc, with spectral signatures consistent with a hot gas but arguing against a predominantly non-thermal origin. The radial distribution and total amount of the hot gas are in agreement with prediction by IllustrisTNG simulations. The constraints on the hot CGM derived in this study hold promise for calibrating key physical processes in next-generation cosmological simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Use of Field RR Lyrae as Galactic Probes – VIII. Early Formation of the Galactic Spheroid</a><span class="id">[2601.16523]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a new photometric catalog of RR Lyrae variables (RRLs, $\sim$300,000) mainly based on data available in public datasets. We also present the largest and most homogeneous spectroscopic dataset of RRLs and Blue Horizontal Branch [BHB] stars ever collected. This includes radial velocity measurements ($\sim$16,000) and iron abundances ($\Delta$S method for 8,140 RRLs, plus 547 from literature). Elemental abundances based on high-resolution spectra are provided for 487 RRLs and 64 BHB stars. We identified candidate RRLs associated to the main Galactic components and their iron distribution function (IDF) becomes more metal-rich when moving from the Halo ([Fe/H]=-1.56) to the Thick (TCD; [Fe/H]=-1.47) and Thin (TND; [Fe/H]=-0.73) disk. Furthermore, Halo RRLs and RRLs in retrograde orbits are $\alpha$-enhanced ([$\alpha$/Fe]=0.27, $\sigma$=0.18), while TCD RRLs are either $\alpha$-enhanced ([Fe/H]$\le$-1.0) or $\alpha$-poor ([Fe/H]$&gt;$-1.0), and TND RRLs are mainly $\alpha$-poor ([$\alpha$/Fe]=-0.01, $\sigma$=0.20). We also identified RRLs associated to the main stellar streams (Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus [GSE]; Sequoia, Helmi, Sagittarius) and we found that their IDFs are quite similar to Halo RRLs. However, GSE RRLs lack the metal-poor/metal-rich tails and their $\alpha$-element distribution is quite compact. The iron radial gradient in Galactocentric distance for TND, TCD and Halo RRLs is negative and it decreases from -0.026, to -0.010, and to -0.002 dex/kpc. The iron radial gradient based on dry Halo (Halo without substructures) RRLs is, within the errors, equal to the global Halo. We also found a strong similarity between iron and [$\alpha$/Fe] radial gradients of Milky Way RRLs and M31 globular clusters throughout the full range of galactocentric distances covered by the two samples.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16566" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulations of multi-phase gas in and around galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.16566]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Multiphase gas – ranging from cold molecular clouds ($\lesssim 100\,$K) to hot, diffuse plasma ($\gtrsim 10^6\,$K) is a defining feature of the interstellar, circumgalactic, intracluster, and intergalactic media. Accurately simulating its dynamics is critical to improving our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, however, due to their multi-scale and multi-physics nature, multiphase systems are highly challenging to model. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of numerical simulations of multiphase gas in and around galaxies. We begin by outlining the environments where multiphase gas arises and the physical and computational challenges associated with its modeling. Key quantities that characterize multiphase gas dynamics are discussed, followed by an in-depth look at idealized setups such as turbulent mixing layers, cloud-wind interactions, thermal instability, and turbulent boxes. The review then transitions to less idealized and/or larger-scale simulations, covering radiative supernovae bubbles, tall box simulations, isolated galaxy models including dwarf and Milky Way-mass systems, and cosmological zoom-in simulations, with a particular focus on simulations that enhance resolution in the halo. Throughout, we emphasize the importance of connecting scales, extracting robust diagnostics, and comparing simulations to observations. We conclude by outlining persistent challenges and promising directions for future work in simulating the multiphase Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16710" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One H2 molecule per ten million H-atoms reveals sub-pc scale cold overdensities at z 4</a><span class="id">[2601.16710]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the detection and analysis of H2 absorption at z = 4.24 towards the bright quasar J0007-5705, observed with the Very Large Telescope as part of the ESPRESSO QUasar Absorption Line Survey (EQUALS). The high resolving power, R 120000, enables the identification of extremely weak H2 lines in several rotational levels at a total column density of N(H2) 2x10^14 cm^-2, among the lowest ever measured in quasar absorption systems. Remarkably, this constitutes the highest-redshift H2 detection to date. Two velocity components are resolved, separated by only 3 km/s: a narrow (b 1.7 km/s) and a broader (b 6.2 km/s) component. Modelling the rotational population of H2 yields density of log nH/cm^-3   2.8 with temperature of  40K (typical of the cold neutral medium) for the narrow component and log nH/cm^-3   1.4 , T 600K for the warmer, more turbulent component under a moderate ultraviolet (UV) field, suggesting at least several Mpc distance from the quasar. This system reveals the existence of tiny (down to  0.01 pc), cold overdensities in the neutral medium. Their detection among only 7 damped Lyman-alpha systems in EQUALS suggests that they may be widespread yet usually remain undetected. H2 provides an exceptionally sensitive probe of these structures: even a minute molecular fraction produces measurable Lyman-Werner absorption lines along the extremely narrow optical beam – the size of the quasar's accretion disc – when observed at sufficiently high spectral resolution. High-resolution spectroscopy on extremely large telescopes may routinely detect and resolve such structures in the distant Universe, when 21-cm absorption will trace the collective contribution of many cold cloudlets toward larger radio background sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illuminating the Physics of Cosmic Origin and Evolution: A UK Space Frontiers 2035 White Paper</a><span class="id">[2601.16761]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the Universe's origins and evolution remains one of the most fundamental challenges in modern cosmology. This white paper explores three key science priorities in this field: unravelling the physics of cosmic inflation, investigating the accelerating expansion of the Universe, and precisely measuring the sum of the neutrino masses. Achieving these goals requires a dedicated survey to map the large-scale structure at high redshift in unprecedented detail. We describe how this can be achieved through a mission concept called SIRMOS, providing a high-throughput, highly multiplexed spectroscopic capability to obtain accurate redshifts for over 100 million galaxies over a wide sky area. Such a survey would leverage the deepest existing wide-area photometric catalogues for targeting, with spectra offering continuous 1.25-2.5 $\mu$m wavelength coverage at moderate resolution, allowing precise redshift measurements in the $1&lt;z&lt;4$ range with minimal bias. We outline the scientific opportunities this presents. Recent years have seen significant advances in instrumentation, including digital micromirror devices, complex telescope mirrors, large detector arrays, and data processing pipelines. While these technologies have been demonstrated in terrestrial applications, such a survey is a unique opportunity to apply these proven capabilities in space to address fundamental questions in cosmology. Participation in such a mission will simultaneously deliver a compelling science case, help align UK Space Agency and STFC strategies, demonstrate the UK's growing capability in end-to-end space missions, and strengthen the national space economy through high-value industrial participation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16772" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Improved measurements of the age of JWST galaxies at z=6-10</a><span class="id">[2601.16772]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>From James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) surveys, 31 galaxies with average redshift 7.3 are selected containing large Balmer break, Lyman-$\alpha$ break (V-shaped SED versus $\lambda$). Apart from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST-NIRCam (Near-infrared camera) photometry for these galaxies, there are JWST-NIRSpec (Near-infrared spectrograph) spectra for 13 galaxies and mid-infrared photometry (mostly JWST-MIRI) for 15 of them. Spectroscopical analyses included Balmer emission lines, Balmer + 4000 angstroms breaks or CaII lines. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with photometry include old and young stellar populations, emission lines associated to HII regions, AGN, interstellar dust extinction and intergalactic extinction from neutral hydrogen. By adopting realistic extinction curves and taking into account the V-shaped SED and low emission at near infrared at rest, the analyses show that AGN contribution in these galaxies ('little red dots' most of them) should be small on average in the reddest wavelengths, though important for few of the 31 galaxies. Average age of the 31 galaxies: $0.61\pm 0.31$(95% CL) Gyr, while the average age of the $\Lambda $CDM universe is 0.70 Gyr. This corresponds to a formation epoch $z_{ form.}&gt;11.2$(97.5% CL). Reddest galaxies present largest ages. One of these very red galaxies gets an age incompatible to be younger than the age of the Universe within $&gt;4.7\sigma$. TP-AGB effect cannot explain this tension. None the less, there may be other uncertainties in the models, so this tension is a provisional result and further research is needed to confirm it.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic threads and gravity: ALMA Observations of IRDC G14.225-0.506</a><span class="id">[2601.16810]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During the star formation process, the interplay between gravity, turbulence, and B-fields is significant, with B-fields apparently serving a regulatory function. However, the extent to which B-fields are decisive relative to turbulence and gravity remains uncertain. This study aims to ascertain the role of B-fields in the fragmentation of molecular clouds. We examine the B-field observed with ALMA at core scales towards the infrared dark cloud G14.225-0.506, focusing on 3 regions with shared physical conditions, and juxtapose it with prior observations at the Hub-filament system scale. Our findings indicate a similar B-field strength and fragmentation level between the 2 hubs. However, distinct B-field morphologies are identified across the 3 regions where polarized emission is detected. In the region N, the large-scale B-field, which is perpendicular to the filamentary structure, persists at smaller scales in the southern half but becomes distorted near the more massive condensations in the northern half. Notably, these condensations exhibit signs of impending collapse, as evidenced by supercritical mass-to-flux values. In the region S, the B-field is considerably inhomogeneous among the detected condensations, and we do not observe a direct correlation between the field morphology and the condensation density. Lastly, in an isolated dust clump located within a southern filament of the northern hub, the B-field aligns parallel to the elongated emission, suggesting a transition in the field geometry. The B-field shows a clear evolution with spatial scales. We propose that the most massive condensations detected in the northern Hub are undergoing gravitational collapse, as revealed by the relative significance of the magnetic field and gravitational potential and mass-to-flux ratio. The distortion of the B-field could be a response to the flow of material due to the collapse.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flux-ratio anomalies in cusp quasars reveal dark matter beyond CDM</a><span class="id">[2601.16818]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strongly lensed quasars in cusp configurations provide a uniquely sensitive probe of small-scale dark matter structure. Using the largest microlensing-free flux ratios for 17 quadruply imaged cusps, we combine these with extensive Monte Carlo simulations of mock lens realizations under cold dark matter (CDM), self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) scenarios. Building on this, we propose a region (minor-axis and narrow major-axis cusp lenses) where flux-ratio anomalies persist even under globally parameterized models (&quot;macromodels&quot;) with multipole freedom (capturing disk, asymmetric, or merger-driven structures). Within this region, J1042+1641 is $&gt;3\sigma$ incompatible with both CDM and SIDM. Our results yield a Bayes factor exceeding $100$, providing very strong evidence for FDM over even the most optimistic CDM and SIDM scenarios.

Among known young stellar objects (YSOs), those exhibiting the most dramatic increases in brightness due to sudden increase in mass accretion rate are eruptive young stars. Gaia20dsk is one of the Gaia-alerted young star candidates that has displayed a double, nonperiodic brightening resembling that of other young eruptive stars. Aims. The goal of this work is to determine the physical and accretion properties of Gaia20dsk to confirm its classification as an eruptive young star. Methods. We combined publicly available optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry with our X-shooter optical/NIR spectrum. In our analysis, we examined the optical and IR light curves from the bursts, reviewing the color-magnitude diagrams across different bands, reporting the detection of emission lines, and providing estimates of the star's accretion rates during the burst. Results. The optical light curve shows two major and one brief brightening events with a maximum amplitude of  1.8 mag in the last five years. A classification based on spectral index indicates that Gaia20dsk is a flat-spectrum star. The X-shooter spectrum exhibit emission lines characteristic of accreting low-to-intermediate-mass young stars, displaying features typical of MNor-type objects. The mass accretion rate is between (0.5-1.8)*10^{-6} M_sun/yr. Conclusions. Gaia20dsk is an eruptive YSO that exhibits photometric features similar to those of MNors, including its characteristic brightening amplitude and burst duration, along with similar spectroscopic features and accretion rates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16833" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinematics of young star clusters in the outer north-eastern region of the Small Magellanic Cloud</a><span class="id">[2601.16833]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It has been suggested since recent time that the magnitude of the interaction between galaxies could be measured from the level of kinematic disturbance of their outer regions with respect to the innermost ones.

I obtained from GEMINI GMOS spectra mean radial velocities of star clusters formed in situ, which added to derived mean proper motions and heliocentric distances, allowed to compute their 3D space velocity components. These space velocities differentiate from those that the clusters would have if they instead orderly rotated with the galaxy, i.e., their residual velocities are larger than the upper limit for an object pertaining to the SMC main body rotation disk. The level of kinematic disturbance depends on the SMC rotation disk adopted; galaxy rotation disks traced using relatively old objects are this http URL resulting kinematic disturbance arises in younger and older stellar populations, so that the epoch of close interaction between both Magellanic Clouds cannot be uncovered on the basis of the kinematics behavior of stellar populations populating the outer SMC</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extragalactic Planetary Nebulae (xPNe).

However the significance of the discrepancy depends on understanding the systematic associated with crowding, metallicity effects, and extinction of the stellar tracers. Thus additional precision distance indicators in the local universe are desperately needed for investigating the H0 tension. The analysis of MUSE archival data makes the case that the Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function (PNLF) has become such an indicator, as the method can reach distances comparable to HST distances of Cepheid at a fraction of a cost, in terms of telescope time and ground-based. With new wide-field spectroscopic facilities it becomes possible to measure distances to early-type galaxies (ETGs) using the PNLF out to 100 Mpc distance, achieving a precise estimate for the H0 value which is independent of the Type Ia supernova calibration, with only single-epoch measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamics of AGN feedback in the X-ray bright East and Southwest arms of M87, mapped by XRISM</a><span class="id">[2601.16901]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As the central galaxy in the nearest cluster, M87 provides the best spatial resolution for disentangling the complex interactions between AGN jets and the surrounding environment. We investigate the velocity structure of the multitemperature X-ray gas in M87, particularly in the eastern and southwestern arms associated with past AGN outbursts, using high-resolution spectroscopy from XRISM/Resolve. We analyze a mosaic of XRISM/Resolve observations covering the core of M87, fitting single- and multi-temperature models to spectra extracted from different regions and energy bands. We assess the line-of-sight velocities and velocity dispersions of the hotter ambient and cooler uplifted gas phases, and evaluate systematic uncertainties related to instrumental gain calibration. The hotter ICM phase, traced by Fe He-$\alpha$ emission, shows velocity dispersions below $\sim100$ km/s, and no significant velocity shifts between the arms and a relaxed offset region, suggesting limited dynamical impact from older AGN lobes. In contrast, the cooler gas phase appears to exhibit larger line of sight velocity gradients up to several hundred km/s as well as a higher velocity dispersion than the ambient hot phase, although these conclusions remain tentative pending improvements in the robustness of the gain calibration at lower energies. The first microcalorimeter-resolved map of gas dynamics in M87 supports the uplift scenario for the X-ray arms, with the cooler gas in the east and southwest seemingly moving in opposite directions along the line of sight. The kinetic energy is a small fraction of the gravitational potential energy associated with the gas uplift, and XRISM further suggests that AGN-driven motions may be short-lived in the hot ambient ICM. These constraints provide important input towards shaping future models of AGN feedback.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The scaling relations of galaxies with different morphology: comparison among WINGS, MANGA and Illustris data samples</a><span class="id">[2601.16931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a panoramic view of several scaling relations (ScRs) of galaxies of different morphology.

In this letter, we report the first post-perihelion blue-sensitive integral-field unit spectroscopy of 3I/ATLAS using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager on November 16, 2025. We confirm previously reported CN, Fe, and Ni outgassing along with detections of carbon chain molecules $\mathrm{C}_2$ and $\mathrm{C}_3$. We calculate production rates for each species. We find Fe and Ni production rates of $\mathrm{Q_{Fe}} = (9.55\pm3.96)\times10^{25}$ atoms s$^{-1}$, and $\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} = (6.61\pm2.74)\times10^{25}$ atoms s$^{-1}$, resulting in a ratio of $\log(\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} / \mathrm{Q_{Fe}}) = -0.16\pm0.03$, which matches Solar System comets well and continues the pre-perihelion trend of declining $\log(\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} / \mathrm{Q_{Fe}})$ with $r_h$. We investigate the radial distributions of these elemental species and find characteristic $e$-folding radii of 3880$\pm$39 km for Ni, 6053$\pm$68 km for CN, 4194$\pm$45 km for $\mathrm{C}_2$, and 3833$\pm$45 km for $\mathrm{C}_3$.

We show that potential deformations of this type leave the (reduced) Dirac algebra unchanged and the modification is naturally reinterpreted as an effective anisotropic stress energy contribution. While the fluid reproduces an isothermal-like mass scaling, its pressure anisotropy prevents it from giving flat rotation curves.

Generalizing earlier results, we identify a restricted class of LTB backgrounds for which the HL source term yields a positive scaling dark matter density, consistent with ghost-freedom, and recovery of GR in the infrared.

We detected 10 scintillation arcs in PSR B1237+25, 1 in PSR 1842+14, and at least 6 in PSR 2021+51.

We use the HST and its WFC3 and the VLT and its ERIS AO facility to search for visual companions among a sample of 77 objects members of the USco and Taurus young nearby associations with estimated masses in the range between approximately 6-66 M$_{\rm Jup}$. We report the discovery of one companion candidate around a Taurus member with a separation of 111.9$\pm$0.4 mas, or $\sim$18 au assuming a distance of 160 pc, with an estimated primary mass in the range between 3–6 M$_{\rm Jup}$and a secondary mass between 2.6–5.2 M$_{\rm Jup}$ depending on the assumed age.

BBHs are often assumed to form at migration traps, i.e. radial locations where the Type I migration of embedded stellar-mass black holes (BHs) transitions from outwards to inwards. In this work, we test this assumption by explicitly simulating the radial migration of BH pairs in AGN disks under different torque prescriptions, including thermal effects and the switch to Type II migration. We map where and when binaries form as a function of supermassive BH (SMBH) mass, disk viscosity, and migrating BH mass. We find that, for SMBH masses below $10^8 M_\odot$, the majority of pair-up events occur near migration traps ($\gtrsim 80\%$). In contrast, for higher SMBH masses, differential migration dominates and off-trap pair-ups can prevail. Certain disk configurations (e.g., $\alpha = 0.01$, $M_\bullet &lt; 10^6 M_\odot$) present a significant overdensity of pair-ups even in the absence of traps due to traffic-jam accumulations where the gamma profile changes slope sharply. We also investigate hierarchical BBH formation, showing that higher-generation pair-ups cluster more tightly around trap or traffic-jam radii. Our results provide realistic prescriptions for BBH pair-up locations and timescales, highlighting the limitations of assuming fixed BBH formation sites.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbit-based structural decomposition and stellar population recovery for edge-on barred galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.10832]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In our previous paper, we developed an orbit-superposition method for edge-on barred galaxies and constructed a set of dynamical models based on different mock observations of three galaxies from the Auriga simulations.

We decomposed these galaxies into different structures combining the kinematic and morphological properties of stellar orbits. We then compared the model-predicted components to their true counterparts in the simulations. Our models can identify (BP/X-shaped) bars, spheroidal bulges, thin discs, and spatially diffuse stellar halos. The mass fractions of bars and discs are well constrained with absolute biases of $|f_{\rm model}-f_{\rm true}|\le0.15$. We recovered the mass fractions of halos with $|f_{\rm model}-f_{\rm true}|\le0.03$. For the bulge components, 10 out of 12 cases exhibit $|f_{\rm model}-f_{\rm true}|\le0.05$, while the other two cases exhibit $|f_{\rm model}-f_{\rm true}|\le0.10$.

The JWST data show a sharp kinematic discontinuity at the tip, with a radial velocity change of $\approx 600$ km/s across 0.1” (1 kpc). The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of $\approx 300$ km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of $v_{BH} = 954^{+110}_{-126}$ km/s and an inclination $i=29^{+6}_{-3}$ deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from $\approx 300$ km/s near the tip to $\approx 100$ km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The bow shock interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/H$\alpha$, [NII]/H$\alpha$, [SII]/H$\alpha$, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning vs. Spectral Energy Distribution Fitting: A Comparative Analysis of Accuracy in Stellar Mass Estimation</a><span class="id">[2512.20544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Traditional spectral energy distribution (SED)-fitting methods for stellar mass estimation face persistent challenges including systematic biases and computational constraints.

Our results demonstrate that Pt-SNE achieves superior accuracy, with a root-mean-square error (sigma_F) of 0.169 dex compared to LePhare's 0.306 dex. Crucially, Pt-SNE exhibits significantly lower bias (0.029 dex) compared to LePhare (0.286 dex). Pt-SNE also shows greater robustness across all stellar mass ranges, particularly for low-mass galaxies (10^9 to 10^10 solar masses), where it reduces errors by 47-53 %. Even when restricted to only six optical bands, Pt-SNE outperforms LePhare using all 26 available photometric bands, underscoring its superior informational efficiency. Computationally, Pt-SNE processes large datasets approximately 3.2 x 10^3 times faster than LePhare. These findings highlight the fundamental advantages of ML methods for stellar mass estimation, demonstrating their potential to deliver more accurate, stable, and scalable measurements for large-scale galaxy surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Characteristic Mass and Energy Conversion Efficiency in the Cusp-Core Transition of Dark Matter Haloes: Implications for Scaling Relations and Supernova feedbacks</a><span class="id">[2601.13868]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxies in the nearby Universe, particularly dwarf systems, exhibit inner mass profiles of dark matter haloes that systematically depart from canonical cold dark matter expectations, signalling an interplay between baryonic feedback and the collisionless halo. We update an analytical cusp-core transition model by incorporating the effect of supernova-driven mass loss. Adapting this model to SPARC galaxies, we measure the energy conversion efficiency epsilon, defined as the fraction of supernova feedback energy that is used to change the central dark-matter potential. We find epsilon   0.01 for nearby SPARC galaxies. Building on these measurements, we compare the dynamical energy required for a cusp-core transformation with the feedback energy available over burst cycles and identify a cusp-core transition forbidden region on the halo-stellar mass plane where transformation cannot occur. Galaxies with halo masses from 10^8 to 10^11 M_sun lie outside the forbidden region, whereas ultra-faint dwarf galaxies &lt; 10^8 M_sun, galaxy groups and clusters &gt; 10^11 M_sun fall within it, consistent with their high central densities and the inefficiency of core formation at very low and very high masses. This approach also explains the observed diversity of inner density profiles in low-mass systems, showing that both the star formation rate and the energy conversion efficiency govern them, with the latter emerging as a key parameter setting the strength of the cusp-core transition. Beyond the cusp-core problem, our observationally inferred energy conversion efficiency provides a model independent benchmark that strongly constrains galaxy formation models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LISA double white dwarf binaries as Galactic accelerometers</a><span class="id">[2405.13109]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are among the guaranteed sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) detector. Most DWDs in the LISA band are far from merging and emit quasimonochromatic GWs. As these sources are distributed throughout the Milky Way, they experience different accelerations in the Galactic gravitational potential, and therefore each DWD exhibits an apparent GW frequency chirp due to differential acceleration between the source and LISA. We examine how Galactic acceleration influences parameter estimation for these sources; and investigate how LISA observations could provide insight into the distribution of matter in the Galaxy.</p></div></details></article>

In the laboratory, we have quantified readout noise, dark current, gain, and full-well capacity via bias, dark, and photon transfer curve analysis at all acquisition modes. To do that, we have developed a gradient correction technique to address row-dependent signal gradients in the image, which are caused by the shutter-less condition of our CCD camera test setup. The technique successfully reproduces the values in the manufacturer specifications. We also have measured quantum efficiency exceeding 80% from 400–800 nm and $\gtrsim$ 90% between 450–750 nm, with sub-second persistence decay, making it ideal for rapid, multi-object spectroscopy. Using a set of diffraction gratings (150, 300, and 600 gr mm$^{-1}$), we have evaluated the spatial separability of multiple spectra and spectral resolution. We have conducted a test observation with this spectrograph system at the Seoul National University Astronomical Observatory (SAO) 1 m telescope and successfully demonstrated its capability of multi-object spectroscopy with moderate resolution of $R \approx 600 - 2600$. We release all Python codes for the test and recipes to facilitate further instrument evaluations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMA publication statistics</a><span class="id">[2601.16687]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The success of an astronomical facility is measured by its scientific impact. A principal metric for this impact is the ensemble of peer-reviewed publications based on the observational data obtained by the facility. We present a comprehensive study of the statistics of the 4,190 refereed publications of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the period from 2012 to 2024. The publications have received 169,985 citations and are based on 2,670 ALMA projects totalling 19,265 hours of 12-m-array-equivalent observing time. Our study analyses publication statistics related to various aspects, e.g. science categories, geographical distribution, archival research, time to publication, publication fraction, and citations. We also look into the community and compare ALMA with other facilities. We find that ALMA is a high-impact observatory with an average of 41 citations per publication,  70% of observed projects published,  40% of publications making use of archival data in 2024, more than 9,400 unique authors, and a publication evolution following that of HST and VLT. Currently, the impact factor for ALMA publications is larger than that of all other major astronomical facilities. ALMA also plays a pivotal role in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), substantially contributing to landmark achievements such as capturing the first image of a black hole shadow.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mercury-Ar$χ$es: a high-performance n-body code for planet formation studies</a><span class="id">[2601.16791]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Forming planetary systems are populated by large numbers of gravitationally interacting planetary bodies, spanning from massive giant planets to small planetesimals akin to present-day asteroids and comets. All these planetary bodies are embedded in the gaseous embrace of their native protoplanetary disks, and their interactions with the disk gas play a central role in shaping their dynamical evolution and the outcomes of planet formation. These factors make realistic planet formation simulations extremely computationally demanding, which in turn means that accurately modeling the formation of planetary systems requires the use of high-performance methods. The planet formation code Mercury-Ar$\chi$es was developed to address these challenges and, since its first implementation, has been used in multiple exoplanetary and Solar System studies. Mercury-Ar$\chi$es is a parallel n-body code that builds on the widely used Mercury code and is capable of modeling the growth and migration of forming planets, the interactions between planetary bodies and the disk gas, as well as the evolving impact flux of planetesimals on forming planets across the different stages of their formation process. In this work we provide the up-to-date overview of its physical modeling capabilities and the first detailed description of its high-performance implementation based on the OpenMP directive-based parallelism for shared memory environments, to harness the multi-thread and vectorization features of modern processor architectures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Astrosky Ecosystem: An independent online platform for science communication and social networking</a><span class="id">[2601.16838]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While almost everything that astronomers study occurs in the vacuum of space, astronomy itself does not `happen in a vacuum'. Interactions between scientists, as well as outreach to members of the public, improve extensively from access to good communication tools. Social media has become a key tool for communication in astronomy, being widely used by individuals and organizations alike for networking, outreach, and more. However, traditional social media is reliant on benevolent corporations providing a free service without compromising on quality, and the recent takeover and decline of Twitter has shown how vulnerable these platforms can be. In this proceeding, we present The Astrosky Ecosystem, which is an initiative to develop open-source tools and integrations for social media, principally the Bluesky social network. We explain how our project enables the astronomy community to operate its own social media infrastructure, independent of for-profit corporations. We also discuss some of the project's technical aspects, including its use of the AT Protocol for social networking, before concluding with ideas for the future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16841" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Origins of Planets for ArieL (OPAL) Key Science Project: the end-to-end planet formation campaign for the ESA space mission Ariel</a><span class="id">[2601.16841]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The growing body of atmospheric observations of exoplanets from space and ground-based facilities showcases how the great diversity of the planetary population is not limited to their physical properties but extends to their compositions.

To lay the foundations for the Ariel mission, the OPAL Key Science Project is tasked with creating an unprecedented library of realistic synthetic atmospheres spanning tens of elements and hundreds of molecules on which the Ariel consortium will test and validate its codes and pipelines ahead of launch. In this work we describe the aims and the pipeline of codes of the OPAL project, as well as the process through which we trace the genetic link connecting planets to their native protoplanetary disks and host stars.

Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (“light curves”). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding  40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sustainable, Local Socio-Economic Development Through Astronomy</a><span class="id">[2601.04224]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Astronomy, often perceived as a distant or luxury science, holds immense potential as a driver for sustainable local socio-economic development.

The analysis identifies both successes and challenges, including unequal benefit distribution, limited local ownership, and sustainability gaps once external funding ends. Building on these lessons, we propose a practical framework/guidelines for designing, implementing, and evaluating astronomy-based community initiatives, rooted in participatory engagement and aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

While these meetings are essential for interacting with other researchers and establishing collaborations, many remain only accessible to those with substantial travel funding, flexible schedules, or geographical proximity. This introduces barriers that predominantly affect early career researchers (ECRs) and people from under-resourced regions, limiting the growth, diversity, and sustainability of the community. To address these issues, the FRB 2025 conference, held in Montréal in July 2025 with over 200 participants, was designed to prioritize inclusivity and accessibility alongside scientific excellence. In this work, we describe how we implemented these goals, including: organizing committees spearheaded by ECRs, a fully hybrid format including YouTube livestreams, low registration fees, a pedagogical day at the beginning of the conference, local vegetarian catering, and the implementation of flash-talks instead of posters. From a post-conference survey of participants, we were able to assess the effectiveness of our initiatives. Notably, we received very positive feedback from the online participants, which amounted to roughly half of the attendees, especially regarding the livestreams and talk recordings. The pedagogical day was also greatly appreciated. The low registration fees naturally led to challenges, in particular with the audio-visual management, and although areas for improvement were noted, such as poster sessions and support for attendees requiring visas, the conference was generally viewed as a success. Our experience demonstrates that highly accessible, hybrid conferences are possible within modest budgets ($\$20$k CAD), and we outline recommendations for future conferences, both in the FRB field and in other domains.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The FarView Low Frequency Radio Array on the Moon's Far Side: Science and Array Architecture</a><span class="id">[2601.16170]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>FarView is a proposed low frequency radio interferometer for deployment on the lunar far side, enabled by the Moon's radio quiet environment. Operating over 1-50 MHz inaccessible from Earth, FarView will open a new observational window and promote discovery class science in cosmology, heliophysics, Galactic and exoplanet astrophysics. The primary science is measurement of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dark Ages (z=30-100), identified by the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as a priority cosmology discovery area. FarView will deliver 3D tomographic measurements and precision power spectra of neutral hydrogen in a largely linear regime, enabling tests of inflationary initial conditions, primordial non Gaussianity, dark matter properties, neutrino masses, and early dark energy. The reference design consists of 100000 crossed dipole antennas in a dense core-halo configuration spanning 200 sq km. A compact 4 km core with 83000 dipoles maximizes sensitivity to large scale cosmological modes, while 20000 halo elements extending to 14 km provide angular resolution and calibration for foreground characterization. Sensitivity forecasts indicate a 10-sigma detection of the Dark Ages 21 cm power spectrum at z=30 over five years of half duty cycle lunar night observations. An FFT-based EPIC beamformer is identified as an efficient signal processing architecture. Beyond cosmology, FarView will enable interferometric imaging of low frequency solar radio bursts, advancing space weather studies. Additional capabilities include stellar space weather observations, Galactic cosmic ray tomography via free-free absorption, and searches for auroral radio emission from exoplanet magnetospheres, a probe of exoplanet habitability. FarView represents a flagship class opportunity to establish the Moon as a platform for foundational astrophysics while delivering unique observational capabilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14444" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estimating Soil Electrical Parameters in the Canadian High Arctic from Impedance Measurements of the MIST Antenna Above the Surface</a><span class="id">[2504.14444]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The MIST experiment aims to detect the cosmological 21-cm signal through sky observations at 25-125 MHz using a wide-beam antenna. The antenna is mounted above the soil and the beam characteristics are highly dependent on the soil's electrical properties. Accurate models for the beam obtained from electromagnetic simulations are crucial for detecting the 21-cm signal. Determining the soil properties to inform the beam simulations is therefore a very high priority for MIST. Here we report the first electrical characterization of the MIST observation site in the Canadian High Arctic, which was conducted in July, 2022. The electrical parameters were estimated using impedance measurements of the instrument's antenna, which is a very advantageous approach for MIST. Our best-fit soil model is consistent with a thawed active layer underlain by permafrost, and the parameters were estimated with a precision close to the requirements for the detection of the cosmological 21-cm signal.</p></div></details></article></body>
