This paper traces the historical development of these chiral conventions, with an emphasis on the physical quantity whose direction became the focal point of this discussion in the mid-1800s, the magnetic field. Though these standards are often reduced to mere mathematical, inconsequential choices, an analysis of the impact of Newton, Maxwell, the London Mathematical Society, and others toward the subject can enhance classroom discussion, not only as a contextual sidebar, but also by emphasizing the influence conventions in physics can have on pedagogy, communication, and scientific advancement.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is Stochastic Supervenience?</a><span class="id">[2512.18257]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Standard formulations of supervenience typically treat higher level properties as point valued facts strictly fixed by underlying base states. However, in many scientific domains, from statistical mechanics to machine learning, basal structures more naturally determine families of probability measures than single outcomes. This paper develops a general framework for stochastic supervenience, in which the dependence of higher level structures on a physical base is represented by Markov kernels that map base states to distributions over macro level configurations. I formulate axioms that secure law like fixation, nondegeneracy, and directional asymmetry, and show that classical deterministic supervenience appears as a limiting Dirac case within the resulting topological space of dependence relations. To connect these metaphysical claims with empirical practice, the framework incorporates information theoretic diagnostics, including normalized mutual information, divergence based spectra, and measures of tail sensitivity. These indices are used to distinguish genuine structural stochasticity from merely epistemic uncertainty, to articulate degrees of distributional multiple realization, and to identify macro level organizations that are salient for intervention. The overall project offers a conservative extension of physicalist dependence that accommodates pervasive structured uncertainty in the special sciences without abandoning the priority of the base level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physicists Joke</a><span class="id">[2512.17948]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work presents a reconstructed English edition of the seminal humor anthology \textbf{Physicists Joke} (\textbf{Fiziki Shutyat}), originally published in the USSR in 1966.

On its face, it repudiates many of the key features of the mechanical conception of physical reality. However, the challenge of developing a precise, coherent alternative to that conception has yet to be met. Here, I argue that a major hindrance to the project of quantum interpretation is its existing interpretative methodologies, which suffer from a lack of systematicity in their judgements about what aspects of the theory are interpretational relevant. In particular, I argue that current interpretations tend to marginalize the informal part of the theory in favour of its formal part, and place inappropriate emphasis on the natural language component of the formalism over its detailed mathematical structure. To counterbalance these biases, I propose that an interpretation-free zone be constructed around the theory, wherein an interpreter initially adopt a descriptive stance which considers all parts of the theory, and that the results of this deliberation (and the judgements about what facts are interpretationally relevant) are reported as part of their interpretation. I argue that the interpretation of quantum theory poses special challenges and difficulties which necessitate this interpretation-free zone, and that existing interpretative methodologies are insufficient to address them. Further, I argue that a reconstructive interpretative methodology, which harnesses the recent results of the quantum reconstruction program, provides a powerful means to identify almost all facts that could be interpretationally relevant, and naturally meets these challenges and difficulties. Moreover, I argue that the quantum reconstruction program offers a powerful way to discover new physical principles, and offers a systematic pathway to build a rich, coherent conception of quantum reality.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The CHSH Game, Tsirelson's Bound, and Causal Locality</a><span class="id">[2512.18105]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We reformulate the CHSH game in terms of indivisible stochastic processes. Using Barandes's stochastic-quantum correspondence and its associated definition of causal locality, we present a novel proof of the Tsirelson bound. In particular, we show that unlike the no-signaling principle alone, the postulates defining causally local, indivisible stochastic processes are precisely strong enough to allow for violations of the Bell inequality up to, but not beyond, the Tsirelson bound.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bell Nonlocality as a Covariance Obstruction in Locally Covariant Quantum Field Theory</a><span class="id">[2512.18603]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Locally covariant algebraic quantum field theory (LCQFT) satisfies Einstein causality through microcausality and operational no-signalling, yet Bell-type correlations persist in entangled field states across spacelike regions. We demonstrate that this apparent tension reflects a fundamental covariance obstruction: no assignment of classical past variables can simultaneously be covariant under spacetime embeddings, screen off quantum correlations, and reproduce AQFT statistics. This obstruction is distinct from dynamical nonlocality or signalling violations. We formalize this as a no-go theorem in the category-theoretic framework of LCQFT, showing that Bell's notion of local causality – requiring factorization conditioned on a common past – is structurally incompatible with diffeomorphism covariance. The failure of Bell locality thus reflects not a breakdown of relativistic causality but the impossibility of embedding quantum correlations into a classical causal framework without introducing preferred foliations or non-covariant beables. This clarifies the conceptual status of nonlocality in relativistic quantum theory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09950" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The meaning of &quot;Big Bang&quot;</a><span class="id">[2512.09950]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>What does “Big Bang” actually mean? What was the origin of these two words? It has often been said that the expression “Big Bang” began as an insult. Even if this were true, it would be just an irrelevant part of the whole issue. There are many more aspects hidden under this name, and which are seldom explained. They will be discussed in this work. In order to frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both Shakespeare and Eco have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. With the conclusion that names are, in general, just labels, simple stickers put to identify things. And this includes those given to great theorems or spectacular discoveries. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled to further substantiate those statements. These points will be at the heart of the investigation carried out here, concerning the very important concept of “Big Bang”. Everybody thinks to know what “the Big Bang” is, but only very few do know it, in fact. When Fred Hoyle first pronounced these two words together, on a BBC radio program, listeners were actually left with the false image that Hoyle was trying to destroy. That is, the tremendous explosion of Lemaître's primeval atom (or cosmic egg), which scattered all its enormous matter and energy content throughout the rest of the Universe. This image is absolutely wrong! As will be concluded, today the label “Big Bang” is used in several different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subsystems (in)dependence in GIE proposals</a><span class="id">[2512.17024]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent proposals suggest that detecting entanglement between two spatially superposed masses would establish the quantum nature of gravity. However, these gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) experiments rely on assumptions about subsystem independence. We sharpen the theoretical underpinnings of such proposals by examining them through the lens of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), distinguishing distinct operational and algebraic notions of independence. We argue that state and measurement independence of subsystems, essential to the experimental logic, is nontrivial in the presence of gauge constraints and gravitational dressing. Using gravitationally dressed fields, we recall that commutation relations between spacelike separated observables are nontrivial, undermining strict Hilbert space factorization. We further explore the implications for entanglement witnesses, investigating the Tsirelson bound when subsystem algebras fail to commute, and showing that the Tsirelson bound persists for a suitably symmetrized CHSH observable even though the operational status of such &quot;joint&quot; observables becomes delicate when commensurability fails. Our analysis highlights how even within linearized covariant quantum gravity, violations of microcausality may affect both the interpretation, modelling, and design of proposed laboratory tests of quantum gravity, despite remaining negligible for current experimental regimes. Although we consider GIE-style protocols as a concrete case study, the subsystem-independence issues we highlight are generic to low-energy (perturbative) quantum gravity. Finally, we derive estimates for dressing-induced microcausality violations, which suggest a complementary avenue to current proposals: in principle, bounding dressing-induced microcausality violations themselves as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity.</p></div></details></article>

We summarise each of these teaching methods and overview their advantages and disadvantages of each method.

Here we adopt an ensemble-first viewpoint in which the starting point is local probability conservation on phase space. For a probability density $\rho$ on a $2N$-dimensional symplectic manifold $(\mathcal{M},\omega)$, probability transport is expressed intrinsically with respect to the Liouville volume form $\Omega=\omega^N/N!$ through a continuity equation defined by the $\Omega$-divergence. For Hamiltonian evolution, specified by $\iota_{X_H}\omega=\mathrm{d}H$, Cartan's identity implies $\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\omega=0$ and hence $\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\Omega=0$, so the Hamiltonian flow is incompressible in the Liouville sense and the continuity law reduces to Liouville's equation. In canonical coordinates this reproduces Hamilton's equations. In particular, the canonical Poisson-bracket relations $\{q^i,p_j\}=\delta^i_{\ j}$ provide the kinematic input that fixes the evolution of observables and underlies the canonical form of the continuity equation. The same organization clarifies the distinction between conservation of total probability and preservation of fine-grained information measures (Gibbs–Shannon entropy), which holds specifically for Liouville-measure-preserving dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visualising Quantum Entanglement Using Interactive Electronic Quantum Dice</a><span class="id">[2510.04931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quantum entanglement remains a challenging concept to teach and visualise due to its microscopic and non-classical nature. We present innovative educational demonstration material consisting of electronic dice that simulate the properties of quantum entanglement through haptic interaction. The system uses displays, orientation sensors, and wireless communication to visualise key quantum mechanical principles such as superposition, measurement, and entanglement correlations. This analogy enables students to experience quantum phenomena through familiar objects, making abstract concepts more tangible. The dice support various educational scenarios, from basic entanglement demonstrations to more complex quantum key distribution experiments, and can be adapted for different educational levels from secondary school to undergraduate physics courses. Initial implementations demonstrate that the interactive nature of the Quantum Dice can help users develop an intuitive understanding of quantum mechanical principles. The low-cost, open source, and robust design makes Quantum Dice accessible to a wider range of educational institutions.</p></div></details></article>

Similar to the NASA Voyager missions sent in 1977, science probes by extraterrestrial life (artifact “technosignatures”) could be sent to explore other stellar systems like our own. In this campaign, we used the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array to observe 3I/ATLAS from 1–9 GHz. We detected nearly 74 million narrowband hits in 7.25 hr of data using the newly-developed search pipeline \texttt{bliss}. We then applied blanking in frequency and drift rate to mitigate Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) in our dataset, narrowing the dataset down to $\sim$2 million hits. These hits were further filtered by the localization code \texttt{NBeamAnalysis}, and the remaining 211 hits were visually inspected in the time-frequency domain. We did not find any signals worthy of additional follow-up. Accounting for the Doppler drift correction and given the non-detection, we are able to set an Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) upper limit of $10-110$ W on radio technosignatures from 3I/ATLAS across the frequency and drift rate ranges covered by our survey.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18903" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optical SETI at ESO in the 2040s</a><span class="id">[2512.18903]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The searches for other life and for intelligence are fundamental problems that science faces today.
