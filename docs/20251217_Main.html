Its relatively soft $\gamma$-ray spectrum peaks near 500 MeV, and since 2020 it has undergone an exceptional series of flaring episodes. The observed emission is well described by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models, with negligible contribution from external seed photons. We investigate the physical origin of BL Lacertae's $\gamma$-ray temporal and spectral variability using data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the \textit{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope, and show that this variability can be explained by a single varying parameter, namely the electrons' peak energy, $\gamma_p$, under a single-zone SSC scenario with a log-parabolic electron distribution. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo to estimate the spectral parameters of BL Lacertae over time, selected from an adaptive-binned gamma-ray light curve. We then study the correlation between the inverse Compton peak luminosity, $L_{IC}$, and the position of this peak on the SED energy axis, $E_p$, and compare it with what is expected for a single-zone SSC scenario when only one parameter is free to vary. We find a correlation $L_{IC} = 10^{42.33\pm0.15\pm0.18_{sys}}E_p^{0.98\pm0.05\pm0.06_{sys}}$, consistent, within the errors, with the linear relation $L_{\mathrm{IC}} \propto E_p$, expected when $\gamma_p$ is the only free parameter in the assumed SSC model. This result supports a minimalist SSC scenario in which changes in $\gamma_p$ dominate the observed temporal and spectral variability of BL Lacertae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the origins of high-velocity features in SNe Ia with the spectral synthesis code TARDIS</a><span class="id">[2512.13791]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Appearing as secondary higher-velocity absorption components, high-velocity features (HVFs) have been observed in several absorption lines in many Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The frequency and ubiquity of these components in silicon and calcium features specifically indicates that the mechanism through which they form must be common occurrence among the majority of SNe Ia. Here we present modelling of the HVF evolution in a sample of six well observed SNe Ia with the radiative-transfer code tardis. A base model is derived for each of the SNe to reproduce the photospheric velocity components, followed by a grid of simulations with Gaussian enhancements to the density profile at high velocities. We train a set of neural networks to emulate the impact of these density enhancements upon the simulated silicon line profile. These networks are subsequently used within a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to infer the density enhancement parameters that most closely reproduce the HVF evolution. While we obtain good matches for the silicon profile, we find that a single density enhancement alone cannot simultaneously produce the observed silicon and calcium HVF evolution. Our findings indicate that neither the delayed-detonation mechanism, nor the double-detonation mechanism can produce these HVFs, suggesting that something may be missing from the models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13804" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buried but not destroyed: the evolution from prompt cusps to NFW haloes</a><span class="id">[2512.13804]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The internal structure of dark matter haloes encodes their assembly history and offers critical insight into the nature of dark matter and structure formation. Analytical studies and high-resolution simulations have recently predicted the formation of 'prompt cusps' - steep power-law density profiles that emerge rapidly from the monolithic collapse of primordial peaks. Yet, by $z=0$ most haloes are well described by Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profiles, raising the question of how these early cusps are transformed in a cosmological setting. We address this problem using 64 zoom-in $N$-body simulations of eight haloes, each resimulated with eight different free-streaming wavenumbers to control the abundance of small-scale structure while keeping the large-scale environment fixed. To mitigate numerical discreteness effects, we classify artificial fragments and genuine subhaloes with a physically motivated procedure based on matching subhaloes to their progenitor peaks. At the population level, we demonstrate that haloes initially form prompt cusps, and their profiles subsequently transition towards the NFW form. Our study reveals three distinct pathways by which prompt cusps evolve: major mergers, accretion of artificial fragments, and interactions with large-scale filaments, each having a distinct impact on the inner density profile. In particular, we show that the original power-law cusp remains visible in the profile of particles associated with the primordial peak even when the total halo profile is already NFW-like. This work highlights the imprint of early collapse on present-day halo structure and provides new insights into the origin of the universality of the NFW profile.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Convective Core Evolution of Main-Sequence Stars in Rapid Population Synthesis I: Framework and Implementation</a><span class="id">[2512.13838]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stars spend most of their lifetime on the main sequence (MS), where hydrogen burning establishes the internal chemical structure that governs the subsequent evolution. In massive stars, mass loss through winds and binary interactions can significantly modify this structure during the MS. We present a new MS evolution framework suitable for rapid binary population synthesis, implemented in the COMPAS code. Building on the semi-analytical model of Shikauchi et al. (2025), our framework captures the evolution of the convective core on the MS under arbitrary mass-loss or mass-gain histories, including a treatment for stellar rejuvenation and MS mergers. This new framework yields more massive helium cores at terminal-age MS, more compact radii in stripped MS stars, and systematically higher black hole masses than commonly used prescriptions. By providing a more realistic treatment of MS evolution, this framework improves the physical consistency of massive stars and binary evolution in rapid population synthesis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A wide-field X-ray search for the Geminga pulsar halo with SRG/ART-XC</a><span class="id">[2512.13846]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Searches for the putative large-scale X-ray halo around the Geminga pulsar have been extensively performed using various narrow field-of-view X-ray telescopes. In this paper, we present wide-field scanning observation of Geminga with SRG/ART-XC. Our X-ray analysis provides, for the first time, direct imaging of a $3.5^\circ \times 3.5^\circ$ region in the $4-12$ keV energy band, comparable in extent to the expected Geminga emission. The ART-XC observation provides a highly uniform sky coverage without strong vignetting effects. The synchrotron X-ray halo flux was predicted using a physical model based on particle injection, diffusion, and cooling over the pulsar's lifetime, as well as the spectral and spatial properties of the synchrotron X-ray and inverse-Compton gamma-ray emissions. The model is tuned to reproduce existing multiwavelength data from X-ray upper limits and GeV to TeV gamma-ray observations. After accounting for the high particle background and its uncertainties, no significant emission is found in the assumed source region, and X-ray flux upper limits are derived. These limits are less constraining by up to a factor of three with respect to existing results obtained with narrow field-of-view telescopes and longer exposure times. Nonetheless, we place direct and independent constraints on Geminga's ambient magnetic field strength, which are compatible with other studies. Our methodology, including simulation for longer observation times, is applied for the first time to the wide field-of-view search for pulsar halos. Using extensive simulations, we also show that a 68% probability of detecting the Geminga pulsar halo can be achieved with a 20-day SRG/ART-XC exposure for a 3 $\mu G$ magnetic field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13894" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AtLAST – Cosmology with submillimetre galaxies magnification bias</a><span class="id">[2512.13894]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnification bias offers a uniquely powerful and independent route to cosmological information. As a gravitational-lensing observable, it probes galaxy-matter correlations without relying on galaxy shapes, PSF modelling, or intrinsic-alignment corrections. Its sensitivity spans both geometry and growth: magnification bias simultaneously responds to the matter density, the amplitude of structure, and the redshift evolution of dark energy (DE) below $z \leq 1$. Importantly, its parameter degeneracy directions differ from those of shear, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, making it a complementary and consistency-check probe with substantial diagnostic value for the next decade of precision cosmology. However, the current potential of magnification bias is restricted by limited sky coverage, catalogue inhomogeneities, and insufficiently precise redshift or number-count characterisation. A next-generation wide-field submillimetre facility like AtLAST – capable of uniform, deep surveys and spectroscopic mapping – would overcome these limitations and transform magnification bias into a competitive, high-precision cosmological tool.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AtLAST – Determination of Halo Mass Density Profiles at kpc Scales through Magnification Bias</a><span class="id">[2512.13895]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnification bias, the lensing-induced modification of background source number counts, provides a uniquely powerful probe of the mass density profiles of galaxies and clusters down to kpc scales. Unlike shear-based weak lensing, magnification bias does not rely on galaxy shapes and thus avoids dominant small-scale systematics. Existing studies, however, are limited by sky coverage, positional uncertainty, and insufficiently deep, confusion-limited submillimetre (submm) surveys. A next-generation wide-field, high-throughput submm facility like the proposed 50m-telescope AtLAST is required to unlock this technique's full diagnostic power.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13937" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doomed Worlds II: Reassessing Suggestions of Orbital Decay for TrES-5 b</a><span class="id">[2512.13937]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>TrES-5b is one of only three ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) with suggestions of a possibly decreasing orbital period that have persisted through multiple independent analyses (G. Maciejewski et al. 2021; S. R. Hagey et al. 2022; E. S. Ivshina &amp; J. N. Winn 2022; W. Wang et al. 2024; L. C. Yeh et al. 2024). While WASP-12 b's decreasing period is well-explained by tidally induced orbital decay (K. C. Patra et al. 2017), and stellar acceleration has been proposed for WASP-4 b (L. G. Bouma et al. 2020), the cause of the apparent trend for TrES-5 b has not been satisfactorily explained. This work extends the previous observations with 14 new ground-based transits from 2016-2024 and two newly-published midtimes for data from 2007 and 2009. Four TESS sectors (75, 77, 82, and 84) have also been included for the first time. With the new data, the case for a decreasing orbital period is much weaker than before. The revised rate of period change, dP/dt=-5.3 +/- 2.2 ms yr^-1, is less than half that was found in previous work and the preference for a quadratic over a linear model, as measured through Delta BIC_LQ, has been falling since 2020, with a current value of 11. Furthermore, these results are not robust to outliers; removing a single early transit midtime causes the effect to vanish (Delta BIC_LQ = -1). Additionally, no significant periodic signals in the transit timing data are identified. The current data are well explained by a linear ephemeris.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fermi-LAT detections of novae V1723 Sco and V6598 Sgr</a><span class="id">[2512.14198]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Numerous classical novae have been observed to emit {\gamma}-rays (E &gt; 100 MeV) detected by the Fermi-LAT. The prevailing hypothesis attributes this emission to the interaction of accelerated particles within shocks in the nova ejecta. However, the lack of non-thermal X-ray detection coincident with the {\gamma}-rays remains a challenge to this theory. Methods. We performed similar analyses of the Fermi-LAT data for both novae to determine the duration, localization, and spectral properties of the {\gamma}-ray emission. These results were compared with optical data from the AAVSO database and X-ray observations from NuSTAR, available for V1723 Sco 2024 only, to infer the nature of the accelerated particles. Finally, we used a physical emission model to extract key parameters related to particle acceleration. Results. V1723 Sco 2024 was found to be a very bright {\gamma}-ray source with an emission duration of 15 days allowing us to constrain the spectral index and the total energy of accelerated protons. Despite early NuSTAR observations, no non-thermal X-ray emission was detected simultaneously with the {\gamma}-rays. However, unexpected {\gamma}-ray and thermal hard X-ray emission were observed more than 40 days after the nova outburst, suggesting that particle acceleration can occur even several weeks post-eruption. V6598 Sgr 2023, on the other hand, was detected by the Fermi-LAT at a significance level of 4{\sigma}over just two days, one of the shortest {\gamma}-ray emission durations ever recorded, coinciding with a rapid decline in optical brightness. Finally, the high ratio of {\gamma}-ray to optical luminosities and {\gamma}-ray to X-ray luminosities for both novae, as well as the curvature of the {\gamma}-ray spectrum of V1723 Sco below 500 MeV, are all more consistent with the hadronic than the leptonic scenario for {\gamma}-ray generation in novae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing the baryon cycle in Galaxy Clusters: connecting galaxy dynamics and gas thermodynamics using (sub-)mm-wave and optical IFU surveys</a><span class="id">[2512.14238]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations in the visible and near infrared are transforming our view of the processes affecting galaxy evolution, much of which is dominated by interactions with the large scale environment.

The tidal disruption of accreting bodies is thought to form circumstellar dusty disks, whose emission spectra could offer additional insights into the mineral phases of the accreted solid material. Silicates are detected in the mid-infrared spectra of several disks, but do not fully account for the near-infrared excess in the disks' spectra. Conductive materials, such as metallic iron, are potential sources of near-infrared emissivity. We investigate the role of metallic iron within silicate dust in the observed spectra of the white dwarfs G29-38 and GD56. Using thermal emission spectra calculations, we analyze the abundance of metallic iron in the dust and the disk structure parameters that best fit the observed spectra. We find that metallic-iron-bearing dust enhances the near-infrared opacity, thereby providing a better fit to the G29-38 spectrum for various silicate compositions than metallic-iron-free dust. The best-fit metal-to-silicate mixing ratio is approximately unity, and for Mg-rich pyroxenes, this value is also consistent with G29-38's stellar atmospheric composition within 1-$\sigma$ observational uncertainties. Based on the spectral fitting and compositional consistency, Fe-rich silicates without metallic iron cannot be ruled out. The observed GD56 spectrum also favors iron-bearing dust. However, the large observational uncertainties of GD56's stellar elemental abundances hinder a precise comparison between the stellar and dust iron abundances. Upcoming high-precision JWST observations will provide a larger sample, enabling statistical analysis of the correlation between the iron abundances in the atmospheres and circumstellar dust of polluted white dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comparative study between low and high energy SOHO/ERNE protons in solar cycle 23</a><span class="id">[2512.14300]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comparison between low and high energy solar energetic protons (SEPs) as observed by the SOHO/ERNE high energy detector in solar cycle (SC) 23.

Within this inclusive perspective the spectral energy density of the gravitons is sharply suppressed in the aHz region even though the high frequency signal can be comparatively much larger both in the kHz and GHz domains. For there are no direct tests on the expansion rate prior to the formation of the light nuclei, a modified postinflationary timeline affects the total number of $e$-folds and additionally suppresses the tensor to scalar ratio by making the relic signals effectively invisible in the aHz range. The expansion rate prior to nucleosynthesis is further bounded by the evolution of the hypercharge field and the large-scale magnetism also constrains the decelerated expansion rate. The magnetogenesis requirements are compatible with a potentially detectable spectral energy density of the relic gravitons between the MHz and the THz while the tensor to scalar ratio remains suppressed in the aHz region. A maximum of the spectral energy density of the gravitons in the audio domain leads instead to a larger magnetic field when the scale of the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy (of the order of the Mpc) gets comparable with the Hubble radius before equality. Along a converse viewpoint the results obtained here imply that a long decelerated stage expanding faster than radiation does not affect the high frequency range but reduces the effective number of $e$-folds by so enhancing the tensor to scalar ratio, possibly beyond its observational limit.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of a Magnetic Flux Rope Prior to the Eruption: Insight from a Radiative MHD Simulation of Active Region Emergence</a><span class="id">[2512.14348]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) are fundamental magnetic structures in solar eruptions, whose formation is generally attributed to (1) the emergence of subsurface flux tubes or (2) flux cancellation driven by photospheric horizontal flows and magnetic reconnection. Both mechanisms can operate simultaneously during active region evolution, making their relative contributions challenging to quantify. Here, we analyze the formation of a flux rope in a MURaM radiative magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation, which formed and evolved for approximately three hours before an M-class flare. The formation process is quantified by magnetic helicity flux, which drives the non-potential evolution of magnetic field, with its advection and shear terms on the photosphere corresponding to the emergence and photospheric horizontal flows, respectively. Examining the helicity injected into the flux rope through the photosphere, we find both terms increase significantly as the eruption approaches, with the shear term prevailing overall. Height-dependent analysis of helicity flux, together with magnetic field and velocity distributions, further reveals a gradual transition from the shear to the advection term with an increasing altitude, which is driven by magnetic reconnection above the photosphere. Our results provide quantitative evidence that flux cancellation governs flux rope formation, arising naturally from magnetic field reorganization during active region evolution: as flux emergence transports magnetic flux upward, photospheric shearing motions adjust magnetic field and inject helicity into solar atmosphere, and magnetic reconnection ultimately assembles the main body of flux ropes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INTEGRAL IBIS catalog of magnetar bursts</a><span class="id">[2512.14356]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the distinctive properties of magnetars, young neutron stars powered mainly by magnetic energy, is the emission of short ($\lesssim$1 s) bursts of hard X-rays. Such bursts have been observed in nearly all the known magnetars, although at different and time-variable rates of occurrence. In the last two decades, the INTEGRAL satellite has extensively covered with good imaging capabilities the Galactic plane, where most magnetars reside. We present the results of a comprehensive search for magnetar bursts in more than twenty years of archival data of the INTEGRAL IBIS instrument (15 keV - 1 MeV). This led to the detection of 1349 bursts with 30-150 keV fluence in the $\sim2\times10^{-9} - 3\times10^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ range from 21 of the 34 examined magnetars and candidate magnetars with well known positions. The durations of the bursts, in terms of $T_{90}$, follow a lognormal distribution centered at $\sim0.1$ s. Most of the detected bursts originated from three particularly active sources: 1E 1547-5408, SGR 1806-20, and SGR 1935+2154. The integral distributions of their burst fluences follow power laws with slopes $\beta$= 0.76$\pm$0.04, 0.95$\pm$0.06, and 0.92$\pm$0.10, respectively. The burst spectra are generally well fit with an exponentially cut-off power law with peak energy $E_{peak}$ in the range $\sim20-60$ keV for SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1935+2154, while the bursts of 1E 1547-5408 are slightly harder ($E_{peak}\sim35-100$ keV). A significant anti-correlation between $E_{peak}$ and fluence is found for SGR 1806-20, which provided the largest number of bursts among the sources of our sample.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14398" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Role of Self-Gravity in Debris Disk Warp Formation: The Case of HD 110058</a><span class="id">[2512.14398]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the crucial role of self-gravity in the formation of warps in debris disks, focusing on the HD 110058 system as an example. Using advanced, GPU-accelerated $N$-body simulations, we model the gravitational dynamics of a massive planetesimal disk perturbed by an inclined, inner planet. Our simulations reveal that self-gravity fundamentally alters the disk's evolution compared to massless models. It enforces a coherent, semi-rigid precession of the disk and enables the rapid formation of a global warp structure within 0.5 Myr. The warp angle undergoes a damped oscillation, eventually settling into a quasi-equilibrium state. By generating synthetic scattered-light images, we demonstrate that our model successfully reproduces the observed S-shaped warp morphology of the debris disk in HD 110058, supporting the existence of an unseen planet. Furthermore, we derive an empirical relationship that connects the equilibrium warp angle to the physical parameters of the disk and the planet. Applying this relation to HD 110058, we constrain its disk mass to be likely less than 1,000 $M_\oplus$, offering a new dynamical perspective on the debris disk mass problem.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A sub-ppm upper limit on the cosmological variations of the fine structure constant alpha</a><span class="id">[2512.14441]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Absorption spectroscopy toward high-redshift quasars provides strong constraints on the putative variation of fundamental constants of physics on cosmological time scales. The submillimeter ground-state transitions of methylidyne (CH) and water (H2O), both molecules widespread and coeval in the interstellar medium, provide a sensitive test for variations of alpha, the fine structure constant, and mu, the proton-to-electron mass ratio, taking advantage of the unmatched spectral resolution and frequency reliability of radio techniques. We used ALMA simultaneous observations of the two species to constrain any velocity offset between their absorption profiles toward the radio-bright lensed quasars PKS1830-211 (z_abs=0.88582) and B0218+357 (z_abs=0.68466). Our observational setup minimizes instrumental errors and known sources of systematics, such as time variability of the absorption profile and frequency-dependent morphology of the background quasar. The excellent correlation between CH and H2O opacities, the large number of individual narrow velocity components, and the number of independent spectra obtained due to the intrinsic time variability of the absorption profiles ensure that even the chemical segregation bias is minimized. We obtained bulk velocity shifts delta_v = -0.048 pm 0.028 km/s and -0.13 pm 0.14 km/s (1 sigma confidence level) between CH and H2O in the direction of PKS1830-211(NE) and B0218+357(SW), respectively. These values convert into the 3sigma upper limits |Delta_alpha/alpha| &lt; 0.55 ppm and 1.5 ppm, respectively, taking into account the independent upper limits on |Delta_mu/mu| previously obtained for these systems. These constraints on |Delta_alpha/alpha|, at look-back times of about half the present age of the Universe, are two to four times deeper than previous constraints on any other single high-z system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coexistence of coagulation and streaming instabilities in protoplanetary discs</a><span class="id">[2512.14443]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The streaming instability is considered one of the leading candidates for the formation of planetesimals, due to its ability to overcome the bouncing and fragmentation barriers. The formation of dense dust clumps through this process, however, is possible provided it involves solids with dimensionless stopping times $\sim 0.1$ in standard discs, which typically corresponds to 1-10 cm-sized particles. This implies that dust coagulation is required for the SI to be an efficient process. Here, we employ unstratified, shearing-box simulations combined with a moment equation for solving the coagulation equation to examine the effect of dust growth on the SI. In dust-rich discs with a dust-to-gas ratio $\epsilon\gtrsim 1$, coagulation is found to have little impact on the SI; while in dust-poor discs with $\epsilon\sim 0.01$, we observe the formation of vertically extended filaments through the action of the coagulation instability (CI), which is triggered due to the dependence of coagulation efficiency on dust density. For moderate dust-to-gas ratios $\epsilon\sim 0.1$ and Stokes numbers $St \lesssim 0.1$, we find onset of the SI within these filaments, with a linear growth rate significantly higher compared to standard SI. We refer to this regime as coagulation-assisted SI. The synergy between both instabilities in that case leads to isotropic turbulence and dust concentrations that are increased by a factor of $30-40$. As dust continues to grow, SI tends to overcome the effect of the CI such that the nonlinear saturation phase is similar to pure SI. Our results suggest that coagulation, by simply increasing dust size, may facilitate the formation of dense clumps through the SI; even though it has only little effect on its nonlinear evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial features and low-$\ell$ suppression from isocurvature modes in multi-field Higgs-$R^2$ inflation</a><span class="id">[2512.14455]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study primordial perturbations in Higgs-$R^2$ inflation in the presence of a non-minimal kinetic mixing between the Higgs and the scalaron. By performing a full numerical integration of the multifield background and linear perturbations, we identify distinct dynamical regimes controlled by the non-minimal coupling $\xi_h$. For $\xi_h \sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$, the turning rate of the inflationary trajectory induces transient multifield effects that imprint localized features in the scalar power spectrum. In the limit $\xi_h\ll 1$, the adiabatic spectrum becomes featureless, but isocurvature modes fail to fully decay, leaving a residual contribution at the end of inflation. We compute CMB angular power spectra TT, TE, EE and show how these regimes yield distinct observational signatures, delineating the parameter space compatible with current bounds. Our results highlight that suppressing spectral features does not guarantee the elimination of isocurvature perturbations, placing non-trivial constraints on Higgs-$R^2$ multifield realizations and motivating future probes sensitive to primordial isocurvature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14460" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The quest for Magrathea planets. II. Orbital stability of exoplanets formed around double white dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2512.14460]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planetary formation might occur at different stages of the stellar evolution of compact binaries. In recent years, the formation of second-generation planets has been tested in circumbinary discs formed by the ejection of stellar material from double white dwarf (DWD) binaries. In these environments, planets ranging from sub-Neptunian to giant masses can form and migrate to within 1 au of the central binary. Nevertheless, studies on the orbital stability of such systems have yet to be undertaken. In this work, we use N-body simulations to study the stability of multi-planet systems formed around compact DWDs in both resonant and non-resonant configurations over timescales of a few million years. We track the occurrence of catastrophic events and employ a variety of metrics, e.g., orbital spacing, centre-of-mass variations and Normalized Angular Momentum Deficit, to explore the outcomes of their evolution. Furthermore, we evaluate the potential for detecting these systems in their final configurations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission by measuring the overall gravitational-wave frequency shift amplitude induced by their planets. Our results show that planets orbiting DWDs can be stable over the studied timescales. While planetary systems starting with two-planets are more likely to survive unaltered, planetary systems with three, four or five planets, experience catastrophic events that cause them to lose some of their original planets, ending up hosting only two surviving planets in the majority of cases. This increases the number of two-planet systems by 122% with respect to their initial abundance and creates a single-planet population amounting to 7% of the totality of systems. The majority of these single-planet systems are potential candidates for LISA. Concerning multi-planet systems, a handful of systems could be detected.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14479" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A one-parameter two-zone leptonic model for the blazar sequence</a><span class="id">[2512.14479]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Blazars, a subclass of radio-loud active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets aligned close to our line of sight, emit highly variable non-thermal radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. The physical origin of their emission and the blazar sequence remain open questions. We present a self-consistent two-zone leptonic model in which relativistic electrons accelerate in a compact region, losing energy via synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, and escape into a larger zone permeated by an external photon field associated with magnetohydrodynamic winds from the accretion disk. By varying only the mass accretion rate onto the central black hole, the model naturally reproduces the blazar sequence, including Compton Dominance, $\gamma$-ray spectral indices, and the positions of synchrotron and inverse Compton peaks, while variations in secondary parameters account for the observed spread in the data. Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars exhibit strong external Compton emission from the extended zone, whereas BL Lac objects are dominated by synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission from the compact acceleration region. This framework highlights the key role of accretion rate and spatially structured emission zones in shaping blazar spectra and provides a unified interpretation of their diverse phenomenology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14509" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbits of Twelve Multiple Stars</a><span class="id">[2512.14509]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inner and outer orbits in twelve hierarchical stellar systems are determined using high-resolution speckle imaging, radial velocities, or both.

They are also the most active annual shower, enabling detailed studies of the dependence of their physical and mechanical properties on mass. We calculated the fragmentation cascades of 39 bright Geminid fireballs, as well as faint video meteors, to derive fragmentation pressures and other physical properties characterizing the meteoroids, such as their bulk densities. Our goal is to describe the mechanical properties across a broad range of initial masses and explain the cause of the observed behavior. We used a physical fragmentation model with a semiautomatic method based on parallel genetic algorithms to fit the radiometric and regular light curve and dynamics data. We also calculated the thermal stress of model bodies with the type of physical properties and trajectories as the observed Geminids. Then, we compared the outcomes of these simulations to our observations. We find that the Geminids are probably cracked by thermal stress in the atmosphere first and then eroded by mechanical forces. The most compact Geminids are in the 20-200 g mass range. The largest observed meteoroids have a wide range of grain sizes, from about 20 um to large, non-fragmenting parts of 1-20 mm in size. The derived bulk densities range from about 1400 to 2800 kg/m3 for smaller meteoroids and approach the assumed grain density of 3000 kg/m3 for larger Geminids.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The stellar activity-rotation-age relationship under the lens of asteroseismology</a><span class="id">[2512.14517]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In low-mass stars, the connection between magnetic activity, rotation period, and age provides key insights into the functioning of dynamos. Fully understanding the activity-rotation-age relationship requires stars with precise fundamental parameters, measured rotation periods, and reliable magnetic activity indicators (e.g. X-ray luminosity). Thanks to space-based photometry, asteroseismology is now the leading method for determining stellar parameters with unprecedented precision and accuracy. The best-characterized solar-like stars compose the Kepler LEGACY sample, with highest-quality asteroseismic data for 66 stars, most of which have measured rotation periods. In the X-ray band, these stars were observed by the ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) telescope on the Russian Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) satellite in the course of its all-sky survey. We reviewed different components of the stellar activity-rotation-age relationship using the largest sample of solar-like stars with highly accurate fundamental parameters from asteroseismology, along with measured rotation periods and X-ray luminosities. We cross-correlated the Kepler LEGACY sample with the SRG/eROSITA source catalogue, finding X-ray detections for 13 of them. We derived their fundamental parameters using the Forward and Inversion COmbination procedure and revisited widely studied activity-age and activity-rotation relationships by consistently incorporating our 13-star subsample with literature samples. By implementing revised activity-rotation-age relationships in a Star-Planet Interaction code to compute X-ray luminosity tracks and comparing the results with observations, we found improved agreement for 7 stars of our subsample. We explored the effect of the revised relationships on the mass loss of planets in the radius valley, finding a modest impact on planet size distributions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A network for solar optical observations in Bulgaria</a><span class="id">[2512.14553]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The report presents a new initiative for the development of a network of ground-based stations for solar observations in the optical range.

In the case of the $Q(z)$ parametrization, we have also tested the particular case of a constant interaction term, $Q(z)=Q_0$. In order to constrain the free parameters of these models, we have used Cosmic Chronometers (CC), SNe Ia data (Pantheon+&amp;SH0ES) and BAO data.

Over more than 20 years of operation, the Pierre Auger Observatory has delivered invaluable insights into the modeling of hadronic interactions at energies beyond human-made particle accelerators. Notably, predictions from current models of hadronic interactions yield a muon deficit that becomes more pronounced with energy when compared to measurements. Presently, the interpretation of the nuclear mass composition estimated from the muon content is in tension with that from direct measurements of the depth of the maximum of electromagnetic profiles. Yet, the measured fluctuations of the muon content of air showers are in agreement with model predictions. These findings hint at small deviations in hadronic models that accumulate throughout the whole shower development rather than at large errors in the calculation of the first hadronic interactions. Also, in an independent, data-driven analysis, we show that the muon deficit can be alleviated if we allow a shift of the predicted depth of the maximum of air-shower profiles by 30 -50 g cm$^{-2}$ towards a heavier mass composition. More recently, we have also provided an updated measurement of the proton-proton cross-section at a center-of-mass energy of 57 TeV and the first estimates of the neutron content of air showers by exploiting late-time signals from the surface scintillator detectors of AugerPrime, the present upgrade of the Observatory. With the advent of AugerPrime, we expect to deliver breakthrough results on the 100 TeV-scale hadronic interactions in the next decade.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selection and characterisation of the M-dwarf targets in the PLATO Input Catalogue</a><span class="id">[2512.14593]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ESA's PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of Stars (PLATO) mission aims to detect planets orbiting around dwarfs and subgiant stars with spectral type F5 or later, including M-dwarfs. The PLATO Input Catalogue (PIC) contains all targets available for observation by the nominal science. The latest version, PIC2.1.0.1, focuses on the Southern PLATO field, named LOPS2, selected as the first long observation field, and includes the P4 sample, one of the four target samples outlined in the Science Requirement Document. P4 includes the M-dwarfs with magnitudes V &lt; 16 located within LOPS2. A characterisation of the M-dwarfs in the PIC is essential for assessing their potentiality to host exoplanets, and eventually estimate the hosted planet(s) properties. The purpose of this paper is to describe how we selected the P4 M-dwarf targets, and obtained their fundamental parameters and properties. In this work, we introduce the P4 sample and detail the methodologies adopted for the measurement of their stellar parameters. Based on a statistical analysis of the P4 sample, we assess both the photometric and volume completeness, and classify the stellar populations according to their Galactic spatial-velocity components. The adopted stellar parameters are validated by comparison with independent methods from the literature used to estimate stellar radii. The P4 sample is compliant with the PLATO science requirements. Being magnitude limited, its volume completeness decreases going towards distances larger than 30 pc, where late-type targets are progressively less covered. The observed large spread in the colour-magnitude diagram is likely due to the combination of several effects such as metallicity, age, binarity and activity. The strategy we adopted for deriving stellar parameters provides results consistent with those obtained in the literature with different and independent methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From the Solar System to cosmological distances: a complete formalism for gravitational wave astrometry</a><span class="id">[2512.14668]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The presence of a gravitational wave background (GWB) can be established not only via exquisitely precise pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements, but also via astrometric observations.

In this work we provide a framework that allows to derive the displacement of sources overcoming the usually adopted “infinite distance” approximation. We also present how this formalism can be used to study the displacements of objects at distances comparable to the GW wavelength, as asteroids, and of objects with a non-trivial three-dimensional distribution, as stars in the Milky Way. Thus, it can be used to probe frequencies beyond PTA experiments, reaching the mHz GWs, also detectable by LISA. We forecast the capability of observing the astrometric deflection induced by a GWB evaluating the harmonic signal-to-noise ratio including correlations between different probes.

We derive analytical bounds for successful leptogenesis with a global and a local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, separately finding an absolute lower bound on the lightest right-handed neutrino mass $M_1 &gt; 1.74 \times 10^{8}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for thermal initial conditions and $M_1 &gt; \mathcal{O}(10^{6})\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for non-thermal initial conditions.

Full flavour effects are included, and crucially, we determine the region where successful leptogenesis can be probed through gravitational-wave observations in upcoming experiments such as LISA and Einstein Telescope.

Limits on these interactions can be obtained by demanding that their emission from the stellar interior does not lead to excessive energy loss. An intriguing question is whether the same microphysical couplings can also be probed through neutron star superradiance, in which gravitationally bound bosonic modes grow exponentially by extracting rotational energy from the star. Although both processes originate from boson-matter interactions, they probe very different kinematic regimes. Stellar cooling probes boson emission at thermal wavelengths, while superradiance is governed by modes whose wavelength is comparable to or greater than the size of the star. Previous work has attempted to relate the microphysical neutron-nucleon scattering and inverse-bremsstrahlung absorption rates directly to the macroscopic growth rate of superradiant bound states. In this work, we re-examine this connection and show that a naive extrapolation of the microphysical absorption rate to the superradiant regime would imply superradiant rates comparable to astrophysical timescales characterised by pulsar spindown. These naive rates are especially high for vector fields. However, we demonstrate that this conclusion changes once collective multiple-scattering effects in dense nuclear matter are taken into account. Repeated nucleon collisions modify the effective low-energy absorption experienced by the bosonic bound state, strongly suppressing the rate relevant for superradiance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum Walks and Exact RG in de Sitter Space</a><span class="id">[2512.13842]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The local physics of light scalar fields in de Sitter space is well described by classical random walks, as expressed through the framework of Stochastic Inflation.

Yet, this description is incomplete. For example, the quantum dynamics of these fields are expected to become important when determining the tail of the probability distribution for the fluctuations. In this paper, we develop the understanding of fields in de Sitter as a quantum walk in order to bridge the gap between the classical and quantum description. We use the framework of exact RG to calculate the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix of the long wavelength fields. This master equation provides the direct map from light fields to models of quantum walks. We show how to reduce the master equation to Stochastic Inflation, and provide a new understanding of how the higher-order corrections arise. In the process, we demonstrate that divergences and secular growth in de Sitter, for both light and heavy fields, can be absorbed by (dynamical) renormalization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Role of Microstate Degeneracy in Phase Transitions: Gravitational Waves from Bubble Entanglement</a><span class="id">[2512.13947]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Vacuum bubbles, formed in first order phase transitions, have important implications for cosmology. In particular, they source gravitational waves. Usually, it is assumed that, once bubbles are materialized, their state, further evolution and mergers are well-described classically. This paper will show that this intuition breaks down for bubbles which possess high microstate degeneracy. This is generic when the phase transition breaks spontaneously a symmetry. First, the degeneracy enhances the transition rate. Furthermore, the internal quantum state of the bubbles profoundly affects the classical dynamics of their mergers. A bubble, no matter how macroscopic, is born in a maximally entangled quantum state. This state can be viewed as a symmetric superposition of many different would-be classical bubbles. The inner entanglement is largely maintained up until their mergers. The resulting true quantum dynamics of the merger is macroscopically different from any type of classical mergers. These differences are imprinted as macroscopic features in the resulting classical gravitational waves. In this way, the inner microstate entanglement of merging bubbles provides a qualitatively new source of gravitational waves. This phenomenon is quantified and compared with the swift memory burden effect in black hole mergers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inspiral-Transition-Plunge Gravitational Waveforms Beyond Kerr: A Kerr-Newman Case Study</a><span class="id">[2512.14156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binary black hole mergers with asymmetric component masses are key targets for both third-generation ground-based and future space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, offering unique access to the strong-field dynamics of gravity. The evolution is commonly divided into three stages: the adiabatic inspiral, the transition, and the plunge. To date, constructions of inspiral-transition-plunge waveforms have largely focused on Schwarzschild or Kerr background spacetimes. In this paper, we extend these efforts to spacetimes beyond Kerr by constructing such waveforms in a Kerr-Newman background. For simplicity, we allow the primary black hole to carry spin and charge while keeping the secondary object neutral and non-spinning. We work in the small charge-to-mass ratio regime and adopt the Dudley-Finley approximation, in which the gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations decouple. In particular, the gravitational sector satisfies a Teukolsky-like equation, enabling only minimal modifications relative to the Kerr case when constructing the waveform. Having the inspiral-transtion-plunge waveforms in hand, we studied observational prospects for constraining the charge of the central black hole. We find that, for intermediate-mass-ratio mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope, explicitly modeling the post-inspiral dynamics significantly tightens charge-to-mass ratio constraints. In particular, the bounds on the charge-to-mass ratio can reach $O(10^{-3})$ in the region of primary masses and spins where the post-inspiral signal dominates, yielding charge bounds that can be orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from the inspiral alone or from the current bound with GW150914. These results lay the groundwork for inspiral-transition-plunge waveform modeling in beyond-Kerr spacetimes and for probing non-Kerr signatures in future GW observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Bounds on Scotogenic Model with Asymmetric Mediator</a><span class="id">[2512.14271]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study cosmological constraints on the asymmetric mediator scenario, a variant of the scotogenic model that addresses the origins of neutrino masses, dark matter (DM), and the baryon asymmetry.

We evaluate the DM relic abundance by solving the Boltzmann equations including $\eta$ decay and scattering processes prior to the freeze-out of the $\eta$ asymmetry, and show Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints from late-time $\eta$ decays.

The confinement phase transition is described with an effective Polyakov loop model, using the latest lattice data as an input. In particular, recent lattice studies clarified the large-$N$ scaling of the surface tension, which we incorporate through a modification of the kinetic term. We demonstrate that the thin-wall approximation agrees with the Polyakov loop model at small $N$ while it breaks down at large $N$. Furthermore, we include reliable estimates of the bubble wall velocity using a recently developed framework based on a large enthalpy jump at the phase transition. Altogether, this allows us to derive the gravitational wave signals for all $SU(N)$ confinement phase transitions and clarifies the behaviour at large $N$. The strongest signal arises for $N=20$, but overall the predicted signals remain rather weak. Our work paves the way for future studies of other gauge groups and systems with fermions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14649" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stochastic Inflation in Numerical Relativity</a><span class="id">[2512.14649]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A set of 3+1 equations for stochastic inflation incorporating all metric and scalar matter degrees of freedom, first presented in previous work, are re-derived in a gauge invariant manner.

While the lensed CMB aids in constraining cosmological parameters, it simultaneously smooths the original CMB's features. The angular power spectrum of the unlensed CMB showcases sharper acoustic peaks and more pronounced damping tails, enhancing the precision of inferring cosmological parameters that influence these aspects. Although delensing diminishes the $B$-mode power spectrum, it facilitates the pursuit of primordial gravitational waves and enables a lower variance reconstruction of lensing and additional sources of secondary CMB anisotropies. In this work, we explore the potential of deep learning techniques, specifically the U-Net++ algorithm, to play a pivotal role in CMB delensing. We analyze three fields, namely $T$, $Q$, and $U$ sky maps, present the angular power spectra of the CMB delensed $TT$, $EE$, $BB$, and $TE$, and compare them with the unlensed CMB angular power spectra. Our findings reveal that the angular power spectrum of the lensed CMB, processed by U-Net++, closely aligns with that of the unlensed CMB. Thus, U-Net++ based CMB delensing proves to be effective in mitigating the impacts of weak gravitational lensing, paving the way for enhancing the CMB delensing power spectrum in forthcoming CMB experiments.

Such model is believed to be more physically consistent than models of interacting dark energy considered in previous works. Constraints were made for three types of interaction. The first two are the types which are often considered in other works on interacting dark energy. The third type has the non-linear dependence on densities of dark components and is studied for the first time. Observational constraints on Hubble constant $H_{0}$ for the first two models are in strong disagreement with so called local measurements of $H_{0}$. And the third model is in better agreement with local measurements than $\Lambda$CDM model.

PSP observed an unusual velocity-dispersion signature: particles below $\sim$1 MeV exhibited a normal velocity dispersion, while higher-energy particles displayed an inverse velocity arrival feature, with the most energetic particles arriving later than those at lower energies. The maximum energy increased from about 20-30 MeV upstream to over 60 MeV downstream of the shock. The arrival of SEPs at PSP was significantly delayed relative to the expected onset of the eruption. In contrast, SolO detected a typical large SEP event characterized by a regular velocity dispersion at all energies up to 100 MeV. To understand these features, we simulate particle acceleration and transport from the shock to the observers with our newly developed SEP model - Particle ARizona and MIchigan Solver on Advected Nodes (PARMISAN). Our results reveal that the inverse velocity arrival and delayed particle onset detected by PSP originate from the time-dependent diffusive shock acceleration processes. After shock passage, PSP's magnetic connectivity gradually shifted due to its high velocity near perihelion, detecting high-energy SEPs streaming sunward. Conversely, SolO maintained a stable magnetic connection to the strong shock region where efficient acceleration was achieved. These results underscore the importance of spatial and temporal dependence in SEP acceleration at interplanetary shocks, and provide new insights to understand SEP variations in the inner heliosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The spin-orbit alignment hypothesis in millisecond pulsars</a><span class="id">[2507.13893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are spun up during their accretion phase in a binary system. The exchange of angular momentum between the accretion disk and the star tends to align the spin and orbital angular momenta on a very short time scale compared to the accretion stage. In this work, we study a subset of $\gamma$-ray MSPs in binaries for which the orbital inclination angle $i$ has been accurately constrained thanks to the Shapiro delay measurements. Our goal is to constrain the observer viewing angle $\zeta$ and to check whether it agrees with the orbital inclination angle $i$, in other words if $\zeta \approx i$. We use a Bayesian inference technique to fit the MSP $\gamma$-ray light curves based on the third $\gamma$-ray pulsar catalogue (3PC). The emission model relies on the striped wind model deduced from force-free neutron star magnetosphere simulations. We found good agreement between the two angles $i$ and $\zeta$ for a significant fraction of our sample, about four fifth, confirming the spin-orbit alignment scenario during the accretion stage. However about one fifth of our sample deviates significantly from this alignment. The reasons are manifold: either the $\gamma$-ray fit is not reliable or some precession and external torque avoid an almost perfect alignment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of CO$_2$, CO, and H$_2$O in the atmosphere of the warm sub-Saturn HAT-P-12b</a><span class="id">[2507.18722]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The chemical composition of warm gas giant exoplanet atmospheres (with Teq &lt; 1000 K) is not well known due to the lack of observational constraints. HAT-P-12 b is a warm, sub-Saturn-mass transiting exoplanet that is ideal for transmission spectroscopy. One transit of HAT-P-12 b was observed with JWST NIRSpec in the 2.87–5.10 $\mu$m range with a resolving power of $\sim$1000. The JWST data are combined with archival observations from HST WFC3 covering the 1.1–1.7 $\mu$m range. The data were analysed using two data reduction pipelines and two atmospheric retrieval tools. Atmospheric simulations using chemical forward models were performed. CO2, CO, and H2O are detected at 12.2, 4.1, and 6.0 $\sigma$ confidence, respectively. Their volume mixing ratios are consistent with an atmosphere of $\sim10\times$ solar metallicity and production of CO2 by photochemistry. CH4 is not detected and seems to be lacking, which could be due to a high intrinsic temperature with strong vertical mixing or other phenomena. SO2 is also not detected and its production seems limited by low upper atmosphere temperatures ($\sim$500 K at $P&lt;10^{-3}$ bar derived from one-dimensional retrievals), insufficient to produce it in detectable quantities ($\gtrsim$ 800 K required according to photochemical models). Retrievals indicate the presence of clouds between 2 and 269 mbar. This study points towards an atmosphere for HAT-P-12 b that could be enriched in carbon and oxygen with respect to its host star. When including the production of CO2 via photochemistry, an atmospheric metallicity that is close to Saturn's can explain the observations. Metallicities inferred for other gas giant exoplanets based on their CO2 mixing ratios may need to account for its photochemical production pathways. This may impact studies on mass-metallicity trends and links between exoplanet atmospheres, interiors, and formation history.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can Big Black Holes Merge with the Smallest Black Holes?</a><span class="id">[2508.14159]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational-wave measurements of the binary black hole population provide insights into the evolution of merging binaries. We explore potential correlation between mass and mass ratio with phenomenological population models where the minimum mass of the smaller (secondary) black hole can change with the mass of the bigger (primary) black hole. We use binary black hole signals from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog with and without the relatively extreme mass-ratio GW190814. When excluding GW190814, models with a variable minimum mass are disfavoured compared to one with a constant minimum mass, with log Bayes factors of -2.49 to -0.98, indicating that the biggest black holes can merge with the smallest. When including GW190814, a parabola model that allows the minimum mass to decrease with increasing primary mass is favoured over a constant minimum-mass model with a log Bayes factor of 4.44. When allowing the minimum mass to decrease, the overall population distributions remain similar whether or not GW190814 is included. This shows that with added model flexibility, we can reconcile potential outlier observations within our population. These investigations motivate further explorations of correlations between mass ratio and component masses in order to understand how evolutionary processes may leave an imprint on these distributions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Impact of Spectroscopic Redshift Errors on Cosmological Measurements</a><span class="id">[2508.21182]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spectroscopic redshift errors, including redshift uncertainty and catastrophic failures, can bias cosmological measurements from galaxy redshift surveys at sub-percent level. In this work, we investigate their impact on the full-shape analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift uncertainty introduces a scale-dependent damping effect on the power spectrum, which is absorbed by counterterms in clustering model, keeping parameter biases below $5\%$. Catastrophic failures suppress the power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor that scales with the catastrophic rate $f_c$. While this effect is negligible for DESI galaxy populations ($f_c=1\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift uncertainty with $f_c=5\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in cosmological constraints. In this case, we observe $6\%$ to $16\%$ shifts ($\sim2.2\sigma$ level) in estimating the fractional growth rate $df\equiv f/f^{\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\ln(10^{10} A_{s})$. Applying the correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum mitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new degeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value restores the constraining power with a modest bias of $1.0\sigma$. Our results indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \textit{Euclid}, at minimum accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model are essential to get unbiased cosmological inference. Extending to evolving dark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, redshift errors do not bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but can degrade constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$ by up to 80% in the worst case.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06437" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Particle acceleration up to the synchrotron burn-off limit in relativistic magnetized turbulence</a><span class="id">[2509.06437]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In high-energy astrophysics, interpreting observed spectra hinges on understanding the competition between energy gains and radiative losses. To progress along these lines, we report on particle-in-cell simulations of particle acceleration in relativistic, magnetized turbulent pair plasmas including synchrotron radiative losses. Our key finding is that the particle energy spectrum does not terminate at this maximal energy but extends beyond with a steepened spectrum, up to the synchrotron burn-off limit where particles cool within a gyrotime. For our adopted parameters (magnetization $\sigma \approx 1 $ and amplitude $\delta B/B_0\simeq 1$), the particle distribution follows ${\rm d}n/{\rm d}\gamma\propto \gamma^{-s}$ with $s\simeq 3$ below the predicted maximal energy, then steepens to $s\simeq 4$ above. The particle distribution and the radiated synchrotron spectra display strong variability near the cutoff energy down to timescales well below the largest eddy turn-around time. We substantiate our results by demonstrating that the acceleration rate itself displays a broken powerlaw-like distribution whose maximal value is the gyrofrequency. The highest energy particles are accelerated by a generalized Fermi process in ideal electric fields, driven by a gradient of the $4$–velocity field $u_E$ of the magnetic field lines of relativistic amplitude, $\delta u_E \gtrsim c$, ordered on a scale comparable to the particle gyroradius. We contend that this is a generic feature of relativistic, large-amplitude turbulence. Lastly, we apply our results to the Crab nebula, which exhibits a hierarchy of characteristic Lorentz factors similar to that studied here. We conclude that stochastic acceleration in this environment is a promising mechanism for explaining the highest-energy part of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution, and its variability.

We therefore develop a new analytical fitting function that captures two critical effects that have previously been neglected: distinct Ly$\alpha$ and Si III line profiles, and a variable ratio for coeval Ly$\alpha$ and Si III optical depths. In contrast to earlier work, we also predict amplitudes for the Si III power spectrum and Ly$\alpha$–Si III cross power spectrum that decrease toward lower redshift due to the hardening metagalactic UV background spectrum at $z\lesssim 3.5$.

While probing the HI gas over cosmic time has improved our understanding, direct HI detection with the redshifted 21 cm line is essentially limited to $z\lesssim 0.42$. Detections beyond this redshift are based on stacking to obtain average HI mass of galaxy populations. Gravitational lensing by the cluster lenses enhances the HI signal and can extend the redshift limit further. In this work, we describe simulations of HI lensing in cluster lenses. We explore the feasibility of detecting strongly lensed HI emission from background galaxies using known $50$ cluster lenses within the uGMRT sky coverage. We demonstrate that certain clusters offer a strong likelihood of HI detection. We also investigate how strong lensing distorts the HI spectral lines. The shape of the HI signal in these lensing models provides useful information and can be used in optimising signal extraction in blind and targeted HI surveys. We find that blind detection of HI signal from galaxies in the redshift range up to $1.58$ requires more than a few hundred hours of observations of individual clusters with the uGMRT. Detecting HI emission in galaxies with strong optical lensing seems promising, with a $5\sigma$ detection potential in less than 50 hours for Abell 370 and 75 hours for Abell 1703 using the uGMRT.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07253" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST-TST High Contrast: Medium-resolution spectroscopy reveals a carbon-rich circumplanetary disk around the young accreting exoplanet Delorme 1 AB b</a><span class="id">[2510.07253]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Young accreting planetary-mass objects are thought to draw material from a circumplanetary disk (CPD) composed of gas and dust.

We conducted spectroscopic observations with JWST/MIRI to investigate the presence of circumplanetary material around this young, accreting planet, and to characterize the planet's atmospheric properties and composition. We perform forward modeling using atmospheric models to characterize the planet's atmosphere. Beyond 10 microns, the SED becomes dominated by this CPD rather than the planet itself. We detect strong emission from HCN and C$_2$H$_2$, while no O-bearing species are observed in the CPD spectrum, suggesting the gas in the CPD has an elevated C/O. We also identify spatially extended H$_2$ emission around the planet, tracing warm gas, with indications that it may be at a higher temperature than the non-extended component. The mid-infrared spectrum of the planetary-mass companion Delorme 1 AB b reveals the first detection of bright C-bearing species in a CPD, together with an outflow traced by H$_2$ extended emission, that could be interpreted as a disk wind. The hot dust continuum emission suggests an inner cavity in the CPD. The presence of warm gas in the CPD provides constraints on the disk's chemical composition and physical conditions, opening up new avenues for disk studies. The study of these long-lived &quot;Peter Pan&quot; disks will enhance our understanding of how accretion persists in evolved low-mass systems, shedding light on their formation, longevity, and evolutionary pathways in planetary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17192" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parametric strong lensing model of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 from Euclid and MUSE observations</a><span class="id">[2510.17192]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new high precision parametric strong lensing total mass reconstruction of the Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) galaxy cluster Abell 2390, at redshift z = 0.231.

Using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we quantify the mass and radial dependence of baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum by selectively replacing halos in the collisionless run with their full-physics counterparts. We find that group-scale halos with $\log M_{\rm 200m}/h^{-1}M_\odot \in[13, 14]$ dominate the suppression, contributing a large fraction of the total reduction in power at $k\sim2-30\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.

We construct two ephemeris models for each target: a linear ephemeris and a shrinking orbital period due to tidal decay. The linear ephemeris is preferred for three of the four models - the highest significance for the quadratic ephemeris is over 3-sigma for WASP-173. We compare these results to theoretical predictions for tidal dissipation of gravity waves in radiation zones, and find that wave breaking is predicted only in WASP-173, making rapid decay plausible in this system but unclear in the other three. The sensitivity of transit timings to orbital decay depends on the square of the time interval covered by available observations, so our results establish a useful baseline against which future measurements can be compared. NGTS-6 and NGTS-10 are important objects for future study as they are in the first field to be observed by the upcoming PLATO mission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08495" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supervised Classification of LEO Debris Families Using Multi-Set Proper Elements</a><span class="id">[2512.08495]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Machine learning techniques using proper elements to reconnect families of satellite fragmentation debris have recently advanced, becoming key to space sustainability and domain awareness. However, an evolving circumterrestrial environment may limit their applicability, particularly when models are trained on outdated debris representations. In this work, we devise a computational pipeline using synthetic fragmentation data from explosive breakup events, generated via a Standard Breakup Model and propagated under a high-fidelity dynamical model. Proper elements are extracted using adapted algorithms for modified equinoctial (MEE), Poincar'e (PNC), and quaternion (QTN) sets. Extending beyond previous approaches limited to MEE space, we include PNC and QTN sets to broaden the dynamical fingerprints available to the classifier. Neural networks trained on various element combinations are used to determine if fragment pairs share a parent. Crucially, we identify a fundamental limitation when applying standard quaternion sets to neural networks: the loss of orbital size information during feature normalization. We introduce an augmented representation (QTN$_p$) that explicitly restores the semi-latus rectum, improving accuracy from 0.31 to 0.60 compared to the standard set. In synthetic Starlink-like LEO experiments, expanding proper-element sets generally improves discrimination. The best model, using a joint feature set (MEE + PNC + QTN), achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.858 compared to 0.789 for the MEE-only baseline, alongside higher accuracy and F1 scores.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The magnetic origin of the outer boundary of sunspots</a><span class="id">[2512.11160]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Sunspot boundaries are commonly outlined by contours of the continuum intensity. However, their magnetic nature has not yet been fully characterised. Aims. We investigate the properties of the outer boundary of a long-lived sunspot to identify the magnetic property that defines it. Methods. We analysed the magnetic properties of AR NOAA11591 spot during its two passages across the solar disc, using SDO/HMI continuum intensity and magnetic field, and determined their contours to outline the outer boundary. Results. During the 1st disc passage, in which the sunspot is in its stable phase, the intensity contours at 0.9 of the mean quiet Sun intensity and isocontours of the magnetic field strength of 625G provide an almost perfect match between the two contours. With these thresholds, the time-averaged area of mismatch is minimised, yielding an average distance between the contours of 0.58 pixel, corresponding to less than 0.26 arcsec. During the 2nd disc passage, the spot shows clear signs of decay, and we find that the 0.9 intensity and 625G magnetic isocontours detach from each other, coupled to the disappearance of penumbra. In this super-equipartition area, granulation still operates. Conclusions. Based on a comparison with simulation data from our previous work, and in agreement with findings of other authors, we conclude that the outer boundary of stable sunspots is defined by an invariant magnetic field: the equipartition field. From the discrepancy between intensity and magnetic contours during the decaying phase of the sunspot, we surmise that alongside the well-established (magneto-)convective regimes of the photosphere - granular, penumbral, and umbral - a super-equipartition granular regime can be identified. In this regime, bright, but smaller granules occur where the magnetic field exceeds equipartition but remains sub-critical for convection suppression.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12481" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Readdressing the contribution of photonuclear reactions to the muon content of extensive air showers: a heuristic approach</a><span class="id">[2512.12481]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The indirect ground-based observations of cosmic rays through extensive air showers in modern experiments typically involve the use of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the characteristics of the primary particles. These simulations necessitate assumptions about particle interactions at energies that have not yet been experimentally probed, which introduces systematic uncertainties in key observables, particularly the number of muons. Current research on this uncertainty primarily focuses on hadronic interaction models, the dominant source of muon production. This study presents an approach that takes into account another significant mechanism for muon generation: photonuclear reactions. A robust heuristic technique has been developed to estimate the contribution of these interactions to the total number of muons over a wide range of extensive air shower parameters (including primary particle type, energy, and slant atmospheric depth) and photonuclear interaction models, with an absolute percentage error on the order of $10\%$ in the estimated number of muons. Furthermore, several potential applications of the suggested method in relation to modern challenges in extensive air shower physics are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial black holes as cosmic expansion accelerators</a><span class="id">[2502.18352]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a novel and natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) exhibiting repulsive behavior. Using a new “Swiss Cheese” cosmological approach, we demonstrate that this cosmic acceleration mechanism is a general phenomenon by examining three regular black hole spacetimes - namely the Hayward, the Bardeen and the Dymnikova spacetimes - as well as the singular de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime. Interestingly, by matching these black hole spacetimes with an isotropic and homogeneous expanding Universe, we obtain a phase of cosmic acceleration that ends at an energy scale characteristic to the black hole parameters or due to black hole evaporation. This cosmic acceleration mechanism can be relevant either to an inflationary phase with a graceful exit and reheating or to an early dark energy type of contribution pertinent to the Hubble tension. Remarkably, we find that ultra-light PBHs with masses $m&lt;5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ dominating the energy content of the Univese before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can drive a successful inflationary expansion era without the use of an inflaton field. Additionally, PBHs with masses $m \sim 10^{12}\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $0.107 &lt; \Omega^\mathrm{eq}_\mathrm{PBH}&lt; 0.5$, slightly before matter-radiation equality, can produce a substantial amount of early dark energy, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling Relative Peak Times of Gravitational Wave Harmonics</a><span class="id">[2506.17492]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurate modeling of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers is essential for extracting their rich physics. A key detail for understanding the physics of mergers is predicting the precise time when the amplitude of the gravitational wave strain peaks, which can differ significantly among the different harmonic modes. We propose two semi-analytical methods to predict these differences using the same three inputs from Numerical Relativity (NR): the remnant mass and spin and the instantaneous frequency of each mode at its peak amplitude. The first method uses the frequency evolution predicted by the Backwards-One-Body model, while the second models the motion of an equatorial timelike geodesic in the remnant black hole spacetime. We compare our models to the SXS waveform catalog for quasi-circular, non-precessing systems and find excellent agreement for $l = |m|$ modes up to $l=8$, with mean and median differences from NR below 1$M$ in nearly all cases across the parameter space. We compare our results to the differences predicted by leading Effective-One-Body and NR surrogate waveform models and find that in cases corresponding to the largest timing differences, our models can provide significant increases in accuracy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22388" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Common Origin of Asymmetric Self-interacting Dark Matter and Dirac Leptogenesis</a><span class="id">[2506.22388]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Assuming dark matter to be asymmetric as well as self-interacting and neutrinos to be Dirac fermions, we propose a framework to address the observed baryon imbalance of the universe. We add three right-handed neutrinos $\nu_{R_i},\,{i=1,2,3}$, one singlet fermion $\chi$, a doublet fermion $\psi$, and heavy scalar doublets $\eta_i,\,{i=1,2}$ to the Standard Model. A global $B-L$ is imposed to protect the Dirac nature of neutrinos. Both $\chi$ and $\psi$ are fermions with non-zero charge under an extended $U(1)_{B-L} \times U(1)_D$ symmetry. Additionally, a $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is imposed, where the singlets $\chi$, $\nu_R$, and $\eta$ are negative and the doublet $\psi$ is positive. The CP-violating out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy scalar $\eta$ generates an equal and opposite $B-L$ asymmetry among the left-handed ($\nu_L$) and right-handed ($\nu_R$) neutrinos. The $\nu_L-\nu_R$ equilibration process does not take place until below the Electroweak phase transition scale because of tiny Yukawa couplings. During this time, Sphaleron processes, which are active at temperatures higher than 100 GeV, transform a portion of the $B-L$ asymmetry stored in left-handed neutrinos into baryon asymmetry. MeV scale gauge boson $Z'$ of $U(1)_D$ sector mediates both annihilation of symmetric dark matter component and self-interaction among dark matter particles. Moreover, $Z'$ mixes with the Standard Model Z-boson and provides a portal for dark matter direct detection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10524" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximum mass limit of strange stars in quadratic curvature-matter coupled gravity</a><span class="id">[2508.10524]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the maximum mass limit of strange stars in quadratic curvature gravity with the non-minimal matter coupling. The characteristic parameters of the quadratic curvature coupling and the non-minimal matter coupling imply the contributions from higher-order curvature terms and the coupling between matter and geometry, respectively. We explicitly demonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor can be modified, and that in the vanishing limit of the non-minimal matter coupling, the formalism of general relativity is recovered. By deriving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations from the gravitational field equations and applying the MIT bag model equation of state, we obtain the corresponding mass-radius relationships for strange stars. Furthermore, we show that the maximum mass limit of strange stars can exceed the general relativistic counterpart. Specifically, we find that a maximum mass up to 3.11 solar mass is achievable, suggesting that the lighter companion of GW190814 could plausibly be a strange star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Precision gravity constraints on large dark sectors</a><span class="id">[2509.02801]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>General relativity, treated as a low energy effective field theory, predicts quantum corrections to Newtons law of gravitation arising from loops of matter and graviton fields. While these corrections are negligible for the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newtons law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa type deviations and inverse square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and forthcoming experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. For truly massless hidden states, present data still permit multiplicities as large as 1e61, with modest spin dependence; for finite masses the constraints reduce to the familiar short range Yukawa parameterization. Our results provide a model independent framework for confronting dark sector scenarios with precision gravity data and clarify how non minimal scalar couplings, potential higher derivative poles at large species number, and Kaluza Klein towers fit within this picture. The approach is complementary to cosmological probes: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background constrain relic abundances under specified production histories, whereas laboratory tests constrain the spectrum of light states irrespective of their cosmological population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Framework for the Spontaneous Scalarization of Regular Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2511.01544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the spontaneous scalarization of generic, static, and spherically symmetric regular black holes supported by nonlinear electrodynamics. Starting from an arbitrary seed metric, we employ the P-dual formalism to reconstruct the electromagnetic sector and subsequently couple a real scalar field nonminimally. As a worked example, we apply the framework to the regular Balart-Vagenas black hole, showing that scalarized and scalar-free branches can coexist in a region where the scalarized configurations are entropically preferred. We further assess possible observational imprints, finding percent-level deviations in both the shadow size and the fundamental scalar quasi-normal modes ($&lt; 10\%$ for small charge-to-mass ratios), indicating that current electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations do not rule out these solutions. Our construction thus provides a general route to explore scalarization on top of nonlinear-electrodynamics-supported spacetimes, extending beyond specific Reissner-Nordström-like cases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme mass ratio inspirals in the cold vector dark matter environment</a><span class="id">[2512.06807]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With regard to the observed dark matter density profile in galaxies and clusters, the scalar dark matter scenario has been previously studied for potential detectability through gravitational wave observations at measurable signal-to-noise ratios. In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $\mu\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M_{\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M_{\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter. Additionally, most of the important results have been compared with the scalar dark matter case.</p></div></details></article></body>
