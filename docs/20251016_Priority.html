We propose a trial wavefunction to model the ULDM distribution beyond the BEC core. We derive the corresponding rotation velocity curve, which shows excellent agreement with those of 12 dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The best-fit ULDM particle mass for each dwarf galaxy falls within a strikingly narrow range of $m=(1.8-3.2)\times 10^{-23}\text{eV}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spatial Variations of Polarized Synchrotron Emission in the QUIJOTE MFI Data</a><span class="id">[2510.12860]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polarized synchrotron emission from ultra-relativistic electrons spiraling the Galactic magnetic field has become one of the most relevant emissions in the Interstellar medium these last years due to the improvement in the quality of low-frequency observations. One of the recent experiments designed to explore this emission is the QUIJOTE experiment. We aim to study the spatial variations of the synchrotron emission in the QUIJOTE MFI data, by dividing the sky into physically separated regions. For such task, we firstly use a novel component separation method based on artificial neural networks to clean the synchrotron maps. After training the network with simulations, we fit both $EE$ and $BB$ spectra by assuming a power-law model. Then, we give estimations for the index $\alpha_{S}$, the amplitude, and the ratio between $B$ and $E$ amplitudes. When analyzing the real data, we found a clear spatial variation of the synchrotron properties along the sky at 11 GHz, obtaining a steeper index in the Galactic plane of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.1 \pm 0.3$ and $\alpha_{S}^{BB} = -3.1 \pm 0.4$ and a flatter one at high Galactic latitudes of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.05 \pm 0.2$ and $\alpha_{S}^{B} = -2.98 \pm 0.27$. We found average values at all sky of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.04 \pm 0.21$ and $\alpha_{S}^{BB} = -3.00 \pm 0.34$. Furthermore, after obtaining an average value of $A_{S}^{EE} = 3.31 \pm 0.08$ $\mu K^{2}$ and $A_{S}^{BB} = 0.93 \pm 0.02$ $\mu K^{2}$, we estimate a ratio between $B$ and $E$ amplitudes of $A_{S}^{BB}/A_{S}^{EE} = 0.28 \pm 0.08$. Based on the results we conclude that, although neural networks seem to be valuable methods to apply on real ISM observations, combined analyses with Planck, WMAP and/or CBASS data are mandatory to reduce the contamination from QUIJOTE maps and then improve the accuracy of the estimations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12892" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMAGAL VIII. Cataloging Hierarchical Mass Structure from Cores to Clumps across the Galactic Disk</a><span class="id">[2510.12892]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Investigating the multi-scale fragmentation of dense clumps into compact cores is essential for understanding the processes that govern the initial distribution of mass in stellar clusters and how high-mass stars ($&gt;8~M_{\odot}$) form. We present a catalog of the hierarchical continuum structure from 904 clumps observed in the ALMAGAL program, a high resolution ($0.15-0.8$\arcsec) 1.38 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large program targeting dense clumps capable of high-mass star formation throughout the Galactic disk. We use \verb|astrodendro|, a dendrogram-based algorithm, on a uniform linear resolution (2000 au) version of the data to extract 5160 continuum structures with effective radii spanning $800-42000$ au and estimated masses between $~0.05-670~M_{\odot}$. With our large sample, we statistically examine the difference in clump properties for regions with varying levels of hierarchical complexity. We find that clumps exhibiting the richest hierarchical morphology have distributions with higher dust temperatures, surface densities, luminosity-to-mass (\textit{L/M}) ratios, and most massive core (MMC) masses, indicating that these regions tend to be at later evolutionary stages. We find a positive correlation between the mass of cores from the ALMAGAL core catalog and the surface density of their surrounding structures identified in this work. However, this correlation is weaker for cores in more evolved clumps, where lower mass cores can be found at higher local surface densities. This could indicate that some cores accrete mass less efficiently from the intra-clump reservoir than others, despite the total available mass increasing over time, a scenario that is congruent with a clump-fed core accretion model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12940" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J-PLUS: Turning Off the Bright Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.12940]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Photometric surveys require precise point spread function (PSF) characterization, as it varies across filters and is crucial for accurate photometry and low surface brightness (LSB) studies. However, the small PSF size provided by default pipelines suits only barely resolved objects, making it difficult to analyze regions near bright stars (rendering those regions unusable). These components are then combined to generate a final PSF for each exposure and filter, spanning 15 mag arcsec-2 in surface brightness and 4 arcmin in radius in the broad bands. In narrow-band filters, the J-PLUS PSF exhibits two rings, whereas in broad-band filters, only one ring is observed. Additionally, the position of the ring shifts with filter wavelength: as the filters become redder, the ring radius increases. We find that there is no significant variation in the extended PSF observed as a function of time (within 2.5h) or position in the field of view. The radial profile of NGC 4212 (which is close to a star) is also studied before/after PSF-subtraction. We developed a novel method to determine the central coordinates of saturated stars, and classify stars without using Gaia magnitudes. Additionally, mirror reflections are automatically detected and masked. Furthermore, in combining different stars and various components of the PSF, we avoided the use of a fixed radius by introducing a new method that does not depend on radial measurements. Accurate characterization of the extended PSF and its subtraction improves sky subtraction, increases the effective area of the survey by about 10%, and enables the study of extended large LSB features in wide area surveys like J-PLUS. Our pipeline is published as free software (GNU GPLv3) an can be customized to other surveys such as J-PAS, where its impact will be even greater due to its depth. This paper is fully reproducible and produced from Commit 4860c70.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12942" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Only the Special Survive: Evolution of Long-Lived Star Clusters in Galaxy Simulations</a><span class="id">[2510.12942]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we aim to answer one crucial question behind the discrepancy between chemical trends of field stars and clusters in the Galactic disk: is the chemical gradient mismatch driven by cluster migration and differential survivability as a function of galactic location? To answer this question, we explored the evolution of long-lived (&gt; 1 Gyr) star clusters in Milky Way-galaxy simulations. In particular, we investigated why some star clusters remain bound over billions of years. We have traced the unique trajectories for a sample of open clusters around two FIRE galaxies throughout cosmic time. Additionally, we characterized the small-scale environment surrounding these clusters over their orbital history. We see that clusters across both FIRE galaxies spend the majority of their lives in under-dense regions of gas, except for brief passages where they interact with gas clouds, causing their orbits to be altered.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12991" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the magneto-ionic medium of the Milky Way using pulsars</a><span class="id">[2510.12991]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic fields are fundamental to the dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) in spiral galaxies and are often separated into large-scale, regular ($\boldsymbol{B}$) and small-scale, random ($\boldsymbol{b}$) components. The thermal electron density, $n_{\rm e}$, can also be divided into large-scale, diffuse, $\langle n_{\rm e} \rangle$, and small-scale, clumpy, $\delta n_{\rm e}$, components. Estimating the properties of $b$ and $\delta n_{\rm e}$ from observations, even within the Milky Way, has long been challenging. This work addresses the challenge using pulsars, which probe the Milky Way's magneto-ionic medium. Using data of more than 1200 pulsars from the Australia Telescope National Facility pulsar catalogue, we combine dispersion (${\rm DM}$) and rotation (${\rm RM}$) measures with theoretical models to estimate both small- and large-scale properties of the Galactic magnetic field and thermal electron density. We find no significant correlation between the average parallel magnetic field strength, $\langle B_{\parallel} \rangle [\mu{\rm G}] = 1.232\,{\rm RM}\,[{\rm rad\,m^{-2}}]/{\rm DM}\,[{\rm pc\,cm^{-3}}]$, and pulsar distance. For pulsars within $20\,{\rm kpc}$, we estimate $|B| \approx 1.2\,\mu{\rm G}$ and $\langle n_{\rm e} \rangle \approx 0.05\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. More importantly, we determine correlation lengths of small-scale components, $\ell_{b} \approx 20$ – $30\,{\rm pc}$ and $\ell_{\delta n_{\rm e}} \approx 250$ – $300\,{\rm pc}$. At smaller distances, $B$ remains roughly constant, while $\langle n_{\rm e} \rangle$ increases and both length scales decrease. These results refine our understanding of fundamental scales in the magneto-ionic medium, aiding the interpretation of extragalactic ${\rm RM}$s and providing insights into the role of magnetic fields in galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galactic chemical evolution with the short-lived isotopes Mn-53, Fe-60, Hf-182, and Pu-244</a><span class="id">[2510.13070]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We run a three-dimensional Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model to follow the propagation of Mn-53 from supernovae of type Ia (SNIa), Fe-60 from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), Hf-182 from intermediate mass stars (IMSs), and Pu-244 from neutron star mergers (NSMs) in the Galaxy.

Bubble Overlap at Redshift z   7 in LAGER-z7OD1</a><span class="id">[2510.13140]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Since the launch of JWST, the sample size of reionization-era Lyman-alpha-emitters (LAEs) has been steadily growing; yet inferences about the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium exhibit increasing variance at redshift z   7, possibly indicating significant field-to-field fluctuations in the progression of cosmic reionization. In this paper, we present new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z   7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and Lyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha damping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard context of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min) = 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral patch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct sub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the nine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a modest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual ionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on an empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling galactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred intergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The errorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our results are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dependency of Bar Formation Timescale on Disk Mass Fraction, Toomre $Q$, and Scale Height</a><span class="id">[2510.13152]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bars are one of the most prominent galactic structures. The classical swing-amplification theory can qualitatively describe the spontaneous bar instability of stellar disks. Still, it cannot quantify the bar formation process or explain why some disk galaxies do not have a bar. Recent studies found that the bar formation timescale depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction of the host galaxy (dubbed as &quot;Fujii relation&quot;), but they only explored a limited parameter space, where the physical effects of Toomre $Q$ (local disk stability parameter) and disk scale height of the host galaxies are not fully explored. In this work, we check the robustness of the Fujii relation in a higher-dimensional parameter space of disk mass fraction, Toomre $Q$, and scale height. We find that the Fujii relation holds for disk galaxies with physically reasonable Toomre $Q$ and scale height. Furthermore, the bar formation timescale also approximately linearly depends on both Toomre $Q$ and scale height, with a more prolonged bar formation in a hotter or thicker disk. We propose an empirical relation to combine the dependency of the bar formation timescale on the three parameters. Based on the empirical relation and recent observations, we estimate that the bar formation timescale in pure stellar disks ranges from $0.20_{-0.06}^{+0.09}~\mathrm{Gyr}$ to $12.20_{-2.80}^{+3.37}~\mathrm{Gyr}$ or even significantly beyond the Hubble timescale in some extreme cases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dependency of the Bar Formation Timescale On The Halo Spin</a><span class="id">[2510.13153]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bars are among the most prominent structures in disk galaxies. While the widely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for their formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in isolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the so-called &quot;Fujii relation&quot;) and linearly on disk hotness and thickness. However, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body models of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random motions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo, we explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing bar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both prograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short timescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for moderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to accelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo spin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence. These trends might arise from the exchange of angular momentum between the stellar disk and the dark matter halo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13222" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospects for the Crossing of Comet 3I/ATLAS's Ion Tail</a><span class="id">[2510.13222]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During October - November 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, will pass upstream of the Europa Clipper and Hera spacecraft. Here, we identify two potential opportunities for in-situ observations of 3I's ion tail by immersion, facilitated by the close alignment between the comet's hyperbolic trajectory with the ecliptic plane. During the period 30 October - 6 November 2025, it is predicted that Europa Clipper will potentially be immersed within the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS, providing the opportunity to detect the signatures of an interstellar comet's ion tail. Characteristic changes to the solar wind are also expected to be observed; a magnetic draping structure associated with the comet may be identifiable. It is further predicted that spacecraft Hera will possibly be immersed within the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS during the period 25 October - 1 November 2025.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of red galaxy candidates at z   12: Early dust growth or significant nebular emission with high-temperature stars?</a><span class="id">[2510.13240]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of two z   12 galaxy candidates with unusually red UV slopes (betaUV  &gt; -1.5), and probe the origin of such colors at cosmic dawn. From Prospector fits to the UNCOVER/MegaScience dataset – deep JWST/NIRCam imaging of Abell 2744 in 20 broad- and medium-bands – we identify several new z &gt; 10 galaxies. Medium-band data improve redshift estimates, revealing two lensed (mu   3.3) z   12 galaxies in a close pair with beta_UV  &gt; -1.5 at an UV absolute magnitude of M_UV   -19 mag, lying away from typical scatter on previously known MUV-betaUV relations. SED fitting with Prospector, Bagpipes, and EAZY support their high-z nature, with probability of low-z interlopers of p(z &lt; 7) &lt; 10%. The potential low-z interlopers are z   3 quiescent galaxies (QGs), but unexpected to be detected at the given field of view unless z   3 QG stellar mass function has a strong turn up at log Mstar/Msun   9. Unlike typical blue high-redshift candidates (beta_UV  &lt; -2.0), these red slopes require either dust or nebular continuum reddening. The dust scenario implies Av   0.8 mag, which is larger than theoretical predictions, but is consistent with a dust-to-stellar mass ratio (log M_dust/M_star   -3). The nebular scenario demands dense gas (log nH /cm^3   4.0) around hot stars (log Teff [K]   4.9). Spectroscopic follow-up is essential to determine their true nature and reveal missing galaxies at the cosmic dawn.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13241" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The dependence of black hole formation in open clusters on the cluster formation process</a><span class="id">[2510.13241]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We performed N-body simulations of both individual cluster evolution and subcluster coalescence, demonstrating that cluster evolution and its outcomes strongly depend on the cluster formation process through comparisons of different gas expulsion modes and formation channels. The evolution of star clusters is significantly shaped by the gas expulsion mode, with faster expulsion producing greater mass loss. A broader degeneracy exists among initial cluster mass, gas expulsion timescale, and formation channel (monolithic vs. coalescence), which manifests in both evolutionary pathways and black hole production. In individual cluster simulations, slower gas expulsion enables progressively lower-mass clusters to retain central black holes within the tidal radius. As the gas expulsion mode transitions from fast to moderate to slow, the fraction of high-velocity stars decreases. Variations in gas expulsion mode and formation channel ultimately influence the stellar velocity distribution (within the tidal radius), and thus the expansion speed, which governs both cluster mass loss and black hole retention. Slowly expanding clusters are more likely to retain black holes and multiple systems, making them prime candidates for black hole searches with {\it Gaia}. Our results highlight the crucial influence of early gas expulsion and cluster formation mechanisms on the dynamical evolution of star clusters and black hole production. These factors should be carefully incorporated into the initial conditions of N-body simulations, which necessarily rely on input from the star formation community.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old open clusters NGC 188 and M 67 in Gaia DR3</a><span class="id">[2510.13288]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We performed a statistical study of two old open clusters NGC 188 and M 67 using Gaia DR3 data. No tidal tails of the clusters were detected, which most likely had been destroyed when the cluster passed through the Galactic plane. The size estimates of the clusters depend on the range of astrometric parameters and stellar magnitudes of the stars used for star counts. The mass spectra of two clusters differ significantly. NGC 188 shows a deficit of low-mass stars compared to M 67. In the halo region of NGC 188 (compared to the core region of the cluster), there is a relative excess of the low-mass stars (just as in the case of M 67) and a deficit of stars in the mass range from 0.66 to 0.9 solar masses. Comparison with the Hunt &amp; Reffert samples showed that almost all the stars from these samples are contained among the stars we selected for counting. Moreover, the group probability of these stars belonging to clusters, estimated by the uniform background method, is higher than 60%. It is shown that the velocity dispersion of single stars (selected according to the `stellar magnitude – color index' diagrams) is significantly smaller than the velocity dispersion of unresolved binary stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Supernova 1987A system and its recent evolution - a review</a><span class="id">[2510.13629]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernova 1987A was the closest supernova event to be observed in nearly 400 years. The outflowing ejecta from the explosion continues to interact with extended circumstellar material and with the equatorial ring (ER) in the triple ring system, while observations of the system have continued across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. This review mainly focuses on works published over the past ten years on Supernova 1987A and its remnant. These include (a) submillimetre, infrared and X-ray studies of molecules, ions and dust in the ejecta, and (b) infrared, optical and X-ray studies of dust and ionized gas in the ER and in the surrounding circumstellar medium, including their time evolution as the ER is shocked and eroded by the impact of high velocity ejecta. Since 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope has become available for high angular resolution infrared observations of Supernova 1987A and has made significant contributions to both (a) and (b) above. Its discovery of redshifted narrow-line emission from multiple ion species located at the centre of the ejecta strongly requires the presence there of either a cooling hot neutron star, or a pulsar wind nebula, to power the emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Condensation sequence of circumstellar cluster seeds (CSCCS)</a><span class="id">[2510.13657]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Traditionally, the condensation sequence of circumstellar dust is predicted based on the thermodynamic stabilities of specific condensates in the macroscopic bulk phase. However, at the (sub-)nanometer scale clusters with non-crystalline structures and significantly different properties are energetically favoured. For this reason, we study the thermodynamic stabilities of metal oxide clusters with generic stoichiometries of M$_2$O$_3$ and M$_3$O$_4$, where M represents a metal atom. With an upper size limit of 50 atoms, we consider clusters with sizes n=1$-$10 for (M$_2$O$_3$)$_n$, and n=1$-$7 for (M$_3$O$_4$)$_n$. The M$_2$O$_3$ clusters comprise alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$), Mg-rich pyroxene (MgSiO$_3$) and a size-limited sample of titanates (CaTiO$_3$), whereas the M$_3$O$_4$ clusters include spinel (MgAl$_2$O$_4$), Mg-rich olivine (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$) and calcium aluminates (CaAl$_2$O$_4$). We find that, apart from the alumina monomer, the aluminum-bearing clusters (Al$_2$O$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$10, and (MgAl$_2$O$_4$)$_n$, n=1$-$7, are favoured over their silicate counterparts (MgSiO$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$10 and (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$)$_n$, n=1$-$7. Also, we find that calcium aluminate clusters, CaAl$_2$O$_4$, are energetically more favourable than magnesium aluminate clusters, MgAl$_2$O$_4$. Furthermore, for a limited data set of (CaTiO$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$2, clusters we find significantly larger stabilities than for the other considered (M$_2$O$_3$)$_n$ clusters, namely Al$_2$O$_3$ and MgSiO$_3$. Future investigations, in particular on titanates and on Ca-rich silicates, are required to draw a more thorough and complete picture of the condensation sequence at the (sub-)nanoscale.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13719" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Stellar Morphology &amp; Size of X-ray-selected Active Galactic Nuclei Host Galaxies Revealed by JWST</a><span class="id">[2510.13719]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the stellar shape and size-mass relationship of X-ray selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using the high-angular resolution and deep sensitivity in the near-infrared of the COSMOS-Web JWST survey field. We present the rest-frame 1-$\mu m$ size, stellar mass, Sersic index, axis-ratio, Gini-$M_{20}$ parameters of 690 moderate luminosity AGNs between redshift 0-3 and with stellar mass $\log M_s\sim 10.75$. We find that AGN host galaxies have an effective radius of 1-5 kpc, which is between star-forming (SFG) and quiescent galaxies (QGs) of the same stellar mass. AGN hosts have similar size-mass trends as SFG and QGs, being smaller at higher redshift for the same stellar mass. The slope of the size-mass relationship of AGN host galaxies is steeper than that of star-forming galaxies. Their rest-frame 1$\mu m$ stellar morphology indicates a significant spheroidal component. We observed a low merger fraction (6%) in our sample as well as substructures similar to disks, bars, and spiral arms in the residual images, which are in tension with evolutionary pathways that require major mergers. However, it may also be due to the different timescales between mergers and AGN activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13737" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comparing subgrid models for cosmic ray diffusion in a magnetized isolated galaxy simulation</a><span class="id">[2510.13737]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) play a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution by altering gas dynamics and chemistry across multiple scales. Typical numerical simulations of CR transport assume a constant diffusion coefficient for the entire galaxy, despite both numerical and theoretical studies showing that it can change by orders of magnitude depending on the phase of the interstellar medium. Only a few simulations exist that self-consistently calculate CR transport with diffusion, streaming, and advection by the background gas. In this study we explore three subgrid models for CR diffusion, based on popular theories of CR transport. We post-process an isolated, star-forming MHD galactic disk simulated using the RAMSES code. The resulting diffusion coefficients depend solely on the subgrid turbulent kinetic energy and the MHD state variables of the plasma. We use these models to calculate coefficients for vertical transport. We find that they depend critically on the local magnetic field tilt angle. Across models, our resulting diffusion coefficients range from $10^{26}~\rm cm^2s^{-1}$ to $10^{31}~\rm cm^2s^{-1}$, and yield CR energy densities at the midplane from $1$ to $100 ~\rm eV cm^{-3}$, suggesting varied degrees of backreaction on their environment. Using simple approximations, we show that the gamma ray luminosity of the galaxy depends primarily on the gas surface density and the turbulent confinement of CRs by the galactic corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistical properties of compressible isothermal turbulence from sub- to supersonic conditions</a><span class="id">[2510.13141]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper investigates the statistical properties of isothermal turbulence in both the subsonic and supersonic regimes. The focus is on the influence of the Mach number ($Ma$) and the Reynolds number ($Re$) on both the space-local and scale-dependent fluctuations of relevant gas variables, the density, velocity, their derivatives, and the kinetic energy. We carry out hydrodynamical simulations with explicit viscosity and therefore controlled $Re$. We confirm previous work that the probability density functions (PDFs) of the gas density are approximately log-normal and depend on $Ma$. In contrast, derivatives of the density and velocity field are sensitive to $Re$, with the probability of extreme events growing with $Re$. The PDFs of the density gradient and velocity divergence (dilatation) exhibit increasingly heavy tails with growing $Ma$, signalling enhanced internal intermittency. At sufficiently high $Ma$, the statistics of dilatation are observed to saturate at a level determined solely by $Re$, suggesting that turbulent dilatation becomes limited by viscous effects. We also examine the scale-by-scale distribution of kinetic energy through a compressible form of the Kármán-Howarth-Monin (KHM) equation. In the intermediate range of scales, a marked difference is found between subsonic and supersonic turbulence: while Kolmogorov-like scaling applies in the sub- and transonic regimes, supersonic turbulence aligns more closely with Burgers turbulence predictions. The analysis of individual terms in the KHM equation highlights the role of the pressure-velocity coupling as an additional mechanism for converting kinetic energy from large to small scales. Moreover, the contributions of the KHM terms exhibit non-monotonic behaviour with increasing $Ma$, with dilatational effects becoming more pronounced and acting to oppose the cascade of kinetic energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mass and spin coevolution of black holes inspiralling through dark matter</a><span class="id">[2510.13604]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In extreme/intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (E/IMRIs) embedded in dark-matter (DM) spikes, the secondary black hole can accrete collisionless particles from the surrounding halo.

We find that higher spin suppresses the mass accretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down and secular alignment of the companion's spin with the orbital plane. Collisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin correlation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \simeq 2.8$, much larger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely independent of the local DM density and the spike slope. The associated spin-down proceeds on astrophysically relevant timescales, thus observations of rapidly spinning IMRI companions would disfavor the presence of dense DM environments, providing constraints complementary to those arising from dynamical friction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin of the two-armed vertical phase-spiral in the inner Galactic disk</a><span class="id">[2503.20869]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gaia recently revealed a two-armed spiral pattern in the vertical phase-space distribution of the inner Galactic disk (guiding radius $R_\textrm{g} \sim 6.2$ kpc), indicating that some non-adiabatic perturbation symmetric about the mid-plane is driving the inner disk out of equilibrium. The non-axisymmetric structures in the disk (e.g., the bar or spiral arms) have been suspected to be the major source for such a perturbation. However, both the lifetime and the period of these internal perturbations are typically longer than the period at which stars oscillate vertically, implying that the perturbation is generally adiabatic. This issue is particularly pronounced in the inner Galaxy, where the vertical oscillation period is shorter and therefore adiabatically shielded more than the outer disk. We show that two-armed phase spirals can naturally form in the inner disk if there is a vertical resonance that breaks the adiabaticity; otherwise, their formation requires a perturber with an unrealistically short lifetime. We predict analytically and confirm with simulations that a steadily rotating (non-winding) two-armed phase spiral forms near the resonance when stars are subject to both periodic perturbations (e.g., by spiral arms) and stochastic perturbations (e.g., by giant molecular clouds). Due to the presence of multiple resonances, the vertical phase-space exhibits several local phase spirals that rotate steadily at distinct frequencies, together forming a global phase spiral that evolves over time. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to earlier predictions, the formation of the two-armed phase spiral does not require transient perturbations with lifetimes shorter than the vertical oscillation period.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining cosmic ray transport models using circumgalactic medium properties and observables</a><span class="id">[2505.13597]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic rays (CRs) are a pivotal non-thermal component of galaxy formation and evolution. However, the intricacies of CR physics, particularly how they propagate in the circumgalactic medium (CGM), remain largely unconstrained. In this work, we study CGM properties in FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) simulations of the same Milky Way (MW)-mass halo at $z=0$ with different CR transport models that produce similar diffuse $\sim$ GeV $\gamma$-ray emission, as an attempt to further constrain CR transport models. We study the gas morphology and thermal properties, and generate synthetic observations of rest-frame UV ion absorption columns and X-ray emission. CRs lower galaxy masses and star formation rates (SFRs) while supporting more cool CGM gas, which boosts the HI and OVI column densities in the CGM, bringing simulations more in line with observations, but there can be large differences between CR transport models and resolution levels. X-ray emission within and close to galaxies is consistent with thermal (free-free and metal-line) emission plus X-ray binaries, while more extended ($\sim 100\,$kpc) CGM emission is potentially dominated by inverse Compton (IC) scattering, motivating future work on the spatially resolved X-ray profiles. Although comparisons with observations are sensitive to sample selection and mimicking the details of observations, and our analysis did not result in strong constraints on CR models, the differences between simulations are significant and could be used as a framework for future studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20407" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutral gas phase distribution from HI morphology: phase separation with scattering spectra and variational autoencoders</a><span class="id">[2505.20407]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Unraveling the multi-phase structure of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) as traced by neutral hydrogen (HI) is essential to understanding the lifecycle of the Milky Way. However, HI phase separation is a challenging and under-constrained problem. The neutral gas phase distribution is often inferred from the spectral line structure of HI emission. In this work, we develop a data-driven phase separation method that extracts HI phase structure solely from the spatial morphology of HI emission intensity structures. We combine scattering spectra (SS) statistics with a Gaussian-mixture variational autoencoder (VAE) model to: 1. derive an interpretable statistical model of different HI phases from their multi-scale morphological structures; 2. use this model to decompose the 2D channel maps of GALFA-HI emission in diffuse high latitude ($|b|&gt;30$\degree) regions over narrow velocity channels ($\Delta v=3$ km/s) into cold neutral medium (CNM), warm neutral medium (WNM), and noise components. We integrate our CNM map over velocity channels to compare it to an existing map produced by a spectrum-based method, and find that the two maps are highly correlated, while ours recovers more spatially coherent structures at small scales. Our work illustrates and quantifies a clear physical connection between the HI morphology and HI phase structure, and unlocks a new avenue for improving future phase separation techniques by making use of both HI spectral and spatial information to decompose HI in 3D position-position-velocity (PPV) space. These results are consistent with a physical picture where processes that drive HI phase transitions also shape the morphology of HI gas, imprinting a sparse, filamentary CNM that forms out of a diffuse, extended WNM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">H3+ in irradiated protoplanetary disks: Linking far-ultraviolet radiation and water vapor</a><span class="id">[2506.05189]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The likely JWST detection of vibrationally excited H3+ emission in Orion's irradiated disk system d203-506 raises the important question of whether cosmic-ray ionization is enhanced in disks within clustered star-forming regions, or whether alternative mechanisms contribute to H3+ formation and excitation. We present a detailed model of the photodissociation region (PDR) component of a protoplanetary disk -comprising the outer disk surface and the photoevaporative wind - exposed to strong external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. We investigate key gas-phase reactions involving excited H2 that lead to the formation of H3+ in the PDR, including detailed state-to-state dynamical calculations of reactions H2(v&gt;=0) + HOC+ -&gt; H3+ + CO and H2(v&gt;=0) + H+ -&gt; H2+ + H. We also consider the effects of photoionization of vibrationally excited H2(v&gt;=4), a process not previously included in PDR or disk models. We find that these FUV-driven reactions dominate the formation of H3+ in the PDR of strongly irradiated disks, largely independently of cosmic-ray ionization. The predicted H3+ abundance in the disk PDR peaks at x(H3+) 1E-8, coinciding with regions of enhanced HOC+ and water vapor abundances, and is linked to the strength of the external FUV field (G0). The predicted H3+ column density ( 1E13 cm^-2) agrees with the presence of H3+ in the PDR of d203-506. We also find that formation pumping, resulting from exoergic reactions between excited H2 and HOC+, drives the vibrational excitation of H3+ in these regions. We expect this photochemistry to be highly active in disks where G_0 &gt; 1E3. The H3+ formation pathways studied here may also be relevant in the inner disk region (near the host star), in exoplanetary ionospheres, and in the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13677" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayesian Quantification of Observability and Equation of State of Twin Stars</a><span class="id">[2506.13677]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The possibility of discovering twin stars, two neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii, is usually studied in forward modelings by using a restricted number of NS matter equation of state (EOS) encapsulating a first-order phase transition from hadronic to quark matter (QM). Informing our likelihood function with the NS radius data from GW170817 and using a meta-model with 9-parameters capable of mimicking most NS EOSs available in the literature, we conduct a Bayesian quantification of the observability and underlying EOSs of twin stars. Of the accepted EOSs, between 12-18\% yield twin stars, depending on the restrictions we place on the second branch. The possibility of twin stars remains robust even under recent observational constraints. We show that many of these twin star scenarios are observable with currently available levels of accuracy in measuring NS radii. We also present the marginalized posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of every EOS parameter for each of four mass-radius correlation topologies. We find that the inferred EOS depends sensitively on not only whether twin stars are present, but also the category of twin stars, indicating that the observation of twin stars would provide a strong constraint on the underlying EOS. In particular, for two coexisting hybrid stars having QM cores at different densities, the PDF for QM speed of sound squared $c_{\rm qm}^2$ has two peaks, one below and another above the conformal limit $c_{\rm qm}^2=1/3$ predicted by perturbative QCD.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galactic echoes</a><span class="id">[2506.16512]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gaia has revealed a variety of substructures in the phase space of stars in the Solar neighborhood, including the vertical `Snail' in $(z,v_z)$ space. Such substructures are often interpreted as the incompletely phase-mixed response of the disc stars to a single perturbation, such as an impulsive encounter with a satellite galaxy. In this paper we consider the possibility that such structures contain manifestations of phase space echoes. First established in plasma physics in the 1960s, echoes arise when a collisionless system is perturbed twice: the macroscopic responses to both perturbations mix to small scales in phase space, whereupon they couple nonlinearly, producing a third macroscopic `echo' response without the need for a third perturbation. We derive the galactic analogue of the plasma echo theory using angle-action variables and apply it to a one-dimensional model of vertical motion in the Milky Way. We verify the predicted echo behavior using idealized test particle simulations, both with and without the inclusion of diffusion through orbital scattering off molecular clouds. While we conclude that the Gaia Snail itself is unlikely a (pure) echo effect, the basic physics we uncover is sufficiently generic that we expect phase-space echoes to be common in disc galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CO desorption from interstellar icy grains induced by IR excitation of superhydrogenated PAHs</a><span class="id">[2507.07896]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Infrared (IR) radiation dominates dense, interstellar clouds, yet its effect on icy grains remains largely unexplored. Its potential role in driving the photodesorption of volatile species from such grains has recently been demonstrated, providing a crucial link between the solid state reservoir of molecules and the gas phase. In this work, we investigate IR-induced photodesorption of CO for astrophysically relevant ice systems containing perhydropyrene (PHP). This fully superhydrogenated version of pyrene is used as an analogue for large carbonaceous molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and related species, as well as hydrogenated carbonaceous grains. The abundance and range of strong IR absorption bands of these carbonaceous species make them interesting candidates for IR-induced effects. We present IR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric measurements probing the effects of IR radiation on two ice systems: a layered ice with CO on top of PHP, and a CO:PHP mixed ice. These ices were irradiated with IR radiation from the FELIX IR Free Electron Laser (FEL) FEL-2. In accordance with previous studies, we confirm that direct excitation of CO is not an efficient pathway to CO desorption, indicating that another energy dissipation mechanism exists. We demonstrate that vibrational excitation of the PHP CH stretching modes leads to efficient CO photodesorption. The derived photodesorption yields are an order of magnitude higher for the layered than the mixed system and comparable to those previously obtained for CO photodesorption from CO on amorphous solid water upon excitation of H$_2$O vibrational modes. Our results indicate that IR excitation of carbonaceous molecules and grains in dense clouds could potentially play an important role in the desorption of volatile species such as CO from icy grains.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Alien Technology?</a><span class="id">[2507.12213]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>At this early stage of its passage through our Solar System, 3I/ATLAS, the recently discovered interstellar interloper, has displayed various anomalous characteristics, determined from photometric and astrometric observations.

Recent studies report that this gradient becomes flatter with increasing stellar age in the Milky Way's (MW) thin disk, while the thick disk exhibits a mildly positive gradient across all ages. In this work, we revisit the metallicity gradient-age relation (MGAR) in both the thin and thick disks of the MW. We use spectroscopic data from LAMOST DR8 and stellar ages calibrated with asteroseismology. Our results show a steadily flattening MGAR in the thin disk and confirm a positive gradient $\sim0.013\,\mathrm{dex\,kpc^{-1}}$ in the thick disk. The flattening in the thin disk may be caused by large-scale radial migration induced by transient spiral arms, or by a time-dependent steepening of the interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity gradient as suggested by recent FIRE2 simulations. The positive gradient in the thick disk may reflect early enrichment of the outer regions by strong feedback or starburst-driven outflows in a turbulent, gas-rich proto-disk. These findings suggest distinct chemodynamical evolution paths for the MW's thin and thick disks and provide valuable constraints for future models of Galactic chemical evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advancing Interstellar Science: A Global Framework for Comprehensive Study of Interstellar Objects</a><span class="id">[2510.01405]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The operation of the Vera C.

Their rapid emergence suggests that massive “heavy seeds” must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars – massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores – believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to $\geq 10^3\,M_{\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ – five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GALACTICNUCLEUS: A high angular resolution JHKs imaging survey of the Galactic centre</a><span class="id">[2510.11966]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The center of the Milky Way is a unique environment of great astrophysical interest, but its extreme crowding and extinction make it difficult to study.

We investigate possible contamination from the cosmic infrared background (CIB), finding that CIB effects are subdominant to the kSZ signal in the relevant ACT frequency channel. We then predict the kSZ signal expected when stacking CMB temperature maps around groups, taking account of their estimated radial velocity. Comparing the model with observations, we are able to constrain the total baryon fraction within haloes, as well as their internal gas profiles. We find evidence for mass dependence of the halo baryon fraction within the virial radius. The gas fraction in massive groups is consistent with the universal baryon fraction, but low-mass groups ($10^{12.5} \lesssim M\,/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot \lesssim 10^{14}$) are depleted to $0.21 \pm 0.06$ times the universal baryon fraction. We find this low virial baryon fraction to be consistent with an extended gas profile, for which the total baryon content reaches the universal value well beyond the virial radius. This conclusion is consistent with previous analyses using X-ray, kSZ, and weak lensing, and plausibly reflects energetic feedback processes from the galaxies in these haloes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quasinormal ringing and Unruh-Verlinde temperature of the Frolov Black Hole</a><span class="id">[2510.01376]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we investigate electromagnetic and Dirac field axial-perturbations of a charged regular black hole arising from quantum gravity effects, commonly referred to as the Frolov black hole, a regular (nonsingular) black hole solution.

However, the confirmed detection of such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources of contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties. Robust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise contamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the astrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of unlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR) depending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed astrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have performed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated population of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\sim$ 0.01\% of the event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs of $\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter space of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over which the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW pair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique will be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW detectors, which can observe many more GW sources.</p></div></details></article>

Experiments show significant improvement over conventional methods within our framework of assumptions, opening new perspectives for studying circumstellar environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulation of Time-dependent Karhunen-Loeve Phase Screens: an Ergodic Approach</a><span class="id">[2510.12861]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Time-dependent phase screens in ground-based astronomy are typically simulated in the so-called frozen-screen approximation by establishing a static phase screen on a large pupil and dragging an aperture equivalent to the size of the actual input pupil across this oversized phase screen. The speed of this motion sweeping through the large phase screen is equivalent to a wind speed that changes the phase screen as a function of time. The ergodic ansatz replaces this concept by constructing the structure function in a three-dimensional volume – a sphere for reasons of computational efficiency – , sampling phase screens by two-dimensional planar cuts through that volume, and dragging them along the surface normal at some speed which generates a video of a phase screen. This manuscript addresses the linear algebra of populating the three-dimensional volume with phase screens of the von-Karman model of atmospheric turbulence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eccentric Disks With Self-Gravity</a><span class="id">[2510.12871]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Can a disk orbiting a central body be eccentric, when the disk feels its own self-gravity and is pressureless? Contradictory answers appear in the literature. We show that such a disk can be eccentric, but only if it has a sharply truncated edge: the surface density $\Sigma$ must vanish at the edge, and the $\Sigma$ profile must be sufficiently steep at the point where it vanishes. If either requirement is violated, an eccentric disturbance leaks out of the bulk of the disk into the low density edge region, and cannot return. An edge where $\Sigma$ asymptotes to zero but never vanishes, as is often assumed for astrophysical disks, is insufficiently sharp. Similar results were shown by Hunter &amp; Toomre (1969) for galactic warps. We demonstrate these results in three ways: by solving the eigenvalue equation for the eccentricity profile; by solving the initial value problem; and by analyzing a new and simple dispersion relation that is valid for any wavenumber, unlike WKB. As a byproduct, we show that softening the self-gravitational potential is not needed to model a flat disk, and we develop a softening-free algorithm to model the disk's Laplace-Lagrange-like equations. The algorithm is easy to implement and is more accurate than softening-based methods at a given resolution by many orders of magnitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12903" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards High-Resolution Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry for Next- Generation In-Situ Space Dust Analysis</a><span class="id">[2510.12903]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic and planetary dust hold vital clues to the chemical evolution of the solar system, yet in situ analysis of their molecular and elemental composition remains technically challenging. Here we present laboratory results from HANKA (High-resolution mass Analyzer for Nano-scale Kinetic Astro materials), a compact Orbitrap-based mass spectrometer developed towards the goal of a universal dust detector for space applications. Using infrared laser ablation and plasma formation under vacuum, we analyzed solid-state samples representative of Lunar, Martian, and Meteoritic material. The resulting mass spectra - recorded at resolving powers of R=60000 - reveal complex, but characteristic element mixtures. These results demonstrate the single event sensitivity of HANKA, and its mass resolution with the ability to resolve complex mass spectra and possibly differentiate geochemical signatures across planetary bodies. The dynamic range of 3-4 orders of magnitude enables even the detection of trace compounds. The minimalistic impact sampling approach enables fast, high-precision compositional mass analysis without complex sample preparation, making the instrument well-suited for orbital, surface, or flyby missions with expected dust impacts. Our system consists of an IR-laser system that simulates impacts of nano to micron sized solid-state dust and ice particles from space. It therefore allows to perform so called analogue experiments in the laboratory. We conclude that IR- laser pulses on a solid-state material are not only well suited for ice particle impact analogues but also a good analogue experiment for solid state particle impacts on a dust detector electrode in space. Moreover, the IR laser is employed only for an optimal analogue experiment simulating the impact event - it is not necessary in space on a spacecraft detecting space dust.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InferA: A Smart Assistant for Cosmological Ensemble Data</a><span class="id">[2510.12920]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Analyzing large-scale scientific datasets presents substantial challenges due to their sheer volume, structural complexity, and the need for specialized domain knowledge.

We present a pre-training approach that leverages simulations, significantly reducing the need for labeled examples from real observations. Our models, trained on simulated data from multiple astronomical surveys (ZTF and LSST), learn generalizable representations that transfer effectively to downstream tasks. Using classifier-based architectures enhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline methods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when fine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective zero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future telescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF) data. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena (namely variable stars from NASA's \textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being trained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities. Our approach provides a practical solution for building general models when labeled data is scarce, but domain knowledge can be encoded in simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12978" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toward First-Principles Multi-Messenger Predictions: Coupling Nuclear Networks with GR Radiation-MHD in {\tt Gmunu}</a><span class="id">[2510.12978]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new implementation of nuclear reaction networks in the \texttt{G}eneral-relativistic \texttt{mu}ltigrid \texttt{nu}merical (\texttt{Gmunu}) code, a framework for general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics (GRRMHD). The extended code self-consistently evolves nuclear species coupled to hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, and neutrino radiation transport under the conformal flatness approximation to Einstein's equations. Four approximate nuclear networks are included, with stiff source terms integrated using implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. Validation is performed through benchmarks including conserved-to-primitive recovery with a tabulated stellar equation of state, one-zone silicon burning, and hydrodynamic tests of shock tubes, acoustic pulses, and detonation fronts of Type Ia supernovae. These tests confirm accurate coupling between nuclear reactions and fluid dynamics, conserving electron and nuclear mass fractions to machine precision. As an application, we conduct spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova simulations. The models reproduce the expected non-exploding behavior of standard progenitors, while enhanced neutrino heating revives the shock. Including nuclear burning modifies the post-shock composition and dynamics, converting silicon and oxygen layers into iron-group nuclei and strengthening the explosion. This demonstrates the impact of explosive burning on ejecta composition and shock evolution, and establishes the stability of the coupled GR radiation-MHD-nuclear framework. The implementation is fully compatible with multidimensional GRMHD simulations and represents the first GRRMHD code combining M1 neutrino transport with fully coupled nuclear burning.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Improved Absolute Polarization Calibrator for BICEP CMB Polarimeters</a><span class="id">[2510.13032]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic birefringence is a hypothesized parity violation in electromagnetism that predicts a frequency-independent polarization rotation as light propagates.

KPI provides angular resolution within the diffraction limit by eliminating instrumental phase errors to first order. It has been successfully demonstrated to boost angular resolution on both space- and ground-based observatories, and is especially useful for enhancing space telescopes, as their diameters are smaller than the largest ground-based facilities. Here we present the first demonstration of KPI on JWST/MIRI data at 7.7 microns, 10 microns, and 15 microns. We generate contrast curves for 16 white dwarfs from the MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White dwarfs (MEOW) Survey, finding significantly deeper contrast at small angular separations compared to traditional imaging with JWST/MIRI, down to within $\lambda$/D. Additionally, we use our KPI setup to successfully recover four known companions orbiting white dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This analysis shows that at these wavelengths KPI can uniquely access the orbital parameter space where inward-migrating post-main-sequence giant exoplanets are now thought to exist. We discuss the prospects for applying KPI to a larger sample of white dwarfs observed with JWST, increasing the volume of directly imaged close-in post-main-sequence exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13502" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A New Method for Aperture Masking Interferometric Imaging: Demonstration with the JWST</a><span class="id">[2510.13502]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new method for aperture masking interferometric (AMI) imaging at near-IR wavelengths using radio astronomical techniques. The method starts with derivation of interferometric visibilities from a Fourier transform of the interferograms. An iterative joint optimization process is then employed, using self-calibration of the interferometric element-based complex voltage gains (i.e. electric fields), and CLEAN deconvolution to obtain the source structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method using the NIRISS aperture masking interferometer on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at 4.8 $\mu$m and 3.8 $\mu$m. Due to a number of effects (the large pixel size, charge migration, near-field optics), the method also requires an initial visibility-based amplitude normalization using observations of a well know point-source calibration star. We employ early science observations of the dusty binary Wolf-Rayet star WR137. Images with a dynamic range (peak/rms) of $\sim 240$ on the target, and $\sim 1000$ on the calibrator, are synthesized from a short integration. The self-calibration process determines the photon path-lengths through the optical system to each aperture using data on the target source itself, thereby representing an essentially 'real-time', precise wavefront error sensor. Four independent measures of the JWST mirror segment pistons (two wavelengths for two sources), agree to within 10 nm to 15 nm, comparable to the expected errors based on an analysis of closure phases on the calibrator star. Including a baseline-based phase correction improves the dynamic range of the final images by about 23\%.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design of an Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope array layout with differential programming</a><span class="id">[2510.13506]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current optimization of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes arrays, also called Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) arrays, relies on brute-force human-driven approaches based on large simulations requiring both high amount of storage and long computation time. To explore the full phase space of telescope positioning of a given array even more simulations would be required. To optimize any array layout, we explore the possibility of developing a differential program with surrogate models of IACT arrays based on high-level instrument response functions (IRFs). The simulation time of a single telescope to a cosmic-ray event can be significantly reduced with its instrument response function or with generative models. However, it is not straight forward to model the array of telescopes from a set of single telescope surrogate models as the array is a stereoscopic imaging system. The complexity increases as well if the telescopes in the array are of different types. Additionally, the optimum of the array layout depends on the scientific use case. Current array layout optimization are obtained by minimizing the sensitivity of the array, a metric that depends on several high-level parameters such as the trigger efficiency, the energy and angular resolution, as well as the background rejection capability. The variety of telescopes types in IACT arrays, such as in the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), not only extends the sensitive energy range but also allows for cross-calibration of the instruments. Therefore, the optimal array layout is not only which minimizes sensitivity but also which reduces the systematic uncertainties. We focus on the optimization of a telescope array based on the SST-1M IACTs in Hanle, Ladakh India aiming at building a generic optimization pipeline for future ground-based cosmic-ray observatories</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13765" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimizing Supernova Classification with Interpretable Machine Learning Models</a><span class="id">[2510.13765]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Photometric classification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is critical for cosmological studies but remains difficult due to class imbalance and observational noise. While deep learning models have been explored, they are often resource-intensive and lack interpretability. We present a computationally efficient and interpretable classification framework that maintains high performance on imbalanced datasets. We emphasize the use of PR-AUC and F1-score as more informative metrics than ROC-AUC in severely imbalanced settings. Using an XGBoost ensemble optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, we classified light curves from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge (SPCC), comprising 21,318 events with a 3.19 imbalance ratio (non-Ia to Ia). Our model achieved a PR-AUC of $0.993^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, an F1-score of $0.923 \pm 0.008$, and a ROC-AUC of $0.976 \pm 0.004$, matching or exceeding deep learning performance on precision-recall trade-offs while using fewer resources. Despite slightly lower overall accuracy, our method balances false positives and false negatives, improving the efficiency of spectroscopic follow-up. We show that optimized ensemble models offer a reproducible and lightweight alternative to complex architectures, particularly for large-scale surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) where transparency and efficiency are essential.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13677" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APRIL: Auxiliary Physically-Redundant Information in Loss - A physics-informed framework for parameter estimation with a gravitational-wave case study</a><span class="id">[2510.13677]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the system under study directly into the training of Neural Networks, ensuring solutions that respect physical laws. While effective for single-system problems, standard PINNs scale poorly to datasets containing many realizations of the same underlying physics with varying parameters. To address this limitation, we present a complementary approach by including auxiliary physically-redundant information in loss (APRIL), i.e. augment the standard supervised output-target loss with auxiliary terms which exploit exact physical redundancy relations among outputs. We mathematically demonstrate that these terms preserve the true physical minimum while reshaping the loss landscape, improving convergence toward physically consistent solutions. As a proof-of-concept, we benchmark APRIL on a fully-connected neural network for gravitational wave (GW) parameter estimation (PE). We use simulated, noise-free compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals, focusing on inspiral-frequency waveforms to recover the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, the total mass $M_\mathrm{tot}$, and symmetric mass ratio $\eta$ of the binary. In this controlled setting, we show that APRIL achieves up to an order-of-magnitude improvement in test accuracy, especially for parameters that are otherwise difficult to learn. This method provides physically consistent learning for large multi-system datasets and is well suited for future GW analyses involving realistic noise and broader parameter ranges.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Third Workshop on Extremely Precise Radial Velocities: The New Instruments</a><span class="id">[1801.05383]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Third Workshop on Extremely Precise Radial Velocities was held at the Penn Stater Conference Center and Hotel in State College, Pennsylvania, USA from 2016 August 14 to 17, and featured over 120 registrants from around the world.

KM3NeT/ORCA is designed for the measurement of neutrino properties and KM3NeT/ARCA for the detection of high-energy neutrinos from the cosmos. Neutrinos are indirectly detected using three-dimensional arrays of photo-sensors which detect the Cherenkov light that is produced when relativistic charged particles emerge from a neutrino interaction. The analogue pulses from the photo-sensors are digitised offshore and all digital data are sent to a station on shore where they are processed in real time using a farm of commodity servers and custom software. In this paper, the design and performance of the software that is used to filter the data are presented. The performance of the data filter is evaluated in terms of its efficiency, purity and capacity. The efficiency is measured by the effective volumes of the sensor arrays as a function of the energy of the neutrino. The purity is measured by a comparison of the event rate caused by muons produced by cosmic ray interactions in the Earth's atmosphere with the event rate caused by the background from decays of radioactive elements in the sea water and bioluminescence. The capacity is measured by the minimal number of servers that is needed to sustain the rate of incoming data. The results of these evaluations comply with all specifications. The count rates of all photo-sensors are measured with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz. These data are input to the simulations of the detector response and will also be made available for interdisciplinary research.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The evolution of PUCHEROS from a basic to a competitive tool for stellar astrophysics</a><span class="id">[2509.00264]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present PUCHEROS +, a new spectrograph developed as an enhanced version of PUCHEROS (Pontificia Universidad Catolica High Echelle Resolution Optical Spectrograph), which was the first high-resolution spectrograph built at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (UC).

The modeled abundances indicate that the RT more closely reproduces the laboratory abundances, with deviations within $\pm$5% for both H$_{2}$O ice and H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O with $\sim$100 $\mu$m grains. In contrast, the LM shows slightly larger discrepancies, typically ranging from $\pm$5-15% from the true abundances. Interestingly, both LM and RT tend to consistently overestimate the abundance of H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O and underestimate H$_{2}$O ice across all mixtures. Nonetheless, when H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O either dominates (&gt;80% as observed on Europa's trailing hemisphere; Carlson et al. 2005) or is present only in trace amounts ($\sim$10% on areas in Europa's leading hemisphere; Dalton III et al. 2013; Ligier et al. 2016), both the LM and RT render acceptable results within $\pm$10% uncertainty. Thus, spectral modeling using the RT is preferred for constraining the surface composition across Europa, although the LM remains viable in specific compositional regimes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introducing The SHell misAlignment Detection for straylight Estimation (SHADE) algorithm: the case of XMM-Newton</a><span class="id">[2510.04659]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When performing X-ray observations with a Wolter-I telescope, the presence of bright off-axis sources can introduce unfocused rays, known as straylight, which contaminate the detector and compromise the scientific analysis. Among the different components of straylight, single reflections off the hyperboloid section of the mirror shells often produce arc-like patterns on the detector. These arcs depend not only on the off-axis angle of the source but also on the geometrical alignment of the individual shells. In this paper, we introduce the SHell misAlignment Detection for straylight Estimation (SHADE) algorithm, a novel and flexible tool designed to infer the misalignment parameters of individual shells, reproduce the geometry of straylight arcs and predict its pattern on the detector. SHADE allows us to model each shell displacement with two parameters: $(\gamma,\xi)$ that represents the tilt amplitude and direction. While the algorithm is general and applicable to any Wolter-like telescope, we demonstrate its effectiveness using a set of XMM-Newton observations of the low-mass X-ray binary GX5-1. As a proof of concept, we recover the best-fit misalignment parameters for a selected shell, obtaining $\gamma = 21.9''^{+10.3}_{-9.02}$ and $\xi = 5.88^{+1.02}_{-0.97}$ rad. SHADE represents a new approach to diagnosing mirror misalignments from straylight patterns and can support both pre and post-launch calibration efforts and future telescope designs.</p></div></details></article></body>
