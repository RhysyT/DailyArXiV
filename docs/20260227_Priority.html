We argue that under optimistic assumptions about the probability of life and intelligence emerging on Earth-like planets, the absence of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations imposes limits on their lifespan. Our analysis suggests that if intelligent life is common, technological civilizations must be relatively short-lived, with lifetimes constrained to $\lesssim 5\times10^3$ years under our most optimistic scenario. Considering electromagnetic communication, we note that our current light cone encompasses the entire Galactic history over the past $\sim 10^5$ years, making the lack of detected signals particularly puzzling for long-lived civilizations. We emphasize that these results should be interpreted as upper bounds derived from the Fermi paradox, not as predictions of actual lifespans.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaia DR3 Analysis of Four Open Clusters Toward the Galactic Anticenter</a><span class="id">[2602.22304]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study provides a detailed examination of the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and dynamical properties of the open clusters COIN-Gaia 24, Czernik 24, FSR 0893, and UBC 74, which are located in the direction opposite to the Galactic center. Astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic data from the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog were used to ensure a precise characterization of cluster members and their physical properties. Membership determination was performed using the UPMASK algorithm applied to a five-dimensional parameter space, yielding 116, 179, 238, and 387 likely members for each cluster, respectively. Structural parameters were derived by fitting King profiles to the radial density distributions of high-probability members. Astrophysical parameters were estimated through Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo isochrone fitting based on PARSEC evolutionary models, complemented by spectral energy distribution analysis using ARIADNE. The resulting extinctions, distances, metallicities, and ages indicate that these are moderately reddened, intermediate-age clusters located between 1 and 3.5 kpc from the Sun. Mean radial velocities combined with Galactic orbital integrations computed with galpy show that all four clusters follow nearly circular, low-eccentricity orbits typical of thin-disc populations. All four OCs have dynamical relaxation times of 22-98 Myr. However, their ages exceed these times by several factors, particularly in Czernik 24, indicating that they are dynamically evolved systems, even though the calculated T_E values represent lower limits. The results confirm that these OCs serve as reliable tracers of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galactic thin disc.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can't see me: super-Eddington growth hindering X-ray detection in high-z broad-line AGNs</a><span class="id">[2602.22305]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit black hole mass estimates for high-redshift broad-line AGNs discovered with JWST by jointly analysing their broad emission lines and their systematic non-detections in deep Chandra imaging. Building upon the self-shadowed, super-Eddington accretion flow framework and the coronal over-cooling prescription of Madau &amp; Haardt (2024), we couple funnel-dependent Comptonization physics with slim-disc spectra from Kubota &amp; Done (2019) and explore the resulting parameter space through a full MCMC inference. Using the sample analysed by Lupi et al. (2024) and Maiolino et al. (2025), we show that X-ray weakness - manifested as extreme bolometric corrections, suppressed 2-10 keV luminosities, and non-detections in the 0.5-5 keV Chandra band - naturally arises when the corona is confined and radiatively over-cooled inside a narrow super-Eddington funnel. The combined broad line+X-ray analysis yields strongly bimodal posteriors: either very massive, very low-Eddington black holes (physically disfavoured), or a population of low-mass ($\sim 10^{6}-10^{7} ~M_{\odot}$) black holes accreting at $f_{\rm Edd} \gg 1$. The latter solution is strongly preferred for nearly all objects and returns masses consistent with, or lower than, local $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm star}$ relations, mitigating the extreme mass ratios implied by single-epoch virial estimators. The predicted intrinsic spectra are redder and exhibit reduced hard-X-ray output but higher bolometric luminosities, implying bolometric corrections larger than those typical of the local AGN population, yet consistent with low-redshift highly accreting counterparts. These results support a picture in which many JWST broad-line AGNs are powered by rapidly growing, super-Eddington black holes whose suppressed coronal emission and self-shadowed BLR geometry combine to mimic overmassive black holes at $z \gtrsim 6$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22306" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Morphology Catalog of Galaxies in CEERS: Evolution in the Size and Color Gradients of Galaxies Since Cosmic Dawn</a><span class="id">[2602.22306]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present measurements of morphological parameters from fitting 53,885 galaxies detected to a magnitude limit of F356W$&lt; 28.5$ in the CEERS NIRCam imaging with galfit in six broadband filters: F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, and F444W. We provide a public catalog of Sérsic index, effective semi-major axis, axis ratio, integrated magnitude, and position angle for these galaxies in each of the filters. Uncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated from simulated galaxies that have similar noise and background properties as the observed galaxies. We compare our measurements with those in the CANDELS/EGS field measured with HST/WFC3 and find that the sizes agree to within 0.09 dex and the Sérsic indices agree to within 0.13 dex. We further present the evolution in the size-mass relation, and find that the evolution to $z\sim9$ is consistent with previous results derived at lower redshift. Finally, we look at the color gradients of galaxies at $1&lt;z&lt;5$ and find that for late-type galaxies ($n&lt;2.5$), there is a strong dependence on mass, but no apparent evolution with redshift, indicating that the stellar populations and dust attenuation in more massive galaxies vary substantially with radius and contribute to significant morphological $k-$corrections. For early type galaxies ($n&gt;2.5$), the color gradients are nearly flat with no dependence on mass, indicating that the stellar populations are more uniform throughout. The structural measurements presented are accurate to $20\%$ or better for most galaxies with F356W $&lt;27.0$ mag and will enable further studies of galaxy morphology to $z\sim10$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filamentary Hierarchies and Superbubbles II: Impact of superbubbles and galactic dynamics on filament formation and fragmentation</a><span class="id">[2602.22326]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large scale phenomena in spiral galaxies such as shear, supernovae, and magnetic fields all contribute to the formation and subsequent evolution of filamentary structure and star formation within them. In this paper, we analyze the properties and dynamics of filaments in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy from Zhao et al. 2024. Using filament and superbubble structure analysis codes, we investigate the roles of galactic shear, supernovae and superbubbles, and magnetic fields on the stability and fragmentation of filaments. We find that local shear has little effect on filament stability and the largest structures at outer radii of the disk may be more likely to be dissipated by shear than supernovae. Filaments are largely parallel to the magnetic field, which plays a significant role in filament stability. By measuring the ratio of surface pressure on a filament to that on its central spine, $\chi_f=P_{surf}/P_{central}$, we find that filaments with $\chi_f \le 1$ are dominated by their own self gravity and have a strong tendency to be gravitationally supercritical, whereas those with $\chi_f &gt; 1$ are either transitory or in the act of being formed. Finally, we investigate the role of ISM pressure on filament dynamics and stability as a function of galactic radius, finding considerable changes in filament stability and the accompanying star formation rates in the inner versus outer regions of the disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It's a matter of time: Empirical Constraints on Supernova Yields and Delay Times from Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2602.22333]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The chemical abundances of a stellar population encode information about nucleosynthesis and its astrophysical sites, but this information is confounded by the specific star formation history of the host galaxy. As a result, placing empirical constraints on supernova yields and timing using abundances has been very challenging. We introduce a galactic chemical evolution model DLEIY that uses an observed star formation history and metallicity distribution to reduce these confounding factors. Using a joint statistical model of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies Sculptor and Fornax, simultaneous constraints on population-averaged yields and galactic outflows are achieved with DLEIY, without fixing the absolute scale of nucleosynthetic yields. The Fe yield from core collapse supernovae is consistent with existing theoretical yield models, while the measured Mg yield is a factor of 2-4 higher, corroborating previous suggestions that yield models may under-predict [Mg/Fe]. We also find that the rate of Type Ia supernovae is enhanced by about a factor of 5 relative to field galaxies, and the delay-time distribution goes as $\sim t^{-2}$, a much steeper relationship than that measured from supernova surveys ($\sim t^{-1.1}$). These findings may suggest a metallicity dependence of the Type Ia rate and delay-time distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of CO$_2$ ice in the planetary nebula NGC 6302</a><span class="id">[2602.22366]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using JWST/MIRI observations, we report the detection of CO$_2$ ice in the dusty torus of the planetary nebula NGC 6302, an environment generally considered hostile to fragile molecular species and ices due to intense UV irradiation. This detection accompanies cold (20-50 K) gas-phase CO$_2$ along the same sightlines. The ice absorption profile exhibits a double-peak profile, a characteristic of pure, crystalline CO$_2$ ice. The CO$_2$ gas-to-ice ratio is more than an order of magnitude higher than in young stellar objects, pointing to distinct ice formation or processing mechanisms in evolved stellar environments. This discovery demonstrates that the dusty torus provides sufficient shielding to harbour ice chemistry, and that ice-mediated surface reactions must be incorporated into chemical models of planetary nebulae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22375" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identifying Evolutionary Stages of Molecular Clumps through Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning</a><span class="id">[2602.22375]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The evolutionary classification of molecular clumps, crucial for understanding star formation, is commonly based on human-assigned categories derived from infrared (IR) emission and well-established morphological criteria. However, due to ambiguous signatures, distance uncertainties or heavily obscured IR emission, a significant fraction of sources often remains unclassified. This work demonstrates the capability of machine learning (ML) as a complementary, data-driven approach to automate the identification and classification of these clumps using data from the MALT90 survey, complemented by Spitzer IR photometry. We applied unsupervised clustering with HDBSCAN on molecular line intensities, revealing distinct groupings that correspond to evolutionary stages. Using only five molecular lines (HCO$^+$, HNC, N$_2$H$^+$, HCN, C$_2$H), we identified stable clusters of protostars and regions without active star formation, driven primarily by C$_2$H and N$_2$H$^+$ emission. Incorporating H$^{13}$CO$^+$ gave rise to a distinct UV-dominant cluster, tracing more evolved regions. Infrared properties appeared as non-significant features implying that envelopes of clumps with different masses are similar in their global infrared characteristics. We then employed supervised learning to classify clumps with previously uncertain categories and provided classifications for 522 objects, predominantly as regions without active star formation. Our results show that ML techniques can effectively uncover intrinsic evolutionary structures in complex astrochemical data and assign categories to uncertain sources, providing a powerful, data-driven complement to traditional methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22384" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D-Herschel: Constraining Dust Emission with Panchromatic Modeling of 3D-HST Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2602.22384]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present 3D-Herschel, a new 0.3-350$\mu$m photometric catalog that combines deblended Herschel far-infrared (FIR) imaging with the CANDELS/3D-HST legacy fields to probe the dust-obscured universe. Using the 17-parameter fitting code Prospector-$\beta$, a Bayesian inference framework, we model 41,387 galaxies spanning 0.5 $&lt; z &lt;$ 2.5 to measure stellar and dust properties with realistic error bars. Comparing fits with and without FIR constraints, we find that for the 3.2$\%$ of galaxies with $&gt;3 \sigma$ detections in at least two Herschel bands, UV-MIR-only models (0.3-24$\mu$m) recover robust stellar ages, SFRs, and stellar masses (50-70$\%$ within the median 1$\sigma$ error). Consequently, the star-forming sequence shows no systematic offset, with an average deviation of 0.1$\pm$0.07 dex at fixed stellar mass for FIR-detected sources at all redshifts. However, the use of rigid log-average IR templates with fixed dust emission parameters ($\gamma$, $U_{\mathrm{min}}$, $Q_{\mathrm{PAH}}$) in UV-MIR modeling corresponds to an unevolving MIR-to-IR luminosity ratio and cold dust temperatures. By contrast, fits that include Herschel photometry, with added freedom in the FIR, yield dust temperatures that are $\sim$7K warmer at all redshifts, with $\sim$0.2 dex higher IR-to-7.7$\mu$m luminosity ratios at the low-mass end of a Herschel-detected sample (log($M_{\star}$) $\sim$9.6 $M_{\odot}$). These results demonstrate that MIR-to-IR conversions depend on stellar mass, cautioning against $L_{\mathrm{IR}}$-independent templates without FIR data. For galaxies with $&lt;10^{11} \ M_{\odot}$ at $z&gt;1.5$, even with state-of-the-art analysis, Herschel can at best provide upper limits due to source confusion; next-generation FIR telescopes will be essential to fully characterize dust emission in distant galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Red Dots as Obscured Little Blue Dots: A Super-Eddington Unification Model</a><span class="id">[2602.22386]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We test whether &quot;Little Red Dots&quot; (LRDs) are dust-reddened, high-inclination counterparts of compact, blue broad-line AGNs (&quot;Little Blue Dots&quot;, LBDs) powered by super-Eddington accretion. We model the central engine as a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure supported accretion flow whose funnel yields strongly anisotropic, intrinsically blue ionizing continua, coupled to an equatorially concentrated BLR and a dusty screen with modest covering factor. Using inclination-dependent SEDs as input to Cloudy, we show that the extreme broad Halpha equivalent widths (EWs) of JWST LRDs are reproduced with global BLR covering factors of only 15%, consistent with standard Type 1 AGNs. Large Balmer EWs arise because self-shadowing suppresses the high-inclination optical continuum while the BLR is illuminated by an EUV-rich SED. Weak high-ionization lines follow from orientation-dependent suppression of the XUV/soft X-ray continuum toward equatorial directions, without requiring a fully enclosing gaseous &quot;cocoon&quot;. With a gray attenuation law of AV = 2.8 along LRD-selected sightlines, the fiducial model matches the V-shaped UV-optical continua and large Balmer decrements; strong Balmer breaks occur only for the most obscured views. A compact equatorial dust component tied to the BLR and normalized by energy conservation intercepts and reradiates only a small fraction of Lbol, producing a modest hot-dust bump and far-IR/sub-mm emission consistent with current limits and implying small dust masses. The model unifies LRD and LBD observables via orientation, predicting correlated trends in Halpha EW, Balmer decrement, Balmer break, high-ionization line strengths, and IR emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22407" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cepheid-based Distances to NGC 4303 and NGC 1068</a><span class="id">[2602.22407]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Cepheid-based distances to two canonical AGN: NGC 4303 (M 61) and NGC 1068. Data were obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope with nonredundant time spacing over 12 visits for each target, and observations were made with the F555W and F814W filters. We found 32,694 point sources in NGC 4303, and 130 of these were determined to be strong Cepheid candidates with periods ranging  $13-93$ days. In NGC 1068, we found 20,207 point sources, where 51 of these were strong Cepheid candidates with periods  $14-92$ days. We fit the period$-$luminosity relationship, calibrated based on a geometric distance to the LMC by Riess et al. (2019), to our Cepheid candidates in each galaxy and correct for potential effects of metallicity. Using a distance constraint for the LMC given by Pietrzyński et al. (2019), this yields a distance modulus of $\mu = 31.083 \pm 0.035$ mag for NGC 4303 and $\mu = 30.150 \pm 0.106$ mag for NGC 1068. Thus, we measure distances of $D = 16.47 \pm 0.27$ Mpc to NGC 4303 and $D = 10.72 \pm 0.52$ Mpc to NGC 1068.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AGN Feedback and the Development of Dusty Multiphase Gas in X-ray Emitting Elliptical Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2602.22415]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper investigates the physical and kinematic properties of dust-rich regions in a small sample of group-centered elliptical galaxies, emphasizing their connection with the hot X-ray emitting gas and detailed dust grain characteristics. Comprehensive multi-wavelength data, including H-alpha and CO emission detected by MUSE and ALMA, demonstrate the presence of dust clouds embedded within complex, hot X-ray atmospheres shaped by AGN feedback. X-ray images show bubbles and cavities surrounded by bright rims. We find that dust regions containing molecular gas traced by CO are preferentially located at the rims of these X-ray cavities, suggesting that AGN-driven outflows enhance the condensation of cold, dusty gas at these compressive interfaces. Kinematic measurements indicate that molecular and ionized gas phases are dynamically and spatially linked, supporting the framework of a multiphase medium arising from the top-down condensation rain in the hot plasma and related chaotic cold accretion. Crucially, spatial variations in the total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv show that regions where dust, CO, and H-alpha emission coincide exhibit notably smaller Rv values, implying steeper extinction curves and the predominance of smaller or less evolved dust grains within these mixed-phase environments. This contrasts with larger Rv values found elsewhere in the dust clouds, suggesting grain growth or survival mechanisms within shielded cold gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion-modified Stars in Accretion Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei: Contribution to AGN disk viscosity</a><span class="id">[2602.22478]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is widely believed that stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs) exist within the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN), forming a distinct population termed “accretion-modified star&quot; (AMS). Gas from the dense disk accretes onto these AMSs, dissipating substantial gravitational energy through a mini-disk around the sMBHs, which drives powerful outflows that interact with the surrounding disk gas. In this study, we investigate two scenarios for AMS accretion: episodic Bondi explosions with hyper-Eddington accretion (Scenario A) and steady Eddington accretion (Scenario B). These outflows generate turbulence, facilitating outward angular momentum transport in the AGN disk via shock interactions and angular momentum exchange. We explore a broad parameter space-spanning the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass ($M_{\rm p}$), dimensionless accretion rate ($\dot{\mathscr{M}}_{\rm p}$), sMBH mass function, and spatial distribution-to calculate the effective viscosity parameter $\alpha_{\rm AMS}$. Our analysis reveals the scaling relations $\alpha_{\rm AMS}\propto\zeta M_{\rm p}^2\dot{\mathscr{M}}_{\rm p}$ for Scenario A and $\alpha_{\rm AMS}\propto\zeta M_{\rm p}^{1.5}\dot{\mathscr{M}}_{\rm p}^{0.1}$ for Scenario B, where $\zeta$ denotes the ratio of total sMBH mass to the SMBH disk mass. For $\zeta={0.01}$ and $M_{\rm p}=10^8 M_\odot$, $\alpha_{\rm AMS}$ ranges from $\sim{3\times10^{-4}}$ to ${0.01}$ (Scenario A) and $\sim{3\times10^{-3}}$ to ${0.04}$ (Scenario B) from the inner to outer disk regions. These results demonstrate that AMS feedback provides an efficient mechanism for angular momentum transport in AGN disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22485" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Environment as the Primary Driver of Dwarf Satellite Statistics</a><span class="id">[2602.22485]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context:Satellite dwarf galaxies provide key constraints on galaxy formation and evolution as their abundance and spatial distribution reflect both host properties and large-scale environment. Aims:This study quantifies the dependence of satellite populations on host stellar mass, morphology and star formation activity across diverse environments and traces their evolution with cosmic time within the LCDM framework. Methods:The Millennium simulation combined with the semi-analytic model is employed to construct consistent samples of host galaxies brighter than Mr &lt; -16 and their satellites (M_* &gt;= 3x10^5 M_sun, Mr &lt; -9) within their virial radius. Satellite abundance and radial profiles are analyzed in cluster, group and void environments and their evolution is traced from z=2 to z=0 across three host stellar mass bins. Results:Satellite abundance correlates strongly with host stellar and bulge mass while host morphology has little additional impact once stellar mass is controlled for. Dense environments suppress satellite populations relative to voids. At z=0 radial profiles reveal strong central concentrations in voids flattened distributions in clusters and intermediate trends in groups. Their redshift evolution shows progressive flattening for low- and intermediate-mass hosts in dense environments stability for massive hosts and increasing central concentration in voids. The cosmic evolution of satellite abundance further highlights distinct pathways: gradual accumulation in voids, mass-dependent trends in groups and strong late-time suppression in clusters. Conclusions:The distribution and abundance of satellite galaxies are governed primarily by environment with host stellar mass and cosmic epoch acting as secondary modulators. Forthcoming wide-field surveys such as LSST, Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope are expected to provide stringent tests of these predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22516" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using Lithium and Beryllium to Study Structure and Evolution of Rotating Stars: Spite Plateau of Halo Stars</a><span class="id">[2602.22516]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The observed lithum (Li) abundance of Galactic halo stars mainly fall within the range of 2.0–2.4 dex. This nearly constant value, known as the Spite plateau, is approximately a factor of three lower than the value predicted from cosmic microwave background measurements and standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) calculations. This discrepancy – referred to as the cosmological Li problem – is considered a potential indication of new physics or astrophysical processes. We employed models incorporating gravitational settling, diffusion, rotation, and magnetic fields to explain the Spite plateau. The rotating models predict that Li abundances in stars with ages of roughly 8–13 Gyr and effective temperatures between 6400 and 5900 K generally fall within 2.0–2.4 dex, forming a well-defined Li plateau, followed by a sharp decline in Li abundance down to about 5200 K. The Li plateau results from the combined effects of variations in convection zone depth, gravitational settling, diffusion, rotation, and magnetic fields. For red giant branch stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}} \lesssim$ 5200 K, the rotating models predict another Li plateau with an abundance of about 1.0 dex. These results are in good agreement with observations. Moreover, the initial Li abundance of 2.72 dex adopted in the models matches the BBN prediction, implying that the Li problem arises from stellar Li depletion. Furthermore, the rotating models also reproduce the Li and Be distributions of the sample that exhibit the Spite plateau meltdown and Be deviation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identify  20,000 Li-rich Giants in the LAMOST Low-Resolution Survey</a><span class="id">[2602.22572]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Li-rich giants serve as valuable tracers of stellar evolution and surface enrichment processes, for which a statistically large and homogeneous sample is crucial. Using the massive low-resolution ($R \sim 1800$) spectroscopic dataset from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey, we systematically search for Li-rich giants by determining their stellar lithium abundances through template matching of the Li I 6708 Å absorption line with a grid of synthetic spectra generated from ATLAS9 model atmospheres. The derived abundances are validated against previous high-resolution studies, showing good consistency with a mean absolute error of about 0.15 dex. Therefore, we adopt a threshold of $A(\rm{Li}) &gt; 1.65$ dex to select Li-rich candidates, followed by visual inspection to ensure the reliability of each detection. Eventually, more than 20,000 Li-rich giants are identified, corresponding to approximately 2.5% of all giants in LAMOST DR9. We also investigate the occurrence rate of Li-rich giants in different evolutionary stages.

The VLBI components show low brightness temperatures ($T_{\rm b} \approx 10^9$ K in the core) and jet-to-counterjet ratios consistent with only mildly relativistic intrinsic speeds ($\beta \lesssim 0.6$ for inclinations $\theta \lesssim 80^\circ$), indicating weakly powered pc-scale outflows. The low radio-Eddington ratios $\log(L_{\rm R,1.4\,GHz}/L_{\rm Edd}) \approx -5$ to $-8$ support this interpretation. Three objects lie on the fundamental plane of black hole activity, implying that global accretion-jet coupling in spiral DRAGNs is similar to that in other AGNs. Comparison with recent GRMHD simulations of thin-disk jets suggests that the VLBI-scale cores in spiral DRAGNs may trace an early or intermittently magnetized phase of jet launching. The coexistence of weak pc-scale jets and large kpc-scale lobes implies recurrent or long-duty-cycle jet activity in these late-type hosts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automated Identification of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch in Globular Clusters with Gaia Data</a><span class="id">[2602.22682]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study introduces an automated approach for identifying the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in globular clusters, combining astronomical data with algorithmic methods. Using a dataset of 160 globular clusters and Python scripts, we matched stellar sources with Gaia data. Our script generates color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and uses the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm to remove outliers. Applying a second-degree polynomial to fit red giant branch (RGB), we identify the TRGB as the star closest to the fitted curve's endpoint. By this method, we expanded TRGB samples in global clusters to 91 with newer observational data. Our results show a decreasing trend in I-band luminosity for metallicities greater than $-$1, consistent with previous studies. The results show a robust trend fitting and the $\rm M_{I}$ of TRGB is about $-$4.02 with extremely low metallicity. Our approach enhances TRGB identification efficiency while providing valuable insights for developing automatic tools in astronomical data analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KMT-2024-BLG-3237: Another Free-Floating Planet Candidate with Angular Einstein Radius Measurement</a><span class="id">[2602.22709]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planet formation theories suggest the presence of free-floating planets (FFPs) that are ejected from their formation sites. While these planets emit very little light, they can be identified through gravitational microlensing. Here, we report the discovery of a FFP candidate in the microlensing event KMT-2024-BLG-3237. The observed light curve exhibits strong finite-source effects characterized by a small amplitude $(\lesssim 0.9\,{\rm mag})$ and a short timescale $(\lesssim 3\,{\rm days})$. The analysis yields an Einstein timescale of $t_{\rm E} = 0.54\pm0.02\,{\rm days}$ and an angular Einstein radius of $\theta_{\rm E} = 6.30\pm0.48\,\mu{\rm as}$. The measurements make it possible to estimate the lens mass as $M \simeq 102\,M_{\oplus}\,(\pi_{\rm rel}/16\,\mu{\rm as})^{-1}$, where $\pi_{\rm rel}$ is the relative lens-source parallax. Depending on the unknown $\pi_{\rm rel}$, the lens could be a Neptune-mass planet $(\pi_{\rm rel} \simeq 0.1\,{\rm mas})$ or a Saturn-mass planet $(\pi_{\rm rel} \simeq 16\,\mu{\rm as})$. A Bayesian analysis yields the lens mass $M = {67.3}_{-42.5}^{+103.2}\,M_{\oplus}$ and the lens distance $D_{\rm L} = {7.34}_{-2.11}^{+0.96}\,{\rm kpc}$. This lens is the eleventh isolated microlens with a measurement of $\theta_{\rm E} &lt; 10\,\mu{\rm as}$. We find that additional searches for possible signatures of a lens host do not show significant evidence for the host.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond Colors: Probing Redshifts from Galaxy Morphology in Single-band Images with ViT-MDNz</a><span class="id">[2602.22711]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To address the challenge of estimating redshifts when only single-band images are available, this study introduces a deep learning model named ViT-MDNz. Leveraging robust statistical priors learned from large-scale data concerning the correlation between redshift and morphology, the model can directly estimate redshifts and their associated uncertainties from single-band galaxy images. It integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract deep morphological features and a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to predict the full redshift probability density function. Trained and evaluated on approximately 300,000 single-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS), the model achieves a normalized median absolute deviation $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} = 0.034$ and an outlier fraction $f_{\rm out} = 2.6\%$ in the $r$-band for redshifts up to $z \lesssim 1$. Evaluations using probability integral transform (PIT) and continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) confirm that the predicted probability density functions are well calibrated and closely match the true distribution. These results demonstrate that competitive redshift estimates can be obtained using morphological features alone, and that incorporating color information further enhances the accuracy and robustness of the estimation. Therefore, ViT-MDNz provides a practical approach for redshift estimation of galaxy samples with limited photometric band coverage, contributing to improved completeness and usability of redshift catalogs for future large-scale surveys such as DESI and LSST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A FUV - optical approach for studying hierarchical star formation in nearby galaxies with UVIT</a><span class="id">[2602.22860]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Young star-forming clumps (SFCs) emit strongly in the ultraviolet (UV), making UV imaging ideal for detecting them. The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat, with 1.5arcsec resolution, has enabled the characterization of recently formed (up to 300 Myr) SFCs on tens of parsec scales in nearby galaxies. The spatial distribution of SFCs with different ages can provide insights into the hierarchy of star formation. This study presents a semi-novel approach to characterize SFCs in two nearby spiral galaxies, NGC 5457 and NGC 1313, by combining UVIT FUV data with g-band data from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS). We tested and optimized our method on NGC 5457 and showed that after proper background subtraction, the FUV-g color of SFCs can serve as an equally reliable age indicator as the widely-used FUV-NUV color. Next, we parametrized the star formation hierarchy in NGC 5457 using the two-point correlation function (TPCF) and found good agreement between the hierarchy parameters derived using FUV-NUV and FUV-g based ages. Using our FUV-g based SFC ages, we also constrained the global hierarchy parameter of NGC 1313 for the first time. The development of our FUV-g based method is motivated by the fact that the NUV channel of the UVIT is not operational, and there is a wealth of archival UVIT FUV-only observations of nearby galaxies. This work demonstrates the potential of our method in constraining the SFC ages and investigating hierarchical star formation in nearby galaxies using FUV and optical observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Environmental Switch in Black Hole Feeding: Bar-Driven vs. Merger-Driven Growth in IllustrisTNG50</a><span class="id">[2602.22875]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The relative roles of secular disc processes and galaxy interactions in driving the growth of supermassive black hole (SMBH) remain unclear. We present a time-resolved, per galaxy analysis of SMBH mass assembly that explicitly tracks bar formation, merger events, and the environment along the main progenitor branches using the high resolution IllustrisTNG50 cosmological simulation. We analyze barred and unbarred disc galaxies in isolated and non-isolated environments using physically motivated boundary definitions. We found that SMBH fueling pathways are regulated by the environment through the timing of bar formation relative to mergers. In isolated barred galaxies, stellar bars form early in dynamically cold discs and establish sustained, coherent accretion phases that regulate late-time SMBH growth. In contrast, in non-isolated galaxies, SMBH growth is dominated by early merger-driven accretion episodes, whereas bars form later and contribute weakly to the primary growth phase. Unbarred control samples show that mergers can trigger rapid SMBH growth without bars, but such growth remains episodic, whereas isolated discs without bars lack sustained accretion. These results demonstrate an environmental bifurcation in SMBH fueling: mergers act as efficient triggers of early growth in dynamically active systems, while bars regulate prolonged accretion only when they form in quiescent discs. This study provides a unified time-domain framework linking galaxy environment, disc dynamics, and SMBH growth by resolving the temporal ordering of bars, mergers, and accretion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Group Pre-processing in J1611+4026: Minor Rejuvenation of a Massive ETG fueled by Interaction-driven Gas Transfer</a><span class="id">[2602.22904]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interactions within galaxy groups are fundamental drivers of galactic evolution, and establishing a direct observational link between the dynamical processes of satellite galaxies and the rejuvenation of massive host galaxies remains challenging. We present a multi-wavelength work of J1611+4026, a unique triple system characterised by a massive early-type host galaxy, Component C and two gas-rich companions, Components A and B, which are currently undergoing a major merger in its near environment. Utilising deep optical imaging from DESI-LS and spectroscopic data from DESI and P200, we employ 2D morphological decomposition using \textsc{GALIGHT} alongside joint spectrophotometric synthesis modelling with \textsc{BAGPIPES} and \textsc{CIGALE} to deconstruct the structural properties and star formation histories of the member galaxies. Crucially, we identify an asymmetric tidal tail extending $\sim$15.15 kpc from Component A, confirming the ongoing interaction between the companions. Although Component C appears quiescent in both morphology and spectroscopy, we reveal a subtle robust signal of “minor rejuvenation”, characterised by significant internal dust extinction of $E(B-V) \sim 0.53$ and a UV excess. The reconstructed star formation history indicates a recent ($\sim$100 Myr) starburst that contributes a negligible fraction to the total stellar mass ($f_{\rm burst} &lt; 0.1$ per cent). We propose that this activity is fueled by the accretion of metal-enriched gas stripped from the interacting companions. These results strongly suggest group pre-processing, where interactions between satellite galaxies drive low-level star formation in the massive host through gas transfer, providing a quantitative benchmark for interaction-driven evolution in dense environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measurements of the HI intensity mapping power spectrum at low redshifts with MIGHTEE data: comparison with detected HI galaxies</a><span class="id">[2602.23055]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Line intensity mapping provides a statistical approach to tracing the large-scale distribution of matter in the Universe. We apply the HI intensity mapping technique to interferometric data from the MeerKAT International GHz-Tiered Extragalactic Explorations (MIGHTEE) Survey, analysing 17.5 hours of a single pointing in the COSMOS field, using a 60 MHz sub-band in the frequency range 1332 - 1392 MHz ($0.02 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.07$). Using a delay-spectrum-based estimator, we measure the HI power spectrum on sub-megaparsec scales and compare it directly to the power spectrum inferred from a catalogue of individually detected HI galaxies in the same field. After mitigating low-level broadband contamination through conservative outlier flagging in the three-dimensional power spectrum, cross-correlation of time-split visibilities yields a statistically significant detection on scales $3 \lesssim k \lesssim 20 \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ with a total signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 13$. Over this range, the power spectra obtained from visibilities and detected galaxies are consistent within uncertainties and have comparable amplitudes of order $10^{-2}$ - $10^{-1}$ $\mathrm{mK}^2 \mathrm{Mpc}^3$. End-to-end validation is performed by propagating detected galaxies through the power spectrum estimator via both direct intensity-field construction and simulated visibilities, demonstrating agreement up to $k \sim 20 \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, beyond which measurements become noise-dominated. A statistically significant correlation is also observed between the data and the simulated visibilities from the detected HI galaxies, which should be free of systematics. These results provide a self-consistent validation of interferometric HI intensity mapping at low redshift and demonstrate agreement with galaxy-based measurements within the same cosmological volume.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stochastic Evolution of Galactic Star Formation with Halo Coupling, AGN Quenching and Hopf Bifurcation Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2602.23077]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a computational framework for galactic evolution based on a coupled stochastic nonlinear oscillator, implemented with the \textbf{Stochastic Hopf Engine}. Gas density ($G$) and star formation rate ($S$) co-evolve through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, capturing the transition from quiescent stability to merger-driven starbursts. Scatter in dark matter halo properties, modeled as multiplicative noise via the \textbf{Euler–Maruyama method}, broadens the bifurcation into a regime where noise-induced bursts occur below the deterministic threshold. Simulations reveal a periodic signature, the \textbf{Galactic Heartbeat}, emerging as a deterministic limit cycle validated by the \textbf{data3} resonance peak in the star-formation spectrum. A radial reduction yields an effective \textbf{Fokker–Planck equation} for burst amplitude; its stationary solution matches numerical PDFs, providing statistical closure. Including differential shear $\Omega(r)$ and spatially varying bifurcation fields reproduces spiral morphologies and AGN-driven quenching. Driving the growth parameter sub-critical ($r_{agn} &lt; 0$) yields “Red and Dead” cores via attractor collapse. Dark matter halo scatter suppresses mean star formation while enhancing intermittency, offering a minimal yet interpretable framework linking local feedback and global potentials to macroscopic galactic evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distribution functions for spheroids</a><span class="id">[2602.23127]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy models comprising several components (including dark matter) that are bound by the self-consistently generated gravitational field are readily constructed from distribution functions (DFs) that are analytic functions of the action integrals J.

We show how DFs for both isotropic and radially biased spherical systems can be constructed with specified f(J). We show how to construct DFs for flattened systems with significant velocity anisotropy. Construction of self-consistent models rather than populations that are confined by an external potential leads to the conclusion that radially-biased spherical systems are generically unstable to quadrupolar perturbations. Chaos is likely key to maintenance of these constraints during adiabatic disc growth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variability of the X-ray obscuring wind in Mrk 335 with XMM-Newton/RGS</a><span class="id">[2602.23255]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Transient X-ray obscuration in Seyfert 1 galaxies is thought to arise from clumpy accretion-disk winds near the broad-line region (BLR), but the wind structure and its short-timescale variability are difficult to measure because high-resolution spectra are often suppressed during deep low states. We analyse a coordinated XMM-Newton/NuSTAR campaign on Mrk 335 in June 2021, complemented by long-term Swift monitoring, which captured the source in an intermediate-flux state that preserves strong RGS absorption features. We first model the broadband spectral energy distribution to determine the ionising continuum and then perform self-consistent photoionisation modelling of the RGS spectra. The stacked RGS spectrum requires three photoionised absorbers with time-averaged log xi approx 3.63, 3.10, and 2.01 and outflow velocities |v_out| approx 5820, 3210, and 2140 km/s. Their properties are broadly consistent with the three-phase obscurer reported in the 2009 intermediate state, indicating recurring multi-phase obscuration over decade timescales. Using five consecutive RGS observations, we track the wind evolution on day timescales and find strong variability in column density and ionisation in all phases, together with smaller but coherent changes in outflow velocity. During a flare, the low-ionisation phase shows an extreme drop in N_H, and the subsequent epoch exhibits an increase in outflow velocity in all phases, consistent with rapid restructuring and possible radiative acceleration in a clumpy wind. The high-ionisation phase responds most directly to changes in the ionising luminosity, while the lowest-ionisation phase shows at most a delayed response. Order-of-magnitude constraints place the obscurer at BLR scales (approx 10^3-10^5 R_g), and simple continuity arguments suggest kinetic power that can reach the percent level of L_bol for plausible estimates of geometry and clumpiness.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imprints of primordial magnetic fields on the late-time Universe</a><span class="id">[2602.23263]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) generated in the early Universe may leave observable imprints in the present-day large-scale structure. However, it remains unclear on which spatial scales primordial signatures can survive the nonlinear processes accompanying structure formation. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolution of PMFs during gravitational collapse and to determine the spatial scales on which primordial signatures can persist. We perform a suite of high-resolution direct numerical simulations of self-gravitating, magnetized halos. By varying the viscosity, we probe different Reynolds-number regimes and follow the coupled evolution of gravitational collapse and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, turbulence generated during collapse triggers the onset of a small-scale dynamo, which amplifies magnetic energy below the Jeans scale and modifies the magnetic energy spectrum significantly. Whether dynamo amplification dominates the magnetic field evolution is determined by the competition between the dynamo growth time and the free-fall time. Our results highlight the importance of resolving the Jeans scale and the associated turbulent inertial range in cosmological MHD simulations to accurately capture the interplay between gravitational compression and dynamo amplification and to assess which structures retain memory of primordial fields.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dyson spheres on H-R diagram</a><span class="id">[2602.23270]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The construction of Dyson spheres, megastructures designed to capture the total radiative output of stars, can be one of the most compelling techno-signature scenarios for advanced extraterrestrial civilizations.

Using radiative balance arguments and representative stellar parameters, we compute the temperature-radius relationship for full energy interception and place these hypothetical structures on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram to assess their observational signatures. Our results show that Dyson spheres around white dwarfs produce cooler and fainter blackbody emissions, peaking in the near- to mid-infrared, while those around M-dwarfs radiate more strongly but at longer wavelengths. In both cases, the equilibrium temperature decreases as R_ D^-1/2, while the total luminosity and observed bolometric flux remain fixed by the stellar output. These findings highlight the astrophysical suitability of low-luminosity stars as Dyson sphere hosts and provide practical constraints for future techno-signature searches using infrared surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23310" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme Emission Line Galaxies in CEERS Are Powered by Star Formation, not AGN</a><span class="id">[2602.23310]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a spectroscopic study of photometrically identified extreme emission-line galaxies (EELGs) with observed-frame equivalent widths (EWs) &gt;5000 A of either H alpha or H beta + [OIII] in the CEERS legacy deep field utilizing JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CAPERS, RUBIES, THRILS and CEERS surveys.

We identify AGN through broad H alpha emission-lines and report 6 new broad-line AGN at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7 identified by the deep ( 8 hr) G395M THRILS survey. We investigate the photometrically selected EELGs in a color-color plot designed for “Little Red Dot” selection and demonstrate that it effectively removes AGN with non-extreme lines from the sample. EELGs with and without broad lines show similar optical line ratios. We compare emission-line morphology to EWs and continuum morphologies and find that [OIII] morphology is more compact at higher EW.  10% of photometrically selected EELGs have broad Balmer lines, jumping to 35% in deep spectroscopy which indicates a significant fraction of photometrically selected EELGs may host AGN. However, many AGN selected as EELGs have incorrectly high photometric EWs. For sources with extreme emission-line EWs that pass our photometric criteria and host an AGN, we find that the narrow H alpha component dominates over the broad, especially in the highest-EW sources. This implies that even when an AGN is present, it does not dominate the extreme emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23354" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the Perseus Cluster II: Metallicity-Dependence of Massive Stars and Chemical Enrichment History</a><span class="id">[2602.23354]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The legacy Hitomi telescope has delivered the precise measurements of the chemical abundances in the Perseus Cluster, covering the Si-group (Si, S, Ar, Ca) and Fe-group elements (Cr, Mn, Ni).

This arises because time delay estimation is intrinsically extrapolative. In practice, global samplers such as nested sampling are steered towards spurious edge modes unless strict convergence criteria are adopted. We demonstrate this with simulations and show that the effect strengthens with higher data density over a fixed time span. To ensure convergence, we provide concrete guidance, notably increasing the number of live points. Further, we show that methods implicitly favouring small delays, for example optimisers and local MCMC, induce a bias towards larger $H_0$.

Here we present new constraints on the spike slope $\gamma_{\rm sp}$ using conventional DM indirect detection searches. We first recast existing photon and neutrino line searches, which include the contribution from the GC region, into constraints on the thermally-averaged DM annihilation cross section $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ in the presence of a DM spike. We then derive new bounds on the spike profile for a generic Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) DM scenario, where the thermal freeze-out mechanism fixes the annihilation cross-section at $\langle\sigma v\rangle\sim (2-3) \times 10^{-26}~{\rm cm}^3~{\rm s}^{-1}$. We find that for DM annihilation to photons, constraints from Fermi-LAT and MAGIC rule out spike profiles at the GC for a broad range of WIMP DM masses from 10 GeV to 100 TeV. Our result holds even if the photon channel constitutes only $1\%$ of the total annihilation rate. For the neutrino channel, we use the IceCube data to constrain the existence of an extremely steep spike in the $\mathscr{O}(1-10)$ TeV DM mass range. Our analysis can be easily extended to other annihilation channels.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The dramatic transition of the extreme Red Supergiant WOH G64 to a Yellow Hypergiant</a><span class="id">[2411.19329]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Red Supergiants (RSGs) are cool, evolved massive stars in their final evolutionary stage before exploding as a supernova.

Observational evidence for luminous warm, post-RSG objects and the apparent lack of luminous RSGs as supernova progenitors suggest a blueward evolution. Since the 1980s, WOH G64 has been considered the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic Cloud, given its large obscuration, outstanding size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Here we report a sudden, yet smooth change in its apparent nature. Time-series photometry and subsequent spectroscopy revealed the most extreme transition ever seen in the optical spectral features of a RSG. We discovered that WOH G64 is a rare, massive symbiotic binary system where the RSG transitioned to a Yellow Hypergiant. The dramatic transition can be explained either by the partial ejection of the pseudo-atmosphere during a common-envelope phase, or the return to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding 30 years. WOH G64 offers a unique opportunity to witness stellar evolution in real-time and assess the role of binarity on the final phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Zoo: Cosmic Dawn – morphological classifications for over 41,000 galaxies in the Euclid Deep Field North from the Hawaii Two-0 Cosmic Dawn survey</a><span class="id">[2509.22311]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present morphological classifications of over 41,000 galaxies out to $z_{\rm phot}\sim2.5$ across six square degrees of the Euclid Deep Field North (EDFN) from the Hawaii Twenty Square Degree (H20) survey, a part of the wider Cosmic Dawn survey. Galaxy Zoo citizen scientists play a crucial role in the examination of large astronomical data sets through crowdsourced data mining of extragalactic imaging. This iteration, Galaxy Zoo: Cosmic Dawn (GZCD), saw tens of thousands of volunteers and the deep learning foundation model Zoobot collectively classify objects in ultra-deep multiband Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) imaging down to a depth of $m_{HSC-i} = 21.5$. Here, we present the details and general analysis of this iteration, including the use of Zoobot in an active learning cycle to improve both model performance and volunteer experience, as well as the discovery of 51 new gravitational lenses in the EDFN. We also announce the public data release of the classifications for over 45,000 subjects, including more than 41,000 galaxies (median $z_{\rm phot}$ of $0.42\pm0.23$), along with their associated image cutouts. This data set provides a valuable opportunity for follow-up imaging of objects in the EDFN as well as acting as a truth set for training deep learning models for application to ground-based surveys like that of the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) collaboration and the newly operational Vera C.

We validate the target selections, photometry, masking, systematics, and redshift distributions of the bright galaxy (BG) and luminous red galaxy (LRG) target catalogues selected from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Survey DR10.1 (LS) imaging. We measure the angular two-point correlation function, $w(\theta)$, test masking strategies, and recover redshift distributions via cross-correlation with DESI DR1 spectroscopy. For BGs, we adopt LS MASKBITS that veto bright stars and extended sources; for LRGs, we pair these with unblurred coadds of the WISE imaging (unWISE) W1 artefact masks. These choices suppress small-scale excess power without imprinting large-scale modes. A Limber-scaling test across BG $r$-band magnitude slices shows that, after applying the scaling, the $w(\theta)$ curves collapse to a near-common power law, demonstrating photometric uniformity with depth and consistency between the North and South Galactic Caps. Cross-correlations with DESI spectroscopy recover the expected N(z), albeit with high shot noise at the brightest magnitudes. For LRGs, angular clustering in photo-$z$ slices (0.4&lt;z&lt;1.0$) is consistent between the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) and Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprints and is well described by an approximate power law once photo-$z$ smearing is included; halo-occupation fits are consistent with recent LRG studies. Together, these tests indicate that the masks and target selections yield reliable clustering statistics, supporting precision large-scale structure analyses with 4MOST CRS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12892" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMAGAL VII.

We present a catalog of the hierarchical continuum structure from 904 clumps observed in the ALMAGAL program, a high resolution ($0.15-0.8$\arcsec) 1.38 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large program targeting dense clumps capable of high-mass star formation throughout the Galactic disk. We use \verb|astrodendro|, a dendrogram-based algorithm, on a uniform linear resolution (2000 au) version of the data to extract 5160 continuum structures with effective radii spanning $800-42000$ au and estimated masses between $~0.05-670~M_{\odot}$. With our large sample, we statistically examine differences in clump properties for regions with varying levels of hierarchical complexity. We find that clumps exhibiting the richest hierarchical morphology have distributions with higher dust temperatures, surface densities, luminosity-to-mass (\textit{L/M}) ratios, and most massive core (MMC) masses, indicating that these regions tend to be at later evolutionary stages. We find a positive correlation between the mass of cores from the ALMAGAL core catalog and the surface density of their surrounding structures identified in this work. However, this correlation is weaker for cores in more evolved clumps, where lower mass cores can be found at higher local surface densities. This could indicate that some cores accrete mass less efficiently from the intra-clump reservoir than others, despite the total available mass increasing over time, a scenario that is congruent with a clump-fed core accretion model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Where Giants Dwell: Probing the Environments of Early Massive Quiescent Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.08674]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the environments of massive quiescent galaxies at 3 &lt; z &lt; 5 using the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) theoretical model. We select galaxies with stellar mass  10^10.8 Msun and specific star formation rate below 0.3x t_Hubble, yielding in a sample of about 5,000 galaxies within a simulated volume of  685 Mpc. These galaxies have formation times that cover well the range inferred from recent observational data, including a few rare objects with very short formation time-scales and early formation epochs. Model high-z quiescent galaxies are alpha-enhanced and exhibit a wide range of stellar metallicity, in broad agreement with current observational estimates. Massive high-z quiescent galaxies in our model occupy a wide range of environments, from void-like regions to dense knots at the intersections of filaments. Quiescent galaxies in underdense regions typically reside in halos that collapsed early and grew rapidly at high redshift, though this trend becomes difficult to identify observationally due to large intrinsic scatter in star formation histories. The descendants of high-z massive quiescent galaxies display a broad distribution in mass and environment by z=0, reflecting the stochastic nature of mergers. About one-third of these systems remain permanently quenched, while most rejuvenation events are merger-driven and more common in overdense regions. Our results highlight the diversity of early quiescent galaxies and caution against assuming that all such systems trace the progenitors of present day most massive clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02297" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Polarization and Magnetic Field of the Radio Arc as Observed by ALMA at 100 GHz</a><span class="id">[2601.02297]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The unique Galactic Center non-thermal filaments (NTFs) have been a focus of investigations for over 40 years. The most prominent manifestation of the NTFs is a bundle of parallel filaments known as the Radio Arc. Radio polarimetric observations made with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 10 GHz have revealed an alternating magnetic field pattern in the Radio Arc that could either be a result of multiple field systems being encountered along the line of sight or an intrinsic feature of the Radio Arc. These VLA observations were not able to distinguish between these possibilities due to the large rotation measures encountered towards the source. We present ALMA 100 GHz observations of the Radio Arc that are not impacted by significant Faraday effects. The observations reported here represent both the first time that ALMA has been used to study the NTFs and the first time 100 GHz polarimetric observations have been conducted on the Radio Arc. We find a uniformly rotated magnetic field with respect to the NTF filament orientation, with the angle of rotation being constant along the length of each filament. However, we find a systematically different magnetic field orientation in different Radio Arc filaments. We use this field pattern to update our understanding of the line-of-sight structures local to the Radio Arc. We find that the magnetic field inferred from our ALMA observations is likely a result either of confusion from multiple magnetic field systems or because the polarization is centrally concentrated within the NTF filaments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21841" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High Mass Dark Matter Searches With the High Speed Flux From the Large Magellanic Cloud</a><span class="id">[2511.21841]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As the hunt for dark matter progresses, recently there have been advances in the search for heavy dark matter with a mass well above a TeV.

We present a self-calibration method based on Zernike polynomials, applied to imaging data from the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST). Our approach constructs a global geometric distortion (GD) model from the position offsets of stars in the WFST r-band relative to Gaia DR3, achieving a median systematic uncertainty of below 10 mas for individual exposures. The correspondence between Zernike polynomials and optical aberrations reveals that the global GD of WFST is dominated by coma, inherent to the optical design, while rapid variations are likely attributed to the atmospheric dispersion corrector. Applying this method to 82 exposures from a single night (20250218), we find that the relative positions of the WFST CCDs remain stable, with standard deviations of less than 0.1 pixel in translation and 1.8 arcsec in rotation. The corrected WFST astrometric system is thereby tied to the Gaia DR3 coordinate frame, with further refinements to be presented in future work.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22739" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ASKAP Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Extragalactic Survey - Data Release 1</a><span class="id">[2602.22739]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Survey on the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is designed to systematically explore the dynamic radio sky, detecting sources that vary on timescales from minutes to several years.

The observations were carried out between June 2023 and May 2025, comprising 2945 images of 276 fields spanning $\sim 12300\ \mathrm{deg}^2$, observed at 888 MHz with a typical rms sensitivity of 0.24 mJy $\rm{beam}^{-1}$ and 12-20 arcsec resolution.

The VAST pipeline extracts the light curves for all the observed sources, and additional filters are implemented to improve the reliability of the resulting light curve database. The light curve database contains 0.5 million sources and 6.4 million individual measurements, publicly available through the CSIRO data access portal. An untargeted variability search yields 117 astrophysical variables, including 27 pulsars, 40 radio stars (10 newly detected at radio wavelengths), 44 active galactic nuclei, two optically identified supernovae, one supernova candidate, one brown dwarf, and two sources without multi-wavelength counterparts that are yet to be identified.

Achieving this goal requires extremely sensitive detectors capable of measuring faint signal of the exoplanet at the single-photon level while maintaining near-zero dark count rates. In the infrared, however, conventional semiconducting detector technologies struggle to meet these stringent requirements. In this work we demonstrate single-photon counting with superconducting Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors at the wavelengths 3.8, 8.5, 18.5, and 25 $\mu$m and measure resolving powers ($E/\delta E$) of 9.9, 5.9, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively, with corresponding dark count rates of 4, 8, 34, and 48 mHz. Our membrane-based devices reach phonon-loss limited performance at 3.8 $\mu$m, more than doubling the performance attainable with comparable solid-substrate devices. These results showcase the detector technology in the mid-infrared and the intricate measurement setup required for these sensitive detectors. We discuss how the detector design and measurement setup can be further optimized to increase the detector performance in the mid-infrared.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization Complex Mask Coronagraph (PIAACMC) on-sky demonstration with MagAO-X</a><span class="id">[2602.23016]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Advancing the technological development of small inner working angle (IWA) coronagraphs is essential to enabling high-contrast imaging of temperate exoplanets with future extremely large telescopes. The PIAACMC has been shown to closely approach the theoretical limit for coronagraphic throughput but its performance has not been fully characterised on-sky. This study serves as the first on-sky characterisation of contrast and IWA performance of the PIAACMC and its first technological demonstration at sub-micron wavelengths. We designed and manufactured phase-shifting focal plane masks optimised for two cases, a narrowband 875 filter (875nm, 3% band) and a broadband z' filter (908nm, 14% band). We tested the coronagraphs both with an internal source and on-sky using MagAOX, the extreme adaptive optics instrument for the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We show good recovery of the off-axis light's PSF shape within 92% and 97% depending on the separation when aligning the inverse set of PIAA lenses. We demonstrate sub-lambda/D IWAs of about 0.74 lambda/D in 875 and 0.76 lambda/D in z'. We reach average raw contrasts within 1 and 5 lambda/D with the internal source of about 1.6e-3 in 875 and 1.3e-3 in z'. These are mainly limited by the focal plane mask manufacturing errors, jitter, and residual quasi-static speckles in MagAO-X. We also show on-sky average raw contrasts within 1 and 5 lambda/D of about 1.4e-2 in 875 and 7.8e-3 in z'. These are likely limited by wavefront control, low-order aberrations, and poor observing conditions. Future work will improve the design and manufacturing processes of the focal plane masks to improve robustness and reach deeper contrast, as well as integrate focal plane wavefront control for non-common path aberrations correction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23067" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A High-Throughput AES-GCM Implementation on GPUs for Secure, Policy-Based Access to Massive Astronomical Catalogs</a><span class="id">[2602.23067]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The era of large astronomical surveys generates massive image catalogs requiring efficient and secure access, particularly during pre-publication periods where data confidentiality and integrity are paramount. While Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles guide the eventual public dissemination of data, traditional security methods for restricted phases often lack granularity or incur prohibitive performance penalties. To address this, we present a framework that integrates a flexible policy engine for fine-grained access control with a novel GPU-accelerated implementation of the AES-GCM authenticated encryption protocol. The novelty of this work lies in the adaptation and optimization of a parallel tree-reduction strategy to overcome the main performance bottleneck in authenticated encryption on GPUs: the inherently sequential Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) authentication hash (GHASH). We present both the algorithmic adaptation and its efficient execution on GPU architectures. Although similar parallelization techniques have been explored in cryptographic research, this is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of their integration into a high-throughput encryption framework specifically designed for large-scale astronomical data. Our implementation transforms the sequential GHASH computation into a highly parallelizable, logarithmic-time process, achieving authenticated encryption throughput suitable for petabyte-scale image analysis. Our solution provides a robust mechanism for data providers to enforce access policies, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity without hindering research workflows, thereby facilitating a secure and managed transition of data to public, FAIR archives.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23102" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TEPCat: The Transiting Extrasolar Planet Catalogue</a><span class="id">[2602.23102]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Transiting extrasolar planets are extraordinarily valuable for understanding the characteristics and formation of planets, because they are the only exoplanets whose physical and orbital properties can be measured to high precision.

Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer (ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in “good” and “bad” categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection.

For CMB lensing convergence $\times$ galaxy weak lensing convergence statistics, we compare the cross angular power spectra to wavelet phase harmonics (WPH). This work also serves as the first application of WST and WPH to these probes. For CMB lensing convergence, we find that WST and $C_\ell$'s yield similar constraints in forecasts for all surveys considered in this work. When CMB lensing convergence is crossed with galaxy weak lensing convergence projected from $\textit{Euclid}$ Data Release 2 (DR2), we find that WPH outperforms cross-$C_\ell$'s by factors between $2.2$ and $3.4$ for individual parameter constraints. To compare these different summary statistics, we develop a novel learned binning approach. This method compresses summary statistics while maintaining interpretability. We find this leads to improved constraints compared to more naive binning schemes for our wavelet-based statistics, but not for $C_\ell$'s.

The KSP is thus acting as an indicator for the degree of the agreement between the observations and the timing models and as a test in revealing the contribution of various physical processes in the stochastic background signal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundamental quantum limits for detecting ultrahigh frequency gravitational waves</a><span class="id">[2501.18146]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ultrahigh-frequency (above 10 kHz) gravitational waves (GW) window provides a unique opportunity to detect primordial GWs, free from astrophysical foregrounds that dominate lower frequencies. A stochastic GW background in this range is generically predicted from cosmological phase transitions and topological defects associated with grand unification and other ultra-high energy theories. We establish a universal quantum limit framework for various detection schemes, setting a fundamental bound on GW detectability. Our analysis reveals that backgrounds in the kHz-MHz range are in principle observable, whereas higher-frequency signals lie below the quantum limit. These results offer theoretical guidance for future detector designs and open new avenues for probing early universe physics.</p></div></details></article></body>
