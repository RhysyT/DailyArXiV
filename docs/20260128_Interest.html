<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interaction-Conditional Semantics and the Dissolution of Quantum Paradoxes</a><span class="id">[2601.18810]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper argues that several canonical puzzles in quantum mechanics, including spin measurement, the double slit, entanglement correlations, and Wigner's friend, share a common origin in a semantic error and the illicit promotion of interaction conditional outcomes to intrinsic properties. I introduce four principles that license only configuration relative predication, grounding outcomes in physical measurement geometry while preserving objectivity. Applying these principles uniformly dissolves each puzzle without new physics or ad hoc interpretive machinery. Bell's theorem and the Kochen-Specker theorem are reframed not as dynamical mysteries but as constraints on permissible explanatory structure, evidence that intrinsic-outcome semantics is incompatible with empirical reality. The result is a relational objectivity that avoids both naive property realism and observer subjectivism.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19566" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relativity with or without light and Maxwell</a><span class="id">[2404.19566]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The complex relationship between Einstein's second postulate and the Maxwell electromagnetic theory is elucidated. A simple deduction of the main results of the Ignatowski approach to the theory of relativity is given. The peculiar status of the principle of relativity among the Maxwellians is illustrated.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Echoes of the Land: An Interactive Installation Based on Physical Model of Earthquake</a><span class="id">[2507.14947]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Echoes of the Land is an interactive installation that transforms seismic dynamics into a multisensory experience through a scientifically grounded spring-block model. Simulating earthquake recurrence and self-organized criticality, the work generates real-time sound and light via motion capture and concatenative granular synthesis. Each block acts as an agent, producing emergent audiovisual cascades that visualize the physics of rupture and threshold behavior. This work exemplifies the amalgamation of scientific knowledge and artistic practice, opening new avenues for novel forms of musical instrument and narrative medium, while inviting further investigation into the intersection of emergent complexity, aesthetics and interactivity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing Latent Self-Similarity in Cellular Automata via Recursive Gradient Profiling</a><span class="id">[2601.17361]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cellular automata (CA), originally developed as computational models of natural processes, have become a central subject in the study of complex systems and generative visual forms. Among them, the Ulam-Warburton Cellular Automaton (UWCA) exhibits recursive growth and fractal-like characteristics in its spatial evolution. However, exact self-similar fractal structures are typically observable only at specific generations and remain visually obscured in conventional binary renderings. This study introduces a Recursive Gradient Profile Function (RGPF) that assigns grayscale values to newly activated cells according to their generation index, enabling latent self-similar structures to emerge cumulatively in spatial visualizations. Through this gradient-based mapping, recursive geometric patterns become perceptible across scales, revealing fractal properties that are not apparent in standard representations. We further extend this approach to UWCA variants with alternative neighborhood configurations, demonstrating that these rules also produce distinct yet consistently fractal visual patterns when visualized using recursive gradient profile. Beyond computational analysis, the resulting generative forms resonate with optical and cultural phenomena such as infinity mirrors, video feedback, and mise en abyme in European art history, as well as fractal motifs found in religious architecture. These visual correspondences suggest a broader connection between complexity science, computational visualization, and cultural art and design.</p></div></details></article></body>
