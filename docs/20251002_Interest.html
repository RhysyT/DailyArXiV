<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A quantitative analysis of Galilei's observations of Jupiter satellites from the Sidereus Nuncius</a><span class="id">[2503.12543]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new careful and comprehensive analysis the observations of the satellites of Jupiter from the Sidereus Nuncius that extends and complements previous similar studies. Each observation is compared to the predictions obtained using a modern sky simulator, verifying and trying to understand them individually. The work considers both the information that can be extracted from the sketches and the angular measurements reported by Galilei. Angular measurements allow assessing the absolute accuracy in relation to modern ephemerides. We evaluate the performances of the telescope in terms of separation power of close-by satellites and the inefficiency in the detection connected to the proximity to the disk. A sinusoidal fit of the data, allows measuring the relative major semi-axes of the satellites' orbits and their periods with a statistical precision of 2-4\% and 0.1-0.3\% respectively. The posterior fit error is used to estimate the measurements precision. We show that with this data one can infer in a convincing way the third law of Kepler for the Jupiter system. The 1:2:4 orbital resonance between the periods of Io and Europa/Ganymede can be determined with \% precision. In order to obtain these results it is important to separate the four datasets. This operation was an extremely difficult task for Galilei. Nevertheless we show how some indication on the periods emerge from the using the modern Lomb-Scargle technique on the full data-set. We briefly extend the use of the simulator to verify the accuracy in the seven observations of the Moon and the performance in reproducing the Pleiades, the Orion belt, the Orion head and the Beehive cluster. Finally we present images obtained with a replica of the telescope that highlights the challenges of these observations thus confirming the excellence underlying this amazing set of early scientific data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Particles before symmetry</a><span class="id">[2509.25276]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The standard model of particle physics is usually cast in symmetry-first terms. Recently, a geometry-first picture has been proposed, in which the relevant symmetries do not appear explicitly at the ground level of ontology. In this paper I extend this approach to two central mechanisms of the standard model: spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Yukawa coupling, both essential for particles to acquire mass. These reformulations offer alternative explanations cast in purely geometric terms. For example, a particle's quantum numbers correspond to the internal space it inhabits and to the geometric type of object it is (e.g. an $(n,m)$-tensor). I argue that a symmetry-first account in terms of principal and associated bundles admits a genuine geometry-first counterpart only when the group's representation coincides with the automorphism group of the fibre – a condition that cuts the slack tolerated by the symmetry-first view.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preparing students for the quantum information revolution: Interdisciplinary teaching, curriculum development, and advising in quantum information science and engineering</a><span class="id">[2510.00150]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As the field of quantum information science and engineering (QISE) continues its rapid growth, there are increasing concerns about the workforce demands and the necessity of preparing students for quantum-related careers. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the field, it is necessary to offer diverse educational opportunities to ensure that students are well-prepared for careers emerging from the second quantum revolution. In this paper, we present our findings from a qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with university QISE educators, who have taken on the challenges and opportunities in developing QISE courses and curricula for undergraduate and graduate students from different academic backgrounds. Our findings focus on common themes across undergraduate and graduate QISE education, as well as advising and mentoring students to prepare them for research in the field. The interviewees discussed the various strategies they had implemented, such as incorporating hands-on lab activities, integration of Python coding with Qiskit, and including project-based learning experiences. Furthermore, their reflections on mentorship and advising students emphasized the importance of recognizing students' prior preparation, providing targeted resources, and supportive learning environments. Our findings are meant to provide guidance for educators looking to implement effective QISE educational strategies that address the changing landscape of quantum information revolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond named methods: A typology of active learning based on classroom observation networks</a><span class="id">[2510.01124]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A growing number of introductory physics instructors are implementing active learning methods in their classrooms, and they are modifying the methods to fit their local instructional contexts. However, we lack a detailed framework for describing the range of what these instructor adaptations of active learning methods look like in practice. Existing studies apply structured protocols to classroom observations and report descriptive statistics, but this approach overlooks the complex nature of instruction. In this study, we apply network analysis to classroom observations to define a typology of active learning that considers the temporal and interactional nature of instructional practices. We use video data from 30 instructors at 27 institutions who implemented one of the following named active learning methods in their introductory physics or astronomy course: Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE), Peer Instruction, Tutorials, and Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies (SCALE-UP). We identify five types of active learning instruction: clicker lecture, dialogic clicker lecture, dialogic lecture with short groupwork activities, short groupwork activities, and long groupwork activities. We find no significant relationship between these instruction types and the named active learning methods; instead, implementations of each of the four methods are spread across different instruction types. This result prompts a shift in the way we think and talk about active learning: the names of developed active learning methods may not actually reflect the specific activities that happen during instruction. We also find that student conceptual learning does not vary across the identified instruction types, suggesting that instructors may be flexible when modifying these methods without sacrificing effectiveness.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redshifted civilizations, galactic empires, and the Fermi paradox</a><span class="id">[2510.00377]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Given the vast distances between stars in the Milky way and the long timescales required for interstellar travel, we consider how a civilization might overcome the constraints arising from finite lifespans and the speed of light without invoking exotic or novel physics. We consider several scenarios in which a civilization can migrate to a time-dilated frame within the scope of classical general relativity and without incurring a biologically intolerable level of acceleration. Remarkably, the power requirements are lower than one might expect; biologically tolerable orbits near the photon radius of Sgr A* can be maintained by a civilization well below the Type II threshold, and a single Type II civilization can establish a galaxy-spanning civilization with a time dilation factor of $10^4$, enabling trips spanning the diameter of the Milky way within a human lifetime in the civilizational reference frame. We also find that isotropic monochromatic signals from orbits near the photon radius of a black hole exhibit a downward frequency drift. The vulnerability of ultrarelativistic vessels to destruction, combined with the relatively short timescales on which adversarial civilizations can arise, provides a strong motivating element for the “dark forest” hypothesis.</p></div></details></article></body>
