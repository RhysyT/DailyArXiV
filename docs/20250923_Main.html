Their origin traces back to hadronic collisions between protons and nuclei in the cosmic rays with hydrogen and helium in the target gas. To accurately interpret the data, a precise determination of the underlying cross sections is therefore mandatory. We present a new evaluation of the neutrino production cross section from $p+p$ collisions, building on our previous analysis of the production cross section for $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, and minor baryonic and mesonic channels. Cross sections for scatterings involving nuclei heavier than protons are also derived. The novelty of our approach is the analytical description of the Lorentz invariant cross section $\sigma_{\rm inv}$, and the fit of the model to the available accelerator data. We work with neutrino energies from $10$ GeV to $10^7$ GeV, and, correspondingly, to incident proton (nuclei) energies from $10$ GeV to $10^9$ GeV (GeV/n). We obtain the total differential cross section, $d\sigma(p+p\rightarrow \nu+X)/dE_{\nu}$ as a function of neutrino and proton energies, with an estimated uncertainty of 5% for neutrino energies below 100 GeV, increasing to 10% above TeV energies. Predictions are given for $\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \bar{\nu_e}$ and $\bar{\nu_\mu}$. A comparison with state-of-the-art cross sections, all relying on Monte Carlo generators, is also presented. To facilitate the use by the community, we provide numerical tables and a script for accessing our energy-differential cross sections.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16306" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutrinos from core-collapse supernovae</a><span class="id">[2509.16306]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The core of a massive star (M &gt; 8 Msun) eventually collapses. This implosion usually triggers a supernova (SN) explosion that ejects most of the stellar envelope and leaves behind a neutron star (NS) with a mass of up to about 2 Msun. Sometimes the explosion fails and a black hole forms instead. The NS radiates its immense binding energy (some 10% of its rest mass or $2-4\times10^{53}$ erg) almost entirely as neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors with typical energies of some 10 MeV. This makes core-collapse SNe the most powerful neutrino factories in the Universe. Such a signal was observed once - with limited statistics - from SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Today, however, many large neutrino detectors act as SN observatories and would register a high-statistics signal. A future Galactic SN, though rare (1-3 per century), would produce a wealth of astrophysical and particle-physics information, including possible signatures for new particles. Neutrinos are key to SN dynamics in the framework of the Bethe-Wilson delayed explosion paradigm. After collapse, they are trapped in the core for a few seconds, forming a dense neutrino plasma that can exhibit collective flavor evolution caused by the weak interaction, a subject of intense theoretical research.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation Hydrodynamic Simulations of Low-Energy Explosions of Red and Yellow Supergiants</a><span class="id">[2509.16308]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A variety of physical processes leads to the low-energy ejection of material from the hydrogen-rich envelopes of red and yellow supergiants. These include common envelope events, stellar mergers, eruptive mass loss, and failed supernovae. These events may appear as luminous red novae, intermediate luminosity red transients, supernova imposters, or other transients with similar lightcurves and colors that are followed by the disappearance of the progenitor star (e.g. failed supernovae). The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will find these events in large numbers; detailed modeling of their lightcurves is essential for photometrically differentiating between these important physical processes in the lives of massive stars. We use one-dimensional, radiation hydrodynamic simulations to model the lightcurves of low-energy explosions of red and yellow supergiants. Red supergiant explosions have durations of 100-400 days, longer than Type IIp supernovae, while stripped, yellow supergiant explosions have durations of 10s of days. Our models probe the boundary between the radiation-pressure dominated and gas-pressure dominated regimes. We provide fitting formulae for the plateau luminosity and duration of the events. Finally, we show that the failed supernovae candidates in NGC 6946 and M31 are consistent with failed supernovae models for explosion energies of $\sim10^{47}-10^{49}$ erg.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical Modeling of Relativistic Effects in Synchrotron-Emitting Shocks</a><span class="id">[2509.16313]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Synchrotron emission is seen in a vast array of astrophysical transients, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), radio supernovae, neutron star (NS) mergers, tidal disruption events (TDEs), and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs). Despite the ubiquity of synchrotron-emitting sources, modeling of the emergent flux from these events often relies on simplified analytic approximations. These approximations are inaccurate for high-velocity shocks, where special-relativistic effects are important. Properly incorporating these effects considerably complicates calculations, and generally requires a numerical treatment. In this work we present a novel numerical model which solves the full radiative-transfer problem in synchrotron-emitting shocks, accounting for all relativistic effects. This `full-volume' model is capable of calculating synchrotron emission from a shock of arbitrary velocity, and is designed to be flexible and applicable to a wide range of astrophysical sources. Using this new code, we evaluate the accuracy of more commonly-used approximate models. We find that the full-volume treatment is generally necessary once the shock proper-velocity exceeds $(\Gamma\beta)_{\rm sh}\gtrsim 0.1$, and that approximate models can be inaccurate by $\gtrsim$ an order-of-magnitude in trans-relativistic shocks. This implies that there may be a bias in the inferred physical properties of some FBOTs, jetted TDEs, and other relativistic explosions, where approximate analytic models are typically employed. The code associated with our model is made publicly available, and can be used to study the growing population of relativistic synchrotron-emitting transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulated 3D $^{56}$Ni Distributions of Type IIp Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2509.16314]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first three-dimensional study of the asymptotic ejecta distributions for a suite of theoretical Type IIp supernovae originating from red supergiant progenitors. We simulate using the radiation-hydrodynamic code F{\sc{ornax}} from core bounce through the first seconds of the neutrino-driven explosion and then follow using a hydrodynamic variant of the code FLASH until shock breakout of the star and through to homologous expansion of the ejecta into the circumstellar environment. Our studied progenitor models range from 9 to 25 M$_{\odot}$, with explosion energies spanning $\sim$0.1$-$1 Bethe. The shock breakout times span the range $\sim$1$-$4 days, with a breakout time spread by direction ranging from hours to over a day. We find that the dipole orientation of the $^{56}$Ni ejecta is well-preserved from the first seconds out to shock breakout. The $^{56}$Ni ejecta penetrates through the initially outer oxygen shell, and its global structure is imprinted with small-scale clumping as the ejecta evolve through the stellar envelope. For the majority of our models, the neutron star kick is anti-aligned with the $^{56}$Ni ejecta. Models with strongly dipolar ejecta morphology and a massive hydrogen/helium envelope with an inner boundary located deep see as much as $\sim$70\% of the $^{56}$Ni ejecta mixed into that outer envelope, reaching asymptotic velocities ranging from $\sim$350 to 3200 km s$^{-1}$. Supernovae arising from red supergiant progenitors and exhibiting prominent nickel features generally display significant $^{56}$Ni mixing into the stellar envelope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLASH-VLT: Constraining deviation from GR with the mass profiles of nine massive galaxy clusters</a><span class="id">[2509.16317]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the anisotropic stress parameter, $\eta=\Psi/\Phi$, defined as the ratio of the gravitational potentials in the linearly perturbed Friedmann-Lemaître Robertson-Walker metric, as a probe of deviations from general relativity across astrophysical to cosmological scales. Using mass profiles reconstructed from high-precision lensing and kinematics of nine galaxy clusters from the CLASH-VLT sample, we derive $\eta(r)$ as a function of the radial distance from the cluster centres, over the range $[0.1 \,\text{Mpc},1.2\,r_{200}^L]$, where $r_{200}^L$ is virial radius best-fit from lensing data. When using a Navarro-Frenk-White or an Hernquist profile to model the total matter distribution, we find consistency with general relativity ($\eta = 1$) within $2\sigma$ for the full radial range for all the sampled clusters. However, adopting a Burkert profile introduces mild tension with general relativity, reaching the $3\sigma$ level in two systems. Assuming a negligible time-dependence in the redshift range spawned by the clusters, we obtain the joint constraint $\eta (r= 1.0 \, \text{Mpc}) = 0.93^{+0.48}_{-0.40}$ (stat) $\pm 0.47$ (syst) at $95\% $ confidence level – an improvement of approximately $40\%$ over previous estimates. We discuss the impact of systematics on the constraints, and we highlight the implications of this result for current and upcoming cluster surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identifying close-in Jupiters that arrived via disk migration: Evidence of primordial alignment, preference of nearby companions and hint of runaway migration</a><span class="id">[2509.16322]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Two leading hypotheses for hot Jupiter migration are disk migration and high-eccentricity migration (HEM). Stellar obliquity is commonly used to distinguish them, as high obliquity often accompanies HEM. However, low obliquity does not guarantee disk migration, due to possible spin-orbit realignment or coplanar HEM. Seeking a proxy for disk migration, we investigate the idea that when the circularization timescale of a planet on circular orbit is longer than its age ($\tau_\mathrm{cir} &gt; \tau_\mathrm{age}$), HEM would not have had sufficient time to complete, favoring disk migration. We empirically calibrate the reduced planetary tidal quality factor to be $Q_\mathrm{p}=4.9^{+3.5}_{-2.5}\times10^5$ using the eccentricity distribution of 500+ Jovian mass ($0.2M_\mathrm{J}&lt;M_\mathrm{p}&lt;13M_\mathrm{J}$) planets with measured masses and radii, a value consistent with solar system Jupiter. We then calculate $\tau_\mathrm{cir}$ and identify dozens of disk migration candidates ($\tau_\mathrm{cir} &gt; \tau_\mathrm{age}, \ e &lt; 0.1$). These planets show three notable trends. We first find a clear cutoff of obliquity at $\tau_\mathrm{cir} \sim \tau_\mathrm{age}$, suggesting the primordial alignment of protoplanetary disks. Secondly, we find that among hot Jupiters ($a&lt;0.1$ au), nearby companions are preferentially found around disk migration candidates, suggesting that either HEM dominates hot Jupiter formation, or disk migration also disrupts nearby companions at short separations. Finally, we find a possible dearth of disk migration candidates around mass ratio $\log q \sim -3.2$, consistent with a similar dip suggested at longer orbits from microlensing. The lack of planets across different orbital distance, if true, could be interpreted as a hint of runaway migration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarized Signatures of Variable Worlds: Modeling Heterogeneous Habitable Earth- and Early Mars-like (Exo)planets</a><span class="id">[2509.16338]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Determining the habitability of terrestrial exoplanets is a complex problem that represents the next major step for the astrophysical community. The majority of current models treat these planets as homogeneous or contain heterogeneity that is constant in time. In reality, habitable exoplanets are expected to contain atmospheric and surface heterogeneities similar to Earth, with diurnal rotation, seasonal changes, and weather patterns resulting in complex, time-dependent signatures. Due to its ability to measure light as a vector, polarimetry provides an important tool that will enhance the characterizations of heterogeneous worlds. Here we model the visible to near-infrared linear spectropolarimetric signatures, as functions of wavelength and planetary phase angle, of various heterogeneous Earth scenarios as well as the first signals of an early wet and potentially habitable Mars. The contributions from the different atmospheric and surface properties result in asymmetric phase curves and variable spectra, with the polarization appearing to be more sensitive than flux to heterogeneities such as patchy clouds and continents moving into and out-of-view. Our models provide important predictions of expected polarized and unpolarized signatures of heterogeneous exoplanets that will help guide the designs and observing plans of future polarimeters, including those proposed for the upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhancing CTAO Monitoring and Alarm Subsystems in Distributed Environments Using ServiMon</a><span class="id">[2509.16366]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>ServiMon is a scalable data collection and auditing pipeline designed for service-oriented, cost-efficient quality control in distributed environments, including the CTAO monitoring, logging, and alarm subsystems. Developed within a Docker-based architecture, it leverages cloud-native technologies and distributed computing principles to enhance system observability and reliability. At its core, ServiMon integrates key technologies such as Prometheus, Grafana, Kafka, and Cassandra. Prometheus serves as the primary engine for real-time performance metric collection, enabling efficient monitoring across multiple nodes. Grafana provides interactive, service-oriented data visualization, facilitating system performance analysis. Additionally, Kafka and Cassandra expose system metrics via the JMX Exporter, offering critical insights into infrastructure availability and performance. This contribution exposes how ServiMon could provide an enhancement on scalability, security, and efficiency in a distributed computing environment, such as the CTAO monitoring, logging, and alarm subsystems. This integrated approach not only ensures robust real-time monitoring, but also optimizes operational costs. Furthermore, ServiMon's ability to generate large volumes of diverse data over time provides a strong foundation for predictive maintenance. By incorporating stochastic and approximate computing techniques, it enables proactive failure detection and system optimization, minimizing downtime and maximizing telescope availability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16374" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A HyperFlash and ÈCLAT view of the local environment and energetics of the repeating FRB 20240619D</a><span class="id">[2509.16374]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Time-variable propagation effects provide a window into the local plasma environments of repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources. Here we report high-cadence observations of FRB 20240619D, as part of the HyperFlash and ÉCLAT programs. We observed for $500$h and detected $217$ bursts, including $10$ bursts with high fluence ($&gt;25$ Jy ms) and implied energy. We track burst-to-burst variations in dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM), from which we constrain the parallel magnetic field strength in the source's local environment: $0.32\pm0.19$ mG. Apparent DM variations between sub-bursts in a single bright event are interpreted as coming from plasma lensing or variable emission height. We also identify two distinct scintillation screens along the line of sight, one associated with the Milky Way and the other likely located in the FRB's host galaxy or local environment. Together, these (time-variable) propagation effects reveal that FRB 20240619D is embedded in a dense, turbulent and highly magnetised plasma. The source's environment is more dynamic than that measured for many other (repeating) FRB sources, but less extreme compared to several repeaters that are associated with a compact, persistent radio source. FRB 20240619D's cumulative burst fluence distribution shows a power-law break, with a flat tail at high energies. Along with previous studies, this emphasises a common feature in the burst energy distribution of hyperactive repeaters. Using the break in the burst fluence distribution, we estimate a source redshift of $z=0.042$-$0.240$. We discuss FRB 20240619D's nature in the context of similar studies of other repeating FRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Image calibration between the Extreme Ultraviolet Imagers on Solar Orbiter and the Solar Dynamics Observatory</a><span class="id">[2509.16383]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To study and monitor the Sun and its atmosphere, various space missions have been launched in the past decades. With the rapid improvement in technology and different mission requirements, the data products are subject to constant change. However, for long-term studies such as solar variability or multi-instrument investigations, uniform data series are required. In this study, we build on and expand the Instrument-to-Instrument translation (ITI) framework, which provides unpaired image translations. We apply the tool to data from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), specifically the Full Sun Imager (FSI) on Solar Orbiter (SolO) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This approach allows us to create a homogeneous data set that combines the two extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagers. We demonstrate that ITI is able to provide image calibration between SolO and SDO EUV imagers, independent of the varying orbital position of SolO. The comparison of the intercalibrated light curves derived from EUI and AIA shows that ITI can provide uniform data series that outperform a standard baseline calibration. We evaluate the perceptual similarity in terms of the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that ITI achieves a significant improvement of perceptual similarity between EUI and AIA. The study provides intercalibrated observations from SolO/EUI/FSI with SDO/AIA, enabling a homogeneous data set suitable for solar cycle studies and multi viewpoint investigations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantifying the Effects of Parameters in Widespread SEP Events with EPREM</a><span class="id">[2509.16401]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Model (EPREM) solves the focused transport equation (FTE) on a Lagrangian grid in a frame co-moving with the solar wind plasma and simulates the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the heliosphere. When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located &gt;=90 degrees from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Noise of Vacuum</a><span class="id">[2509.16409]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the evolution of primordial cosmological perturbations in a vacuum decay model where de Sitter space transitions to radiation domination through quantum-thermal decay processes. Unlike standard inflation, this framework generates curvature perturbations through stochastic noise from vacuum decay rather than quantum fluctuations of an inflaton field. We derive the stochastic differential equation governing the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}(t)$ and show that any horizon crossing is brief and does not constitute the primary mechanism for perturbation generation. Scale dependence emerges from spatial correlations in the noise rather than horizon crossing dynamics. The model naturally addresses the horizon and flatness problems through initial thermal equilibrium in de Sitter space and predicts zero tensor-to-scalar ratio. We demonstrate that spatially correlated noise can generate observationally viable spectral tilts while maintaining Gaussian statistics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possible First Detection of Gyroresonance Emission from a Coronal Mass Ejection in the Middle Corona</a><span class="id">[2509.16453]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Routine measurements of the magnetic field of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have been a key challenge in solar physics. Making such measurements is important both from a space weather perspective and for understanding the detailed evolution of the CME. In spite of significant efforts and multiple proposed methods, achieving this goal has not been possible to date. Here we report the first possible detection of gyroresonance emission from a CME. Assuming that the emission is happening at the third harmonic, we estimate that the magnetic field strength ranges from 7.9–5.6 G between 4.9-7.5 $R_\odot$. We also demonstrate that this high magnetic field is not the average magnetic field inside the CME, but most probably is related to small magnetic islands, which are also being observed more frequently with the availability of high-resolution and high-quality white-light images.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16477" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Mass Loss and the Kinetic Energy of Solar Coronal Mass with Far-Ultraviolet Flares</a><span class="id">[2509.16477]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar eruptive events, such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), can affect planetary habitability by disturbing the stability of their atmospheres. For instance, strong stellar flares and CMEs can trigger atmospheric escape and, in extreme cases, may strip away the atmosphere completely. While stellar flares have been observed and explored at a wide range of wavelengths, the physical properties of stellar CMEs remain unconstrained due to the difficulty in observing them. In this context, the Sun provides our only window on the potential characteristics of CMEs on Sun-like stars. A correlation between solar X-ray flare peak flux and the mass of flare-associated solar CMEs has been reported using solar data collected during Solar Cycle 23 (1996-2006) (Aarnio et al. 2011). Here, we build upon that work. We extend the correlation into the far-UV (FUV), where stellar flares are and will be routinely detected with existing and future FUV observatories by incorporating data spanning two entire Solar Cycles (23 and 24; 1996-2019). Using three different space missions (CMEs from LASCO/SOHO, X-ray flare events from XRS/GOES, and FUV flares from AIA/SDO), we report a correlation between FUV flare peak flux and energy centered at 1600Å and mass, kinetic energy, and linear speed of flare-associated CMEs. These empirical relations enable estimates of CME masses and kinetic energies from FUV flares on Sun-like stars. While direct stellar-CME detections remain elusive, the correlations derived here are likely applicable to Sun-like stars and provide a working framework for evaluating exoplanet atmospheric erosion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark interactions in neutron star interiors: the interplay of baryons, dark matter, and dark energy</a><span class="id">[2509.16484]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The impact of energy exchange among the relevant fluid components: baryonic matter, fermionic dark matter (DM), and dark energy (DE) on the internal structure of neutron stars is investigated. Using a representative DM mass $m_{\chi} = 10$ GeV and a barotropic DE relation, we add source terms Qi to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and examine three cases: (i) noninteracting fluids (Model I), (ii) fully interacting baryon plus DM and DM with DE fluids with optional DM self repulsion (Model II), and (iii) a unified dark sector coupled to baryons (Model III). Two effects dominate: softening by massive, pressure-poor DM, and additional softening/ and binding from DE with negative pressures. Model I isolates these baselines. In Model II, exchange terms self regulate, making the mass radius curves nearly independent of the coupling parameter $\alpha$ for nearly five orders of magnitude. Model III breaks this $\alpha$ degeneracy: a sizable vacuum fraction suppresses the baryonic pressure gradient, reducing both the maximum mass and radii, whereas a pure-DM core is less sensitive. We outline when dark interactions can leave observable, macroscopic imprints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light curves of time-dependent accretion disk in tidal disruption events</a><span class="id">[2509.16544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are believed to be an ideal laboratory for studying the evolution of accretion flow around a supermassive black hole (BH). In general, the mass feeding rate to the BH is suggested to be super-Eddington initially, and evolves to be sub-Eddington on timescale of years. In this paper, we carry out calculations of the time-dependent evolution of accretion disk in the standard environment of TDE, i.e., injecting matter at the circularization radius of the stellar debris in the form of $\dot M_{\rm inject} \propto t^{-5/3}$. One of the main findings is that when $\dot M_{\rm inject}$ evolves to a value around the Eddington accretion rate, the radiation pressure instability occurs. We test the influence of the model parameters on the light curves, such as the BH mass $M_{\rm BH}$, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and mass-injecting radius $R_{\rm{out}}$, all of which are found to affect the light curves to some extent. In most cases, we find that the light curves oscillate significantly due to the radiation pressure instability. As an exception, when $\alpha$ is small or $R_{\rm{out}}$ is large, we find that the oscillations are completely suppressed. In this case, the light curve drops steeply and then becomes flat in the late-time evolution, which is applied to explaining the observed ultraviolet (UV) light curves of ASASSN-15oi and ASASSN-14ae together with the assumption of a photosphere.

According to this hypothesis, the electric charges of the electron and proton slightly differ in magnitude, leading to the emergence of a magnetic field in rotating astrophysical objects. The theoretical justification of the Sutherland-Einstein hypothesis is presented in a simplified version of the 6D Kaluza-Klein theory, taking into account the consequences of the Kerr-Newman metric. The analysis shows that a fundamental dipole-type magnetic field should arise around any massive rotating body. However, in real astrophysical objects, such a field is largely screened and distorted by induced charges and currents. As an application, we consider the problem of determining the magnetic fields of hot Jupiters, since the strong tidal effects in these giant exoplanets should result in approximately similar screening mechanisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Overdispersed radio source counts and excess radio dipole detection</a><span class="id">[2509.16732]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The source count dipole from wide-area radio continuum surveys allows us to test the cosmological standard model.

This study is based on high-resolution optical spectra obtained with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We first calculated the average chemical element abundance, the rotational velocity, and the radial velocity of the stars using the ZEEMAN2 spectrum synthesis code with the PHOENIX model atmospheres. We then studied the abundances of titanium and iron inferred from individual lines in the spectra of each star and their variations with their predicted formation depths $\tau_{\rm 5000}$. Similarly to the BHB stars cooler than 11500 K observed in globular clusters, no clear observational evidence of vertical stratification is detected in the atmosphere of these stars. In the second part of this project, we searched for the presence of a magnetic field in the stars applying the Least-Squares Deconvolution technique on the Stokes $I$ and $V$ spectra. The measured mean longitudinal magnetic field uncertainties, ranging from 8 to 30 G, effectively rule out the presence of an organized magnetic field in these targets with a strength larger than a few 100 G.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16847" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Refining the Greisen Profile for Low-Energy Cosmic Gamma-Rays: Quantifying Deviations Across Altitudes and Zenith Angles</a><span class="id">[2509.16847]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study refines the Greisen formalism by comparing the classical Greisen profile and a modified Greisen profile, which incorporates an empirical correction to the shower age parameter with zenith-angle dependence, aiming to better describe low-energy cascades against CORSIKA simulations of cosmic gamma-ray showers (20-800 GeV).

In this study, we report on two consecutive heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), separated by  10.5 hours, at a heliocentric distance of  12 solar radii. For each crossing, we identified a series of flux ropes embedded within reconnection exhausts on the sunward side of X-line. Their passage durations are &lt;20sec, corresponding to spatial scales of a few thousands kilometers, still larger by three orders of magnitude than ion inertial length. This identification was possible particularly during intervals when PSP was closest to the HCS center. These flux ropes are distinguishable from the background exhausts by enhancements in magnetic field strength, significantly in the guide field component, travel speed slightly faster (typically by &lt;10km/s) than surrounding outflows, and often accompanied by, though not always, increased density and reduced temperature. We attribute their origin to secondary reconnection within the exhausts and subsequent merging of smaller flux ropes into larger structures, consistent with predictions by various simulations. We suggest that such flux ropes are most readily identifiable at the HCS center where the background magnetic field is weakest so that the relative enhancement in flux rope field becomes most prominent. This observational advantage is particularly notable closer to the Sun where the high ambient magnetic field strength can otherwise obscure such structures unless the spacecraft trajectory remains within the HCS central region for a sufficient duration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Impact of ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(α, γ)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ Reaction on the Evolution of He Stars</a><span class="id">[2509.16948]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction is one of the most important reactions in the evolution of massive stars, yet its rate is still highly uncertain. In this work, we investigated how variations in the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction rate affect the evolution of a 14 $\rm M_{\odot}$ He star using the MESA code. Our simulations indicate that the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction rate determines the conditions for C burning, affecting its explodability. As the reaction rate increases, central C-burning becomes neutrino-dominated, transitioning from the convective to the radiative regime. This leads to higher compactness and a larger iron core, indicating a more compact pre-SN core structure that is difficult to explode. Conversely, lower reaction rates shorten the C-burning lifetime and trigger earlier central Ne ignition, which counteracts core contraction. This results in reduced compactness and iron core mass. We also found that variations in reaction rates shift the location of the last C-burning shell. When this shell exceeds the mass coordinate used for compactness evaluation, the overall compactness increases significantly. Although the Si- and O-burning convective shells decrease compactness, the overall increase remains unaffected. This work suggests that the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction play an important role in the pre-SN core structure and potentially impact the explodability of massive He stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clues on the X-ray emission mechanism of blazars PKS 2155$-$304 and 3C 454.3 through polarization studies</a><span class="id">[2509.16976]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray polarization measurable with the imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (\textit{IXPE}) could constrain the long-debated leptonic versus hadronic origin of the high-energy component in the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of blazars. We report \textit{IXPE} results and SED modeling of PKS 2155$-$304 and 3C 454.3, a high- and low-synchrotron-peaked blazar. For PKS 2155$-$304, model-independent analysis gives polarization angle $\Psi_X$ = (130$\pm$2.5) deg and polarization degree $\Pi_X$ = (20.9$\pm$1.8)\% in the 2$-$8 keV band, in agreement with spectro-polarimetric analysis. We found $\Pi_X$ varies with time and shows indications of energy dependence, suggesting stratified emission regions. For 3C 454.3, no X-ray polarization is detected in the June 2023 observation, analyzed here for the first time. The detection in PKS 2155$-$304 and non-detection in 3C 454.3 are consistent with X-ray emission from synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, respectively. Dividing the dataset into finer time bins allows a more granular view of polarization variability. We modeled the broadband SEDs using quasi-simultaneous optical, UV, and X-ray data from {\it Swift}, {\it AstroSat}, and $\gamma$-rays from {\it Fermi}. In PKS 2155$-$304, X-rays lie in the high-energy tail of the synchrotron component, while in 3C 454.3 they lie in the rising part of the inverse Compton component. Our SED modeling with X-ray polarization favors a leptonic scenario for PKS 2155$-$304. These results support a structured jet model where X-ray emission originates from a compact acceleration zone near the shock front, while lower-energy optical emission comes from a broader turbulent region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation Mediated Shock and Planar Shock Breakout in the Presence of Atomic Transition Lines</a><span class="id">[2509.16996]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We numerically study fast Newtonian radiation mediated shocks (RMS - v/c 0.2) in two simplified problems in the context of supernova shock breakout; (1) An RMS traveling in a uniform medium, and (2) an RMS escaping a powerlaw density profile in planar geometry (\rho x^n). Both problems were previously solved in the literature assuming a fully ionized plasma medium emitting Bremstrahllung. It was shown that at high shock velocities photons can deviate from local thermal equilibrium (LTE) and reach distributions peaked at many keV. In this study we incorporate, for the first time, opacity from bound species of heavy elements (solar-like composition) into these two problems, at times drastically augmenting the photon production due to bound-free and bound-bound radiative processes. We use a previously developed hydrodynamically coupled multi-group radiative diffusion code, including inelastic Compton scattering and frequency-dependent opacity from the publicly available TOPS table. Adding a more realistic opacity leads the radiation to maintain LTE at higher velocities in comparison to the fully ionized problem. In the planar SBO problem this opacity can reduce the emission temperature by half and even an order of magnitude. This result is important for the observation of supernova shock breakout emission. The SED of SN envelope breakout will very likely remain in LTE for explosions in red super giant stars without stellar wind (and part of blue super giant star explosions), making X-Ray observations less likely in these cases by orders of magnitude relative to previous predictions. We provide a semi-analytic description for the SED in the case where LTE is maintained. A correct shock-breakout calculation requires opacity tables that include bound yet highly ionized species, ruling out the use of certain line tables (such as the commonly used Kurucz table).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Atomic Line Opacities for Modeling Astrophysical Radiative Transfer</a><span class="id">[2509.17003]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In astrophysics, line opacity is a primary source of uncertainty in theoretical calculations of radiative transfer. Much of this uncertainty is dominated by the inability to resolve the width and separation in frequency of sharp atomic transition lines, leading to the common use of approximate frequency-averaged treatments for the lines. In a previous paper, we calculated shock-cooling emission following explosions in core-collapse supernovae using a mult-group radiative transfer code, and compared the results to those of the similar and often used STELLA code from the literature. We found important differences in the spectral energy distribution (SED) resulting from different choices of line opacity treatment. In our code, we used in the emissivity a frequency-binned average of a high-resolution opacity, while in STELLA the often-used Eastman Pinto 1993 (EP93) prescription was employed. In this short letter we revisit this comparison, essentially reproducing STELLA bound-free (photoionization) and bound-bound (line transition) opacities. We show the importance of introducing micro-plasma electron excitation level cutoffs in the equation of state (EOS). We also argue that EP93 is useful for estimating photon mean free-path in the presence of a forest of lines, but that it can underestimate photon production and reprocessing rates (emissivity) by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge, no fully-consistent coarse-frequency solution currently exists for line modeling in these systems. Finally, we describe new features in our updated publicly available high-resolution frequency-dependent opacity table.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RX Gru: a short-period pre-main-sequence eclipsing binary with a distant circumbinary companion</a><span class="id">[2509.17011]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of a new short-period pre-main-sequence eclipsing binary, RX Gru, orbited by a distant circumbinary companion. We characterized the system by analysing the photometric observations from the Solaris network, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, and the Super Wide Angle Search for Planets survey, combined with the radial velocities from four high-resolution spectrographs: HARPS, FEROS, CHIRON, and HRS. We derived the parameters of the eclipsing components, which are $M_{\rm Aa} = 1.004^{+0.027}_{-0.026}\,$M$_\odot$, $R_{\rm Aa} = 1.007\pm0.021\,$R$_\odot$, and $T_{\rm eff,Aa} = 5379\pm289\,$K for the primary, and $M_{\rm Ab} = 0.985^{+0.024}_{-0.025}\,$M$_\odot$, $R_{\rm Ab} = 1.024\pm0.023\,$R$_\odot$, and $T_{\rm eff,Ab} = 5322\pm278\,$K for the secondary. We determined the age of the system from the observed parameters using two evolution codes, MESA and Cesam2k20. We obtained an age of $\sim$28$\,$Myr, placing the two stars at the very end of the pre-main-sequence phase. We also derived the minimum mass and orbital period of the tertiary companion, which are found to be $M_{\rm B} = 89.0\pm3.5\,$M$_{\rm Jup}$ and $P_{\rm AB} = 23.79 ^{+0.10 }_{-0.25}\,$yr, respectively. We conclude that RX Gru consists of a tight inner binary composed of two twin components and an outer low-mass companion (a massive brown dwarf or a very low-mass star) in a relatively wide orbit, and we suggest that the system was formed via the dynamical unfolding mechanism coupled with the shared accretion of the circumbinary material by the binary components.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The fractions of reflection effect systems detected in different subclasses of hot subdwarfs</a><span class="id">[2509.17056]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hot subdwarfs with close low-mass M-type or brown dwarf companions usually show the reflection effect and often also eclipses.

We noticed that none of the helium-rich hot subdwarfs were found with the reflection effect. Most of them might form through the merger channel. About 13\% of the He-poor hot subdwarfs on the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 25,000 – 33,000 K are discovered with the reflection effect. Nevertheless, the cooler hot subdwarfs located on the top of the EHB, those grouped on the bottom of the EHB, and those located above the EHB with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 45,000 – 75,000 K exhibit lower fractions of reflection effect systems of about 2\%. These three subclasses of hot subdwarfs might contain higher fractions of single stars. Hot subdwarfs below the EHB also show a low fraction of reflection effect systems. They might have a higher fraction of stars with close WD companions. A similar fraction of reflection effect systems to those on the EHB with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 25,000 – 33,000 K is found in hot subdwarfs located above the EHB with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 35,000 – 45,000 K.

We perform a Bayesian analysis of the $S_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ and $S_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ factors using calibrated $R$-matrix mappings and experimental ANC constraints for the $1^{-}$, $2^{+}$, and $0^{+}$ ground state. For $S_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, flat prior on the $1^{-}$ ANC lead to broad posterior with $68\%$ credible interval spanning $ [71.4,\,93.4]$ keV b, while Gaussian priors concentrate weight near the reported ANC values and yield narrower posteriors. For $S_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, the analysis includes the interference of the radiative transition through the subthreshold resonance with the direct capture to the ground-state, which depends on the ground-state ANC $C_{0}$, giving broad posterior with $68\%$ credible interval spanning $[30.7,\,50.5]$ keV b. The Gaussian priors centered near anchor values. The resulting posteriors quantify both correlations and uncertainties: despite incorporating the published ANC constraints, the $68\%$ intervals remain broad, showing that present ANC determinations do not yet reduce the astrophysical uncertainty. Overall, the Bayesian framework provides statistically robust posteriors for $S_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ and $S_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, improving the reliability of extrapolations for stellar modeling and nucleosynthesis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Plasma Instabilities and of the Intergalactic Magnetic Field on Blazar-Induced Electromagnetic Cascades</a><span class="id">[2509.17104]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Intergalactic weak magnetic fields can have non-negligible effects on the electromagnetic cascades induced by blazar gamma-ray emission.

We use these unique measurements in concert with Solar Orbiter and L1 in situ data spanning the first half of the Solar Cycle 25 in time and from 0.045 - 1 au in heliocentric distance to develop a radial scaling technique to estimate the morphology of the Alfvén surface from measurements of the solar wind speed and local Alfvén speed. We show that accounting for solar wind acceleration and mass flux is necessary to achieve reasonable agreement between the scaled location of the Alfvén surface and the locations of direct crossings measured by Parker. We produce continuous 2D equatorial cuts of the Alfvén surface over half a Solar Cycle (ascending phase and maximum). Parker's earliest crossings clipped outward extrusions, many of which are likely transient related, while more recently Parker has unambiguously sampled deep sub-Alfvénic flows. We analyze the average altitude, departure from spherical symmetry, and surface roughness, finding that all are positively correlated to solar activity. For the current modest Solar Cycle, the height varies up to 30\% which corresponds to a near-doubling in angular momentum loss per unit mass loss.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing hadronic interactions with high-energy and low-energy muons in extensive air showers</a><span class="id">[2509.17150]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-energy cosmic rays are observed indirectly by detecting the extensive air showers initiated in Earth's atmosphere.

To improve the precision in orbital properties, precursor radial velocity (RV) follow-up observations for selected candidates are essential. This study examines the impact of three variables on the orbital period uncertainties of long-period giant planets: the number of future observations, the temporal gap between past and future data, and the temporal coverage of upcoming observations. Our simulations indicate that the orbital phases at which future RV observations are acquired play a significant role in reducing period uncertainties. Additionally, observing too frequently within a given time frame adds limited value to the program once a certain number of observations has been achieved. The temporal gap proves to be the most important factor when there is no strict end time to the observing campaign. However, if a strict end time is set, starting observations earlier yields improved reductions in orbital period uncertainty. These insights offer practical guidance for planning efficient RV follow-up campaigns to maximize the science yield of future space-based direct imaging missions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eROSITA-selection of new period-bounce Cataclysmic Variables: First follow-up confirmation using TESS and SDSS</a><span class="id">[2509.17216]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Between 40$\%$ and 80$\%$ of cataclysmic variables (CVs) are expected to have evolved past the period-minimum and contain a degenerate donor.

We have produced an initial selection of 137 high-likelihood period-bounce candidates from WD catalog based on our multiwavelength period-bouncer scorecard and selection cuts including X-ray data from the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma spacecraft (SRG). We have laid out three main requirements (classification as a CV, determination of an orbital period and detection of a very late-type donor) that should result in the confirmation of several of these candidates. Our path for confirming these candidates has already produced its first successful result with the confirmation of GALEX J125751.4-283015 as a new period-bouncer. Several other candidates have already fulfilled at least one of our three requirements making their future confirmation likely. Our search for period-bouncers using the X-ray eROSITA emission of objects in optical WD catalogs has led to the confirmation of six new period-bouncers identified from the Gaia DR3 WD catalog (five previously known CVs and one WD candidate), a 18$\%$ increase that brings the present population to 39 systems. Both the selection method for period-bounce candidates and the confirmation path that we outlined will aid in future searches for new period-bounce candidates, contributing to the goal of resolving the discrepancy between the predicted high number of period-bouncers and the low number of these systems successfully observed to date.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Thick Volatile Atmosphere on the Ultra-Hot Super-Earth TOI-561 b</a><span class="id">[2509.17231]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-short period (USP) exoplanets – with $R_p \leq 2~$R$_{\oplus}$ and periods $\leq$1 day – are expected to be stripped of volatile atmospheres by intense host star irradiation, which is corroborated by their nominal bulk densities and previous eclipse observations consistent with bare rock surfaces.

Qualitatively, subluminal modes with fluctuating electric field larger than the guide field, $E_w (\omega) \geq B_0$, cannot propagate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the mass composition of TeV cosmic rays with HAWC</a><span class="id">[2509.17273]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this contribution, we have investigated the energy spectra of the elemental mass groups of cosmic rays for the Light (H+He), medium (C+O) and heavy (Ne-Fe) components using the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Gamma-Ray observatory (HAWC).

EAS measurements above the knee, for instance, have helped to understand some aspects about the acceleration and propagation mechanisms of the PeV component of cosmic rays and have shown possible hints about the transition from the galactic to the extragalactic regime. Meanwhile, EAS data in the TeV energy range have revealed unexpected features in the all-particle and elemental spectra, which may indicate the presence of previously unknown cosmic-ray phenomena. In this contribution, I will present a brief account on these EAS results, with particular emphasis on the recent measurements of the all-particle energy spectrum and the elemental composition of cosmic rays from 10 TeV up to 1 EeV. In addition, I will compare the latest results of EAS experiments and direct detectors at energies just below the knee, where there exists an overlap between both detection techniques.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17309" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme Ultraviolet Wave and Quasi-periodic Pulsations during an eruptive M-class Flare</a><span class="id">[2509.17309]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we report multiwavelength and multipoint observations of the prominence eruption originating from active region 11163, which generated an M3.5 class flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2011 February 24. The prominence lifts off and propagates nonradially in the southeast direction. Using the revised cone model, we carry out three-dimensional reconstructions of the icecream-like prominence. The latitudinal inclination angle decreases from $\sim$60$\degr$ to $\sim$37$\degr$, indicating that the prominence tends to propagate more radially. The longitudinal inclination angle almost keeps constant (-6$\degr$). The highly inclined prominence eruption and the related CME drive an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave, which propagates southward at speeds of $\sim$381.60 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$398.59 km s$^{-1}$ observed in 193 Å and 304 Å, respectively. The M3.5 class flare presents quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in soft X-ray, hard X-ray, EUV, and radio wavelengths with periods of 80$-$120 s. Cotemporary with the flare QPPs, a thin current sheet and multiple plasmoids are observed following the eruptive prominence. Combining with the appearance of drifting pulsation structure, the QPPs are most probably generated by quasi-periodic magnetic reconnection and particle accelerations as a result of plasmoids in the current sheet.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing dust and grain growth in the optically thick circumbinary ring of V892 Tau</a><span class="id">[2509.17424]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A considerable proportion of young stars belong to multiple star systems. Constraining the planet formation processes in multiple stellar systems is then key to understand the global exoplanet population. This study focuses on investigating the dust reservoir within the triple system V892 Tau. Our objective is to establish constraints on the properties and characteristics of the dust present in the system's circumbinary ring. Based on archival ALMA and VLA data from 0.9 mm to 9.8 mm, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the ring of V892 Tau. We first studied the spatial variation of the spectral index, before employing 3D full radiative transfer calculations to constrain the ring's geometry and the radial dependence of the dust grain properties. Spectral indices are consistent with non-dust emission in the vicinity of the central binary, and with dust emission in the ring likely remaining optically thick up to 3.0 mm. Our radiative transfer analysis supports these interpretations, yielding a model that reproduces the observed intensities within the 1-sigma uncertainties across all wavelengths. The resulting dust surface density and temperature profiles both decrease with increasing radius, and are in agreement with values reported in the literature. Maximum grain sizes are constrained to 0.2 cm, with a size distribution power-law index -3.5. These results imply that the dust grain fragmentation velocity does not exceed 8 m/s. Whilst our results suggest dust trapping at the cavity edge, they also suggest that tidal perturbations triggered by the central binary limit grain growth within the ring. This highlights the need to further constrain planet formation efficiency in multiple stellar systems, a goal that may be advanced by applying the methodology of this work to a wider sample of systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hubble Tension resolved by the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations Measurements</a><span class="id">[2509.17454]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological observations. However, severe challenges to the phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM model have emerged recently, including the Hubble constant tension and the significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration. Despite many explanations for the two challenges have been proposed, the origins of them are still intriguing mysteries. Here, we investigate the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) measurements to interpret the Hubble constant tension. Employing a non-parametric method, we find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift from DESI BAO data and type Ia supernovae. From the Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) is derived from $w(z)$ model-independently. We find that the values of $H_0$ show a descending trend as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant tension. Our study finds that the two unexpected challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM model can be understood in one physical framework, e.g., dynamical dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 6 year radio lightcurve of the tidal disruption event AT2019azh</a><span class="id">[2509.17525]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Analysis of radio emission from tidal disruption events allows for detailed constraints on the properties of ejected outflows and the host environment surrounding the black hole. However, the late-time radio behaviour of tidal disruption events is not well-studied due to a lack of observations. In this work we present long-term radio monitoring observations of the tidal disruption event AT2019azh spanning 1167-2159 days post disruption. We fit a physically motivated synchrotron model to the radio spectra at each epoch, and model the decay of the light curve under the assumption that the outflow transitions into the non-relativistic Sedov-Taylor regime at late times. Through this modelling we obtain strong constraints on the density profile of the circumnuclear medium, finding an unusually flat density profile proportional to $r^{0.24^{+0.11}_{-0.15}}$. Overall we find that unlike some tidal disruption events, AT2019azh does not show late time re-brightening up to 6 years post-disruption. The Sedov-Taylor light curve decay model provides a good fit to the data, motivating the assumption that the outflow was produced by a single ejection of material close to the time of stellar disruption. From forward modelling the evolution of the radio light curve decay we predict that the radio afterglow from AT2019azh should be detectable for decades at its current rate of evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17527" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Late-Time Cosmological Constraints on Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy</a><span class="id">[2509.17527]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy is a one-parameter extension of the standard HDE framework, in which the horizon entropy is reformulated using Kaniadakis entropy.

In this work we test the Kanadiakis holography model against multiple late-time observational probes, including Type Ia supernovae from PantheonPlus and Union3, Cosmic Chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2).

Recent implementations adopt more physical parameterizations, but it remains unclear whether these models reliably recover astrophysical quantities. We test whether current CIB halo models can constrain the star formation efficiency, $\eta(M_h,z)$, and the halo mass where it peaks, $M_{\rm max}$, when fitted to mock data. We examine whether discrepancies arise from emission assumptions (the HOD ingredients) or from more fundamental components, such as bias and matter clustering. Using the M21 CIB HOD model within the halo framework, we fit mock CIB power spectra and star formation rate density (SFRD) data from the SIDES-Uchuu simulation, then repeat the analysis with a simplified simulation (SSU) matched to the HOD assumptions. Comparing best-fit parameters to known inputs, we find that although the M21 model fits the mock data well, it fails to recover intrinsic parameters, especially $M_{\rm max}$, even when applied to data generated with consistent assumptions. Emission-related quantities (SFRD, emissivity) agree within 5%, but the two-halo term shows a redshift- and scale-dependent offset exceeding 20%, likely due to the linear treatment of halo bias and matter clustering. Scatter in the SFR-halo mass relation and spectral energy distributions significantly impacts shot noise ($\sim 50\%$) but only modestly ($&lt;10\%$) the clustered signal. We conclude that robust recovery of physical parameters from CIB clustering requires improved cosmological ingredients in halo models, including scale-dependent halo bias and nonlinear matter power spectra, alongside refined emission modeling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17586" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological constraints on Galileon dark energy with broken shift symmetry</a><span class="id">[2509.17586]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current cosmological data seem to show that dark energy is evolving in time and that it possibly crossed the phantom divide in the past. So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\log B\simeq 6.5$). Yet, as with other non-minimally coupled theories, it has severe ancillary gravitational effects. These can be mitigated to some extent, but as with other viable theories, the penalty is ever more elaborate scalar field models of dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17599" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling the Quantum Nature of Black Holes: Towards a Proof of Hawking Radiation through Gamma-Ray Observations</a><span class="id">[2509.17599]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hawking's groundbreaking prediction that black holes emit thermal radiation and ultimately evaporate remains unverified due to the extreme faintness of this radiation for stellar-mass or larger black holes.

These black hole morsels are expected to emit gamma rays in the GeV-TeV range on observable timescales. We analyze data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope coinciding with the well-localized binary black hole merger GW170814, searching for delayed gamma-ray signatures associated with morsel evaporation. While we find no evidence for such emission, we place exclusion limits on morsel masses, ruling out the 4 x 10^8 kg scenario at the 95 percent confidence level for a total emitted mass of one solar mass. We also outline future directions, including the incorporation of late-time evaporation spikes, systematic application across the growing gravitational wave catalog, and the enhanced discovery potential of next-generation facilities such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neural likelihood estimators for flexible gravitational wave data analysis</a><span class="id">[2509.17606]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we develop a Neural Likelihood Estimator and apply it to analyse real gravitational-wave (GW) data for the first time.

However, these methods struggle with overlapping families, interlopers, and the detection of older structures. Spectroscopic data can help overcome these limitations. The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) contains reflectance spectra at visible wavelengths for 60,518 asteroids over the range between 374-1034 nm, representing a large sample that is well suited to studies of asteroid families. Using Gaia spectroscopic data, we investigate a region in the central Main Belt centered around 2.72 AU, known for its connection to L- type asteroids. Conflicting family memberships reported by different HCM implementations underscore the need for an independent dynamical analysis of this region. We determine family memberships by applying a color taxonomy derived from Gaia data and by assessing the spectral similarity between candidate members and the template spectrum of each family. We identify an L- type asteroid family in the central Main Belt, with (460) Scania as its largest member. Analysis of the family's V-shape indicates that it is relatively old, with an estimated age of approximately 1 Gyr, which likely explains its non detection by the HCM. The family's existence is supported by statistical validation, and its distribution in proper element space is well reproduced by numerical simulations. Independent evidence from taxonomy, polarimetry, and spin-axis obliquities consistently supports the existence of this L- type family. This work highlights the value of combining dynamical and physical data to characterize asteroid families and raises questions about the origin of L- type families, potentially linked to primordial objects retaining early protoplanetary disk properties. Further spectroscopic data are needed to clarify these families.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unraveling the Unexpected Seasonal Variation of Multi-Muon Events at NO$ν$A</a><span class="id">[2509.17655]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The seasonal variation of single muons is a well-understood phenomenon, mainly driven by a positive correlation with temperature fluctuations in the atmospheric profiles.

This has motivated exploring alternatives, including new particles and macroscopic objects. Two well-motivated scenarios are sub-GeV DM and Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). Molecular clouds (MCs), typically studied as star-forming sites, can serve as astrophysical laboratories to probe these candidates via their ionization rates. Observations show ionization levels exceeding expectations from known CR fluxes, pointing to an additional ionizing component. Here, we consider electrons and positrons from annihilating and decaying MeV DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from evaporating PBHs, as possible contributors. We model transport driven by energy losses within the clouds. By comparing predicted ionization rates with observations, conservative constraints are set on the thermally averaged cross section $\langle\sigma v\rangle$, decay lifetime $\tau$ and PBH abundances $f_{PBH}$. The analysis assumes all the observed ionization comes from DM and adopts a 95% confidence level. Results show that, even in the most conservative case of local MCs such as L1551, these constraints are very close to the most competitive bounds from X-ray observations, while inner-Galaxy clouds like DRAGON or G1.4–1.8+87 provide stronger limits, sometimes improving X-ray and cosmological constraints. For sub-GeV DM, MCs exclude parameter space competitive with the one tested by NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, or Voyager, especially below $\sim$30 MeV. In the PBH case, asteroid-mass black holes are restricted to a low fraction of DM, with optimistic scenarios getting close to the strongest limits. This demonstrates the potential of MCs as a novel probe in indirect DM searches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing the high-z cosmic web with Quaia: catalogues of voids and clusters in the quasar distribution</a><span class="id">[2509.17696]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the formation and evolution of the cosmic web of galaxies is a fundamental goal of cosmology, using various tracers of the cosmic large-scale structure at an ever wider range of redshifts.

In this analysis, we selected 708,483 QSOs at $0.8&lt;z&lt;2.2$ from the Quaia data set, allowing a reconstruction of the matter density field using 24,372 deg$^2$ sky area with a well-understood selection function, and thus going beyond previous studies. Using the REVOLVER method, we created catalogues of voids and clusters based on the estimation of the local density at QSO positions with Voronoi tessellation. We tested the consistency of Quaia data and 50 mock catalogues, including various parameters of the voids and clusters in data subsets, and also measurements of the density profiles of these cosmic super-structures at $100 h^{-1}$Mpc scales. We identified 12,842 voids and 41,111 clusters in the distribution of Quaia QSOs. The agreement between data and mocks is at a level of 5-10%, considering void and cluster radii, average inner density, and density profiles.

In this regard the IceCube observation of high-energy neutrinos from the direction of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxy NGC 1068 is not surprising. More recently, another Seyfert-starburst composite galaxy, NGC 7469, has shown hints for neutrino emission at even higher energies. Theoretical investigations could clarify that their so-called AGN corona is the most-likely origin of these neutrinos due to the need of being partially $\gamma$-ray opaque. In this work, we present an updated version of our Seyfert-starburst composite model from 2022, that accounts for a proper treatment of the stochastic acceleration processes in the AGN corona and the secondary electrons and positrons from leptonic radiation processes. Moreover, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to study the parameter space of these two potential high-energy neutrino sources under consideration of the given prior knowledge. In the case of NGC 1068, we can successfully explain its non-thermal observational features, where both its AGN corona and starburst ring are needed to account for the observations at high- energies. In the case of NGC 7469, the high-energy signatures can only be explained assuming a small coronal radius and the including external $\gamma\gamma$-pair attenuation. In general, both sources exhibit a strong influence of the $\gamma$-ray opaqueness on the results, highlighting the need for an accurate treatment of the intrinsic coronal X-ray field and the spatial extent of the $\gamma$-ray production site.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ion-scale Turbulence and Energy Cascade Rate in the Solar Corona and Inner Heliosphere</a><span class="id">[2509.17861]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Plasma turbulence cascading from MHD to kinetic scales in the heliospheric plasma is believed to play a key role in coronal heating and fast solar wind acceleration, but the properties of the turbulence remain poorly constrained by observations. Here we compare the ion-scale density fluctuation levels inferred from the properties of solar radio bursts with the magnetic field fluctuation levels obtained through in-situ measurements in the inner heliosphere. We find that the observed magnetic and density fluctuation amplitudes are consistent with excitation by kinetic Alfvén waves and/or KAW structures over broad range of distances from the Sun. We then use the radio diagnostics and the KAW scenario to deduce the radial variation of magnetic fluctuation amplitudes in regions close to the Sun where in-situ measurements cannot be obtained. Further, we calculate the energy cascade rate (plasma heating rate) profile over a region that extends from the low corona ($\sim 0.1$ R$_\odot$) into the heliosphere (out to $\sim 1$ au), and compare it to the energy deposition rate required to drive the solar wind. The cascade rate agrees with the available in-situ measurements and also provides predictions closer than $\sim 10$ R$_\odot$ where in-situ approaches are not available.

Non-equilibrium $^{3}$He burning leads to the merging of core and envelope convective zones, which causes abrupt decreases in the stellar radius. It has been suggested by van Saders &amp; Pinsonneault (2012) that these effects may be relevant for cataclysmic variables (CVs). We have performed stellar evolution modeling to study the role of the CKI in CV evolution. We find that the CKI has no effect on normal CVs which evolve via magnetic braking and gravitational radiation above the period gap. CKI cycles either do not occur or are abruptly halted once mass transfer begins. If only gravitational radiation is considered, the CKI does occur. The abrupt radius changes can cause detachment phases which produce small period gaps with widths of a few minutes. We describe how the size of the period gaps is controlled by the $^{3}$He profiles of the secondaries.

In the search for exoplanets using radial velocities (RV), stellar activity has become one of the main limiting factors for detectability. Fortunately, activity-induced RV signals are wavelength-dependent or chromatic, unlike planetary signals. This study exploits the broad spectral coverage provided by the combined use of SOPHIE and SPIRou velocimeters to investigate the chromatic nature of the activity signal of the highly active M dwarf EV Lac. Aims. We aim to understand the origin of the strong wavelength dependence (chromaticity) observed in the RV signal of EV Lac by selecting spectral lines based on physical properties. In particular, we explore the impact of starspots by defining the contrast effect at the level of individual lines. The Zeeman effect is also considered in this study. Methods. SPIRou and SOPHIE spectra were reduced using the line-by-line (LBL) method. We performed custom RV calculations, using groups of spectral lines selected for their sensitivity to either the spot-to-photosphere contrast or the Zeeman effect. The sensi- tivity of each line to the spot is defined using a two-temperature model based on PHOENIX spectra, while Landé factors were used to quantify Zeeman sensitivity. Results. We find that the spectral lines are distributed in two distinct families of contrasts, producing anti-correlated RV signals. This leads to a partial cancellation of the total RV signal, especially at longer wavelengths and provides a natural explanation for the strong chromaticity observed in EV Lac. This sign-reversal effect is demonstrated here, for the first time, on empirical data. Building on this discovery, we propose a new approach to constraining spot temperatures and to mitigating stellar activity. This will open up promising avenues for improving activity corrections and enhancing the detection of exoplanets around active M dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic inventory of the background fields of relativistic particles in the Universe</a><span class="id">[2509.17954]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The extragalactic background is composed of the emission from all astrophysical sources, both resolved and unresolved, in addition to any diffuse components. In the last decade, there has been significant progress in our understanding of the cosmic history of extragalactic emissions associated with stellar evolution and accretion onto supermassive black holes, largely enabled by the extensive body of multi-wavelength data. The brightness of the extragalactic sky is now measured in photons, neutrinos, and cosmic rays, using observatories on the ground, in the sea, and in the ice, satellites in Earth orbit, and probes at the edge of the solar system. This wealth of disparate data is essential to unraveling the mysteries of the source populations that contribute to the extragalactic background. In this contribution, we present an open database containing the most comprehensive collection of measurements of the extragalactic background spectrum to date. The combination of multi-messenger measurements over 27 frequency decades allows us to estimate the energy density of most extragalactic background components with an uncertainty of less than 30%. We explore the consistency of this cosmic inventory of the observed fields of relativistic particles populating the Universe with the cosmic history of star formation and accretion around supermassive black holes. Models incorporating these cosmic histories, as well as the redshift-dependent luminosity functions of extragalactic sources, currently match the electromagnetic component of the extragalactic background spectrum over 14 frequency decades, from the near UV to sub-TeV gamma rays. The knowledge gained from synthetic population models in the electromagnetic bands may become a crucial tool for understanding the origin of the most energetic extragalactic messengers, neutrinos and ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Improving radial velocity precision with CARMENES-PLUS:An upgrade of the near-infrared spectrograph cooling system</a><span class="id">[2509.17966]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>CARMENES is a dual-channel high-resolution spectrograph at the 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope designed to detect low-mass planets around late-type dwarfs by measuring their radial velocities (RVs). High thermal stability in both the visible (VIS) and near infrared channels is essential to achieve the precision required for these measurements. In particular, stabilising the NIR channel to the millikelvin level, which operates at cryogenic temperatures (140 K), poses significant engineering this http URL CARMENES-PLUS project was initiated to improve the instruments intrinsic RV precision. In this article, we focus on the thermal stability improvements made to the NIR channels cooling system. The NIR cooling system was originally conceived to operate with a discontinuous flow of cryogenic nitrogen gas. As part of CARMENES-PLUS, this was upgraded to a continuous flow configuration. Additional changes included the installation of an automatic vacuum system, a proportional control valve, and a pressure regulation system. These upgrades were designed to reduce thermal fluctuations and enhance long-term stability. The implemented upgrades significantly improved the intrinsic RV precision of the NIR channel. We quantified this improvement using Fabry Perot calibration spectra, obtaining an intrinsic RV precision of 0.67 ms after the interventions, an improvement of nearly 2 ms . We also assessed the stability of the nightly zero points, finding a reduced scatter of 3.9 ms post upgrade, compared to 6.1 ms before. For a sample of slowly rotating stars (vsin i below 2 kms), the median scatter decreased from 8.8 ms to 6.7 ms after the upgrades. These results demonstrate that the thermal control upgrades introduced in CARMENES PLUS have enhanced the NIR channels RV performance, bringing it closer to the VIS channels stability and reinforcing CARMENES capabilities for exoplanet detection around M dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Decade of Transit-Timing Measurements Confirm Resonance in the K2-19 System</a><span class="id">[2509.18031]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>K2-19 is a star, slightly smaller than the Sun, that hosts three transiting planets. Two of these, K2-19 b and c, are between the size of Neptune and Saturn and have orbital periods near a 3:2 commensurability, and exhibit strong transit-timing variations (TTVs). A previous TTV analysis reported moderate eccentricities of $\approx0.20 \pm0.03$ for the two planets, but such high values would imply rapid orbital decay for the innermost planet d.

In a previous paper (Afify et al. 2024), we have investigated the stability threshold of the ion-ion acoustic instability (IIAI) in parameter regimes compatible with recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP, (Fox et al. 2016)) observations, in the presence of a Maxwellian electron distribution. We found that observed parameters are close to the instability threshold, but IIAI requires a higher electron temperature than observed. Aims. As electron distributions in the solar wind present clear non-Maxwellian features, we investigate here if deviations from the Maxwellian distribution could explain the observed IIAI. We address specifically the kappa ( $\kappa$ ) and core-strahl distributions for the electrons. Methods. We perform analytical studies and kinetic simulations using a Vlasov-Poisson code in a parameter regime relevant to PSP observations. The simulated growth rates are validated against kinetic theory. Results. We show that the IIAI threshold changes in the presence of $\kappa$ or core-strahl electron distributions, but not significantly. In the latter case, the expression of an effective temperature for an equivalent Maxwellian electron distribution given in Jones et al. (1975) is confirmed by simulations. Such an effective temperature could simplify stability assessment of future observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bound-state resonances of the Schwarzschild black hole: Analytic treatment</a><span class="id">[2506.15768]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inspired by an earlier idea of Mashhoon, who suggested to relate the discrete quasinormal resonant modes of a black hole to the bound-state resonances of the corresponding inverted black-hole potential, Völkel [Phys.

A cleaner image of the light-ring against a non-luminous background, not affected by the emission and all the dynamical effects taking place near the ISCO, would thus be preferable. A more distant SMBH illumination source that could accommodate this can be provided by the unique spectral lines emitted by the cooler parts of the accretion disk, the so-called Broad Line Region (BLR). Spectral line emission from the transitional region between the inner disk and the outer BLR may be ideal for obtaining a cleaner image of the light-ring, and better suited for strong gravity tests. A crucial first order effect of a BLR spectral line illumination of the SMBHs in galactic centers, and a possible smoking gun signal of strong SMBH lensing, will be an Einstein ring, whose presence could be evident even in unresolved sources where only the total line profile can be acquired.

However, the continuum emission from their highly turbulent hot plasma is expected to be strongly time-varying and with very inhomogeneous brightness. This can mask important SMBH-related effects, like the appearance of the light-ring, rendering them ineffective as probes of strong gravitational lensing physics. Besides being an inhomogeneous and strongly time-varying ”illuminator”, the hot plasma emission extends all the way to the ISCO. This then leads to the superposition of the strongly-lensed radiation from the area of the light-ring to the continuum emission from the ISCO, effectively making gravitational lensing physics hard to separate from accretion disk Astrophysics. These problems could be overcome if one utilizes the spectral line radiation field emanating from the cooler parts of the extended accretion disk, the so-called BLR, and especially its expected neutral phase, as a more distant, but still adequately strong SMBH illuminator, typically found at $r\sim (10^2-10^4)\, R_s$. This kind of illumination can provide a cleaner image of the light-ring region, and thus allow more information on the spacetime geometry around the SMBH to be obtained. Here, we examine some of the benefits of such an illumination in discerning strong-gravity physics near SMBHs and their observability. We expand on the fact that such emission can provide a smoking gun signal of lensing, in the form of an Einstein ring. To first order, the imaging of the Einstein ring and its spectroscopic signature can facilitate the measurement of the SMBH mass, while the second order effects associated with the light-ring can constrain the SMBH spin, and even identify deviations from the Kerr spacetime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16289" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charged particle dynamics in singular spacetimes: hydrogenic mapping and curvature-corrected thermodynamics</a><span class="id">[2509.16289]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the dynamics of charged test particles in a singular, horizonless spacetime arising as the massless limit of a charged wormhole in the Einstein–Maxwell–Scalar framework.

Exploiting exact first integrals, we construct the effective potential and obtain circular orbit radii, radial epicyclic frequencies, and azimuthal precession rates. In the weak-field limit (\(r \gg |Q|\)), the motion reduces to a Coulombic system with small curvature-induced retrograde precession. At large radii, the dynamics maps to a hydrogenic system, with curvature corrections inducing perturbative energy shifts. Approaching \(r_\ast\), the potential diverges, producing hard-wall confinement.

These results point to a sensitivity of the spectrum with potentially far-reaching implications for black-hole spectroscopy. At the same time, growing attention has turned to astrophysical environments around compact objects and their role in shaping gravitational-wave astrophysics. In this work, we establish a direct link between spectral instabilities and environmental effects by modeling matter as a localized bump outside the light ring of a spectrally-unstable exotic compact object with a purely reflective surface. We find that while such environments can destabilize the fundamental quasinormal modes of loosely-compact exotic objects, the fundamental modes of ultra-compact horizonless objects remain remarkably robust. In contrast, overtones are shown to develop spectral instabilities in the presence of the bump. By tracking both interior modes, trapped between the light ring and the surface of the exotic compact object, and exterior modes, confined between the bump and the light ring, we uncover an overtaking instability in which “unperturbed” exterior overtones metamorphose into “perturbed” fundamental modes as the bump moves outward. Finally, we demonstrate that environmental effects, while capable of further amplifying spectral instabilities, cannot induce next-to-leading-order perturbations strong enough to trigger a modal instability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light thermal dark matter models in the light of DAMIC-M 2025 constraints</a><span class="id">[2509.16319]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the viability of light thermal dark matter (DM) in sub-GeV mass range in view of the stringent new DAMIC-M limits on DM-electron scattering.

We find that relations among moment of inertia, tidal deformability, quadrupole moment and $f$-mode frequency exhibit universality, with deviations limited to $1-10\%$, in close agreement with other compact star models. Using tidal deformability constraints from GW170817 and GW190814, we obtain astrophysical limits on canonical properties of dark energy stars. For positive anisotropy strength, the radius of a $1.4M_\odot$ star is constrained to $R_{1.4}=8.93^{1.88}_{1.40}$ km (GW170817) and $10.92^{+0.71}_{-0.54}$ km (GW190814), consistent with observational bounds. The corresponding $f$-mode frequencies are constrained to $3.257^{+0.450}_{-0.537}$ kHz and $2.692^{+0.137}_{-0.157}$ kHz. Further, applying Pearson correlation analysis for the first time to anisotropic compact stars, we obtained the coefficients between various stellar attributes of dark energy stars and we show that the Chaplygin parameter $B$ correlates strongly with the $f$-mode frequency, with positive anisotropy strengthening while negative anisotropy weakening the correlation strength. These results establish that universal relations extend to anisotropic dark energy stars and can be directly tested with present and future gravitational-wave observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equation of state for hyperonic neutron-star matter in SU(3) flavor symmetry</a><span class="id">[2509.16559]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using a relativistic mean-field model calibrated to finite-nucleus observables and bulk properties of dense nuclear matter, we investigate hyperonic neutron-star matter within an SU(3) flavor-symmetry scheme.

A systematic comparison of the density and magnetic spectra shows that both steepen near the electron scales. Notably, the density spectrum exhibits slopes close to $-10/3$, while the magnetic spectrum becomes consistently steeper than the density spectrum at scales smaller than $\rho_e$, indicating that the turbulence becomes electrostatic.

In this scenario, the overabundance issue of heavy DM can be tackled by diluting its abundance through the continuous injection of entropy when the matter-like inflaton decays into the SM bath. Using the low reheating scenario, we can obtain the correct value of DM density both for freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms for super-heavy DM. Moreover, we have studied the Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced from cosmic strings, which fall within the detectable range of future proposed GW experiments. Additionally, the dominance of a quadratic inflaton potential before the reheating temperature changes the temperature-scale factor relation, which suppresses the GW spectrum at higher frequencies. Choosing an arbitrarily low reheating temperature provides only a tiny fraction of the DM density due to dilution from entropy injection. This fraction of the vector DM suggests that only the extragalactic contribution is relevant in the KM3NeT event because DM lifetime is shorter than the age of the Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17179" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multifield Cosmology and the Dark Universe</a><span class="id">[2509.17179]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Multifield models, arising from multiple scalars interacting with gravity, provide a rich theoretical framework for addressing fundamental problems in modern cosmology.

We review the implications of this regime for a number of problems relevant for cosmological inflation, dark matter and dark energy. We focus, in more detail, on a class of exact rapid-turn solutions that give a model of dynamical dark energy. In this model, the sound speed of the dark energy perturbations is reduced compared to the speed of light, which leads to observational differences from a cosmological constant even for an equation-of-state parameter very close to -1. Furthermore, this model holds promise for the simultaneous alleviation of two prominent cosmological tensions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17217" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An idealized general circulation model for the atmospheric circulation on the ice giants</a><span class="id">[2509.17217]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Uranus and Neptune are the least explored planets in the Solar System. A key question regarding the two planets is the similarity of their observed flows despite the great differences in their obliquity and internal heating. To answer this fundamental question and understand the ice giants atmospheric circulation, we developed a new general circulation model (GCM). This tool will also be key to facilitating the success of future missions to the ice giants, for which atmospheric flows will be a measurable quantity. Past GCMs for the ice giants have struggled to reproduce the observed winds on Uranus and Neptune. Using our idealized GCM, we systematically explored how the zonal wind and meridional circulation respond to different model and physical parameters; our main focus was on the depth of the domain. We show that in cases where the bottom layer of the model is deep enough, the simulated flow is independent of the meridional structure of the forcing temperature, indicating that dynamical processes, and not the imposed thermal forcing, are the dominant drivers of the circulation and the thermal structure. A momentum balance analysis further shows that meridional and vertical eddy momentum flux convergence are both central to maintaining the circulation. These results provide a physical explanation for the similarity of the flow on Uranus and Neptune although their solar and internal forcing are significantly different. The modeling framework developed in this study can serve as a foundation for the development of more comprehensive GCMs of the ice giants and help guide the interpretation of future mission data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational baryogenesis in $f(T,L_m)$ gravity</a><span class="id">[2509.17218]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. In this work, we explore gravitational baryogenesis within the framework of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian depends on both the torsion scalar $T$ and the matter Lagrangian $L_m$. We consider three representative models and examine their ability to generate the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio. Our analysis shows that couplings involving both torsion and the matter Lagrangian, $\partial_\mu(-T-\frac{L_m}{L_0})$, can successfully account for the baryon asymmetry for decoupling temperatures in the range $10^{12}$-$10^{14}\,\text{GeV}$, while remaining consistent with small deviations from General Relativity. These results highlight the capacity of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity to provide novel mechanisms for baryogenesis, demonstrating that the interplay between torsion and matter-sector contributions can naturally generate the observed asymmetry. The framework also remains compatible with late-time cosmological evolution, offering a unified setting for early- and late-time dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17384" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhanced Gravitational Effects of Radiation and Cosmological Implications</a><span class="id">[2509.17384]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the momentarily comoving frame of a cosmological fluid, the determinant of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) is highly sensitive to its pressure.

We derive the gravitational field equations for the general power-law case and examine the cosmological implications of the scale-independent model characterized by dimensionless couplings to photons and neutrinos. We show that, unlike various theories based on the EMT, the present setup, which leads to an enhanced gravitational effects of radiation, does not alter the time evolution of the energy density of particle species. Furthermore, we confront the model with the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis, and discuss its potential to alleviate the Hubble tension by reducing the sound horizon. The radiation-gravity couplings we propose here are expected to yield testable cosmological and astrophysical signatures, probing whether gravity distinguishes between relativistic and nonrelativistic species in the early universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frequency dependence of the thermal dust $E/B$ ratio and $EB$ correlation: insights from the spin-moment expansion</a><span class="id">[2210.14768]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The change of physical conditions across the turbulent and magnetized interstellar medium (ISM) induces a 3D spatial variation of the properties of Galactic polarized emission. The observed signal results from the averaging of different spectral energy distributions (SED) and polarization angles, along and between lines of sight. As a consequence, the total Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ will have different distorted SEDs, so that the polarization angle becomes frequency dependent. In the present work, we show how this phenomenon similarly induces a different distorted SED for the three polarized angular power spectra $EE$, $BB$ and $EB$, implying a variation of the $EE/BB$ ratio with frequency. We demonstrate how the previously introduced spin-moment formalism provides a natural framework to grasp these effects, allowing us to derive analytical predictions for the spectral behaviors of the polarized spectra, focusing here on the example of thermal dust polarized emission. After a quantitative discussion based on a model combining emission from a filament with its background, we further reveal that the spectral complexity implemented in the dust models commonly used by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) community produce such effects. This new understanding is crucial for CMB component separation, in which an extreme accuracy is required in the modeling of the dust signal to allow for the search of the primordial imprints of inflation or cosmic birefringence. For the latter, as long as the dust $EB$ signal is not measured accurately, great caution is required about the assumptions made to model its spectral behavior, as it may not simply follow from the other dust angular power spectra.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutron star phase transition as the origin for the fast radio bursts and soft gamma-ray repeaters of SGR J1935+2154</a><span class="id">[2304.10871]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetars are believed as neutron stars (NSs) with strong magnetic fields.

To find such objects, isolating unique electromagnetic signatures of their accretion flow is key. With the aid of three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations that utilize an approximate, semi-analytic, super-imposed spacetime metric, we identify two such signatures for merging binaries. Both involve magnetic reconnection and are analogous to plasma processes observed in the solar corona. The first, like colliding flux tubes that can cause solar flares, involves colliding jets that form an extended reconnection layer, dissipating magnetic energy and causing the two jets to merge. The second, akin to coronal mass ejection events, involves the accretion of magnetic field lines onto both black holes; these magnetic fields then twist, inflate, and form a trailing current sheet, ultimately reconnecting and driving a hot outflow. We provide estimates for the associated electromagnetic emission for both processes, showing that they likely accelerate electrons to high energies and are promising candidates for continuous, stochastic, and/or quasi-periodic higher energy electromagnetic emission. We also show that the accretion flows around each black hole can display features associated with the magnetically arrested state. However, simulations with black hole spins misaligned with the orbital plane and simulations with larger Bondi radii saturate at lower values of horizon-penetrating magnetic flux than standard magnetically arrested disks, leading to weaker, intermittent jets due to feedback from the weak jets or equatorial flux tubes ejected by reconnecting field lines near the horizon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The thermodynamic structure and large-scale structure filament in MACS J0717.5+3745</a><span class="id">[2411.08103]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the results of Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopy, as well as new MUSTANG2 90 GHz observations of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect from MACS J0717.5+3745, an intermediate redshift ($z=0.5458$) and exceptionally massive ($3.5\pm0.6\times10^{15}$ M$_\odot$) Frontier Fields cluster experiencing multiple mergers and hosting an apparent X-ray bright large-scale structure filament.

We perform the first application of the moment expansion to reproduce a thermal dust model largely used by the CMB community, demonstrating its power as a minimal tool to compress, understand and model the information contained within any foreground model. Furthermore, we use this framework to produce new models of thermal dust emission containing the maximal amount of complexity allowed by the current data, remaining compatible with the observed angular power-spectra by the $Planck$ mission.

Here, we first update the computation of the entropy associated with various sectors of the observed universe, including in the diffuse cosmic and late-time gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds, in baryonic matter both in diffuse components, in stars and stellar remnants, and in cosmic rays; we then update, crucially, the estimate of entropy in stellar-mass and super-massive black holes, whose abundance and mass function has come into increasingly sharp definition with recent observations and with the rapidly growing statistics of black-hole-black-hole mergers observed with gravity wave detectors. We also provide a new, corrected estimate of the potential entropy associated with a stochastic gravitational wave background, with dark sector radiations, and with several dark matter models. Finally, we utilize the similarly recently updated constraints on the abundance of hypothetical primordial black holes - black holes, that is, of non-stellar origin - to assess the maximal amount entropy they could store. We find that if supermassive primordial black holes exist, they can dominate the entropy budget of the universe consistently with current constraints on their abundance and mass function, to a level potentially not distant from the posited entropy associated with the cosmic event horizon of de Sitter spacetime. The same conclusion holds for certain dark sector models featuring a large number of dark degrees of freedom.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Wave Memory from Accelerating Relativistic Jets in Multiple Thick Shell Scenarios</a><span class="id">[2502.06110]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave (GW) memory, a permanent distortion of the space-time metric, is anticipated during the acceleration of relativistic jets in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).

The Gnevyshev-Ohl Rule and its Generation Mechanism</a><span class="id">[2502.11120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Gnevyshev-Ohl (G-O) rule, or even-odd effect, is an important observational phenomenon in solar cycles, originally suggesting that even-numbered cycles are typically followed by stronger odd-numbered ones. However, subsequent studies have reported varied forms and often conflicting manifestations of this rule, along with diverse interpretations of its physical origin. Using an observation-based iterative map, we investigate these different forms of the G-O rule and propose a more general underlying rule: statistically, a given solar cycle is more likely to be followed by a stronger one, regardless of even-odd numbering. This transition asymmetry arises from the map's inherent asymmetry relative to the diagonal. Over timescales comparable to historical observations, both the G-O rule and its reversal can arise randomly, without a consistent preference. The short-term behavior of the rule is sensitive to the initial cycle, the selected time interval, and the parameters of the recursion function. These findings reconcile previously conflicting reports and point to a general generation mechanism: G-O-like behavior arises naturally from nonlinear stochastic dynamics. While different recursion parameters may lead to varying short-term patterns and statistical strengths, the emergence of G-O-like features appears to be a generic property of such systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">90.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15592" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fresh Look at Neutrino Self-Interactions With the Lyman-$α$ Forest: Constraints from EFT and PRIYA Simulations</a><span class="id">[2503.15592]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first search for evidence of neutrino self-interaction with two new, state-of-the-art likelihoods for eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ data.

However, observations of sources in dense environments are heavily affected by propagation effects which may hinder a detection. Millimetre wave observations bypass this complication but require the largest radio telescopes to compensate for the lower flux densities. When used in phased mode, the ALMA radio telescope provides an equivalent dish size of 84m, being the most sensitive instrument at mm/sub mm. With its high time resolution it offers a unique opportunity to study radio transients in an unexplored window. We study the Galactic Centre (GC) magnetar, PSR J1745$-$2900, as a laboratory for magnetars in complex magneto-turbulent environments and to link with FRBs. We showcase the potential of ALMA in phased mode to observe radio transients and to achieve, for some sources, the first ever detections outside the cm wave range. We studied the GC magnetar using ALMA archival data of Sgr A* at Band 3 from the 2017 GMVA campaign. We searched in intensity and classified the pulses based on their circular and linear polarisation properties and arrival phase. We detected eight pulses with energies in the range of 10$^{29}$ erg. We constructed its cumulative energy distribution and we fit a power law, where the event rate scales with energy as $R \propto E^{\gamma}$. The result is an exponent of $\gamma = -2.4 \pm 0.1$. With the $\gamma -$value and the system properties of phased ALMA, we estimate that over 160 known pulsars could be detected by ALMA. For repeating FRBs, observing during their peak activity window could lead to several detections. We expect that ALMA's lower frequency bands with polarisation capabilities, will serve as a pioneer on mm wave searches for pulsars and to study complex environments involving radio transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">92.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16391" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion Flow Properties of Swift J1727.8-1613 and Estimation of the BH Mass</a><span class="id">[2504.16391]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rising phase of the 2023-24 outburst of the recently discovered bright transient black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 was monitored by {\it Insight}-HXMT.

While there exists a generic set of tests that are designed to probe certain systematic effects, the implementations differ slightly across the individual surveys, making it difficult to make direct comparisons. In this paper, we use the TXPipe package to conduct a series of predefined diagnostic tests across three public shear catalogs – the 1,000 deg$^2$ KiDS-1000 shear catalog, the Year 3 DES-Y3 shear catalog, and the Year 3 HSC-Y3 shear catalog. We attempt to reproduce the published results when possible and perform key tests uniformly across the surveys. While all surveys pass most of the null tests in this study, we find two tests where some of the surveys fail. Namely, we find that when measuring the tangential ellipticity around bright and faint star samples, KiDS-1000 fails with a $\chi^2$/dof of 121.1/16 and 257.7/16 for bins 4 and 5 for faint, weighted stars.

Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) offer a mechanism to alleviate these tensions within the framework of the standard model. These fields source excess small-scale baryon clumping, which can speed up recombination and shrink the comoving sound horizon at the surface of last scattering. Computing the modified recombination history requires coupling the radiative transport of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons to compressible magnetohydronamic simulations. Since doing so is generically computationally intractable, we have developed a linearized treatment which self-consistently computes the modified recombination history in the presence of PMF induced baryon clumping for fields with red-tilted spectra. The clumping factors we find are too small to alleviate outstanding cosmological tensions, but our general framework can be applied to other PMF spectra, and provides a significant theoretical step towards a complete account of recombination in the presence of small-scale baryon clumping.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">97.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing Cosmic Distance Duality Relation and Transparency with DESI DR2</a><span class="id">[2506.17926]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) is a basic relation of standard cosmology. This work tests the CDDR and cosmic transparency using angular diameter distances from DESI DR2, luminosity distances from Pantheon+, and direct measurements of the Hubble parameter. First, we use two redshift matching reconstruction method, the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Control Points Interpolating (CPI) finding that the results are highly dependent on the cosmological prior choose which relates to Hubble tension. We then estimate parameters for several phenomenological models, comparing reconstruction methods and the effect of marginalization. The results show that marginalization has no significant impact, but the choice of reconstruction method is highly influential, highlighting methodology as a primary source of systematic uncertainty. Furthermore, our test for cosmic opacity rules out cosmic dust and provides auxiliary support for the validity of the CDDR. Therefore, we conclude that the CDDR itself exhibits no significant deviation, but different redshift matching methods strongly affect the results, and some singular results are more likely attributed to supernova calibration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">98.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blending effects on shear measurement synergy between Euclid-like and LSST-like surveys</a><span class="id">[2506.22658]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe for constraining cosmological parameters, but its success relies on accurate shear measurements. In this paper, we use image simulations to investigate how a joint analysis of high-resolution space-based and deep ground-based imaging can improve shear estimation. We simulate two scenarios: a grid-based setup, where galaxies are placed on a regular grid to mimic an idealised, blending-free scenario, and a random setup, where galaxies are randomly distributed to capture the impact of blending. Comparing these cases, we find that blending introduces significant biases, particularly in LSST-like data due to its larger point spread function. This highlights the importance of including realistic blending effects when evaluating the performance of joint analyses. Using simulations that account for blending, we find that the most effective catalogue-level synergy is achieved by combining all galaxies detected in either survey. This approach yields an effective galaxy number density of $44.08~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ over the magnitude range of 20.0 to 27.5, compared to $39.17~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ for LSST-like data alone and $30.31~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ for \textit{Euclid}-like data alone. Restricting the analysis to only the overlapping sources detected in both surveys results in a gain of ${\sim}12\%$ compared to using either survey alone. While this joint-object approach is suboptimal at the catalogue level, it may become more effective in pixel-level analyses, where a joint fit to individual galaxy shapes can better leverage the complementary strengths of both data sets. Studying such pixel-level combinations, with realistic blending effects properly accounted for, remains a promising direction for future work.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">99.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Torsion cosmology in the light of DESI, supernovae and CMB observational constraints</a><span class="id">[2507.04265]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we investigate a torsion-based cosmological model within the Einstei-Cartan framework, constrained by the latest combined datasets including DESI DR2 BAO, PantheonPlus and DESY5 supernovae, and the full Planck 2018 CMB measurements (temperature, polarization, and joint NPIPE PR4 + ACT DR6 lensing). The torsion parameter is constrained to $\alpha = -0.00066 \pm 0.00098$ with the full dataset combination, consistent with zero at less than $1\sigma$, while yielding a Hubble constant $H_0 = 68.41 \pm 0.32$ km/s/Mpc and matter clustering amplitude $S_8 = 0.812 \pm 0.006$. The model shows notable potential in alleviating cosmological tensions, reducing the $S_8$ discrepancy with KiDS-1000 from $\sim 2.3\sigma$ in $\Lambda$CDM to only $0.1\sigma$. Model comparisons based on the Akaike information criterion show consistent improvements across all datasets, with $\Delta {\rm AIC}$ values ranging from $-5.68$ to $-6.62$, indicating a statistically preferred fit for the torsion model.

However, recent observations suggest potential deviations from this assumption, hinting at a small anisotropic expansion. Such an expansion can arise from sources that break rotational invariance. A minimal realization of this scenario is described by a Bianchi I geometry, where the degree of anisotropy is quantified by the shear parameter $\Sigma$. In this work, we constrain the present-day value of the shear, $\Sigma_0$, by confronting theoretical predictions with recent cosmological data. We implement various anisotropic models within the Boltzmann code \texttt{CLASS} and explore their parameter space using the sampler \texttt{MontePython}. Although our results show that $\Sigma_0$ is model-dependent, notably, in one specific scenario considering a homogeneous scalar field coupled to a 2-form field, $\Sigma_0 = 0$ is excluded at the $2\sigma$ confidence level, with mean value around $|\Sigma_0| \sim 10^{-4}$ while remaining consistent with observations. These findings challenge the conventional assumption that cosmic shear is negligible in the present universe. Moreover, the anisotropic expansion in this model is driven by a steep scalar field potential, a feature often found in supergravity-inspired scenarios. While anisotropic models offer interesting alternatives and could help explain some cosmological anomalies, they generally introduce additional parameters, making the standard $\Lambda$CDM model statistically favored in most cases. Still, they remain compatible with current observations and provide new perspectives on features not fully explained within the standard framework. These results highlight the importance of further exploring anisotropic cosmologies to better understand their implications.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">101.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strangeon Matter: from Stars to Nuggets</a><span class="id">[2507.13935]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fact that strange sea quarks are abundant in the nucleons, but with zero net strangeness, is of great importance for understanding the nature of matter condensed by the strong interaction, particularly in the context of the “gigantic nucleus” formed by the gravitational collapse of an evolved massive star.

With data from the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we analyze the spectral index, morphology and multiplicity of the detected radio sources. The high-sensitivity, high-resolution observations allow us to resolve many sources; 65$\%$ of the reported sources are resolved at least within the synthesized beam. We report thirteen new detections and two previously known detections that we observed for the first time in radio frequencies. We use the observations to build radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to calculate spectral indices. With radio morphologies and the spectral indices, we give assessments on the nature of the sources, highlighting six sources that display a radio jet-like morphology and a spectral index consistent with ionized jets. Combining with the SOMA Radio I sample, we present the radio - bolometric luminosity relation, especially probing the regime from $L_{\rm bol}\sim 10^4$ to $10^6\:L_\odot$.

Each light curve is carefully scrutinized and its properties are summarized in a set of five parameters. One of these, which measures the relative width of the light maxima and minima, is found to be particularly efficient at revealing significant correlations with the current state of the star on the AGB. The picture that had been sketched in an earlier work is clarified and new features are revealed. In particular, the evolution on the AGB of stars having not yet experienced a third dredge-up event is shown to go together with a closely related path followed by the light curve in the parameter space. Moreover, evidence is found for the existence of two different types of light curves for stars having experienced dredge-up events strong enough for their impact to be detectable. For some, probably associated with higher initial mass stars, the light maximum becomes broader as the star evolves along the AGB, while for others it becomes narrower. Interpretations are proposed, however often too speculative to be firmly ascertained: the results presented raise several unanswered questions and point to the need for new observations and analyses, suggesting that light curves still carry more messages and information than has been currently possible to decrypt.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">104.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Triggering Electron Capture Supernovae: Dark Matter Effects in Degenerate White-Dwarf-like Cores of Super-Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars</a><span class="id">[2507.19320]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) have emerged as a compelling formation channel for low-mass neutron stars, bolstered by decades of theoretical work and increasingly supported by observational evidence, including the recent identification of SN 2018zd. Motivated by this, we investigate the influence of fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) on the equilibrium structure of progenitor cores and the formation of their neutron star remnants. Using a general relativistic two-fluid formalism, we model the coupled evolution of ordinary matter (OM) and ADM, treated as separately conserved fluids interacting solely through gravity. Our analysis focuses on neon-rich white dwarfs (Ne WDs), which are typical progenitor cores for ECSNe. We assume conservation of both baryon number ($N_B$) and dark matter particle number ($N_D$) during collapse, allowing for a consistent mapping between progenitor and remnant configurations. We find that ADM significantly enhances the central density of the WD progenitor. This lowers the threshold gravitational mass $M^*$ required to initiate electron capture, enabling ECSNe from lower-mass progenitors. The resulting remnants are stable, dark matter-admixed neutron stars with gravitational masses potentially well below current observational bounds. Moreover, we find that the conversion energy during the WD-to-NS conversion is also significantly reduced for higher ADM particle masses and fractions, suggesting that unusually low-energy ECSNe may serve as potential indicators of ADM involvement in stellar collapse.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">105.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04028" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial black holes versus their impersonators at gravitational wave observatories</a><span class="id">[2509.04028]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of primordial black holes (PBHs) would mark a major breakthrough, with far-reaching implications for early universe cosmology, fundamental physics, and the nature of dark matter. Gravitational wave observations have recently emerged as a powerful tool to test the existence and properties of PBHs, as these objects leave distinctive imprints on the gravitational waveform. Notably, there are no known astrophysical processes that can form sub-solar mass black holes, making their discovery a compelling signal of new physics. In addition to PBHs, we consider other exotic compact object (ECO) candidates-such as strange quark stars and boson stars-which can produce similar gravitational signatures and potentially mimic PBHs. In this work, we employ the Fisher matrix formalism to explore a broad parameter space, including binary masses, spins, and a variety of nuclear and quark matter equations of state. Our goal is to assess the ability of next-generation gravitational wave detectors-specifically Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope-to distinguish PBHs from ECOs, stellar BHs and neutron stars. We compute the maximum luminosity distances at which confident ($\geq 3\sigma$) detections of sub-solar masses or tidal effects are possible, providing quantitative benchmarks for PBH identification or exclusion under various observational scenarios. Our results indicate that next-generation detectors will be capable of probing sub-solar mass PBHs out to cosmological distances of $z \sim 3$. For heavier objects with masses up to $M \lesssim 2 M_\odot$, we show that PBHs can be distinguished from neutron stars via their lack of tidal effects up to redshifts of $z \sim 0.2$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">106.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Landscape of Collapsar Outflows: Structure, Signatures and Origins of Einstein Probe Relativistic Supernova Transients</a><span class="id">[2509.04551]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Einstein Probe is revolutionizing time-domain astrophysics through the discovery of new classes of X-ray transients associated with Type Ic-Broad Line supernovae. These events commonly exhibit bright early-time optical counterparts, and sudden afterglow rebrightening within the first week - features that existing models fail to explain. In particular, structured jet and cocoon scenarios are inconsistent with the observed sharp rebrightening and multi-day optical emission, while the refreshed shock model is ruled out due to its inconsistency with collapsar hydrodynamics. Drawing on 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we present the multi-scale angular and radial structure characterizing collapsar outflows. The resulting morphology features episodic, wobbling jets with a &quot;top-hat&quot; geometry, embedded within a smoother global cocoon and disk ejecta angular structure. The wobbling jets give rise to variations in radiative efficiency that can account for the observed alternation between X-ray-dominated and $\gamma$-ray-dominated jet emission. The top-hat structure of individual wobbling jet episodes naturally explains the sudden rebrightening observed when the emission from the top-hat jet cores enters the observer's line of sight. The radial structure is consistent with that inferred from observations of stripped-envelope supernovae. It comprises a mildly relativistic cocoon ($0.3\lesssim\beta\Gamma\lesssim3$) that may power an early ($\sim1\,{\rm day}$) rapidly decaying emission, followed by slower, black hole accretion disk-driven outflows ($\beta\lesssim0.3$), which dominate the slowly evolving optical emission at $t\gtrsim1\,{\rm day}$. This novel multi-component outflow structure provides a unified explanation for the multiband light curves observed in Einstein Probe transients and is likely a common feature of Type Ic-Broad Line supernovae more broadly.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">107.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing Magnetic Field Configurations in Spider Pulsar PSR J1723-2837 with IXPE</a><span class="id">[2509.05240]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first X-ray polarimetry observations of a redback millisecond pulsar binary, PSR J1723-2837, with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE).

We explore two limiting magnetic field configurations, parallel and perpendicular to the bulk flow, and simulate their expected polarization signatures using the {\tt 3DPol} radiative transport code. To account for the rapid rotation of the polarization angle predicted by these models, we implement a phase-dependent Stokes alignment procedure that preserves the polarization degree while correcting for a phase-rotating PA. We also devise a new maximum-likelihood fitting strategy to determine the phase-dependence of the polarization angle by minimizing the polarization degree uncertainty. This technique hints that the binary may be rotating clockwise relative to the celestial north pole. We find no significant detection of polarization in the IXPE data, with PD&lt;50% at 99% confidence level. Our results excludes the high-polarization degree scenario predicted by the perpendicular field model during the brightest orbital phase bin.

We develop a strategy to identify LISA source candidates in multiband photometric surveys. We constructed a synthetic EM catalogue of white dwarf (WD) detections based on a population synthesis code combined with a semi-analytical model of the Milky Way and a consistent cooling model for the evolution. We compared sources in the LISA band with other WD observations in magnitude-colour and colour-colour plots. From a full sky survey with $u \le$24.5, we find that 57$\%$ of the sources in the LISA band occupy a specific region in colour-colour diagrams. Inside this area, we find that $\sim 63\%$ (6.5 $\times 10^4$) of EM observations are LISA candidates, $\sim 31\%$ ($ 3.2 \times 10^4$) are DWDs slightly outside the LISA frequency range, and only a small contamination comes from single WDs and wider binaries. We find that the colour distributions of close DWDs represent a powerful tool to distinguish potential LISA sources from the broader WD population.

The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes.

This framework provides a unified description of dark matter and dark energy, transitioning naturally from a matter-dominated phase at early times to a negative-pressure dark-energy phase at late times. In this scalar-field formulation, the GCG and MCG models are naturally applicable to both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. Extending this approach, we develop a systematic method to obtain a class of integrable scalar-field cosmological models. In this study, we use this method to construct a new scalar-field altered Chaplygin gas (ACG) model. To investigate the viability of Chaplygin-type models, we perform a likelihood analysis using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation together with Cepheid-calibrated distances.

This problem is inherently ill-posed and is further challenged by the variety of timescales exhibited by sources in time series data from planetary space missions. As such, a systematic multi-scale unsupervised approach is needed to identify and separate sources at different timescales. Existing methods typically rely on a preselected window size that determines their operating timescale, limiting their capacity to handle multi-scale sources. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised multi-scale clustering and source separation framework by leveraging wavelet scattering spectra that provide a low-dimensional representation of stochastic processes, capable of distinguishing between different non-Gaussian stochastic processes. Nested within this representation space, we develop a factorial variational autoencoder that is trained to probabilistically cluster sources at different timescales. To perform source separation, we use samples from clusters at multiple timescales obtained via the factorial variational autoencoder as prior information and formulate an optimization problem in the wavelet scattering spectra representation space. When applied to the entire seismic dataset recorded during the NASA InSight mission on Mars, containing sources varying greatly in timescale, our approach disentangles such different sources, e.g., minute-long transient one-sided pulses (known as &quot;glitches&quot;) and structured ambient noises resulting from atmospheric activities that typically last for tens of minutes, and provides an opportunity to conduct further investigations into the isolated sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">113.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Partial tidal disruption of White Dwarfs in off-equatorial orbits around Kerr black holes</a><span class="id">[2410.12727]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the results of a suite of numerical simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics to study partial tidal disruption events (TDEs) of white dwarfs (WDs) in off-equatorial orbits in intermediate mass spinning (Kerr) black hole backgrounds.

Our objective here is to quantify the differences in variables like the mass of the self-bound core, the peak fallback rate of debris and gravitational wave signature in off-equatorial orbits compared to equatorial ones. The analysis is carried out using a hybrid numerical scheme, one which involves integrating the exact Kerr geodesics while adopting a Newtonian formalism for the stellar fluid dynamics, justified by our choice of simulation parameters.

We observe that the cosmological phase space features the same set of fixed points as in standard GR, i.e., radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, curvature-dominated, and exponentially-accelerated solutions independently of the values of the coupling function and the scalar field. Furthermore, the radiation-dominated fixed points are repellers and the exponentially accelerated fixed points are attractors in the phase space, thus allowing for cosmological solutions behaving qualitatively similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model, i.e., transitioning from a radiation-dominated phase into a matter-dominated phase, and later into a late-time cosmic acceleration phase supported by the scalar field potential. Following a reconstruction method through which we produce the cosmological solutions in the GR limit of the theory and introduce them into the general EsGB dynamical system, a numerical integration of the dynamical system shows that the EsGB theory provides cosmological solutions indistinguishable from those of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, compatible with the current observations from the Planck satellite and weak-field solar system dynamics, while maintaining the scalar field and the coupling function finite and regular throughout the entire time evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">115.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotating and swirling binary black hole system balanced by its gravitational spin-spin interaction</a><span class="id">[2502.08706]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first exact and analytical solution in General Relativity describing an equilibrium configuration for two stationary black holes.

These neutrinos are the only messengers from the extreme cosmic accelerators that can reveal the origin of the most energetic cosmic rays. Consequently, much effort is being devoted to achieving their detection. In particular, the GRAND project aims to observe the $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar \nu_\tau$ components of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in the near future using radio antennas. In this work, we investigate how the detection of cosmogenic neutrinos by GRAND can be used to probe beyond the Standard Model physics. We identify three well-motivated scenarios which induce distinct features in the cosmogenic neutrino spectrum at Earth: neutrino self-interactions mediated by a light scalar ($\nu$SI), pseudo-Dirac neutrinos (PD$\nu$) and neutrinos scattering on ultra-light Dark Matter ($\nu$DM). We show these scenarios can be tested by GRAND, using 10 years of cosmogenic neutrino data, in a region of parameter space complementary to current experiments. For the $\nu$SI model,, we find that GRAND can constrain the coupling to $\nu_\tau$ in the range [$10^{-2},10^{-1}$] for a scalar with mass in the range 0.1 to 1 GeV. For PD$\nu$, we find that GRAND is sensitive to sterile-active mass squared splitting in the range [$10^{-15},10^{-13}$] ${\rm eV}^2$. Finally, for the $\nu$DM model, assuming a heavy mediator, GRAND can do substantially better than the current limits from other available data. These results rely on the fact that the actual cosmogenic flux is around the corner, not far from the current IceCube limit.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">117.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taming systematics in distance and inclination measurements with gravitational waves: role of the detector network and higher-order modes</a><span class="id">[2504.12473]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational-wave (GW) observations of compact binaries have the potential to unlock several remarkable applications in astrophysics, cosmology, and nuclear physics through accurate measurements of the source luminosity distance and inclination. However, these parameters are strongly correlated when performing parameter estimation, which may hamper the enormous potential of GW astronomy. We comprehensively explore this problem by performing Bayesian inference on synthetic data for a network of current and planned second-generation GW detectors, and for the third-generation interferometer Einstein Telescope (ET). We quantify the role of the network alignment factor, detector sensitivity, and waveform higher-order modes in breaking this degeneracy. We discuss the crucial role of the binary mass ratio: in particular, we find that ET can efficiently remove the error in the distance as long as the compact binary is asymmetric in mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">118.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full-Spectrum Analysis of Gravitational Wave Production from Inflation to Reheating</a><span class="id">[2505.08868]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we systematically study gravitational wave (GW) production during both the inflationary and post-inflationary epochs. While inflationary GWs can be readily derived from tensor perturbations during inflation, post-inflationary GWs arise from a variety of processes during reheating and require detailed treatment for quantitative analysis. We consider four distinct production channels: $(i)$ pure inflaton annihilation, $(ii)$ graviton bremsstrahlung from inflaton decay, $(iii)$ radiation-catalyzed inflaton-graviton conversion, and $(iv)$ scattering among fully thermalized radiation particles. For each channel, we solve the corresponding Boltzmann equation to obtain the GW spectrum and derive a simple yet accurate analytical expression for it. By employing a consistent treatment of all production channels, our analysis yields for the first time the full spectrum of GWs produced during the inflationary and post-inflationary epochs. We find that, while inflationary GWs dominate at low frequencies, post-inflationary processes generally produce high-frequency GWs with considerably high energy densities that may significantly exceed that of inflationary GWs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">119.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Dark Energy from $F(R)$ Gravity Models Unifying Inflation with Dark Energy: Confronting the Latest Observational Data</a><span class="id">[2506.02245]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A class of viable $F(R)$ gravity models which can provide a unified description of inflation with the dark energy era is confronted with the latest observational data on the dark energy era. These models have the unique characteristic that the de Sitter scalaron mass in the Einstein frame counterpart theory is a monotonic function of the curvature, which renders them viable descriptions for both the inflationary and the late-time acceleration eras. We also compare these models with other well-known viable $F(R)$ gravity models and with the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. As we show, the most phenomenologically successful models are those which deviate significantly from the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. Also some of the models presented, provide a statistically favorable description of the dark energy eras, compared with the exponential $F(R)$ gravity model and of course compared with the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. All the models we present in this article are confronted with the observational data from the Planck collaboration, the Pantheon plus data from Type Ia supernovae, the two rounds of observations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, data from baryon acoustic oscillations and the Hubble constant measurements by SH0ES group. As we show, two of the models are statistically favorable by the data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">120.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10648" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vortex-magnetic competition and regime transitions in antiparallel flux tubes</a><span class="id">[2506.10648]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Vortex-magnetic interactions shape magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, influencing energy transfer in astrophysical, geophysical, and industrial systems. On the Sun, granular-scale vortex flows couple strongly with magnetic fields, channeling energy into the corona. At high Reynolds numbers, vorticity and magnetic fields are nearly frozen into the charged fluid, and MHD flows emerge from the Lorentz force mediated interactions between coherent vortex structures in matter and the field. To probe this competition in a controlled setting, we revisit the canonical problem of two antiparallel flux tubes. By varying the magnetic flux threading each tube–and thus sweeping the interaction parameter $N_i$, which gauges Lorentz-to-inertial force balance–we uncover three distinct regimes: vortex-dominated joint reconnection, instability-triggered cascade, and Lorentz-induced vortex disruption. At low $N_i$, classical vortex dynamics dominate, driving joint vortex-magnetic reconnection and amplifying magnetic energy via a dynamo effect. At moderate $N_i$, the system oscillates between vorticity-driven attraction and magnetic damping, triggering instabilities and nonlinear interactions that spawn secondary filaments and drive an energy cascade. At high $N_i$, Lorentz forces suppress vortex interactions, aligning the tubes axially while disrupting vortex cores and rapidly converting magnetic to kinetic energy. These findings reveal how the inertial-Lorentz balance governs energy transfer and coherent structure formation in MHD turbulence, offering insight into vortex-magnetic coevolution in astrophysical plasmas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">121.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16387" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial magnetogenesis from a supercooled dynamical electroweak phase transition</a><span class="id">[2506.16387]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of $\gamma$-ray from blazars suggest the presence of magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium, which may require a primordial origin. Intense enough primordial magnetic fields can arise from theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking during the big bang, where supercooling is ended by a strongly first order phase transition. We consider theories involving new scalars and possibly vectors, including thermal particle dark matter candidates. Intense enough magnetic fields can arise if the reheating temperature after the phase transition is below a few TeV. The same dynamics also leaves testable primordial gravitational waves and possibly primordial black holes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">122.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15934" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wino and Real Minimal Dark Matter Excluded by Fermi Gamma-Ray Observations</a><span class="id">[2507.15934]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that minimal, fermionic dark matter (DM) models in the $n$-dimensional representation of the weak force with zero hypercharge that make up 100% of the DM under the standard cosmological history are strongly excluded for $n &lt; 9$. This includes the thermal wino, which we show is ruled out even allowing for DM core sizes up to $\sim$6.7 kpc with the preferred local DM density or $\sim$3.7 kpc in addition to the local DM density being half the preferred value, at less than $0.2$ GeV/cm$^3$. We reach these conclusions through dedicated searches with 14 years of Fermi gamma-ray data in the inner Galaxy between 30 GeV and 2 TeV for the continuum gamma-rays produced in the decays of unstable particles produced in DM annihilation and bound-state formation processes. We consider a variety of Milky Way DM profiles in our analyses, including those motivated by modern hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, and show that all the $n &lt; 9$ minimal DM models are disfavored even under the most conservative assumptions for these density profiles. While wino, quintuplet ($n=5$), and $n = 7$ DM models are strongly disfavored by our analyses under the standard cosmology, we discuss how non-standard cosmological histories or DM sub-fractions could still allow for these particles to be realized in nature, with discovery opportunities at next-generation particle colliders and gamma-ray telescopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">123.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17358" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confronting Rainbow-deformed $f(R)$ Gravity with the ACT Data</a><span class="id">[2508.17358]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we examine a theoretical scenario which combines two fundamental theoretical proposals for the early Universe and a possible evolution for the early post-inflationary epoch. Specifically, we assume that the early Universe contains gravity's rainbow effects on the spacetime and the inflationary Lagrangian contains $R^2$ corrections or $f(R)$ gravity corrections in general. In addition we assume that the era beyond the end of inflation until the reheating temperature is reached, is a kination era. Both theories, $R^2$ and gravity's rainbow emerge from a quantum context so their effects should be first checked at the theory which connects the quantum with the classical, hence inflation. Spacetime is four dimensional and the effects of the quantum theory could possibly be imprinted in the inflationary Lagrangian and of course on the spacetime itself. For the gravity's rainbow deformed Starobinsky model, both Lagrangian quantum effects and spacetime quantum effects are combined. As we show the resulting theory is compatible with the ACT data. We also consider power-law $f(R)$ gravity deformations and we show that in this case, the model is viable without the need of extending the slow-roll era of inflation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">124.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unique gravitational wave signatures of GLPV scalar-tensor theories</a><span class="id">[2509.05027]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study gravitational waves induced by scalar primordial fluctuations in Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV), beyond Horndeski, scalar-tensor theories.

The new interaction leads to third derivatives in the source for scalar-induced tensor modes, which are absent in Horndeski-related theories. Such new higher-derivative terms lead to a further enhanced production of induced gravitational waves. We predict that for a scale-invariant primordial spectrum, the induced gravitational wave spectral density has a characteristic frequency dependence proportional to $f^5$. Such a fast-rising spectrum offers a potential unique signature of modified gravity in the early universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">125.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power-law $F(R)$ Gravity as Deformations to Starobinsky Inflation in View of ACT</a><span class="id">[2509.06251]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we aim to provide a new parametrization of power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation framework in the Jordan frame.
