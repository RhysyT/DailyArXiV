Current morphological studies have been limited by small samples, as well as by insufficient imaging depth, which may not allow reliable separation between point-like and extended components, leaving the existence and properties of extended components in LRD largely unconstrained. Here, we perform the image stacking analysis of 217 LRDs in four NIRCam bands, representing the largest and homogeneous sample observed from COSMOS-Web survey to date. Our results reveal an unambiguous detection of faint extended emission in the F444W band, with a typical size of  200 parsecs and magnitude of  27.7 AB at z 6.5. We perform four-band photometric SED fitting based on galaxy templates and derive a stellar mass of 8.91+- 0.1 logM_sun. Given this stellar mass, the host galaxy is compact, i.e.,  2.5 times smaller than star-forming populations at similar mass, and the typical black hole mass of LRDs is elevated by  1.5 dex above the local MBH-M* relation. This work provides direct observational evidence for the existence of LRD host galaxies and offers crucial insights into the growth of the host galaxy and the co-evolution of galaxies and their black holes within the first billion years after the Big Bang.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25831" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Model-Independent Inference of Galaxy Star Formation Histories in the Local Volume</a><span class="id">[2510.25831]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the diversity of star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies is key to reconstructing their evolutionary paths. Traditional models often assume parametric forms such as delayed-tau or exponentially declining models, which may not reflect the actual variety of formation processes. We aim to assess what types of SFHs are consistent with the observed present-day star formation rates (${\text{SFR}}_0$) and time-averaged star formation rates ($\langle \text{SFR} \rangle$) of galaxies in the Local Volume, without assuming any fixed functional form. We construct a non-parametric framework by generating large ensembles of randomized SFHs for each galaxy in the sample. For each SFH, we compute its predicted stellar mass and present-day SFR and retain only those consistent with the observed values within a 20% tolerance. We then infer the statistical distribution of power-law slopes $\eta$ (fitted as ${\text{SFR}}(t) \propto (t-t_{\text{start}})^\eta$) and 50% stellar mass formation times $t_{50}$. Both $\eta$ and $t_{50}$ correlate strongly with the SFR ratio (Spearman $\rho &gt; 0.75$, $p \ll 10^{-16}$), indicating that the shape and timing of star formation are primarily governed by this ratio. The $t_{50}$ distribution shows sharp spikes near 7.74 and 7.86 Gyr, which we attribute to grid discretization combined with filtering, rather than a physical bimodality. Our results confirm that strongly declining SFH templates are disfavored in the Local Volume: most systems are consistent with flat long-term SFHs, with only mild decline or occasional rising. Importantly, this is demonstrated through a fully model-independent, data-driven approach, with per-galaxy uncertainties quantified using the standard error of $\eta$ and $t_{50}$ from the ensemble of accepted SFHs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25833" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the quasar disc-wind-jet connection with LoTSS and SDSS</a><span class="id">[2510.25833]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the relationship between disc winds, radio jets, accretion rates and black hole masses of a sample of $\sim$100k quasars at z $\approx$ 2. Combining spectra from the 17th data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with radio fluxes from the 2nd data release of the Low Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS), we statistically characterise a radio loud and radio quiet population using a two-component Gaussian Mixture model, and perform population matching in black hole mass and Eddington fraction. We determine how the fraction of radio loud sources changes across this parameter space, finding that jets are most efficiently produced in quasars with either a very massive central black hole ($M_{\textrm{BH}} &gt; 10^9 \textrm{M}_{\odot}$) or one that is rapidly accreting ($\lambda_{\textrm{Edd}}&gt;0.3$). We also show that there are differences in the blueshift of the CIV $\lambda$1549Å line and the equivalent width of the HeII $\lambda$1640Å line in radio loud and radio quiet quasars that persist even after accounting for differences in the mass and accretion rate of the central black hole. Generally, we find an anti-correlation between the inferred presence of disc winds and jets, which we suggest is mediated by differences in the quasars' spectral energy distributions. The latter result is shown through the close coupling between tracers of wind kinematics and the ionising flux– which holds for both radio loud and radio quiet sources, despite differences between their emission line properties– and is hinted at by a different Baldwin effect in the two populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE) XI: Circumgalactic O VI Emission Traces Clumpy Inflowing Recycled Gas</a><span class="id">[2510.25844]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is host to gas flows into and out of galaxies and regulates galaxy growth, but the multiphase, diffuse gas in this region is challenging to observe. We investigate the properties of gas giving rise to O VI emission from the CGM that upcoming missions, such as the Aspera SmallSat, will be able to map in local galaxies. We use the FOGGIE simulations to predict the O VI emission from edge-on galaxies across the redshift range $z=1\rightarrow0$. O VI emission is brightest surrounding small, clumpy structures near the galaxy where the gas density is high. Most of the O VI surface brightness originates from collisionally ionized, $T\sim10^{5.5}$ K, inflowing gas and is not preferentially aligned with the major or minor axis of the galaxy disk. Simulated galaxies with higher halo masses, higher median CGM gas density, and higher star formation rates produce brighter and more widespread O VI emission in their CGM. We show that while O VI emission primarily originates in inflowing gas, turning off outflows in a simulation without star formation feedback eliminates most of the O VI emission. Enrichment from feedback is necessary to mix with the inflowing gas and allow it to glow in O VI. Collectively, our findings point towards a picture where O VI emission traces warm, ionized envelopes of cooler clouds that are accreting onto the galaxy in a metal-enriched galactic fountain. Finally, we show that the detection limit of Aspera is sufficient to detect O VI emission tens of kpc from the galaxy center for $\sim L^\star$ galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25847" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Simulations of Weakly Collisional Plasmas with Braginskii Viscosity in Galaxy Clusters</a><span class="id">[2510.25847]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the implementation of an anisotropic viscosity solver within the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) framework of the TreeSPH code OpenGadget3. The solver models anisotropic viscous transport along magnetic field lines following the Braginskii formulation and includes physically motivated limiters based on the mirror and firehose instability thresholds, which constrain the viscous stress in weakly collisional plasmas. To validate the implementation, we performed a suite of standard test problems – including two variants of the sound-wave test, circularly and linearly polarized Alfven waves, fast magnetosonic wave, and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability – both with and without the plasma-instability limiters. The results show excellent agreement with the AREPO implementation of a similar anisotropic viscosity model (Berlok et al. 2019), confirming the accuracy and robustness of our method. Our formulation integrates seamlessly within the individual adaptive timestepping framework of OpenGadget3, avoiding the need for subcycling. This provides efficient and stable time integration while maintaining physical consistency. Finally, we applied the new solver to a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy cluster, demonstrating its capability to model anisotropic transport and plasma microphysics in realistic large-scale environments. Our implementation offers a versatile and computationally efficient tool for studying anisotropic viscosity in magnetized astrophysical systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spiral Structure Diversity in Milky Way Analogs from TNG50: The Role of Gas and Disk Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2510.25848]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The generation of spiral arms and the mechanisms controlling their properties within a realistic cosmological framework - the complete understanding is still beyond our grasp. Using a statistically significant sample of Milky Way- and Andromeda-like (MW/M31) analogs from the high-resolution TNG50 cosmological simulation, we carry out the first systematic investigation of spiral-arm formation, their observable properties, and the underlying physical drivers. The selected analogs predominantly exhibit two-armed ($m = 2$) spirals in both stars and gas, while the gaseous disks often display stronger, more tightly wound, and multi-armed patterns ($m&gt;2$). Spiral features appear across stellar populations of different ages, confirming their density-wave nature and producing coherent spirals in both metallicity and mean stellar age distributions-consistent with recent Gaia observations of the Milky Way. Our analysis reveals a diverse dynamical scenario for spiral generation: gas content, disk coldness, and shear jointly regulate the growth and morphology of spiral perturbations. We find that the gas content and the dynamical coldness of the disk jointly regulate spiral growth: galaxies with higher gas fractions and colder disks develop more prominent spirals. The measured relation between spiral pitch angle and disk shear shows significant scatter around the analytic prediction, likely due to the combined influence of bars, gas inflows, and feedback. These results demonstrate that spiral density waves can persist in fully cosmological disks, linking internal dynamical processes to galaxy assembly and offering testable predictions for present and future surveys such as JWST and Roman.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25872" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resolved HII regions in NGC 253: Ionized gas structure and suggestions of a universal density-surface brightness relation</a><span class="id">[2510.25872]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the full-disk VLT-MUSE mosaic of NGC 253 to identify 2492 HII regions and study their resolved structure. With an average physical resolution of 17 pc, this is one of the largest samples of highly resolved spectrally mapped extragalactic HII regions. Regions of all luminosities exhibit a characteristic emission profile described by a double Gaussian with a marginally resolved or unresolved core with radius &lt;10 pc surrounded by a more extended halo of emission with radius 20-30 pc. Approximately 80% of the emission of a region originates from the halo component. As a result of this compact structure, the luminosity-radius relations for core and effective radii of HII regions depend sensitively on the adopted methodology. Only the isophotal radius yields a robust relationship in NGC 253, but this measurement has an ambiguous physical meaning. We invert the measured emission profiles to infer density profiles and find central densities of n_e = 10-100 cm-3. In the brightest regions, these agree well with densities inferred from the [SII]6716,30 doublet. The central density of HII regions correlates well with the surface brightness within the effective radius. We show that this same scaling relation applies to the recent MUSE+HST catalog for 19 nearby galaxies. We also discuss potential limitations, including completeness, impacts of background subtraction and spatial resolution, and the generality of our results when applied to other galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25876" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chemical separation of stellar populations: analytic solutions for chemical evolution models with metallicity-dependent yields</a><span class="id">[2510.25876]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar abundances of elements with production channels that are metallicity-dependent (most notably aluminium) have provided an empirical route for separating different Galactic components. We present 'single-zone' analytic solutions for the chemical evolution of galaxies when the stellar yields are metallicity-dependent. Our solutions assume a constant star formation efficiency, a constant mass-loading factor and that the yields are linearly dependent on the interstellar medium abundance (with the option of a saturation of the yields at high metallicity). We demonstrate how the metallicity dependence of the yields can be mathematically considered as a system-dependent delay time (approximately equal to the system's depletion time) that, when combined with system-independent delay times arising from stellar evolutionary channels, produces the separation of different systems based on their star formation efficiency and mass-loading factor. The utility of the models is highlighted through comparisons with data from the APOGEE spectroscopic survey. We provide a comprehensive discussion of the chemical evolution models in the [Al/Fe]-[Mg/Fe] plane, a diagnostic plane for the separation of in-situ and accreted Galactic components. Extensions of the models are presented, allowing for the modelling of more complex behaviours largely through the linear combination of the presented simpler solutions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A three-dimensional reconstruction of the interstellar magnetic field toward a star-forming region</a><span class="id">[2510.25879]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. The polarized thermal emission from interstellar dust offers a valuable tool for probing both the dust and the magnetic field in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, existing observations only yield the total amount of dust emission along the line of sight (LoS), with no information on its LoS distribution. Aims. We present a new method designed to give access to the LoS distribution of the dust emission, both in terms of intensity and polarization. Methods. We relied on three kinematic gas tracers (HI, 12CO, and 13CO emission lines) to identify the different clouds present along the LoS. We decomposed the measured intensity of the dust emission, $I_d$, into separate contributions from these clouds. We performed a similar decomposition of the measured Stokes parameters for linear polarization, $Q_d$ and $U_d$, to derive the polarization parameters of the different clouds, and from this we inferred the clouds' magnetic field orientations. Results. We applied our method to a $3~{\rm deg}^2$ region of the sky, centered on $(l,b) = (139°30',-3°16')$ and exhibiting signs of star formation activity. We found this region to be dominated by an extended and bright cloud with nearly horizontal magnetic field, as expected from the nearly vertical polarization angles measured by Planck. More importantly, we detected the presence of two smaller, depolarizing molecular clouds with very different magnetic field orientations in the plane of the sky ($\simeq 65°$ and $\simeq 45°$ from the horizontal). This is a novel and viable result, which cannot be directly read off the Planck polarization maps. Conclusions. The application of our method to the G139 region convincingly demonstrates the need to complement 2D polarization maps with 3D kinematic information when looking for reliable estimates of magnetic field orientations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Universality of the Relation Between Magnetic Fields and Star Formation in Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.25909]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The interstellar medium (ISM) is permeated by magnetic fields that affect gas dynamics and star formation. These fields correlate with supernova (SN)-driven turbulence, but whether the scaling is universal across galaxy properties, ISM phases, and energy budgets remains unclear. We quantify the dependence of magnetic fields on star formation activity including both regular and starburst galaxies. We analyse 19 spiral disks from the cosmological RTnsCRiMHD Azahar suite, deriving line-of-sight integrated maps to measure median magnetic-field strength ($B$), specific energies (thermal, turbulent, magnetic, and cosmic-ray), and star formation rate (SFR), star formation surface density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) and specific SFR (sSFR). We find an almost universal magnetic-field-SFR scaling with slope $\alpha \approx 0.2$-$0.3$ across galaxy mass and ISM phases. The $B$-$\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ slope ($\alpha \approx 1/3$) supports an SN-driven, turbulence-regulated origin. Neutral gas is generally turbulence-dominated and in near equipartition with magnetic energy for systems with sSFR $\gtrsim 0.1$ Gyr$^{-1}$ and SFR $\gtrsim 1$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The simulated trends match observations with similar slopes ($\alpha \approx 0.25$-$0.35$), indicating that SN-driven turbulence is the main amplification mechanism behind the near-universal $B$-SFR relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TRIShUL: Technique for Reconstructing magnetic Interstellar Structure Using starLight polarization</a><span class="id">[2510.25911]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel technique to decompose line-of-sight (LOS) stellar polarization as a function of distance, aimed at reconstructing three dimensional (3D) plane-of-sky (POS) magnetic structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). The method assumes that the observed polarization arises from discrete, thin dust layers located at varying distances along the LOS. Using a simple frequentist framework, it identifies structural changes in the distance-sorted cumulative Mahalanobis distance of Stokes parameters (q and u) to detect the locations of dust layers and estimate their associated physical properties (parallax and Stokes parameters) necessary to construct 3D maps. We benchmark the method using mock datasets representative of high-Galactic-latitude regions, incorporating realistic Gaia parallax uncertainties and polarization expected from the upcoming Pasiphae survey. Tests show that the method reliably recovers dust cloud distances and polarization properties when the polarization exceeds 0.1%, and the effective background-star fraction is greater than 10% in samples of about 345 stars. The dependence on background fraction decreases as the intrinsic polarization amplitude of the dust field increases. We apply our method to existing polarization data from two illustrative sightlines, one at intermediate-high Galactic latitude and one near the Galactic plane, with known tomographic solutions, finding excellent agreement with the literature and demonstrating its accuracy across both regions. Comparing with the BISP-1 approach, both methods effectively recover dust cloud properties, but our approach is prior-free and computationally more efficient in determining the optimal number of clouds along the LOS. These advantages make it flexible and broadly applicable for multi-layer dust cloud reconstruction for the upcoming era of large-scale stellar polarization surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Potential Thermal Profiles of The Third Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</a><span class="id">[2510.25945]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the thermal evolution of 3I/ATLAS, the third macroscopic interstellar object discovered on 2025 July 1. By comparing modeled thermal profiles with observations of volatile activity, it is possible to constrain bulk physical properties of a cometary nucleus. 3I/ATLAS is actively producing a variety of cometary volatiles. In this paper, we calculate one-dimensional thermal profiles of the third interstellar object 3I/ATLAS throughout its trajectory in an attempt to gain insight into its bulk properties based on measurements of its volatiles. Assuming a variety of typical comet and asteroid bulk geophysical properties such as heat capacities, densities, and conductivities, we calculate the radial thermal profile as a function of depth throughout the hyperbolic trajectory. The methods and code to generate the thermal profile are flexible for any hyperbolic or bound orbit. The thermal profiles are benchmarked to the nominal sublimation temperatures of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO, but are still applicable to any volatile. Comparison between the modeled surface temperatures and the observed onset of H$_2$O activity near 3 au indicates that surface temperatures exceeding $\sim$150 K can only be achieved if the albedo is below 0.2. We therefore set the upper limit on the albedo of 3I/ATLAS to be 0.2.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25950" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyman-$α$ radiation pressure regulates star formation efficiency</a><span class="id">[2510.25950]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Order-unity star formation efficiencies (SFE) in early galaxies may explain the overabundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at high redshift. Here we show that Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) radiation pressure limits the gas mass converted into stars, particularly in primordial environments. We develop a shell model including Ly$\alpha$ feedback, and validate it with one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. To account for Ly$\alpha$ resonant scattering, we adopt the most recent force multiplier fits, including the effect of Ly$\alpha$ photon destruction by dust grains. We find that, independently of their gas surface density $\Sigma_g$, clouds are disrupted on a timescale shorter than a free-fall time, and even before supernova explosions if $\Sigma_g \gtrsim 10^3\,M_{\odot}\ \rm pc^{-2}$. At $\log(Z/Z_{\odot}) = -2$, relevant for high-redshift galaxies, the SFE is $0.01 \lesssim \hat{\epsilon}_{*} \lesssim 0.66$ for $10^3 \lesssim\Sigma_g [M_{\odot}\ \rm pc^{-2}] \lesssim 10^5$. The SFE is even lower for decreasing metallicity. Near-unity SFEs are possible only for extreme surface densities, $\Sigma_{g} \gtrsim 10^5\;M_{\odot}\ \rm pc^{-2}$, and near-solar metallicities. We conclude that Ly$\alpha$ radiation pressure severely limits a possible extremely efficient, feedback-free phase of star formation in dense, metal-poor clouds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ram pressure shaping HVC droplets – FAST HI observations of HVC AC-III and theoretical interpretation</a><span class="id">[2510.26077]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>FAST HI observations reveal unprecedented internal structures of the high-velocity cloud AC-III, which is found to consist of several coherent subclumps (D1–D6) with nearly constant line widths of $\sim 20~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, while the global velocity spread ranges from $-220$ to $-180~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$. These subclumps exhibit parabolic morphologies, consistent with ram-pressure–confined droplets, with their heads tending to point toward the Galactic plane. A steady-state model reproduces both the morphology and the observed exponential density profiles. The tip density reaches $\sim 2~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, implying an ambient medium density of $\sim 10^{-3}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, in agreement with the Galactic warm ionized medium at a distance of $\sim 5$ kpc. Deviations from symmetric droplet shapes, along with internal patterns such as strip-like ridges, rings, and holes, indicate rich internal dynamics. In particular, the observations are consistent with fluid loops forming inside the droplets in response to interactions between neighboring subclumps. These loops can generate ring-like dynamic patterns and drive secondary turbulence, sustaining long-lived internal motions. An intermediate-velocity component ($-150$ to $-100~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) exhibits a shell-like morphology aligned with the head of AC-III, possibly shaped by pressure interactions mediated by the WIM. Overall, we suggest that HVC AC-III is entering the Galactic WIM layer and being sculpted by ram pressure into a droplet-like morphology, providing a valuable case for studying the structure formation, turbulence origin, and dynamic evolution of HVCs, as well as the physical properties of the ambient medium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion rates of stellar-mass compact objects embedded in AGN discs</a><span class="id">[2510.26111]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar-mass compact objects (COs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs are commonly assumed to accrete via Bondi or Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) prescriptions, neglecting gas angular momentum. We show that differential rotation in AGN discs can impart non-negligible angular momentum, in which case accretion proceeds through a viscous disc rather than Bondi/BHL flow. Our model provides a new framework estimating the CO accretion rate as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{CO} = \min\{\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis}, \dot{M}_\mathrm{BHL}\}$, where the viscous rate $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis}$ accounts for gas–CO relative motion decomposed into a local gradient term (due to differential rotation) and bulk motion (from differing orbital parameters). This rate can be expressed as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis} = \alpha \xi (r_\mathrm{H}/r_\mathrm{BHL})^3\dot{M}_\mathrm{BHL}$, where $\xi$ is a coefficient of order unity. It can also be approximately scaled to the global AGN accretion rate as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis} \propto \dot{M}_1$, with the scaling coefficients in both forms determined by the specific dynamical configuration. The accretion is viscosity-limited when $q &gt; [\alpha \xi(1+\mathcal{M}^2)^{3}/3]^{1/2} h^3$, where $q$ is the mass ratio between the CO and the supermassive black hole, $\alpha$ the viscosity parameter, $\mathcal{M}$ the Mach number of the bulk relative motion, and $h$ the aspect ratio of the AGN disc. In thin AGN discs this condition is satisfied for most stellar-mass or more massive COs. Our framework also naturally allows for the inclusion of established outflow corrections, thereby enabling a more realistic treatment of super-Eddington flows. Our formulation thus improves upon Bondi/BHL prescriptions and offers a more physically motivated basis for studying CO evolution in AGN environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotation Measure Analysis of Shocks and Sloshing Fronts in a Galaxy Cluster Merger Simulation</a><span class="id">[2510.26218]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations of the Fornax cluster show depolarization signatures on megaparsec scales, which may be associated with shocks and/or sloshing motions during cluster merger and/or in-fall. To investigate the possible reasons behind the depolarization, we carry out analytical and full polarized radiative transfer (PRT) calculations of radio point sources behind a merging galaxy cluster simulated using the FLASH code. With uniform background light, we analyzed the rotation measure (RM) morphology near the shock front and the cluster center, where sloshing cold fronts appear. For the shock scenario, we find a local RM enhancement by $\sim56\%$ behind the shock front on megaparsec scales, arising from the compression of hot gas and magnetic field lines. Behind the sloshing cold front, the cluster center shows decrement in RM magnitude by $\sim23.3\%$, as a result of the cancellation effect of randomly-oriented magnetic fields induced by sloshing-driven turbulence. We find that beam depolarization increases behind shock fronts and across sloshing cold fronts, indicating enhanced magnetic field fluctuations across the plane of the sky in both scenarios. By fully accounting for all radiative transfer coefficients in the PRT calculations, the uniform background light becomes more depolarized near the cluster center, with the effect growing more pronounced as background intensity decreases. This suggests that synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation of the intracluster medium can significantly influence the polarization of background sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The SOMA MM Survey.

We investigate the chemical content of 22 well-studied massive protostars from the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation survey, aiming to identify correlations between chemical and physical parameters. We analyzed Atacama Compact Array and Total Power 1.3 mm (Band 6) data, deriving column densities, line widths, and excitation temperatures of multiple molecular species by modeling detected lines under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) using MADCUBA. Spectra show 35 species, from simple molecules (e.g., CO, SO, SiO) to complex organic molecules (COMs), with seven sources exhibiting high chemical complexity (&gt; 100 transitions). Average excitation temperatures vary across the sample: $T_\text{ex}&gt;100~\text{K}$ for eight sources, $50-100~\text{K}$ for four, and $T_\text{ex} &lt; 50~\text{K}$ for the remainder. Sources with $T_\text{ex} &lt; 50~\text{K}$ trace lukewarm, chemically simple gas, while those with $T_\text{ex}&gt;100~\text{K}$ indicate the presence of typical hot cores where thermal desorption is efficient, resulting in line-rich spectra. Comparing these chemical properties with the bolometric luminosity to envelope mass ratio ($L_\text{bol}/M_\text{env}$), an evolutionary tracer, we find tentative correlations with line widths, excitation temperature, and column densities. These data provide important constraints for chemodynamical models of massive protostellar cores.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The role of black hole feedback on galaxy star formation and the degeneracy with halo quenching</a><span class="id">[2510.26305]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The interplay between the accretion of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the stellar mass growth of the host galaxies is still a matter of hot debate. The accretion of the SMBHs is expected to release energy under the form of AGNs. This energy is believed to impact the star formation activity and contribute to the quenching of galaxies. Here, we address this key unsolved issue with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE. In DECODE, we grow galaxies with their SFR linked to halo accretion rate distributions via abundance matching. SMBHs are evolved following the stellar mass growth of their host galaxies by assigning an accretion rate at each redshift from the empirical Eddington ratio distributions and duty cycles. We test the assumption that galaxies permanently quench when their central SMBHs approach the limit imposed by the observed $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ relation, as a proxy of SMBH disruptive feedback. We find that simply imposing the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ condition is sufficient to generate a fraction of quenched galaxies consistent with current data, including the newest ones from Euclid. In addition, our minimal, data-driven model, also predicts SMBH scaling relations consistent in slope and normalisation with those observed, and an $M_{\rm BH} - M_\star$ relation weakly evolving with redshift. The model also naturally generates SMBH accretion rates peaking within 1 Gyr of their host SFHs. We note that all the main predictions on galaxy quenched fractions and SMBH growth histories and scaling relations are degenerate with those expected in a halo quenching model. The comprehensive data-driven model presented in this work represents an invaluable tool to investigate SMBH demography across time and environments in an accurate, physically motivated manner, ideally suited to rapidly explore the implications from large surveys, such as Euclid and Rubin-LSST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Evidence for Galactic Cosmic Ray Processing</a><span class="id">[2510.26308]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spectral observations of 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) with JWST/NIRSpec and SPHEREx reveal an extreme CO2 enrichment (CO2/H2O = 7.6+-0.3) that is 4.5 sigma above solar system comet trends and among the highest ever recorded. This unprecedented composition, combined with substantial absolute CO levels (CO/H2O = 1.65+-0.09) and red spectral slopes, provides direct evidence for galactic cosmic ray (GCR) processing of the outer layers of the interstellar comet nucleus. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that GCR irradiation efficiently converts CO to CO2 while synthesizing organic-rich crusts, suggesting that the outer layers of 3I/ATLAS consist of irradiated material which properties are consistent with the observed composition of 3I/ATLAS coma and with its observed spectral reddening. Estimates of the erosion rate of 3I/ATLAS indicate that current outgassing samples the GCR-processed zone only (depth  15-20 m), never reaching pristine interior material. Outgassing of pristine material after perihelion remains possible, though it is considered unlikely. This represents a paradigm shift: long-residence interstellar objects primarily reveal GCR-processed material rather than pristine material representative of their primordial formation environments. With 3I/ATLAS approaching perihelion in October 2025, immediate follow-up observations are critical to confirm this interpretation and establish GCR processing as a fundamental evolutionary pathway for interstellar objects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shock-driven heating in the circumnuclear star-forming regions of NGC 7582: Insights from JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS spectroscopy</a><span class="id">[2510.26321]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present combined JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS integral field spectroscopy data of the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of the highly dust obscured Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7582, which is part of the sample of AGN in the Galaxy Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). Spatially resolved analysis of the pure rotational H$_2$ lines (S(1)-S(7)) reveals a characteristic power-law temperature distribution in different apertures, with the two prominent southern star-forming regions exhibiting unexpectedly high molecular gas temperatures, comparable to those in the AGN powered nuclear region. We investigate potential heating mechanisms including direct AGN photoionisation, UV fluorescent excitation from young star clusters, and shock excitation. We find that shock heating gives the most plausible explanation, consistent with multiple near- and mid-IR tracers and diagnostics. Using photoionisation models from the PhotoDissociation Region Toolbox, we quantify the ISM conditions in the different regions, determining that the southern star-forming regions have a high density ($n_H \sim 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) and are irradiated by a moderate UV radiation field ($G_0 \sim 10^{3}$ Habing). Fitting a suite of Paris-Durham shock models to the rotational H$_2$ lines, as well as rovibrational 1-0 S(1), 1-0 S(2), and 2-1 S(1) H$_2$ emission lines, we find that a slow ($v_s \sim 10$ km/s) C-type shock is likely responsible for the elevated temperatures. Our analysis loosely favours local starburst activity as the driver of the shocks and circumnuclear gas dynamics in NGC 7582, though the possibility of an AGN jet contribution cannot be excluded.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing the evolution of brightest galaxies and diffuse light in galaxy groups</a><span class="id">[2510.26329]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a suite of 100 cosmologically motivated, controlled N-body simulations designed to advance the understanding of the role of purely gravitational dynamics in the early formation of low-mass galaxy groups (  1-5 x 10^13 M_sun). In this work, we investigate the temporal evolution of key indicators of dynamical relaxation, with particular emphasis on the secular growth of the diffuse intragroup light (IGL), the four major group galaxies, and the mass distributions of their progenitors. We also assess the diagnostic power of several magnitude gaps between top-ranked galaxies as proxies for dynamical age. As in our previous study, we compare outcomes from three group classes defined by the number of brightest group galaxies (BGGs) present at the end of the simulations. The early assembly of galaxy groups is consistent with a stochastic Poisson process at an approximately constant merger rate. Various dynamical diagnostics - including galaxy pairwise separations, velocity dispersions, and the offset of the first-ranked galaxy from the group barycentre - indicate that single-BGG groups evolve more rapidly towards virialisation than double- and especially non-BGG systems. We further find that first-ranked group members and the IGL, follow distinct growth histories, with the IGL assembled from a more numerous and systematically lower-mass population than the central object. This distinction is particularly pronounced in non-BGG systems, where about one third of the IGL originates from small galaxies, each contributing less than 5% to this component. Among the tested magnitude gaps, the difference between the first- and fourth-ranked galaxies, $\Delta M4-1$, proves a more robust indicator of dynamical age for low-mass groups than the conventional $\Delta M2-1$ gap. The $\Delta M5-1$ and $\Delta M6-1$ gaps also perform well and may be preferable in certain contexts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oMEGACat.

Utilizing the oMEGACat combined astro-photometric and spectroscopic dataset we parse 14 subpopulations from the upper red-giant branch to below the main-sequence turnoff. We combine our results with previous works to estimate the age and age spread of each population. We find that the chemically enhanced (P2) populations are all  1 Gyr younger ( 11.6 Gyr old) and have significantly higher intrinsic age spreads (0.6 Gyr) than the primordial (P1) populations ( 12.6 Gyr old, 0.3 Gyr spread), with the intermediate (Im) populations falling in between the two. Additionally, we connect for the first time the Chromosome Diagram to the two-stream age-metallicity relation, allowing us to link the P1 and P2 stars to the distinct star formation tracks, proposed to be in-situ and ex-situ contributions to the cluster's assembly. Our results are consistent with some suggested formation models and rule out others but no current model can explain all observed features of the subpopulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XRISM Observations of The Prototypical Cold Front in Abell 3667</a><span class="id">[2510.26405]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the merging galaxy cluster Abell 3667 with \textit{XRISM}/Resolve. Two observations, targeting the cluster X-ray core and the prototypical cold front, were performed with exposures of 105 ks and 276 ks, respectively. We find that the gas in the core is blueshifted by $v_z\sim-200$ km s$^{-1}$ relative to the brightest cluster galaxy, while the low-entropy gas inside the cold front is redshifted by $v_z\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$. As one moves further off-center across the front, the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity changes significantly, by $\Delta v_z=535^{+167}_{-154}$ km s$^{-1}$, back to the value similar to that in the core. There are no significant LoS velocity gradients perpendicular to the cluster symmetry axis. These features suggest that the gas forming the cold front is flowing in the plane oriented along the LoS, supporting an offset merger scenario in which the main cluster has passed in front of the subcluster and induced rotation of the core gas in the plane perpendicular to the sky. The region just inside the front exhibits the largest LoS velocity dispersion seen across two pointings, $\sigma_z\sim420$ km s$^{-1}$, which can be interpreted as a developing turbulence or a projection of the LoS velocity shear within the front. The large LoS velocity jump across the cold front, combined with the lack of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the surface of the front, suggests some mechanism to suppress it. For example, a magnetic field with $B&gt;5\,\mu$G is required if the cold front is stabilized by magnetic draping.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26435" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joint Analysis of Optical, Near-Infrared And Mid-Infrared Variability of 4 Quasars at Redshift &lt; 1</a><span class="id">[2510.26435]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Amid rapid advances in time-domain astronomy, multi-wavelength (e.g., optical and infrared) time-domain studies of quasars remain scarce.

For these objects, we obtain complementary optical light curves from Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and W1-band light curves from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We perform correlation analysis to study the time lags between different bands, which may be directly related to the size of the dust torus. After correcting for infrared flux contamination from the accretion disk and accounting for the redshift effect, we measure the Ks-optical and W1-optical lags for the targets VVV J1834-2925 and VVV J1845-2426. Using typical sublimation temperatures and reverberation time lags, we obtain a graphite-to-silicate grain size ratio of $\frac{a_C}{a_S}\sim$ 0.4. Through SED fitting, we determine the luminosities of these quasars and find that their dust torus sizes follow the established $R_{dust}-L_{AGN}$ relation reported in previous studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimizing Long-term Variability of AGN Light Curves. I. A Case Study with ZTF Observations in the EGS Field</a><span class="id">[2510.26436]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Optical variability is a key observational probe for studying the accretion dynamics and central engine physics of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The quality and completeness of light curves have a direct impact on variability studies, particularly for faint AGNs and high-redshift AGNs. To improve the quality of long-term light curves for AGNs, we bin and stack multi-epoch images balancing the image depths and temporal resolution. As a case study, we apply this method to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field, where the overlapping region covers an area of about 370 arcmin$^2$ and includes $g$-band and $r$-band data taken from March 2018 to December 2024. The co-added images are approximately 2.0 to 2.5 magnitudes deeper than the ZTF single-epoch images. With co-added images, we construct light curves for 73 AGNs in the EGS field. Compared to the traditional ZTF light curves, our light curves maintain consistent long-term variability trends but with higher photometric precision. Furthermore, this method can help detect AGNs with weak variability which are missed from the traditional ZTF data due to the noisy light curves or below the detection limit in ZTF's single-epoch exposure. Among the 73 AGNs, the majority exhibit a bluer-when-brighter (BWB) trend on long-term timescales, which is consistent with previous studies. This work offers insights for optimizing AGN light curves in both current and upcoming all-sky time-domain surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26445" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neon is an inhibitor of CO hydrogenation in pre-stellar core conditions</a><span class="id">[2510.26445]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neon (Ne) is the fifth most abundant element in the Universe. Because it is chemically inert, it has never been considered in astrochemical models that studied molecular evolution. In the cold dark environments of pre-stellar cores, where the temperatures are below 10 K, Ne can condense onto the surface of interstellar grains. We investigated the effect of Ne on the production of formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH) through carbon monoxide (CO) hydrogenation on different cold surfaces. We highlight its role in conditions corresponding to pre-stellar cores. In an ultra-high vacuum system, we conducted two types of experiments. The first experiment involved the co-deposition of CO and H atoms with or without Ne. The second experiment involved depositing a monolayer of CO and separately a monolayer of Ne (or vice versa), followed by bombarding the layers with hydrogen atoms. Additionally, we used a gas-grain chemical code to simulate a pre-stellar core and determine where Ne can affect the chemistry. The presence of Ne on the surface significantly inhibits CO hydrogenation at temperatures below 12 K. In the co-deposition experiments, we observed a 38% decrease in the H$_2$CO production at 11 K when the quantity of Ne in the mixture was lower than a monolayer. At 10 K and with one monolayer in the mixture, the production decreased to 77%, and it reached 91% for a few monolayers of Ne in the mixture at 9 K. While the decrease in CH$_3$OH formation is still notable, it is less pronounced: 43% at 11 K, 61% at 10 K, and 77% at 9 K. Experiments with stacked layers revealed that the CO layer decay varies slightly when the Ne layer is positioned above or below it. This observation indicates that Ne and CO create a mixture in which Ne can diffuse and stabilize at the surface, which isolates CO molecules from the accreting H atoms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26450" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The rotation speed of the spiral pattern in the Milky Way galaxy</a><span class="id">[2510.26450]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For a sample of masers, the basic kinematic equations were solved by including the Galactic rotation parameters and the peculiar velocity of the Sun as the unknown variables.

The simulations include detailed modeling of star formation, chemical enrichment, and supernova feedback using the \textsc{CELib} and \textsc{grackle} libraries, achieving baryonic resolutions of $\sim2\times10^3\,M_\odot$. Our study focuses on how assembly history governs the structural and kinematic diversity of dwarf galaxies within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. The simulated galaxies reproduce the observed stellar-to-halo mass, mass–metallicity, and size–mass relations, yielding stellar masses of $10^6-10^8\,M_\odot$ and metallicities consistent with those of Local Group dwarf galaxies. The galaxies display a broad range of rotational support, where gas is generally more rotationally supported than stars. Differences in morphology and kinematics primarily reflect variations in halo assembly timescales and merger activity. Early-assembling, high-concentration halos form stars efficiently and become gas-poor by $z=0$, while late-assembling, low-concentration halos remain gas-rich due to delayed star formation and rejuvenated gas accretion. We identify a clear anti-correlation between rotational support and the cumulative merger mass fraction, demonstrating that dynamical heating by mergers is the dominant factor shaping kinematic diversity. In some cases, late-time mergers induce the formation of extended gas disks by delivering fresh gas and angular momentum. These results demonstrate that assembly history, rather than halo mass alone, critically shapes the present-day kinematic and morphological diversity of dwarf galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26570" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The magnetic fields of the dusty nuclei and molecular outflows of Arp 220</a><span class="id">[2510.26570]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy mergers trigger starburst activity and galactic outflows that enrich the circumgalactic medium, profoundly impacting galaxy evolution.

We perform ALMA $870~\mu$m dust continuum polarization and CO(3-2) emission line polarization, and report the first detection of CO(3-2) emission line polarization through the Goldreich-Kylafis effect in an outflow. Dust polarization shows that Arp 220 E has a spiral-like B-field on the disk with a linear polarization fraction of $0.4\pm0.1$% that may produce the detected circular polarization passing through foreground aligned dust grains. Arp 220 W reveals a B-field parallel to the red- and blueshifted outflows in both the dust and emission line polarization maps. The outflows show a dust polarization of $0.2$%, while the CO(3-2) emission line polarization is $1-2$% at $4-6\sigma$ significance across independent velocity channels. A highly polarized ($3-5$%) dusty bridge has a B-field orientation of $\sim110^{\circ}$ connecting both nuclei. Mean B-field strengths of $1.6$ mG and $8$ mG for the blue- and redshifted outflows, respectively, are estimated. These strong B-fields are attributed to amplification by compression in nuclear clouds and supernova remnants. This amplified B-field is likely sustained by the turbulent kinetic energy in the outflow and may be critical in directing the transport of metals and cosmic rays into the circumgalactic medium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26625" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The chemical DNA of the Magellanic Clouds IV.

We measure [Eu/Fe] abundance ratios in 209 giant stars that are confirmed members of the SMC, providing the first extensive dataset of Eu abundances in this galaxy across its full metallicity range, spanning more than 1.5 dex. We compare Eu abundances with those of Mg and Ba to evaluate the efficiency of the r-process relative to $\alpha$-capture and s-process nucleosynthesis. The SMC shows enhanced [Eu/Fe] values at all metallicities (comparable with the values measured in the Milky Way), with a clear decline as [Fe/H] increases (from $\sim$ -1.75 dex to $\sim$ -0.5 dex), consistent with the onset of Type Ia supernovae. In contrast, [Eu/Mg] is enhanced by about +0.5 dex at all [Fe/H], significantly above the values observed in Milky Way stars, where [Eu/Mg] remains close to solar, reflecting comparable production of r-process and $\alpha$-capture elements. Moreover, [Ba/Eu] increases with metallicity, beginning at [Fe/H] $\approx$ -1.5 dex, namely at a lower metallicity with respect to the Milky Way, where [Ba/Eu] starts to increase around [Fe/H] $\approx$ -1 dex. Our findings suggest the SMC has a higher production of Eu (with respect to the $\alpha$-elements) than the Milky Way but in line with what observed in other dwarf systems within the Local Group. We confirm that galaxies with star formation efficiencies lower than the Milky Way have high [Eu/$\alpha$], probably indicating a stronger efficiency of the delayed sources of r-process at low metallicities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal disruption events with SPH-EXA: resolving the return of the stream</a><span class="id">[2510.26663]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In a tidal disruption event (TDE), a star is disrupted by the tidal field of a massive black hole, creating a debris stream that returns to the black hole, forms an accretion flow, and powers a luminous flare. Over the last few decades, several numerical studies have concluded that shock-induced dissipation occurs as the stream returns to pericentre (i.e., pre-self-intersection), resulting in efficient circularisation of the debris. However, the efficacy of these shocks is the subject of intense debate. We present high-resolution simulations (up to 10^10 particles) of the disruption of a solar-like star by a 10^6M_sun black hole with the new, GPU-based, smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code SPH-EXA, including the relativistic apsidal precession of the stellar debris orbits; our simulations run from initial disruption to the moment of stream self-intersection. With 10^8 particles - corresponding to the highest-resolution SPH simulations of TDEs in the pre-existing literature - we find significant, in-plane spreading of the debris as the stream returns through pericenter, in line with previous works that suggested this is a significant source of dissipation and luminous emission. However, with increasing resolution this effect is dramatically diminished, and with 10^10 particles there is effectively no change between the incoming and the outgoing stream widths. Our results demonstrate that the paradigm of significant dissipation of kinetic energy during pericentre passage is incorrect, and instead it is likely that debris circularisation is mediated by the originally proposed, stream-stream collision scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ODYSSEUS Survey.

However, the spatial scales over which the initial conditions can exert a significant influence are not well constrained. We report the first evidence for parsec-scale spatial correlations of stellar magnetospheric inclinations ($i_{\rm mag}$), observed in the Lupus low-mass star forming region. Applying consensus clustering with a hierarchical density-based clustering algorithm, we demonstrate that the detected spatial dependencies are stable against perturbations by measurement uncertainties. The $i_{\rm mag}$ correlation scales are on the order of  3 pc, which aligns with the typical scales of the Lupus molecular cloud filaments. Our results reveal a connection between large-scale forces – in the form of expanding shells from the Upper Scorpius and Upper-Centaurus-Lupus regions – and sub-au scale system configurations. We find that Lupus has a non-uniform $i_{\rm mag}$ distribution and suggest that this results from the preferential elongation of protostellar cores along filamentary axes. Non-uniformity would have significant implications for exoplanet occurrence rate calculations, so future work should explore the longevity of these biases driven by the star-cloud connection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26716" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Dwarf Galaxy Database II: Connections between Host Galaxy Properties and Black Hole Accretion Signatures</a><span class="id">[2510.26716]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the connection between accretion signatures and host galaxy properties in the context of how active dwarf galaxies are identified. We use the database constructed in Wasleske &amp; Baldassare (2024) which contains dwarf galaxies that were selected as active galaxies by optical spectroscopy, infrared colors, X-ray brightness, and photometric variability. Multi-wavelength archival data was used to consistently apply all of these methods to every galaxy within this compiled set. The cross application of these methods resulted in a diversity of sub-populations identified as active by some set of these techniques. In this paper, we estimate host galaxy properties from spectral energy distribution models. We connect the active galactic nuclei (AGN) signatures to our estimated host galaxies' properties using statistical dimensionality reduction methods. We find that dwarf AGN selected by infrared colors are the most distinct population, with the highest star formation rates and lowest stellar masses. We also find some other key population differences, such as the broad line AGN having significantly higher AGN luminosities. X-ray and variability selected AGN have higher average star formation rates than those selected with optical narrow line spectroscopic diagrams.

By fitting up to three three epochs per source with a fully relativistic disk model, we show that many system properties can be reliably recovered, including importantly the black hole mass ($M_{\bullet}$). These accretion-based $M_{\bullet}$ values, which in this sample span nearly three orders of magnitude, are consistent with galactic scaling relations but are significantly more precise (68\% credible interval $ &lt; \pm 0.3$ dex) and physically motivated. Expected accretion scaling relations (e.g., $L_{Bol}^{ disk} / L_{Edd} \propto T_p^4 \propto M_{\bullet}^{-1}$), TDE-specific physics correlations ($L_{plat} \propto M_{\bullet}^{2/3}$ and $R_{out}/r_g \propto M_{\bullet}^{-2/3}$) and black hole-host galaxy correlations ($M_{\bullet}$-$M_{\star}$ and $M_{\bullet}$-$\sigma_{\star}$) naturally emerge from the data and, for the first time, are self-consistently extended into the intermediate-mass (IMBH, $M_{\bullet} &lt; 10^{5}$) regime. We discuss the implications of these results for TDE physics and modeling. We also review and discuss different methods for $M_{\bullet}$ inference in TDEs, and find that approaches based on physical models of the early-time UV/optical emission are not able to recover (at a statistically significant level) black hole-host galaxy scalings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining binary mergers in AGN disks using the non-observation of lensed gravitational waves</a><span class="id">[2408.13144]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dense and dynamic environments within active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks may serve as prolific birthplaces for binary black holes (BBHs) and one possible origin for some of the BBHs detected by gravitational-wave (GW) observatories. We show that a considerable fraction of the BBH in AGN disks will be strongly lensed by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Thus, the non-observation of lensed GW signals can be used to constrain the fraction of BBH binaries residing in AGN disks. The non-detection of lensing with current ${\cal O}(100)$ detections will be sufficient to start placing constraints on the fraction of BBHs living within accretion disks near the SMBH. In the next-generation detectors era, with ${\cal O}(10^5)$ BBH observations and no lensed events, we will be able to rule out most migration traps as dominant birthplaces of BBH mergers; moreover, we will be able to constrain the minimum size of the accretion disk. On the other hand, should AGNs constitute a major formation channel, lensed events from AGNs will become prominent in the future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timescales of Quasar Accretion Discs from Low to High Black Hole Masses and a Turnover at the High Mass End</a><span class="id">[2411.02759]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Characteristic time scales in the stochastic UV-optical variability of quasars may depend on the mass of their black holes, $M_{\rm BH}$, as much as physical timescales in their accretion discs do. We calculate emission-weighted mean radii, $R_{\rm mean}$, and orbital timescales, $t_{\rm mean}$, of standard thin disc models for emission wavelengths $\lambda$ from 1000 to 10000 AA, $M_{\rm BH}$ from $10^6$ to $10^{11}$ solar masses, and Eddington ratios from 0.01 to 1. At low $M_{\rm BH}$, we find the textbook behaviour of $t_{\rm mean}\propto M_{\rm BH}^{-1/2}$ alongside $R_{\rm mean} \approx \mathrm{const}$, but toward higher masses the growing event horizon imposes $R_{\rm mean} \propto M_{\rm BH}$ and thus a turnover into $t_{\rm mean}\propto M_{\rm BH}$. For quasars of $\log L_{\rm bol}=47$, the turnover mass, where $t_{\rm mean}$ starts rising is $M_{\rm BH}\approx 9.5$, which means that the turnover in $t_{\rm mean}$ is well within the range of high-luminosity quasar samples, whose variability time scales might thus show little mass dependence.

EELG1002 has record-breaking rest-frame [O{\sc iii}]+H$\beta$ EW $\sim3100-3700$Å; $\sim32-36\times$ higher than typical $z \sim 0.8$ [O{\sc iii}] emitters with similar stellar mass and higher than typical $z &gt; 5$ galaxies.

Among the proposed interpretations, such excess has been explained by negligible dust attenuation conditions following radiation-driven outflows launched by young stars when a galaxy goes through a super-Eddington phase. Dust opacity decreases the classical Eddington luminosity by a (boost) factor $A$, thus favoring the driving of outflows by stellar radiation in compact, initially dusty galaxies. Here, we compute $A$ as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, gas fraction, galaxy size, and metallicity (a total of 8 parameters). We find that the main dependence is on metallicity and, for the fiducial model, $A \sim 1800(Z/Z_\odot)/(1+N_{\rm H}/10^{23.5}\, {\rm cm^2})$. We apply such results to 20 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$ and evaluate their modified Eddington ratio. We predict that three galaxies are in the outflow phase. Their outflows have relatively low velocities ($60 -100 \,{\rm km\ s^{-1}}$), implying that they are unlikely to escape from the system. For the remaining 17 galaxies that are not currently in the outflow phase, we calculate the past evolution of the modified Eddington ratio from their star formation history. We find that 15 of them experienced an outflow phase prior to observation during which they effectively displaced their dust to larger radii. Thus, dusty outflows driven by stellar radiation appear to contribute to the observed bright UV galaxies at $z &gt; 10$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COSMOS Spectroscopic Redshift Compilation (First Data Release): 488k Redshifts Encompassing Two Decades of Spectroscopy</a><span class="id">[2503.00120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the COSMOS Spectroscopic Redshift Compilation encompassing   20 years of spectroscopic redshifts within a 10 deg$^2$ area centered on the 2 deg$^2$ COSMOS legacy field.

Rest-frame $NUVrJ$ colors and SFR – stellar mass correlations show the compilation primarily contains low- to intermediate-mass star-forming and massive, quiescent galaxies at $z &lt; 1.25$ and mostly low-mass bursty star-forming galaxies at $z &gt; 2$. Sources in the compilation cover a diverse range of environments, including protoclusters such as “Hyperion”. The full compilation is 50\% spectroscopically complete by $i \sim 23.4$ and $K_s \sim 21.6$ mag; however, this is redshift dependent. Spatially, the compilation is $&gt;50$\% ($&gt;30$\%) complete within the central (outer) region limited to $i &lt; 24$ mag and $K_s &lt; 22.5$ mag, separately. We demonstrate how the compilation can be used to validate photometric redshifts and investigate calibration metrics. By training self-organizing maps on COSMOS2020/Classic and projecting the compilation onto it, we find key galaxy subpopulations that currently lack spectroscopic coverage including $z &lt; 1$ intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies and low-/intermediate-mass bursty star-forming galaxies, $z \sim 2$ massive quiescent galaxies, and $z &gt; 3$ massive star-forming galaxies. This highlights how combining self-organizing maps with our compilation can provide guidance for future spectroscopic observations to get a complete spectroscopic view of galaxy populations.

However, the small-scale physics governing ionizing photon sinks - particularly the interplay between recombinations, photon propagation, and self-shielded regions - remains poorly understood. Accurately modeling these processes requires a framework that self-consistently links ionizing emissivity, the clumping factor, mean free path, and photoionization rate. In this work, we extend the photon-conserving semi-numerical framework, SCRIPT, by introducing a self-consistent sub-grid model that dynamically connects these quantities to the underlying density field, enabling a more realistic treatment of inhomogeneous recombinations and photon sinks. We validate our model against a comprehensive set of observational constraints, including the UV luminosity function from HST and JWST, CMB optical depth from Planck, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements of the IGM temperature, photoionization rate, and mean free path. Our fiducial model also successfully reproduces Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity fluctuations, reinforcing its ability to capture large-scale inhomogeneities in the reionization process. Notably, we demonstrate that traditionally independent parameters, such as the clumping factor and mean free path, are strongly correlated, with implications for the timing, morphology, and thermal evolution of reionization. Looking ahead, we will extend this framework to include machine learning-based parameter inference. With upcoming 21cm experiments poised to provide unprecedented insights, SCRIPT offers a powerful computational tool for interpreting high-redshift observations and refining our understanding of the last major phase transition in the universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03508" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identifying Astrophysical Anomalies in 99.6 Million Cutouts from the Hubble Legacy Archive Using AnomalyMatch</a><span class="id">[2505.03508]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Astronomical archives contain vast quantities of unexplored data that potentially harbour rare and scientifically valuable cosmic phenomena.

BBHs are often assumed to form at migration traps, i.e. radial locations where the Type I migration of embedded stellar-mass black holes (BHs) transitions from outwards to inwards. In this work, we test this assumption by explicitly simulating the radial migration of BH pairs in AGN disks under different torque prescriptions, including thermal effects and the switch to Type II migration. We map where and when binaries form as a function of supermassive BH (SMBH) mass, disk viscosity, and migrating BH mass. We find that, for SMBH masses below $10^8 M_\odot$, the majority of pair-up events occur near migration traps ($\gtrsim 80\%$). In contrast, for higher SMBH masses, differential migration dominates and off-trap pair-ups can prevail. Certain disk configurations (e.g., $\alpha = 0.01$, $M_\bullet &lt; 10^6 M_\odot$) present a significant overdensity of pair-ups even in the absence of traps due to traffic-jam accumulations where the gamma profile changes slope sharply. We also investigate hierarchical BBH formation, showing that higher-generation pair-ups cluster more tightly around trap or traffic-jam radii. Our results provide realistic prescriptions for BBH pair-up locations and timescales, highlighting the limitations of assuming fixed BBH formation sites.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDSS-V LVM: Detectability of Wolf-Rayet stars and their He II ionizing flux in low-metallicity environments I.

Its proximity and low reddening has enabled us to detect its Wolf-Rayet (WR) star population with 12 known objects. Quantitative spectroscopy of the stars revealed half of these WR stars to be strong sources of He ii ionizing flux, but the average metallicity of the SMC is below where WR bumps are usually detected in integrated galaxy spectra showing nebular He ii emission. Utilizing the Local Volume Mapper (LVM), we investigate regions around the six SMC WN3h stars, whose winds are thin enough to avoid He recombination and allow photons with &gt; 54 eV to escape. Focusing on He ii 4686 Å, we show that the broad stellar wind component, the strongest optical diagnostic of the WN3h stars, is diluted within 24 pc in the integrated light from LVM, making the WR stars hard to detect in low-metallicity integrated regions. In addition, we compare the He ii ionizing flux from LVM with the values inferred from the stellar atmosphere code PoWR and find that the nebular emission around them only in some cases reflects the high amounts emitted by the stars. We conclude that early-type WN stars with comparably weak winds are viable sources to produce the observed He ii ionizing flux in low-metallicity galaxies. The easy dilution of the stellar signatures can explain the rareness of WR bump detections at 12 + log O/H &lt; 8.0, while at the same time providing major candidates for the observed excess of nebular He ii emission. This constitutes a challenge for population synthesis models across all redshifts as the evolutionary path towards this observed WR population at low metallicity remains enigmatic.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AGN-heated dust revealed in &quot;Little Red Dots&quot;</a><span class="id">[2509.07100]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a puzzling population of extragalactic sources whose origin is highly debated. In this work, we perform a comprehensive stacking analysis of NIRCam, MIRI and ALMA images of a large and homogeneously-selected sample of LRDs from multiple JWST Legacy fields. We report clear evidence for hot-dust emission in the median stacked spectral energy distribution (SED), featuring a rising near-infrared continuum up to rest-frame $\lambda_{\rm rest}$$\sim$ 3$\mu$m, which is best explained by a standard dusty AGN structure. Although LRDs are likely a heterogeneous population, our findings suggest that most ($\gtrsim$50\%) LRDs show AGN-heated dust emission, regardless of whether the Optical/Ultraviolet (UV) continuum is stellar or AGN-dominated. In either case, the best-fit dusty-AGN SED, combined with the lack of X-ray detection in the deep Chandra stacks, suggests that Compton-thick ($N_{\rm H}$$&gt;$3$\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius ($R$$_{\rm sub}$$\sim$0.1 pc). Therefore, we argue that AGN-heated dust does not directly obscure either the Optical/UV continuum or the broad-line region emission, in order to explain the observed blue UV slopes and prominent Balmer features. While a gas-dust displacement is in line with several models, the formation scenario (in-situ or ex-situ) of this pre-enriched hot dust remains unclear.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Binary-lens Microlensing Degeneracy: Impact on Planetary Sensitivity and Mass-ratio Function</a><span class="id">[2509.16191]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational microlensing is a unique method for discovering cold planets across a broad mass range. Reliable statistics of the microlensing planets require accurate sensitivity estimates. However, the impact of the degeneracies in binary-lens single-source (2L1S) models that affect many actual planet detections is often omitted in sensitivity estimates, leading to potential self-inconsistency of the statistics studies. In this work, we evaluate the effect of the 2L1S degeneracies on planetary sensitivity by simulating a series of typical microlensing events and comprehensively replicating a realistic planet detection pipeline, including the anomaly identification, global 2L1S model search, and degenerate model comparison. We find that for a pure-survey statistical sample, the 2L1S degeneracies reduce the overall planetary sensitivity by $5\sim10\%$, with the effect increasing at higher planet-host mass ratios. This bias leads to an underestimation of planet occurrence rates and a flattening of the inferred mass-ratio function slope. This effect will be critical for upcoming space-based microlensing surveys like the Roman or Earth 2.0 missions, which are expected to discover $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ planets.

This thesis builds a deep learning pipeline for radio pulsar candidate selection that fuses array-derived features with image diagnostics. From approximately 500 GB of Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data, raw voltages are converted to filterbanks (SIGPROC), then de-dispersed and folded across trial dispersion measures (PRESTO) to produce approximately 32,000 candidates. Each candidate yields four diagnostics–summed profile, time vs. phase, subbands vs. phase, and DM curve–represented as arrays and images. A baseline stacked model (ANNs for arrays + CNNs for images with logistic-regression fusion) reaches 68% accuracy. We then refine the CNN architecture and training (regularization, learning-rate scheduling, max-norm constraints) and mitigate class imbalance via targeted augmentation, including a GAN-based generator for the minority class. The enhanced CNN attains 87% accuracy; the final GAN+CNN system achieves 94% accuracy with balanced precision and recall on a held-out test set, while remaining lightweight enough for near–real-time triage. The results show that combining array and image channels improves separability over image-only approaches, and that modest generative augmentation substantially boosts minority (pulsar) recall.

We demonstrate the power of \ampere\ using a number of simple models, including inferring the posterior mineralogy of circumstellar dust using a Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer model. {\sc ampere}\ reproduces the input parameters well in all cases, and shows that some past studies have tended to underestimate the uncertainties that should be attached to the parameters. {\sc ampere}\ can be applied to a wide range of problems, and is particularly well-suited to using expensive models to interpret data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A summary of instruments proposed for observing pulsating variables from the Mt.

Presently it is an exciting era in observational study of variable stars owing to surveys like OGLE and TESS. The vast number of sources being discovered by these surveys is also creating opportunities for 1-2m class telescopes to provide follow-up observations to characterize these. We present some initial observations of type-II cepheids from the Mt. Abu observatory and highlight the need for dedicated observing runs of pulsating variables. We also present optical designs for several suggested instruments for the Mt. Abu observatory that will contribute towards this goal.

Such information is now being measured for dozens of planets with state-of-the-art facilities using Bayesian atmosphere retrievals. We collect measurements of exoplanet composition of gas giants into a Library of Exoplanet Atmospheric Composition Measurements for comparison on a population level. We develop an open-source toolkit, ExoComp, to standardize between solar abundance, metallicity, and C/O ratio definitions. We find a systematic enhancement in the metallicity of exoplanets compared to T-dwarf and stellar populations, a strict bound in C/O between 0 and 1, and statistically significant differences between measurements from direct, eclipse, and transmission spectroscopy. In particular, the transit spectroscopy population exhibits a systematically lower C/O ratio compared to planets observed with eclipse and direct spectroscopy. While such differences may be astrophysical signals, we discuss many of the challenges and subtleties of such a comparison. We characterize the mass-metallicity trend, finding a slope consistent between planets measured in transit versus eclipse, but offset in metallicity. Compared to the Solar System and constraints from interior modeling, gas giant atmospheres appear to exhibit a steeper mass-metallicity trend. We hope that the tools available in ExoComp and the data in the Library of Exoplanet Atmospheric Composition Measurements can enhance the science return of the wide-array of space- and ground-based exoplanet science being undertaken by the community.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generative Artificial Intelligence for Air Shower Simulation</a><span class="id">[2510.26316]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detailed simulation of extensive air showers, produced by primary cosmic rays interacting in the atmosphere, is a task that is traditionally undertaken by means of Monte Carlo methods. These processes are computationally intensive, accounting for a major fraction of the computational resources used in the large-scale simulations required by current and future experiments in the field of astroparticle physics. In this work, we present a novel approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to accelerate air shower simulations. We developed and trained a GAN on a dataset of high-energy proton-induced air showers generated with \texttt{CORSIKA}; our model reproduces key distributions of secondary particles, such as energy spectra and spatial distributions at ground level of muons. Once the model has been trained, which takes approximately 74 hours, the generation real time per shower is reduced by a factor of $10^4$ with respect to the full \texttt{CORSIKA} simulation, leading to a substantial decrease in both computational time and energy consumption.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mapping Anisotropies in the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background with space detector networks</a><span class="id">[2510.26359]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Future space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as TianQin, LISA, and Taiji are expected to conduct joint observations. Such a multi-detector network will provide complementary viewing angles for the anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), thereby significantly enhancing the capability to reconstruct and localize its spatial distribution. In this paper, we have established the first dedicated data analysis pipeline for the anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background using a joint network of TianQin, LISA, and Taiji. Our analysis incorporates both Gaussian, stationary, and unpolarized point sources from diverse sky locations as well as a random sky map. We have performed full-sky map reconstruction in pixel space using maximum likelihood estimation to extract the angular distribution of the SGWB. The results demonstrate that, when considering the detector noise, the TianQin+LISA+Taiji detector network can reconstruct the angular power spectrum of the stochastic background up to a maximum multipole moment of $l = 14 $, which can provide valuable information for studies on the spatial distribution of galactic compact binaries and physical imprints from the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26739" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wavefront Curvature and Transverse Atomic Motion in Time-Resolved Atom Interferometry: Impact and Mitigation</a><span class="id">[2510.26739]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</a><span class="id">[2508.19386]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the Early Universe with Deep Learning</a><span class="id">[2509.22018]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a $0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of structure formation in the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magrathea v2: A planetary interior modeling platform in C++</a><span class="id">[2510.23733]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magrathea is an open-source C++ code for modeling the internal structure of differentiated planets.

However, due to a scarcity of labelled data, it is often infeasible to apply supervised methods to anomaly detection. We present AnomalyMatch, an anomaly detection framework combining the semi-supervised FixMatch algorithm using EfficientNet classifiers with active learning. AnomalyMatch is tailored for large-scale applications and integrated into the ESA Datalabs science platform. In this method, we treat anomaly detection as a binary classification problem and efficiently utilise limited labelled and abundant unlabelled images for training. We enable active learning via a user interface for verification of high-confidence anomalies and correction of false positives. Evaluations on the GalaxyMNIST astronomical dataset and the miniImageNet natural-image benchmark under severe class imbalance display strong performance. Starting from five to ten labelled anomalies, we achieve an average AUROC of 0.96 (miniImageNet) and 0.89 (GalaxyMNIST), with respective AUPRC of 0.82 and 0.77. After three active learning cycles, anomalies are ranked with 76% (miniImageNet) to 94% (GalaxyMNIST) precision in the top 1% of the highest-ranking images by score. We compare to the established Astronomaly software on selected 'odd' galaxies from the 'Galaxy Zoo - The Galaxy Challenge' dataset, achieving comparable performance with an average AUROC of 0.83. Our results underscore the exceptional utility and scalability of this approach for anomaly discovery, highlighting the value of specialised approaches for domains characterised by severe label scarcity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Deviation of Kerr Metric via Bumpy Parameterization and Particle Swarm Optimization in Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</a><span class="id">[2506.21955]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Measurement of deviations in the Kerr metric using gravitational wave (GW) observations will provide a clear signal of new Physics. Previous studies have developed multiple parameterizations (e.g. “bumpy&quot; spacetime) to characterize such deviations in extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRI) and employed analyses based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) formalism to quantify the constraining power of space-borne GW detectors like LISA and Tianqin, e.g., achieving a constraint sensitivity levels of $10^{-4} \sim 10^{-2}$ on the dimensionless bumpy parameter $\delta \tilde{Q}$ under varying source configurations in analytical kluge waveform for LISA. In this paper, we advance prior analyses by integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO) with matched filtering under a restricted parameter search range to enforce a high probability of convergence for PSO. Our results reveal a significant number of degenerate peaks in the likelihood function over the signal parameter space with values that exceed the injected one. This extreme level of degeneracy arises from the involvement of the additional bumpy parameter $\delta \tilde{Q}$ in the parameter space and introduces systematic errors in parameter estimation. We show that these systematic errors can be mitigated using information contained in the ensemble of degenerate peaks, thereby restoring the reliability of astrophysical inferences about EMRI systems from GW observations. This study highlights the critical importance of accounting for such degeneracies, which are absent in FIM-based analyses, and points out future directions for improving EMRI data analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15398" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-scale optimal control for Einstein Telescope active seismic isolation</a><span class="id">[2507.15398]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a multi-scale optimal control framework for active seismic isolation in the Einstein Telescope, a third-generation gravitational-wave observatory.

Accurate knowledge of the mapping enables complex sensing or beam control applications that leverage multimode conversion. In this work, we present a characterisation system to directly measure the electric field from a photonic lantern using digital off-axis holography, following its evolution over a 73 nm range near 1550 nm and in two orthogonal, linear polarisations. We provide the first multi-wavelength, polarisation decomposed characterisation of the principal modes of a photonic lantern. Performance of our testbed is validated on a single-mode fibre then harnessed to characterise a 19-port, multicore fibre fed photonic lantern. We uncover the typical wavelength scale at which the modal mapping evolves and measure the relative dispersion in the device, finding significant differences with idealised simulations. In addition to detailing the system, we also share the empirical mode transfer matrices, enabling future work in astrophotonic design, computational imaging, device fabrication feedback loops and beam shaping.</p></div></details></article></body>
