However, obtaining reliable age estimates and uncertainties for field stars has been a long-standing challenge. We test the fidelity of ages from recent catalogs of giants and subgiants using wide binaries, whose components formed at the same time and thus should have consistent inferred ages. We find that subgiant ages based on spectroscopic metallicities from Xiang &amp; Rix (2022) are generally consistent within their reported uncertainties, implying that fractional uncertainties of 5-10% are realistically achievable. In contrast, we find that published photometric subgiant ages and red giant ages underestimate true uncertainties by factors of 2-5. These results demonstrate that accurate metallicity and $\alpha$-element abundances are essential for precise isochrone ages and establish wide binaries as a powerful, model-independent benchmark for calibrating stellar age measurements in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08683" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-messenger Analysis of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries: The Joint-likelihood Approach</a><span class="id">[2510.08683]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) formed in galaxy mergers are promising multi-messenger sources. They can be identified as quasars with periodic variability in electromagnetic (EM) time-domain surveys. The most massive of those systems can be detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in the nanohertz frequency gravitational-wave (GW) band. We present a method to simultaneously analyze EM lightcurves and PTA observations as a multi-messenger data stream. For this, we employ a joint likelihood analysis, in which the likelihood of the EM data and the PTA likelihood are multiplied. We test this approach by simulating 208 binary signals that can be detected both by the Rubin Observatory in the nominal ten-year survey and by a PTA dataset with a  30-year baseline, which resembles our expectations for a dataset of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) collaboration in  2035. We compare our multi-messenger analysis with analyses that take into account the EM and PTA data separately. We find that the joint likelihood approach results in improved parameter estimation with smaller percent errors compared to the distinct analyses that consider only EM or PTA data separately. Among the SMBHB parameters, the binary total mass and the orbital inclination show the greatest improvement. We also compare our multi-messenger pipeline with an analysis, in which the EM constraints are used as priors to the PTA analysis. We demonstrate that the joint likelihood approach delivers tighter constraints on all binary parameters, with systematically higher values of Kullback-Leibler divergence, which measures the deviation of the posterior distribution from the prior.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Vertically Orientated Dark Matter Halo Marks a Flip of the Galactic Disk</a><span class="id">[2510.08684]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Unveiling the 3D shape of the Milky Way's dark-matter halo is critical to understanding its formation history. We created an innovative dynamical model with minimal assumptions on the internal dynamical structures and accommodates a highly flexible triaxial DM halo. By applying the method to 6D phase-space data of K-giant stars from LAMOST + Gaia, we robustly determine the 3D dark-matter distribution of the Milky Way out to approximately 50 kpc. We discover a triaxial, nearly oblate dark-matter halo with $q_{\rm DM} = Z/X= 0.92\pm0.08$, $p_{\rm DM} = Y/X= 0.8\pm0.2$ averagely within 50 kpc, where $Z$ axis is defined perpendicular to the stellar disk. The axes ratio $q_{\rm DM} &gt; p_{\rm DM}$ is strongly preferred; the long-intermediate axis plane of the dark-matter halo is unexpectedly vertical to the Galactic disk, yet aligned with the `plane of satellites'. This striking configuration suggests that the Galactic disk has flipped, likely torqued by minor mergers, from an original alignment with the dark-matter halo and satellite plane, as supported by Milky Way analogues from Auriga and TNG 50. By allowing $q_{\rm DM}(r)$ and $p_{\rm DM}(r)$ vary with radii, we find tentative evidence that the dark-matter halo is twisted, being more oblate in the inner regions, and only become vertically aligned at $r\gtrsim 20$ kpc, also consistent with the prediction of the disk flip scenario. Such disk reorientation is non-trivial yet its physical mechanism is straightforward to comprehend and naturally originates a vertical satellite plane. Our findings offer a unified framework that links dark-matter halo orientation, satellite alignment, and disk evolution, reinforcing the internal consistency of the Milky Way in $\Lambda$CDM model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That's so Retro: The Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus Merger Trajectory as the Origin of the Chemical Abundance Bimodality in the Milky Way Disk</a><span class="id">[2510.08688]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Milky Way (MW) is thought to have experienced a $\sim$3:1 mass-ratio merger event near redshift $z\sim2$ with a significantly retrograde trajectory. This now-disrupted dwarf galaxy is commonly known as the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). In this paper, we investigate the impact of the GSE merger trajectory on metal abundances in the MW disk. We construct numerical models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) incorporating radial gas flows to account for angular momentum transport during the merger event. Unlike prograde trajectories, radial and retrograde mergers are generally accompanied by a major sinking event in which much of the interstellar medium falls toward the Galactic center. This effect leads to a net decrease in surface density across much of the disk. Ongoing Type Ia supernova explosions then drive a rapid decline in [$\alpha$/Fe] due to the lowered gas supply. Consequently, radial and retrograde trajectories increase (decrease) the number of low (high) [$\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations relative to prograde trajectories. If high [$\alpha$/Fe] stars form in sufficient numbers through other mechanisms, the effect of the retrograde trajectory can produce a bimodal [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution at fixed [Fe/H], as observed in the MW. In models dominated by low [$\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations, a bimodality does not arise because the retrograde trajectory cannot increase the number of high [$\alpha$/Fe] stars. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of gas dynamics in GCE models featuring major merger events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08689" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metals versus Non-metals: Chemical Evolution of Hydrogen and Helium Isotopes in the Milky Way</a><span class="id">[2510.08689]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Star formation drives changes in the compositions of galaxies, fusing H and He into heavier nuclei. This paper investigates the differences in abundance evolution between metal and non-metal isotopes using recent models of Galactic chemical evolution appropriate for the thin disk epoch. A strong degeneracy arises between metal yields from stellar populations and the mean Galactocentric radial velocity of the interstellar medium (ISM). Similar metallicities arise when increases (decreases) in metal yields are combined with increases (decreases) to the gas flow velocity. A similar degeneracy exists between metal yields and the rate of gas ejection from the ISM. We demonstrate that this degeneracy can be confidently broken with precise measurements of the hydrogen (D/H) and helium ($^3$He/$^4$He) isotope ratios in the Galactic ISM. At fixed O/H, higher metal yields lead to higher D/H and lower $^3$He/$^4$He. Measurements available to date are not sufficiently precise or numerous to draw confident conclusions. A detailed inventory of non-metal isotopes in the Milky Way would provide critical empirical constraints for stellar and galactic astrophysics, as well as a new test of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We forecast that only $\sim$4 additional measurements of $^3$He/$^4$He within $\sim$$3$ kpc of the Sun are required to measure the primordial $^3$He/$^4$He ratio at $\sim$30\% precision. In parallel, empirical benchmarks on metal yields also have the power to inform stellar models, since absolute yield calculations carry factor of $\sim$$2-3$ uncertainties related to various complex processes (e.g., rotational mixing, convection, mass loss, failed supernovae).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST imaging of omega Centauri: II. Evidence for a split white dwarf cooling sequence in the near-infrared</a><span class="id">[2510.08715]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed analysis of the white dwarf cooling sequence (WD CS) in omega Centauri based on combined Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST observations. Our analysis confirms the previously reported split - based on HST observations in ultraviolet filters - in the upper part of the WD CS, consistent with the presence of two distinct WD populations, and extends it to a significantly fainter and cooler limit (down to  8000 K), corresponding to cooling ages of about 1 Gyr. We used artificial star (AS) tests and cooling models to confirm that the split is evidence of two WD populations with different masses and progenitors: one sequence of canonical WDs produced by the He-normal progenitors, and one sequence of low-mass WDs originated from the cluster He-rich component. We show that the fraction of WDs from the He-rich component in the outer regions is smaller than that found in the innermost regions. We also studied the kinematics of WDs and showed that in the outer regions, the velocity distribution of WDs from He-rich progenitors is slightly radially anisotropic, while that of canonical WDs is slightly tangentially anisotropic. Both the radial variation of the fraction of WDs from the He-rich population and the difference between their velocity distribution and that of canonical WDs are consistent with spatial and kinematic differences previously found for He-rich and He-normal main-sequence (MS) stars and in general agreement with models predicting that He-rich stars form more centrally concentrated than He-normal stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planetary Nebula Evolution for Single Stellar Models. The Formation of Neutral Spikes</a><span class="id">[2510.08721]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations are presented from the formation up to the late evolution of planetary nebula, for 6 different stellar models from 1 to 5 Mo. The hydrodynamical models use stellar evolution calculations as inner boundary conditions and updated values for the number of ionizing photons. Special emphasis is placed on the formation of neutral spikes, as recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. The results indicate that neutral spikes can be detected either at the formation of planetary nebulae or in their decline. In the first case, the temporal window decreases with the mass of the model, ranging from 3,000 years in the 1 Mo case to 0 for 5 Mo. In the second case, only the 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 Mo cases allow us to detect the neutral spikes for most of the remaining time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The CEERS Photometric and Physical Parameter Catalog</a><span class="id">[2510.08743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) catalog, including space-based photometry, photometric redshifts, and physical parameters for more than 80,000 galaxies. The imaging used for this catalog comes from the CEERS survey, which has NIRCam coverage over  100 sq. arcmin of the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) in seven filters from 1.15$\mu$m to 4.44$\mu$m. Alongside these data, we also include ancillary HST imaging in seven filters from 0.435$\mu$m to 1.6$\mu$m. We used Source Extractor with hot and cold detection settings to extract photometry. We derive photometric redshifts using the spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling code, LePHARE, and estimate their accuracy using spectroscopically confirmed galaxies out to $z\sim10$, with $\sigma_{NMAD}$ ranging from 0.035-0.073, depending strongly on galaxy magnitude and redshift. We compute stellar masses, star formation rates, and E(B-V) using three different SED fitting codes with different templates and assumptions about the galaxy star formation histories. All of these measurements, as well as the full mosaics in all filters, and redshift probability distribution functions, are made available via the CEERS DR1.0 data release.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Distribution of Quenched Galaxies in the Massive z = 0.87 Galaxy Cluster El Gordo</a><span class="id">[2510.08801]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>El Gordo (ACT-CL J0102$-$4915) is a massive galaxy cluster with two major mass components at redshift $z=0.87$. Using SED fitting results from JWST/NIRCam photometry, the fraction of quenched galaxies in this cluster was measured in two bins of stellar mass: $9&lt;\log{({M_*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})}&lt;10$ and $10\leq\log{({M_*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})}&lt;12$. While there is no correlation between the quenched fraction and angular separation from the cluster's overall center of mass, there is a correlation between the quenched fraction and angular separation from the center of the nearest of the two mass components for the less-massive galaxies. This suggests that environmental quenching processes are in place at $z\sim1$, and that dwarf galaxies are more affected by those processes than massive galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08815" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LATIS Data Release: $\sim4200$ Spectra of $z \sim 2-3$ Galaxies, Redshifts, and IGM Tomography Maps</a><span class="id">[2510.08815]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the data release of the Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), one of the largest optical spectroscopic surveys of faint high-redshift galaxies. The survey provides 7408 optical spectra of candidate $z \sim 2-3$ galaxies and QSOs in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey D1, D2 (COSMOS), and D4 fields. The $R \sim 1000$ spectra were obtained using the IMACS spectrograph at the Magellan Baade telescope, with typical integrations of 12 hr. From these spectra, we measured 5575 high-confidence spectroscopic redshifts, of which 4176 are at $z &gt; 1.7$, thereby substantially increasing the number of public spectroscopic redshifts at $z \approx 2-3$ in COSMOS and the other survey fields. The data release includes Ly$\alpha$ transmission fluctuations measured in $4.7 \times 10^5$ pixels, which were used to create 3D maps of the intergalactic medium (IGM) transmission spanning 1.65 deg${}^2$ and $z = 2.2-2.8$ at a resolution of 4 $h^{-1}$ cMpc. These are the largest such maps to date and provide a novel tracer of large-scale structure in legacy fields. We also provide ancillary data including mock surveys. The LATIS data will enable a variety of community studies of galaxy evolution, environments, and the IGM around cosmic noon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring the Temperature of Extremely Hot Shock-Heated Gas in the Major Merger MACS J0717.5+3745 With Relativistic Corrections to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect</a><span class="id">[2510.08837]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The conversion of gravitational potential to kinetic energy results in an intracluster medium (ICM) gas with a characteristic temperature near 10 keV in the most massive galaxy clusters. X-ray observations, primarily from Chandra and XMM-Newton, have revealed a wealth of information about the thermodynamics of this gas. However, two regimes remain difficult to study with current instruments: superheated gas well above 10 keV generated by shocks from major mergers, and distant systems strongly impacted by cosmological dimming. Relativistic corrections to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (rSZe) produce a fractional spectral distortion in the cosmic microwave background at sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths that could offer a complimentary probe of both high temperature and high redshift ICM gas. Here we describe multi-band measurements of the rSZe, including observations from the Fourier Transform Spectrometer on the Herschel-SPIRE instrument, that constrain the ICM thermodynamics of the major merger MACSJ0717.5+3745. Within the seven observed lines of sight, we find an average temperature of $T_{\mathrm{rSZe}}=15.1^{+3.8}_{-3.3}$ keV, which is consistent with the values obtained from X-ray measurements of the same regions, with $T_{\mathrm{Chandra}}=18.0^{+1.1}_{-1.1}$ keV and $T_{\mathrm{XMM}}=13.9^{+0.9}_{-0.9}$ keV. This work demonstrates that the rSZe signal can be detected with moderate spectral resolution sub-millimeter data, while also establishing the utility of such measurements for probing superheated regions of the ICM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion-Regulated Type Transitions in Changing-Look AGNs: Evidence from Two-Epoch Spectral Analysis</a><span class="id">[2510.08868]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The changing-look active galactic nucleus (CL-AGN), an extraordinary subpopulation of supermassive black holes, has attracted growing attention for understanding its nature. We present an analysis of the spectral properties of 203 low-redshift CL-AGNs ($z&lt;0.35$) using two-epoch spectra from SDSS DR16 and DESI DR1 with time baseline ranging from $\sim$1000 to 8000 days, based on spectral fitting and decomposition. The sample consists of 11.3\% Type 1.0, 26.6\% Type 1.2, 43.1\% Type 1.5, and 19\% Type 1.8/2.0 AGNs. The total sample is divided into two datasets: Dataset A (110 objects) with minor spectral type variations, likely general AGN variability, and Dataset B (93 objects) showing significant type transitions and characteristic turn-on or turn-off behavior. Our results reveal clear optical continuum and emission-line variability, showing both bluer-when-brighter and redder-when-brighter trends. A strong correlation between the broad H$\beta$/[O {\sc iii}] ratio and broad H$\alpha$ luminosity ($L_{\rm H\alpha}$), ${\rm log(H\beta/[O~III])}=(0.63\pm 0.07){\rm log}(L_{\rm H\alpha})-(26.49\pm2.96)\pm0.48$ for Dataset B, as well as the correlation between H$\beta$/[O {\sc iii}] and Eddington ratio ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$), ${\rm log(H\beta/[O~III])}=(0.59\pm 0.08){\rm log}(L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd})+(1.02\pm0.15)\pm0.53$ for Dataset B, suggests that accretion rate variations drive changes in ionizing flux within the broad-line region, thereby triggering AGN type transitions. These findings underscore the critical role of supermassive black hole accretion processes in refining the AGN unification model. Future work should investigate potential connections between stellar evolution in outer accretion disk and the observed scatter in these correlations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tides from the cloud can induce the fast disruption of star clusters and offer an explanation for Gaia strings</a><span class="id">[2510.08913]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Young stars form in clusters within molecular clouds, but older stars are evenly distributed across the galactic disk, necessitating an explanation for cluster dissolution. We analytically study tidal forces from cold molecular clouds as a key mechanism for accelerated cluster disruption. Cloud tides, caused by the gravitational pull of the parent cloud along the radial direction, arise from the spatial gradient of gravitational acceleration and drive cluster disruption. This mechanism activates after gas expulsion and remains effective until the cloud is disrupted by stellar feedback or the cluster moves away. Cloud tides act on gas-deprived clusters, causing exponential expansion on a tidal timescale of $t_{\rm tidal,ext} = \sqrt{3/(8\pi G\rho_{\rm mean})}$, where $\rho_{\rm mean}$ is the cloud's density at the cluster's location. With a duration of a few Myr, cloud tides can lead to a 10 times increase of the cluster size, producing bar-like elongated stellar aggregations resembling Gaia strings. These results establish cloud tides as a potentially important mechanism for star cluster disruption.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Sharper View of the X-ray Spectrum of MCG–6-30-15 with XRISM, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR</a><span class="id">[2510.08926]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a time-averaged spectral analysis of the 2024 XRISM observation of the narrow-line Seyfert-1 galaxy MCG–6-30-15, taken contemporaneously with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. Our analysis leverages a unique combination of broadband and high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy to definitively isolate and characterize both broad and narrow emission and absorption features in this source. The best-fitting model for the joint spectral analysis is very well described by reflection from the inner accretion disk illuminated by a compact corona, modified by multi-zone ionized absorption from an outflowing wind along the line of sight. The XRISM/Resolve data confirm that a strong, relativistically-broadened Fe K$\alpha$ emission line is required in order to obtain an adequate model fit. The Resolve data additionally verify the presence of a $v_{\rm out} \sim 2300$ km/s component of this outflowing wind, find tentative evidence for a $v_{\rm out} \sim 20,000$ km/s wind component, and indicate that the reflection from distant, neutral material may originate in a non-uniform structure rather than the traditional torus of AGN unification schemes. Though a rapid prograde black hole spin is statistically preferred by the best-fitting model, consistent with previous results, the AGN flux variability over the course of the observation complicates the interpretation of the time-averaged spectra. This insight, clarified by the combination of high signal-to-noise and high spectral resolution in the joint dataset, emphasizes the importance of time-resolved, high-resolution spectral analysis in unambiguously measuring the physical properties of variable AGN.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08950" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAMOST Medium-resolution Spectroscopic Survey of the Rosette Nebula</a><span class="id">[2510.08950]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report multi-fiber, medium-resolution spectroscopy of the Rosette Nebula with full spatial coverages, and present a table of the nebular parameters based on the spatially-resolved measurements of emission lines. These new observations were conducted through the Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey of Nebulae (MRS-N) on the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). Comprehensive analyses were performed on a total of 3854 high-quality nebular spectra, so far the most extensive spectral dataset available for this nebula that encompasses an area of 4.52 square degrees. Various physical parameters, including relative line intensities, radial velocities (RVs), and full widths at half maximum (FWHMs), were derived through measurements of the H-alpha, [N II] 6548,6584 and [S II] 6716,6731 emission lines detected in the LAMOST MRS-N spectra. For the first time, we found a bow-shaped feature in the spatial distribution of RVs of the Rosette Nebula. Moreover, the spatial distributions of RVs and FWHMs, as well as additional parameters such as gas temperature and turbulent velocity in the vicinity of the nebula, indicate possible interaction between Rosette and the nearby supernova remnant (SNR), Monoceros Loop. Our new observations provide indispensable measurements of the Rosette Nebula. The parameter table in particular can be used as valuable constraint on the chemo-dynamical modeling of the nebula, which will enable deeper understanding of the characteristics of this H II region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Metallicity Gradients in the Reionization Epoch from the FIRE-2 Simulations</a><span class="id">[2510.08997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We employ the high-redshift suite of FIRE-2 cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations to investigate the evolution of gas-phase metallicity radial gradients in galaxies in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Our sample consists of 22 galaxies spanning the redshift range $z \sim 10-5$. We find that galaxies at $z\sim10$ exhibit a median metallicity gradient of $-0.15\,\mathrm{dex\cdot kpc^{-1}}$ with substantial scatter, which gradually flatten to $-0.1\,\mathrm{dex\cdot kpc^{-1}}$ at $z\sim6$, accompanied by a reduction in scatter. In the EoR, metallicity gradients correlate positively with stellar mass: more massive galaxies display flatter gradients with smaller scatter, broadly consistent with recent JWST observations. At fixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher star formation rates (SFRs) exhibit steeper negative gradients, while sSFR shows a strong anti-correlation with gradient slope. Because EoR galaxies in FIRE-2 generally lack significant rotational support, we adopt the ratio of peak-to-peak velocity shear to twice the velocity dispersion ($\Delta v/2\sigma$) as a proxy for the strength of gas flows. We find a strong positive correlation between metallicity gradients and $\Delta v/2\sigma$: galaxies with lower $\Delta v/2\sigma$ (i.e., weaker gas flows) tend to exhibit steeper negative gradients. Furthermore, galaxies with steeper gradients display higher central SFR surface densities, suggesting localized star formation with inefficient interstellar medium mixing that drives inside-out chemical enrichment in galaxy evolution in the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A study of 80 known pulsars at 185 MHz using MWA incoherent drift-scan observations</a><span class="id">[2510.09046]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A systematic study of 80 known pulsars observed at 185 MHz has been conducted using archival incoherent-sum data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The dataset comprises 48 drift-scan observations from the MWA Voltage Capture System, covering approximately 30,000 square degrees of sky with sensitivities reaching about 8 mJy in the deepest regions. An optimized PRESTO-based search pipeline was deployed on the China SKA Regional Centre infrastructure. This enabled the detection of 80 known pulsars, representing a 60 percent increase over the previous census.

However, observations of dual quasars with sub-5 kpc separations-the critical phase preceding final coalescence-have remained elusive due to angular resolution limitations. We present the discovery and confirmation of two sub-arcsecond dual quasars at $z&gt;1$, selected from 59,025 SDSS quasars, which fall within the footprint of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and slitless spectroscopy, we confirmed SDSS J1625+4309 ($z=1.647$, separation 0.55&quot;/4.7 kpc) and SDSS J0229$-$0514 ($z=3.174$, separation 0.42&quot;/3.2 kpc), probing the sub-5 kpc separation regime. Through novel combination of WFC3/IR direct imaging (F140W) and grism spectroscopy (G141), we resolve both components morphologically and spectroscopically confirm their dual nature via detection of H$\beta$+[OIII] and MgII emission lines in each nucleus. Two-dimensional image decomposition reveals distinct host galaxy morphologies: J1625+4309 shows an extended, disturbed structure ($R_e$=4.7 kpc) indicative of an ongoing major merger, while J0229$-$0514 exhibits a compact host ($R_e$=1.4 kpc) suggesting an advanced coalescence stage. Black hole mass estimates based on virial relations yield M$_{\mathrm{BH}} \sim 10^{8.1}-10^{8.7} M_\odot$ with line-of-sight velocity offsets of $(0.7\pm0.1)\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $(1.0\pm0.2)\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. These confirmations directly constrain the frequency and properties of close dual quasars, opening new avenues for studying SMBH mergers at cosmic noon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09091" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Low-Frequency Spectra of Radio Pulsars</a><span class="id">[2510.09091]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Low-frequency spectral studies of radio pulsars represent a key method for uncovering their emission mechanisms, magnetospheric structure, and signal interactions with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM).

This paper reviews the morphology of pulsar radio spectra, advances in spectral modeling, and the key physical processes governing the low-frequency emission.

Emission spectrum especially of heavier COMs may consists of up to hundreds of lines, where line blending hinders the analysis. However, identifying the molecular composition of the gas leading to the observed millimeter spectra is the first step toward a quantitative analysis. We develop a new method based on supervised machine learning to recognize spectroscopic features of the rotational spectrum of molecules in the 3mm atmospheric transmission band for a list of species including COMs with the aim to obtain a detection probability. We used local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) modeling to build a large set of synthetic spectra of 20 molecular species including COMs with a range of physical conditions typical for star forming regions. We successfully designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that provides detection probabilities of individual species in the spectra. We demonstrate that the produced CNN-model has a robust performance to detect spectroscopic signatures from these species in synthetic spectra. We evaluate its ability to detect molecules according to the noise level, frequency coverage, and line-richness, and also test its performance for incomplete frequency coverage with high detection probabilities for the tested parameter space, and no false predictions. Ultimately, we apply the CNN-model to obtain predictions on observational data from the literature toward line-rich hot-core like sources, where detection probabilities remain reasonable with no false detection. We prove the use of CNNs facilitating the analysis of complex millimeter spectra both on synthetic spectra as well as first tests on observational data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detecting dark matter substructure with lensed quasars in optical bands</a><span class="id">[2510.09148]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Flux ratios of multiple images in strong gravitational lensing systems provide a powerful probe of dark matter substructure. Optical flux ratios of lensed quasars are typically affected by stellar microlensing, and thus studies of dark matter substructure often rely on emission regions that are sufficiently extended to avoid microlensing effects. To expand the accessible wavelength range for studying dark matter substructure through flux ratios and to reduce reliance on specific instruments, we confront the challenges posed by microlensing and propose a method to detect dark matter substructure using optical flux ratios of lensed quasars. We select 100 strong lensing systems consisting of 90 doubles and 10 quads to represent the overall population and adopt the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test as our statistical method. By introducing different types of dark matter substructure into these strong lensing systems, we demonstrate that using quads alone provides the strongest constraints on dark matter and that several tens to a few hundred independent flux ratio measurements from quads can be used to study the properties of dark matter substructure and place constraints on dark matter parameters. Furthermore, we suggest that the use of multi-band flux ratios can substantially reduce the required number of quads. Such sample sizes will be readily available from ongoing and upcoming wide-field surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The age and metallicity dependence of the near-infrared absolute magnitude and colour of red clump stars</a><span class="id">[2510.09168]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the age and metallicity dependence of the absolute magnitude and colour of red clump (RC) stars is crucial for validating the accuracy of stellar evolution models and enhancing their reliability as a standard candle. However, this dependence has previously been investigated in the near-infrared across multiple bands only for -1.05 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$ 0.40, a range accessible through the star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Therefore, we used star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way Galaxy to investigate the age and metallicity dependence of the absolute magnitude and colour of RC stars in the near-infrared for a broader parameter space (0.45 $\leq$ Age (Gyr) $\leq$ 10.5, -1.65 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$ 0.32). Comparison of our results with three isochronous models BaSTI, PARSEC, and MIST reveals that the age dependence of the absolute magnitude for young RC stars aligns well with theoretical predictions, within the fitting errors of the multiple regression analysis. Additionally, the observed colour shows good agreement with the theoretical models.

In this study, we analyze the dynamics of the Centaurus A (CenA) and M83 galaxies, along with their associated dwarf companions identified via Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance measurements, to constrain both the group mass and the local value of $H_0$. By examining the motions of these galaxies relative to the system's barycenter, we apply both the minor and major infall models, which provide bounds on the true radial velocity dispersion. Averaging these approaches, we obtain a virial mass estimate of $(11 \pm 2) \times 10^{12}\, M_{\odot}$ and a Hubble flow-based mass of $(2.6 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{12}\, M_{\odot}$. Modeling the cold Hubble flow around the group center of mass, we derive a corresponding value of the Hubble constant as $68 \pm 5~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. These results offer an independent, dynamically motivated constraint on the local value of $H_0$, explicitly accounting for the impact of peculiar velocities in the nearby Universe. We also discuss the mild tension between the virial and Hubble flow-based mass estimates, which likely arises from the fact that M83 is close to the velocity surface and breaks the Hubble flow model assumptions. While the Hubble flow fit emphasizes galaxies that follow smooth expansion on the lower branch of the velocity-distance relation, the virial estimate includes the broader spread of bound galaxies near the group core, which seems to fit better for the CenA/M83 total mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is the contribution of gravitational infall on the mass assembly of star-forming clouds? A case study in a numerical simulation of the interstellar medium</a><span class="id">[2510.09480]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Star formation in galaxies is a complex phenomenon occurring on a very wide range of scales, and molecular clouds are at the heart of this process. The formation of these structures and the subsequent collapse of the gas within them to form new stars remain unresolved scientific questions. In particular, the role and importance of gravity at between the disk scale height and prestellar cores (100 to 0.01 pc) are still topics of debate. In this work, we conduct a case study examining the mass assembly and evolution of a giant molecular cloud complex in a numerical stratified-box simulation of the interstellar medium with photo-ionizing and supernova driving and resolving down to scales $\gtrsim 1$ pc and densities up to $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. By introducing tracer particles to precisely track the forces acting on the gas during its evolution towards and within the clouds, we are able to quantify how much of the mass inflow is driven by the self-gravity of the gas and the gravity from the stellar disk. We find that up to 20% of the gas is gravity-driven at a scale of 100 pc, contributing 10% of the inflow from the warm to the cold phase and 20% from the cold phase to the individual molecular clouds, reaching up to 45% inside the molecular gas, at densities $\gtrsim 400$ cm$^{-3}$. However, at the 100 pc scale, the contribution of gravity-driven gas on the linewidth is negligible. We conclude that the bulk of the gas motions assembling the clouds in our simulation are caused by the supernova-driven supersonic turbulence, which results in locally convergent flows, with a small contribution from the stellar gravitational potential.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Underdensities Host the Clearest IGM Ly$α$ Transmission and Indicate Anisotropic Reionization</a><span class="id">[2510.09568]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>How galaxies drive reionization and what governs its geometry remain fundamental questions. We present JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) observations toward two of the most Ly$\alpha$-transmissive QSO sightlines near the end of reionization. We find that regions at $z \sim 5.7$ along both sightlines previously found to be low-density in Ly$\alpha$ emitters are also underdense in [O III] emitters, with densities less than half the cosmic mean. Other transmissive regions, however, are found to coincide with average-density environments, indicating that multiple pathways may produce high IGM transmission. For the first time, we measure the two-dimensional cross-correlation between IGM transmission and galaxy positions, revealing evidence for anisotropic ionization geometry. Specifically, we detect enhanced transmission at transverse distances of $\Delta r \sim 0.8$ times the mean free path, consistent with ionizing photons escaping preferentially along large-scale structures that are aligned with, but offset from, the line of sight. This anisotropic escape may contribute to the observed patchiness of reionization and challenges the assumption of isotropic ionized bubble growth in current models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catalog of Mock Stellar Streams in Milky Way-Like Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.09604]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dynamically cold stellar streams from tidally dissolved globular clusters (GCs) serve as excellent tools to measure the Galactic mass distribution and show promise to probe the nature of dark matter. For successful application of these tools to observations, it is essential to have an accurate model of stellar stream properties on the Galactic scale. To this end we produce a mock catalog of stellar streams in four simulated Milky Way-like galaxies. We build the catalog with three main components: a model for the formation and disruption of globular clusters based on cosmological simulations, time-dependent potentials constructed with basis function expansions for integrating stream orbits, and an improved particle spray algorithm for efficient generation of stellar streams. We find that the observable widths and lengths of mock streams as a function of galactocentric radius are well described by power-laws for streams beyond 10 kpc. We generate mock photometry for Gaia, LSST, and Roman, and find that the latter two surveys will increase the number of observable stars in GC stellar streams by several orders of magnitude. Our full catalog, containing stream populations across four different galaxy realizations, is publicly available and can be used to study stream population statistics and to calibrate models which use stellar streams to understand our Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08735" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emergence of advection-diffusion transport structure and nonlinear amplitude evolution of strongly driven instabilities</a><span class="id">[2510.08735]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Instabilities driven by strong gradients appear in a wide variety of physical systems, including plasmas, neutral fluids, and self-gravitating systems. This work develops an analytic formulation to describe the transport structure and nonlinear amplitude evolution of a discrete, strongly driven instability in the presence of energy sources and sinks. Initially, the mode is found to evolve linearly until the gradient in the distribution has been exhausted. It then transitions to a nonlinear phase governed by a Bernoulli differential equation, for which a closed-form analytic solution is found, and continues to evolve until the energy sources and sinks reach equilibrium. During the nonlinear phase, the leading order distribution function is found to persistently satisfy an advection-diffusion equation in time and energy coordinates. These analytical results are shown to agree closely with nonlinear kinetic simulations and to be readily applicable in the study of resonant transport in plasmas, galaxies and viscous shear flows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of the Asymmetric Effect in the Response of Photoionization Gas</a><span class="id">[2311.16463]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The variability of quasar radiation provides a powerful probe of the photoionization response of ionized gas, which plays a central role in tracing cosmic evolution and plasma physics under extreme conditions. In this work, we investigate the physical origin of the asymmetric response observed in broad absorption line (BAL) systems and constrain the gas density and spatial scale of quasar outflows. Using time-dependent photoionization simulations and analytical estimates focused on CIV, we quantify the response timescales across different ionization states. Our results show that over 70\% of BAL gas exhibits a negative response to quasar dimming, indicating a strong asymmetry in ionization behavior. This asymmetry is driven by systematically shorter response timescales in higher ionization states. Given typical observational cadences longer than one day, the observed response pattern requires at least 40% of the BAL gas to have a density below $n_{\rm H} = 10^6\ \cc$, consistent with most measured BAL densities but significantly lower than typical accretion disk winds ($n_{\rm H} &gt; 10^8\ \cc$). These findings suggest that BAL outflows either undergo substantial density evolution as they propagate or originate from larger-scale regions such as the dusty torus. The asymmetric response thus provides new constraints on the physical structure and origin of quasar outflows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05115" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Likelihood and appearance of life beyond the Earth: An astronomical perspective</a><span class="id">[2405.05115]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As of 2025, over 6000 planets are known to orbit stars other than our Sun.

Using a conditional autoencoder architecture, the model efficiently produces high-fidelity waveforms across a broad parameter space, including component masses (m1, m2), spin components (S1x, S1y, S1z, S2x, S2y, S2z), and tidal deformabilities (Lambda1, Lambda2). Trained on 1*10^6 waveforms generated by the IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2 model, our network achieves a mean mismatch of 2.13*10^-3. The generation time for a single waveform is 0.12 s, compared to 0.66 s for IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2, representing a speedup of about fivefold. When generating 1000 waveforms, the model completes the task in 0.75 s, roughly ten times faster than the baseline.

However, the determination is complicated by MSPs' long-term dynamic evolution and the scarcity of radial velocity measurements. We compiled 64 field MSP systems that are well astrometrically determined, and calculated their transverse peculiar velocities $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$ and Galactic heights $z$. Assuming that the Galactic-longitude components $v_\mathrm{l}$ of $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$ are statistically stable over time (the &quot;stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$&quot; assumption), we approached the distribution of the $v_\mathrm{l}$ components of $\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$ by the observed $v_\mathrm{l}$ sample. We find that the observed $v_\mathrm{l}$ can be well described by a linear combination of three normal distributions. Accordingly, the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution can be approximated by a linear combination of three Maxwellian components under the assumption that $\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$ directions are uniformly distributed. Our dynamical population synthesis analysis based on the derived $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution verified the &quot;stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$&quot; assumption in the parameter space of this work, and estimated the initial and the current Galaxy-wide scale heights of field MSP systems to be about 0.32 kpc and 0.68 kpc, respectively. According to the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution, $\approx14$% of all the MSPs born in a globular cluster with the nominal 50 $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ central escape velocity can be retained. Therefore, the $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution of field MSP systems may account for the high number of MSPs discovered in globular clusters, which implies that MSPs in star clusters may follow the same formation channel(s) as field MSP systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulation of Binary-Single Interactions in AGN Disks II: Merger Probability of Binary Black Holes during Chaotic Triple Process</a><span class="id">[2507.07715]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers resulting from binary-single interactions (BSIs) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks are a potential source of gravitational wave (GW) events with measurable eccentricities. Previous hydrodynamical simulations have shown that ambient gas can significantly influence the dynamics of BSIs. However, due to limitations such as the use of purely Newtonian dynamics and small sample sizes, a direct estimation of the BBH merger probability during BSI has remained elusive. In this work, we directly quantify the merger probability, based on a suite of 1800 two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with post-Newtonian \emph{N}-body calculations. Our results demonstrate that dense gas can enhance the merger probability by both shrinking the spatial scale of the triple system and increasing the number of binary-single encounters. These two effects together boost the merger probability by a factor of $\sim$5, from 4\% to as high as 20\%. Among the two effects, our analysis suggests that the increase in encounter frequency plays a slightly more significant role in driving the enhancement. Moreover, this enhancement becomes more significant at larger radial distances from the central SMBH, since the total gas mass enclosed within the Hill sphere of the triple system increases with radius. Finally, the BSI process in AGN disks can naturally produce double GW merger events within a timescale of $\sim$year, which may serve as potential observational signatures of BSI occurring in AGN disk environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Onset of CN Emission in 3I/ATLAS: Evidence for Strong Carbon-Chain Depletion</a><span class="id">[2509.01647]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interstellar objects provide a direct window into the environmental conditions around stars other than the Sun. The recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS, a new interstellar comet, offers a unique opportunity to investigate the physical and chemical properties of interstellar objects and to compare them with those of comets in our own Solar System. In this Letter we present the results of a 10-night spectroscopic and photometric monitoring campaign with the 2.4 m Hiltner and 1.3 m McGraw-Hill telescopes at the MDM Observatory. The campaign was conducted between August 8 and 17 while 3I/ATLAS was inbound at heliocentric distances of 3.2 - 2.9 au. Our observations captured the onset of optical gas activity. Nightly spectra reveal a weak CN emission feature in the coma of 3I/ATLAS, absent during the first nights but steadily strengthening thereafter. We measure a CN production rate of $Q$(CN)$\sim6\times$10$^{24}$ s$^{-1}$, towards the lower end of activity observed in Solar System comets. Simultaneous photometry also indicates a small but measurable increase in the coma's radial profile and increasing $r$-band $Af\rho$ with values in the order of $\sim300$ cm. We derived a gas-to-dust production ratio of $\log Q (\mathrm{CN})/Af\rho\sim22.4$. Our upper limit on the C$_2$-to-CN ratio ($\log Q(\mathrm{C}_2)/Q(\mathrm{CN})\lesssim-0.8$) indicates that 3I/ATLAS is a strongly carbon-chain depleted comet. Further observations of 3I/ATLAS are required to verify the apparent carbon-chain depletion and to explore whether such composition represents a recurring trait of the interstellar comet population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comparing XRISM cluster velocity dispersions with predictions from cosmological simulations: are feedback models too ejective?</a><span class="id">[2510.06322]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dynamics of the intra-cluster medium (ICM), the hot plasma that fills galaxy clusters, are shaped by gravity-driven cluster mergers and feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBH) in the cluster cores.

In cool cores, XRISM reveals systematically lower velocity dispersions than the simulations predict, with all ten measurements below the median simulated values by a factor $1.5-1.7$ on average and all falling within the bottom $10\%$ of the predicted distributions. The observed kinetic-to-total pressure ratio is also lower, with a median value of $2.2\%$, compared to the predicted $5.0-6.5\%$ for the three simulations. Outside the cool cores and in non-cool-core clusters, simulations show better agreement with XRISM measurements, except for the outskirts of the relaxed, cool-core cluster A2029, which exhibits an exceptionally low kinetic pressure support ($&lt;1\%$), with none of the simulated systems in either of the three suites reaching such low levels.

However, survey systematics such as variations in seeing and sky brightness can also induce artificial fluctuations in the observed densities of known stellar streams. These variations arise because survey conditions affect both object detection and star-galaxy misclassification rates. To mitigate these effects, we use Balrog synthetic source injections in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data to calculate detection rate variations and classification rates as functions of survey properties. We show that these rates are nearly separable with respect to survey properties and can be estimated with sufficient statistics from the synthetic catalogs. Applying these corrections reduces the standard deviation of relative detection rates across the DES footprint by a factor of five, and our corrections significantly change the inferred linear density of the Phoenix stream when including faint objects. Additionally, for artificial streams with DES like survey properties we are able to recover density power spectra with reduced bias. We also find that uncorrected power-spectrum results for LSST-like data can be around five times more biased, highlighting the need for such corrections in future ground based surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A first look at quasar-galaxy clustering at $z\simeq7.3$</a><span class="id">[2510.08455]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present JWST observations of the environments surrounding two high-redshift quasars – J0252$-$0503 at $z = 7.0$ and J1007$+$2115 at $z = 7.5$ – which enable the first constraints on quasar-galaxy clustering at $z \sim 7.3$. Galaxies in the vicinity of the quasars are selected through ground-based and JWST/NIRCam imaging and then spectroscopically confirmed with JWST/NIRSpec using the multi-shutter assembly (MSA). Over both fields, we identify 51 $z&gt;5$ galaxies, of which eight are found within a $\Delta v_{\textrm{LOS}}=\pm1500 \rm{km} \rm{s}^{-1}$ line-of-sight velocity window from the quasars and another eight in the background. The galaxy J0252\_8713, located just $7\,\rm{pkpc}$ and $\Delta v_{\textrm{LOS}} \approx 360\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ from quasar J0252$-$0503, emerges as a compelling candidate for one of the most distant quasar-galaxy mergers. Combining the galaxy discoveries over the two fields, we measure the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation and obtain a correlation length of $r_0^{\rm{QG}}\approx7.6_{-1.6}^{+1.7}\,h^{-1}\,\rm{cMpc}$, based on a power-law model with a fixed slope of $\gamma_{\rm{QG}} = 2.0$. Under the assumption that quasars and galaxies trace the same underlying dark matter density fluctuations, we infer a minimum dark matter halo mass for $z\simeq7.3$ quasars of $\log_{10}(M_{\textrm{halo, min}}/\textrm{M}_{\odot})= 11.6\pm0.6$ in a halo model framework. Compared to measurements from EIGER at $\langle z \rangle = 6.25$ and ASPIRE at $\langle z \rangle = 6.7$ (where $\log_{10}(M_{\textrm{halo, min}}/\textrm{M}_{\odot}) \gtrsim 12.3$), our clustering results provide tentative evidence for a non-monotonic redshift evolution of quasar clustering properties. We further estimate a quasar duty cycle of $f_{\rm{duty}}\approx0.1\%$, consistent with constraints from quasar proximity zones and IGM damping wings. (abridged)</p></div></details></article>

Recently, the emergence of deep-learning models trained across very large datasets has created a new paradigm for machine learning in the form of Foundation Models. Foundation Models are programs trained on very large and broad datasets with an extensive number of parameters. Once built, these powerful, and flexible, models can be utilized in less resource-intensive ways to build many different, downstream applications that can integrate previously disparate, multimodal data. The development of these applications can be done rapidly and with a much lower demand for machine learning expertise. And the necessary infrastructure and models themselves are already being established within agencies such as NASA and ESA. At NASA this work is across several divisions of the Science Mission Directorate including the NASA Goddard and INDUS Large Language Models and the Prithvi Geospatial Foundation Model. And ESA initiatives to bring Foundation Models to Earth observations has led to the development of TerraMind. A workshop was held by the NASA Ames Research Center and the SETI Institute, in February 2025, to investigate the potential of Foundation Models for astrobiological research and to determine what steps would be needed to build and utilize such a model or models. This paper shares the findings and recommendations of that workshop, and describes clear near-term, and future opportunities in the development of a Foundation Model (or Models) for astrobiology applications. These applications would include a biosignature, or life characterization, task, a mission development and operations task, and a natural language task for integrating and supporting astrobiology research needs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08643" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Astronomical Plate Digitization at SHAO</a><span class="id">[2510.08643]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The digitization of historical astronomical plates is essential for preserving century-long observational data.

Missions like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have made information about distant objects more easily accessible, resulting in extensive amounts of valuable data. As part of this work-in-progress study, we are working to create an atmospheric absorption spectrum prediction model for exoplanets. The eventual model will be based on both collected observational spectra and synthetic spectral data generated by the ROCKE-3D general circulation model (GCM) developed by the climate modeling program at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). In this initial study, spline curves are used to describe the bin heights of simulated atmospheric absorption spectra as a function of one of the values of the planetary parameters. Bayesian Adaptive Exploration is then employed to identify areas of the planetary parameter space for which more data are needed to improve the model. The resulting system will be used as a forward model so that planetary parameters can be inferred given a planet's atmospheric absorption spectrum. This work is expected to contribute to a better understanding of exoplanetary properties and general exoplanet climates and habitability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deep-REMAP: Probabilistic Parameterization of Stellar Spectra Using Regularized Multi-Task Learning</a><span class="id">[2510.09362]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the era of exploding survey volumes, traditional methods of spectroscopic analysis are being pushed to their limits. In response, we develop deep-REMAP, a novel deep learning framework that utilizes a regularized, multi-task approach to predict stellar atmospheric parameters from observed spectra. We train a deep convolutional neural network on the PHOENIX synthetic spectral library and use transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a small subset of observed FGK dwarf spectra from the MARVELS survey. We then apply the model to 732 uncharacterized FGK giant candidates from the same survey. When validated on 30 MARVELS calibration stars, deep-REMAP accurately recovers the effective temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\log \rm{g}$), and metallicity ([Fe/H]), achieving a precision of, for instance, approximately 75 K in $T_{\rm{eff}}$. By combining an asymmetric loss function with an embedding loss, our regression-as-classification framework is interpretable, robust to parameter imbalances, and capable of capturing non-Gaussian uncertainties. While developed for MARVELS, the deep-REMAP framework is extensible to other surveys and synthetic libraries, demonstrating a powerful and automated pathway for stellar characterization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generalized Distributions of Host Dispersion Measures in the Fast Radio Burst Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2510.09463]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As is well known, Hubble tension is one of the most serious challenges in cosmology to date. So, it is of interest to measure the Hubble constant by using some new probes independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNIa). One of the promising probes is the fast radio bursts (FRBs), which could be useful in cosmology. In the literature, the methodology proposed by Macquart {\it et al.} has been widely used, in which both $\rm DM_{IGM}$ and $\rm DM_{host}$ are described by probability distribution functions. Recently, it was found that in order to obtain a Hubble constant $H_0$ consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES by using the current ${\cal O}(100)$ localized FRBs, an unusually large $f_{\rm IGM}$ fairly close to its upper bound $1$ is required, if the narrow prior bounded by $0.5$ for the parameter $F$ in the distribution of $\rm DM_{IGM}$ was used. In fact, a small $F$ is the key to make $H_0$ larger. In the present work, we consider a loose prior for the parameter $F$, and find an unusually low $H_0$ by using 125 localized FRBs. We show that the model with loose $F$ prior is strongly preferred over the one with narrow $F$ prior in all terms of the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC. So, the great Hubble tension between FRBs, Planck 2018 and SH0ES should be taken seriously. Instead of modifying $\sigma_\Delta=Fz^{-0.5}$ in the distribution of $\rm DM_{IGM}$, here we try to find a new way out by generalizing the distribution of $\rm DM_{host}$ with varying location and scale parameters $\ell$ and $e^\mu$, respectively. We find that $H_0$ can be consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES in all cases. All the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC for the generalized distributions of $\rm DM_{host}$ are overwhelmingly strong.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09533" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS) format: moving from visualisation to scientific analysis</a><span class="id">[2510.09533]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. In the current era of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy, international organisations are actively working on the definition of new standards for the publication of astronomical data, and substantial effort is devoted to make them available through public archives. Aims. We present a set of tools that allow user-friendly access and basic scientific analysis of observations in Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS) format, and we use them to gauge the quality of representative skymaps at ultraviolet, optical, and infrared wavelengths. Methods. We apply a fully-automatic procedure to derive aperture photometry in 10 different bands for the 323 nearby galaxies in the Herschel Reference Sample (HRS), and compare its results with the rigorous analyses involving specialised knowledge and human intervention carried out by the HRS team. Results. Our experiment shows that 9 of the 10 skymaps considered preserve the original quality of the data, and the photometric fluxes returned by our pipeline are consistent with the HRS measurements within a few per cent. In the case of Herschel PACS maps at 100 {\mu}m, we uncovered a systematic error that we ascribe to an inconsistent combination of data products with different spatial resolution. For the remaining skymaps, the estimated statistical uncertainties provide a realistic indication of the differences with respect to the HRS catalogue. Conclusions. In principle, the currently available HiPS skymaps in Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format allow to carry out broadband photometric analyses with an accuracy of the order of a few percent, but some level human intervention is still required. In addition to assessing data quality, we also propose a series of recommendations to realise the full potential of the HiPS format for the scientific analysis of large astronomical data sets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09571" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep uGMRT observations for enhanced calibration of 21 cm arrays – I. First image and source catalogue</a><span class="id">[2510.09571]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radio-interferometric arrays require very precise calibration to detect the Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal. A remarkably complete and accurate sky model is therefore needed in the patches of the sky used to perform the calibration. Instruments such as HERA, which use a redundant calibration strategy, also require a reference sky model to fix degenerate gain solutions. We have carried out a deep (20 hours) observation using the upgraded GMRT to make a high-fidelity sky model of one of the HERA calibration fields GLEAM 02H (J0200$-$3053). Here, we present the results from a $16.7\,\rm{MHz}$ bandwidth data centred at $147.4\,\rm{MHz}$. Using multiple GMRT pointings, we have made a $6.9^\circ\times6.9^\circ$ mosaic, which yields a median rms of $3.9^{+3.7}_{-1.4}\,{\rm mJy/beam}$ that reduces to $\sim2\,{\rm mJy/beam}$ at source-free regions. In the overlapping patch, this rms is deeper than the GLEAM catalogue, which is used for HERA calibration. We produce a catalogue of $640$ sources ($26\%$ extended) in the flux range $0.01-19.08\,{\rm Jy}$. The catalogue has a sub-arcsec positional accuracy, and the estimated fluxes are consistent with existing catalogues. The differential source counts are found to be deeper than GLEAM and consistent with LoTSS. Preliminary simulations of the sky models from GLEAM and our catalogue show $\sim 10-25\%$ difference in the visibility amplitude, with relatively small phase difference ($\approx 2^\circ$). Future work is planned for larger survey areas and wider bandwidth to reduce the rms and measure the in-band source spectral indices, which are expected to enhance the fidelity of the HERA calibration model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generative modelling for mass-mapping with fast uncertainty quantification</a><span class="id">[2410.24197]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the nature of dark matter in the Universe is an important goal of modern cosmology. A key method for probing this distribution is via weak gravitational lensing mass-mapping - a challenging ill-posed inverse problem where one infers the convergence field from observed shear measurements. Upcoming stage IV surveys, such as those made by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid satellite, will provide a greater quantity and precision of data for lensing analyses, necessitating high-fidelity mass-mapping methods that are computationally efficient and that also provide uncertainties for integration into downstream cosmological analyses. In this work we introduce MMGAN, a novel mass-mapping method based on a regularised conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which generates approximate posterior samples of the convergence field given shear data. We adopt Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability and apply regularisation techniques to overcome mode collapse, issues that otherwise are particularly acute for conditional GANs. We train and validate our model on a mock COSMOS-style dataset before applying it to true COSMOS survey data. Our approach significantly outperforms the Kaiser-Squires technique and achieves similar reconstruction fidelity as alternative state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Notably, while alternative approaches for generating samples from a learned posterior are slow (e.g. requiring $\sim$10 GPU minutes per posterior sample), MMGAN can produce a high-quality convergence sample in less than a second.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OLÉ – Online Learning Emulation in Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2503.13183]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we present OLÉ, a new online learning emulator for use in cosmological inference. The emulator relies on Gaussian Processes and Principal Component Analysis for efficient data compression and fast evaluation. Moreover, OLÉ features an automatic error estimation for optimal active sampling and online learning. All training data is computed on-the-fly, making the emulator applicable to any cosmological model or dataset. We illustrate the emulator's performance on an array of cosmological models and data sets, showing significant improvements in efficiency over similar emulators without degrading accuracy compared to standard theory codes. We find that OLÉ is able to considerably speed up the inference process, increasing the efficiency by a factor of $30-350$, including data acquisition and training. Typically the runtime of the likelihood code becomes the computational bottleneck. Furthermore, OLÉ emulators are differentiable; we demonstrate that, together with the differentiable likelihoods available in the $\texttt{candl}$ library, we can construct a gradient-based sampling method which yields an additional improvement factor of 4. OLÉ can be easily interfaced with the popular samplers $\texttt{MontePython}$ and $\texttt{Cobaya}$, and the Einstein-Boltzmann solvers $\texttt{CLASS}$ and $\texttt{CAMB}$.

We calculate minimum $\Delta V$ single-impulse direct transfer trajectories to 3I/ATLAS both from Earth and from Mars. We consider launch dates spanning January 2025 through March 2026 to explore obtainable and hypothetical mission scenarios. Post-discovery Earth departures require a challenging $\Delta V\gtrsim24$ km s$^{-1}$ to fly by 3I/ATLAS. By contrast, Mars departures from July 2025 - September 2025 require $\Delta V\sim5$ km s$^{-1}$ to achieve an early October flyby – which is more feasible with existing propulsion capabilities. \added{We further calculate the phase angle and flyby velocity for these trajectories, noting that the resulting flyby speeds would impose significant observational and engineering challenges that a mission would need to overcome.} We discuss how existing spacecraft could be used to observe 3I/ATLAS and how spacecraft at other locations in the Solar System could be repurposed to visit future interstellar objects on short notice.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GW-YOLO: Multi-transient segmentation in LIGO using computer vision</a><span class="id">[2508.17399]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Time series data and their time-frequency representation from gravitational-wave interferometers present multiple opportunities for the use of artificial intelligence methods associated with signal and image processing. Closely connected with this is the real-time aspect associated with gravitational-wave interferometers and the astrophysical observations they perform; the discovery potential of these instruments can be significantly enhanced when data processing can be achieved in O(1s) timescales. In this work, we introduce a novel signal and noise identification tool based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. For its application into gravitational waves, we will refer to it as GW-YOLO. This tool can provide scene identification capabilities and essential information regarding whether an observed transient is any combination of noise and signal. Additionally, it supplies detailed time-frequency coordinates of the detected objects in the form of pixel masks, an essential property that can be used to understand and characterize astrophysical sources, as well as instrumental noise. The simultaneous identification of noise and signal, combined with precise pixel-level localization, represents a significant advancement in gravitational-wave data analysis. Our approach yields a 50\% detection efficiency for binary black hole signals at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 15 when such signals overlap with transient noise artifacts. When noise artifacts overlap with binary neutron star signals, our algorithm attains 50\% detection efficiency at an SNR of 30. This presents the first quantitative assessment of the ability to detect astrophysical events overlapping with realistic, instrument noise present in gravitational-wave interferometers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</a><span class="id">[2508.19386]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HWO Target Stars and Systems: A Prioritized Community List of Potential Stellar Targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory's ExoEarth Survey</a><span class="id">[2509.20544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The HWO Target Stars and Systems 2025 (TSS25) list is a community-developed catalog of potential stellar targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) in its survey to directly image Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone.

Enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio directly on detectors is difficult and expensive, leading to extensive research in advanced post-processing techniques. Aims: Removing background noise from images is a valuable pre-processing step catalog-building tasks. We introduce BGRem, a machine learning (ML) based tool to remove background noise from astronomical images. Methods: BGRem uses a diffusion-based model with an attention U-Net as backbone, trained on simulated images for optical and gamma ({\gamma})-ray data from the MeerLICHT and Fermi-LAT telescopes. In a supervised manner, BGRem learns to denoise astronomical images over several diffusion steps. Results: BGRem performance was compared with a widely used tool for cataloging astronomical sources, SourceExtractor (SExtractor). It was shown that the amount of true positive sources using SExtractor increased by about 7% for MeerLICHT data when BGRem was used as a pre-processing step. We also show the generalizability of BGRem by testing it with optical images from different telescopes and also on simulated {\gamma}-ray data representative of the Fermi-LAT telescope. We show that in both cases, BGRem improves the source detection efficiency. Conclusions: BGRem can improve the accuracy in source detection of traditional pixel-based methods by removing complex background noise. Using zero-shot approach, BGRem can generalize well to a wide range of optical images. The successful application of BGRem to simulated {\gamma}-ray images, alongside optical data, demonstrates its adaptability to distinct noise characteristics and observational domains. This cross-wavelength performance highlights its potential as a general-purpose background removal framework for multi-wavelength astronomical surveys.</p></div></details></article></body>
