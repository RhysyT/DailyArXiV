In a series of two papers, we use constrained N-body simulations to investigate the different cosmic web environments. For the current study, we focus on the cosmic walls. We derive the conditions of the centres of proto-walls and analyse their evolution with N-body simulations. Next, we investigate the statistical properties of Zel'dovich pancakes by studying the number density of the cosmic wall centres in scale space and, for the first time, we calculate the Lagrangian-space volume of cosmic walls. Finally, we infer the mean density and velocity fields and the distribution of haloes around cosmic walls with a suite of physically realistic dark-matter-only simulations. We compare the cosmic walls obtained with the caustic skeleton framework with previously proposed saddle point conditions on the primordial potential and density perturbation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIPSY: A new Disc Instability Population SYnthesis, I. Modeling, evolution of individual systems, and tests</a><span class="id">[2510.02436]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Disc instability (DI) is a model aimed at explaining the formation of companions through the fragmentation of the circumstellar gas disc. Furthermore, DI could explain the formation of part of the observed exoplanetary population. We aim to provide a new comprehensive global model for the formation of companions via DI. The latter leads for the companions to orbital migration and damping of the eccentricities and inclinations. As it evolves, the disc is continuously monitored for self-gravity and fragmentation. When the conditions are satisfied, one (or several) clumps are inserted. The evolution of the clumps is then followed in detail. We showcased the model by performing a number of simulations for various initial conditions, from simple non-fragmenting systems to complex systems with many fragments. We confirm that the DIPSY model is a comprehensive and versatile global model of companion formation via DI. It enables studies of the formation of companions with planetary to low stellar masses around primaries with final masses that range from the brown dwarf to the B-star regime. We conclude that it is necessary to consider the many interconnected processes such as gas accretion, orbital migration, and N-body interactions, as they strongly influence the inferred population of forming objects. It is also clear that model assumptions play a key role in the determination of the systems undergoing formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02437" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIPSY: A new Disc Instability Population SYnthesis, II. The Populations of Companions Formed Through Disc Instability</a><span class="id">[2510.02437]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We applied the global end-to-end model described in Paper I of this series to perform a population synthesis of companions formed via disc instability (DI). By using initial conditions compatible with both observations and hydrodynamical simulations, and by studying a large range of primary masses (0.05-5 Msol), we can provide quantitative predictions of the outcome of DI. In the baseline population, we find that  10 % of the discs fragment, and about half of these end up with a surviving companion after 100 Myr. 75\% of the companions are in the brown dwarf regime, 15 % are low-mass stars, and 10 % planets. At distances larger than  100 au, DI produces planetary-mass companions on a low percent level. Inside of 100 AU, however, planetary-mass companions are very rare (low per mill level). The average companion mass is  30 Mj scaling weakly with stellar mass. Most of the initial fragments do not survive on a Myr timescale; they either collide with other fragments or are ejected, resulting in a population of free-floating objects (about 1-2 per star). We also quantify several variant populations to critically assess some of our assumptions used in the baseline population. DI appears to be a key mechanism in the formation of distant companions with masses ranging from low-mass stars down to the planetary regime, contributing, however, only marginally to planetary mass objects inside of 100 AU. Our results are sensitive to a number of physical processes, which are not completely understood. Two of them, gas accretion and clump-clump collisions, are particularly important and need to be investigated further. Magnetic fields and heavy-element accretion have not been considered in our study, although they are also expected to affect the inferred population. We suggest acknowledging the importance of the gravito-turbulent phase, which most protoplanetary discs experience.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02481" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reheating with Thermal Dissipation and Primordial Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2510.02481]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In order for an inflationary universe to evolve into a hot universe, a process known as reheating is required. However, the precise mechanism of reheating remains unknown. We show that if the reheating is triggered by thermal dissipation effects, distinctive features appear in the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves. This suggests a possible way to observationally probe the physics of reheating.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02508" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of an NH$_3$ absorption band at 2.2 $μ$m on Europa</a><span class="id">[2510.02508]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The presence of NH$_3$-bearing components on icy planetary bodies has important implications for their geology and potential habitability. Here, I report the detection of a characteristic NH$_3$ absorption feature at 2.20 $\pm$ 0.02 $\mu$m on Europa, identified in an observation from the Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer. Spectral modeling and band position indicate that NH$_3$-hydrate and NH$_4$-chloride are the most plausible candidates. Spatial correlation between detected ammonia signatures and Europa's microchaos, linear, and band geologic units suggests emplacement from the underground or shallow subsurface. I posit that NH$_3$-bearing materials were transported to the surface via effusive cryovolcanism or similar mechanisms during Europa's recent geological past. The presence of ammoniated compounds implies a thinner ice shell (Spohn &amp; Schubert, 2003) and a thicker, chemically reduced, high-pH subsurface ocean on Europa (Hand et al. 2009). With the detection of NH$_3$-bearing components, this study presents the first evidence of a nitrogen-bearing species on Europa- an observation of astrobiological significance given nitrogen's essential role in the chemistry of life.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02510" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The anisotropic expansion rate of the local Universe and its covariant cosmographic interpretation</a><span class="id">[2510.02510]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Without making any assumption on the underlying geometry and metric of the local Universe, we provide a measurement of the expansion rate fluctuation field using the Cosmicflows-4 and Pantheon+ samples in the redshift range $0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.1$ ($30 \,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc} &lt; R &lt; 300\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$). The amplitude of the anisotropic fluctuations is found to be of order a few percent relative to the monopole of the expansion rate. We further decompose the expansion rate fluctuation field into spherical harmonic components and analyze their evolution with redshift across the studied redshift range. At low redshift, the dipole is clearly dominant, with an amplitude of $\sim (2.2 \pm 0.15)\times 10^{-2}$, significantly larger than the higher–order modes. As redshift increases, the dipole amplitude steadily decreases, reaching roughly half its value in the highest redshift bin investigated. The quadrupole is also significant, at about half the dipole amplitude, and persists across all redshift bins, with no clear decreasing trend, although uncertainties grow at higher redshift. A nonzero octupole is also detected at low redshift. The dipole, quadrupole, and octupole components are found to be aligned, exhibiting axial symmetry around a common axis ($l = 295^\circ,\, b = 5^\circ$). We interpret the observed fluctuations in the expansion rate within the framework of covariant cosmography. Our results indicate that the multipoles of the expansion rate fluctuation field are primarily driven by a strong quadrupole in the covariant Hubble parameter, together with dipole and octupole contributions from the covariant deceleration parameter. These few parameters suffice to reconstruct the luminosity distance with high precision out to $z \sim 0.1$, in a manner that is model–independent, non–perturbative, and free from assumptions about peculiar velocities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Warm Jupiter Migration Pathways with Eccentricities. I. Catalog of Uniform Keplerian Fits to Radial Velocities of 200 Warm Jupiters</a><span class="id">[2510.02564]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Giant planets are expected to predominantly form beyond the water ice line and occasionally undergo inward migration. Unlike hot Jupiters, which can result from high-eccentricity tidal migration, warm Jupiters between 0.1-1 AU ($\approx$10–365 d) are in many ways more challenging to explain because they reside outside the tidal influence of their host stars. Warm Jupiters should therefore preserve traces of their origins as their eccentricities are directly related to their past interactions. We analyze the eccentricities of 200 warm Jupiters orbiting 194 Sun-like host stars (with FGKM spectral types) using 18,587 RV measurements across 40 high-resolution spectrographs. RVs are compiled from the literature and are supplemented with 540 new observations from MINERVA-Australis at Mt. Kent Observatory and the Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph at McDonald Observatory's Hobby-Eberly Telescope, which are timed to improve eccentricity constraints by sampling orbits near periastron passage. The overarching goal of this program is to establish the relative importance of giant planet migration channels through the largest homogeneous analysis of warm Jupiter orbital properties to date. In particular, we evaluate and compare the impact of different system architectures and host star characteristics on the population-level eccentricity distributions of warm Jupiters. Here, we present the target sample, observations, orbit fitting procedure, and parameter summary statistics of our survey. All orbit fit solutions, parameter posterior chains, and merged RV tables for each system are made publicly available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Warm Jupiter Migration Pathways with Eccentricities II. Correlations with Host Star Properties and Orbital Separation</a><span class="id">[2510.02591]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Warm Jupiters with orbital periods of $\approx$10-365 d represent a population of giant planets located well within the water ice line but beyond the region of tidal influence of their host star relevant for high-eccentricity tidal migration. Orbital eccentricities offer important clues about the formation and dynamical history of warm Jupiters because in situ formation and disk migration should imprint near-circular orbits whereas planet scattering should excite eccentricities. Based on uniform Keplerian fits of 18,587 RVs targeting 200 warm Jupiters, we use hierarchical Bayesian modeling to evaluate the impact of host star metallicity, stellar mass, and orbital separation on the reconstructed population-level eccentricity distributions. Warm Jupiters take on a broad range of eccentricities, and their population-level eccentricities are well modeled using a Beta distribution with $\alpha$ = 1.00$^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$ and $\beta$ = 2.79$^{+0.28}_{-0.26}$. We find that 27$^{+3}_{-4}\%$ of warm Jupiters have eccentricities consistent with near-circular orbits ($e$ $&lt;$ 0.1), suggesting that most warm Jupiters (73$^{+3}_{-3}\%$) detected are dynamically hot. Warm Jupiters orbiting metal-rich stars are more eccentric than those orbiting metal-poor stars – in agreement with earlier findings – but no differences are observed as a function of stellar host mass or orbital separation, at least within the characteristic ranges probed by our sample ($\approx$0.5–2.0 $M_{\odot}$ and 0.1–1 AU, respectively). In this sense, metallicity plays a larger role in shaping the underlying eccentricity distribution of warm Jupiters than stellar mass or final orbital distance. These results are broadly consistent with planet scattering playing a major role in shaping the orbital architectures of close-in giant planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolutionary Map of the Universe: Detection of the Wolf-Rayet Star WR40</a><span class="id">[2510.02615]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a radio-continuum detection of the well-known Wolf-Rayet star WR40 at 943.5 MHz using observations from the EMU survey. We find that the shell surrounding WR40, known as RCW 58, has a flux density of 158.9+/-15.8 mJy and the star itself is 0.41+/-0.04 mJy. The shell size is found to be 9' x 6', which matches well with the shell in Halpha and is similarly matched to the shell at 22 um in infrared. Using Gaia data, we derive a linear size of 7.32(+/-0.34) x 4.89(+/-0.23) pc at a distance of 2.79+/-0.13 kpc. We use previous ATCA observations at 8.64, 4.80, and 2.4 GHz to determine a spectral index of WR40, which is estimated to be alpha = 0.80+/-0.11, indicating that the emission from the star is thermal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The H.E.S.S. Gravitational Wave and Gamma-Ray Burst Follow-Up Programs</a><span class="id">[2510.02687]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astrophysics have experienced rapid growth over the past decade, seeking a complete picture of different cosmic phenomena. Transient sources, in particular, benefit from the input of multi-messenger observations, offering complementary perspectives on the same event while maximizing the detection probability of a rapidly fading signal. In this context, Gravitational Wave (GW) detections serve as perfect triggers for potential counterpart detections. Notably, a GW alert could be associated with a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), jetted cataclysmic events produced either by the collision of a binary neutron star system or a core-collapse supernova. These sources also radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing detection by X- and gamma-ray instruments aboard various satellites and thus enabling multi-wavelength triggering opportunities. The strong interest in minimizing reaction time to capture the full-time evolution of the emission, together with the often challenging localization uncertainties of the alerts, underscores the need for rapid and well-coordinated follow-up programs such as the one developed by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration. This contribution will give an overview of the transient follow-up strategy carried out by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration, from the external alert trigger and the automatic reaction of the observatory to the various analysis steps of the obtained observations. To illustrate this comprehensive strategy, we will show two examples of follow-up observations of both GRBs and GWs, highlighting key results and challenges in the search for an associated high-energy gamma-ray emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02693" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Stellar Activity in a Sample of Active M Dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2510.02693]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Most M dwarfs show higher chromospheric activity, often exceeding solar levels. Characterizing stellar activity is essential, particularly since these stars are prime targets in the search for habitable exoplanets. We investigate the stellar activity of active M dwarfs using TESS photometry combined with spectroscopic observations. We explore relations between flare occurrence rate (FOR), flare energies, rotation period, starspot filling factor, and chromospheric indicators. We also examine correlations between flare amplitude, duration, and cumulative flare frequency distributions to probe the mechanisms behind magnetic activity. We find that FOR is flat across spectral types M0-M4 but declines for cooler M dwarfs. Rapid rotators ($P_{\rm rot} &lt; 1$ day) display significantly higher FOR and flare activity. M dwarfs with higher FOR tend to have lower flare amplitudes, suggesting that frequent flares are generally less energetic. For stars with 0.15–0.76 $M_\odot$, the median $L_{H\alpha}/L_{\rm bol}$ varies by a factor of 2.5 across mass bins of 0.1 $M_\odot$, while $\Delta$EW decreases by 92\%. The cumulative flare frequency distributions show a decrease in the power-law slope from M0 to M5, with $\alpha$ ranging from 1.68 to 1.95. Our results indicate a transition in stellar activity near M4, where stronger H$\alpha$ emission coincides with higher FOR. We confirm that chromospheric and flare activity follow a power-law relation, highlighting the interplay between magnetic fields and flaring in M dwarfs. We also find that fast rotators sustain frequent flaring through strong dynamos, and that highly active stars dissipate magnetic energy via numerous low-energy flares rather than rare high-energy ones.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02740" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Features in the Cosmic Ray Energy Spectrum Observed with Telescope Array Surface Detectors</a><span class="id">[2510.02740]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are extremely energetic charged particles that originate from outer space. The Telescope Array (TA) experiment, the largest UHECR observatory in the Northern Hemisphere, has provided high-precision measurements of the cosmic ray energy spectrum due to its stable operation and efficient data collection. These measurements have revealed three significant spectral features: the ankle, shoulder, and cutoff. Analyzing these features is crucial for understanding the origin and propagation of UHECRs. In this talk, we will present the latest energy spectrum measured by the TA surface detectors and discuss the observed differences in the UHECR energy spectrum between the northern and southern skies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">H.E.S.S. observations of SN 2024ggi</a><span class="id">[2510.02796]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernova (SN) explosions interacting with dense circumstellar medium are considered to be very promising sites for efficient cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration and subsequent emission of neutral-pion-decay gamma rays. These environments share similarities with already detected gamma-ray novae, but with much greater available energy content, so it is important to characterize their emission in the very-high-energy range. We present the results of H.E.S.S. observations of one such candidate source - SN 2024ggi, located in NGC 3621 at a distance of 7.24 Mpc. A total of 30 hours of data, gathered throughout a month of post-explosion observations, provide flux upper limits that are used to constrain source parameters, offering meaningful insights for theoretical predictions. We exclude bright gamma-ray emission in the first day after explosion, and later upper limits are consistent with wind densities derived from optical observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02802" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TeV Emission from PSR B1055-52 with HESS: Evidence for a Pulsar Halo</a><span class="id">[2510.02802]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar halos are a recently identified class of TeV $\gamma$-ray sources, offering valuable insights into the evolution of pulsar systems at the highest energies. However, only a handful of such sources have been detected so far, making each new identification critical for understanding the properties of the population as a whole. We report the first detection of extended very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray emission around PSR B1055$-$52 using observations from the H.E.S.S. array. This middle-aged pulsar, previously grouped together with Geminga and PSR B0656$+$14 as part of the “Three Musketeers”, has now been confirmed to host a TeV pulsar halo, making it the third detected system of its kind, and the first TeV pulsar halo discovered in the southern hemisphere. Our analysis performed in an energy range of $0.3-60\,$TeV, reveals gamma-ray emission with a one sigma extension of $(2.05 \pm 0.32)^\circ$. The analysis indicates that the emission extends beyond the region which was observed with H.E.S.S.. No significant spectral variation is detected across the emission. The diffusion coefficient derived for this halo is significantly lower than the standard ISM value, aligning with findings in the Geminga halo and indicating that slow diffusion may be a common property of pulsar halos. The detection of this new TeV pulsar halo provides a crucial data point for studying the population-wide properties of pulsar halos, their impact on cosmic-ray propagation, and their role as a source of Galactic electrons and positrons.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Band Splitting in m-Type II radio Bursts and their Role in Coronal Parameter Diagnostics</a><span class="id">[2510.02821]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type II radio bursts are signatures of shock waves generated by solar eruptions, observed at radio wavelengths. While metric (m) type II bursts originate in the lower corona, their longer-wavelength (up to kilometers) counterparts extend into interplanetary space. A rare but valuable feature observed in some type II bursts is band splitting in their dynamic spectra, which provides crucial insights into physical parameters such as shock speed, Alfvén Mach number, Alfvén speed, and coronal magnetic field strength (B). In this study, we investigate band-splitting in 44 m-type II radio bursts observed by the Radio Solar Telescope Network during solar cycle 24 (2009 – 2019). These events exhibit splitting in both fundamental and harmonic bands and are analyzed under both perpendicular and parallel shocks. All events are associated to solar flares and 41 (93 \%) with the coronal mass ejections. Shock speeds, derived using a hybrid coronal density model proposed by \cite{Vrsnak2004}, range from $\approx$ 350 to 1727 \kms. The relative bandwidth (BDW) of the split bands remains constant with frequency and height. Alfvén Mach numbers indicate moderate shock strength (1.06 – 3.38), while Alfvén speeds and $B$ vary from $\approx$ 230 – 1294 \kms\ and $\approx$ 0.48 – 7.13 G, respectively. Power-law relationships are established as $BDW \propto f_L^{-0.4}$ and $BDW \propto R^{\sim1}$, while the coronal magnetic field decreases with height as $B \propto R^{\sim-3}$. These results enhance our understanding of shock dynamics and magnetic field structures in the solar corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02831" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling the Excitation, Propagation and Damping of Quasi-Periodic Fast Magnetosonic Waves in Realistic Coronal Active Region Magnetic Field Structures</a><span class="id">[2510.02831]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quasi-periodic fast propagating magnetosonic waves (QFPs) were discovered in the solar corona in EUV since the launch of SDO spacecraft more than a decade ago. The QFP waves are associated with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) providing information on flare pulsations as well as on the magnetic field by MHD wave seismology. Previous models of QFP waves used primarily idealized magnetic active region structures. However, more realistic active region numerical models are needed to improve the application of coronal seismology to observations of waves in coronal structures. Here, we extend the previous models by including realistic magnetic configuration based on an observed coronal active region in a case study using AR 11166 observed on March 10, 2011 by SDO/AIA, using potential field extrapolation of photospheric magnetic field with realistic gravitationally stratified density structure { with typical coronal temperature} in our resistive 3D MHD model. We aim at reproducing the observed QFPs properties, such as directionality, propagation, reflection, nonlinearity, and damping of these waves. We model various forms of excitation of QFPs through time dependent boundary conditions, and localized pulses at the base of the corona. We produce synthetic emission measure (EM) maps from the 3D MHD modeling results to facilitate comparison to EUV observations. We find that the present more realistic model provides better qualitative agreement with observations compared to previous idealized models, improving the study of QFP wave excitation, propagation and damping in coronal ARs, with potential applications to coronal seismology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A supermassive black hole under the radar: repeating X-ray variability in a Seyfert galaxy</a><span class="id">[2510.02832]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the last few years, a few supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have shown short-term (of the order of hours) X-ray variability. Given the limited size of the sample, every new addition to this class of SMBHs can bring invaluable information. Within the context of an automated search for X-ray sources showing flux variability in the \textit{Chandra} archive, we identified peculiar variability patterns in 2MASX J12571076+2724177 (J1257), a SMBH in the Coma cluster, during observations performed in 2020. We investigated the long-term evolution of the flux, together with the evolution of the spectral parameters throughout the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, which cover a time span of approximately 20 years. We found that J1257 has repeatedly shown peculiar variability over the last 20 years, on typical timescales of $\simeq20-25$ ks. From our spectral analysis, we found hints of a softer-when-brighter behaviour and of two well-separated flux states. We suggest that J1257 might represent a new addition to the ever-growing size of relatively low mass SMBHs ($M\simeq10^6-10^7\mathrm{M}_\odot$) showing extreme, possibly quasi-periodic X-ray variability on short time scales. The available dataset does not allow for a definitive classification of the nature of the variability. However, given the observed properties, it could either represent a quasi-periodic oscillation at particularly low frequency or be associated with quasi-periodic eruptions in an AGN with peculiar spectral properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02834" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hunt for the mHz variability in the TESS and XMM-Newton observations of nova-like cataclysmic variables</a><span class="id">[2510.02834]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analysed the flickering of selected nova-like cataclysmic variables observed by the TESS satellite and XMM-Newton.

We found a new optical $f_{\rm b}$ in three nova-like systems and confirmed that the value of this frequency is clustered around 1 mHz. V504 Cen and V751 Cyg show possible X-ray counterparts of $f_{\rm b}$ that had previously only been seen in MV Lyr. This points towards the very central disc for source localisation.

V3885 Sgr and V1193 Ori show flaring activity in the long-term light curve during which TESS observations were made. The corresponding PDSs show changes in shape and disappearance of $f_{\rm b}$. TT Ari and SGRt 062340.2-265715 exhibit smooth changes in the long-term optical light curve, and the corresponding TESS observations show variable $f_{\rm b}$ during these changes. $f_{\rm b}$ is higher for lower brightness, which was seen only in MV Lyr so far.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analysis of the Supernova Remnant IC 443 using H.E.S.S.

This makes it a key target for investigating the mechanisms of cosmic-ray acceleration and gamma-ray production, particularly in the context of supernova remnants as potential sources of PeV cosmic rays. This work presents a first analysis of the region as observed by H.E.S.S.. We detect extended very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from IC 443, consistent with previous observations by VERITAS and MAGIC. A multi-wavelength comparison incorporating data from Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, and VERITAS strongly supports a hadronic origin of the observed emission, and highlights the presence of relativistic protons interacting with the surrounding molecular cloud. These findings reinforce the role of IC 443 as a key laboratory for studying supernova remnants as cosmic-ray accelerators and their interaction with their surrounding mediums.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The chemical DNA of the Magellanic Clouds III. The first, extragalactic Mg-K anticorrelation: the LMC globular cluster NGC 1786</a><span class="id">[2510.02846]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we derived [K/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios for six stars of the old globular cluster NGC 1786 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We employed high-resolution spectra acquired with the MIKE spectrograph mounted at the Magellan/Clay telescope. We found a clear Mg-K anticorrelation among the analyzed stars. In particular, the Mg-poor stars ([Mg/Fe] &lt; 0.0 dex) are enriched by   0.25 dex in [K/Fe] compared to the Mg-rich stars ([Mg/Fe] &gt; 0.0 dex). This finding makes NGC 1786 the first globular cluster residing in an external galaxy in which such extreme chemical anomaly has been detected. The observed trend nicely agrees with those observed in Galactic globular clusters hosting Mg-poor stars, such as NGC 2808, and Omega Centauri suggesting that such chemical anomaly is an ubiquitous feature of old, massive, and metal-poor stellar systems and it does not depend on the properties of the parent galaxy in which the cluster formed. Also, Na-O and Mg-Al anticorrelations were detected among the stars of NGC 1786. The newly discovered Mg-K anticorrelation reinforces the idea that stars capable of activating the complete MgAl cycle are responsible for the observed chemical anomalies in these clusters. In this context, asymptotic giant branch stars seem to be a valuable model since they are able to produce K while depleting Mg. However, the precise and complete physics of this model remains a subject of debate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02907" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral nature of Sco X-1 observed using the X-ray SPECtroscopy and Timing (XSPECT) payload on-board XPoSat</a><span class="id">[2510.02907]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scorpius X-1 is the brightest and first discovered X-ray source in the sky. Studying this source in the low-energy band has been challenging in the past due to its high brightness. However, with the X-ray SPECtroscopy and Timing (XSPECT) payload on-board Indias first X-ray Polarimetry Satellite (XPoSat), we have the capability to study the source despite its very high brightness, thanks to the fast (1 ms) readout of the instrument. We investigate the evolution of the spectral and timing properties of Sco X-1 across the horizontal, normal, and flaring branch, as observed with XSPECT. We examine changes in the spectral parameters as a function of position on the color-color diagram (CCD). Spectral studies indicate that the soft X-ray emission can be modeled using a multicolor disk component, with the inner disk temperature ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 keV. The hard component is described by a Comptonized continuum using either the nthComp or Comptb model with electron temperatures from 2.4 to 4.7 keV and optical depth between 5 and 14. Additionally, we observe the presence of an iron K-alpha line at 6.6 keV and an iron K-beta line at 7.6 keV. Both spectral models suggest a steep rise in Comptonization flux as well as disk flux in the flaring branch. An increase in neutron star blackbody temperature and inner disk temperature are also observed during flaring. The Z-track is driven by changes in the optical depth of the corona, the Comptonization flux and the disk flux and the inner disk temperature. No quasi-periodic oscillations are detected in any branch, suggesting their association with the high-energy spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is there a unique asteroseismic interior model for the solar-like oscillating KIC 7747078?</a><span class="id">[2510.02925]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Asteroseismology provides a direct observational window into the structure and evolution of stars. While spectroscopic and photometric methods only provide information about the surface properties of stars, asteroseismology, through the analysis of oscillation frequencies, offers comprehensive information about the deep stellar interior as well as the surface. The scattering of effective temperature (Teff) determined from the spectrum and degeneracy in the Hertzsprung Russell diagram poses challenges in developing a unique interior model for a single star. Although observational asteroseismic data partially lift this degeneracy, the best model that meets all asteroseismic constraints is not obtained. Most models reported in the literature typically address the large separation Dnu constraint between oscillation frequencies, which is a critical issue, especially in post main sequence stars. Reference frequencies, influenced by helium ionisation zone induced glitches in oscillation frequencies, are instrumental in refining models. Using the high metallicity derived from the colors of the Kepler Legacy star KIC 7747078, we obtain the masses of models M as 1.208 Msun and 1.275 Msun using the reference frequencies and individual frequencies as constraints, respectively. By applying the chi2 method using these reference frequencies, Dnu, and surface metallicity determined from the spectrum, we develop a unique star model with a mass of 1.171 pm 0.019 Msun, a radius of 1.961 pm 0.011 Rsun, an effective temperature of 5993 K, an initial metallicity of 0.0121, and an age of 5.15 pm 0.29 Gyr. A significant advantage of this method is that Teff emerges as an output, not a constraint. The mixed mode oscillation frequencies of this model align well with the observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Role of Asteroseismology in Understanding Mass Loss in Red Giants</a><span class="id">[2510.02931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Red giant stars play a key role in advancing our understanding of stellar mass loss. However, its initial mass and the amount of mass lost during this phase remain uncertain. In this study, we investigate the asteroseismic signatures of mass loss and the parameters that influence it. We examine six stars identified as red giant branch (RGB) stars in the APOKASC-2 catalog. Assuming these stars are on their first ascent of the RGB, we construct interior models. The resulting model ages are significantly older than the age of the Galaxy, indicating that these stars are likely experiencing mass loss and evolving toward the red clump (RC) phase. The minimum possible initial masses are estimated using the mass-metallicity diagram, from which we infer that the minimum mass lost by these stars ranges from $0.1$-$0.3{\rm M}_{\odot}$. Models constructed with an initial minimum mass yield the maximum possible age of the star. The ages of these models fall within the range of 9-9.5Gyr. For two stars, asteroseismic parameters confirm RC classification. Due to degeneracies in the HR diagram, distinguishing between internal structure models is challenging; however, asteroseismic constraints provide clear differentiation. Although mass-loss and mass-conservation models have similar $M$, $R$, and $T_{\rm eff}$ values, $\Delta\nu$s determined from the $l$=0 modes in the mass-loss models are 5-10$\%$ higher than observed. This discrepancy may arise from differences in internal structure. Finally, evolutionary model grids are used to examine how initial mass and $Z$ affect mass loss. Mass loss increases with increasing metallicity and decreases with increasing initial mass, regardless of the adopted value of $\eta$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An analysis of the solar differential rotation in solar cycle No. 19 (1954-1964) determined using Kanzelhoehe sunspot group positions</a><span class="id">[2510.03002]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study solar differential rotation (DR) for solar cycle No. 19 (1954-1964) by tracing sunspot groups on the sunspot drawings of Kanzelhoehe Observatory for Solar and Environmental Research (KSO). Our aim is to extend previous DR analysis from the KSO data (1964-2016) to the years prior to 1964 to create a catalog of sunspot group positions and DR parameters from KSO sunspot drawings and white light images. Synodic angular rotation velocities were first determined using the daily shift (DS) and robust linear least-squares fit (rLSQ) methods, then converted to sidereal velocities, and used to derive solar DR parameters. We compare the DR parameters obtained from different sources and analyse the north-south asymmetry of rotation for solar cycle No. 19. It has been shown that our results for the equatorial rotation velocity (parameter A) and the gradient of DR (parameter B) coincide with earlier results from the KSO data (performed with a different method), as well as with results from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO) and the Yunnan Observatories (YNAO). In contrast, the values of parameter A from three different earlier studies based on the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) exhibit statistically significant differences when compared to the values of parameter A derived from KSO, KoSO and YNAO. These findings suggest that the GPR data have the largest inconsistency compared to the other three data sources, highlighting the need for further analysis to identify the causes of these discrepancies. The analysis of the north-south asymmetry in the solar rotation profile using two different methods shows that the DR parameters of the hemispheres coincide, indicating a rotational symmetry around the equator. This is consistent with previous results from KSO and YNAO data. However, all sources indicate slightly higher equatorial rotation velocities in the southern hemisphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for dark matter around intermediate mass black holes with the H.E.S.S. experiment</a><span class="id">[2510.03023]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), with masses ranging from a hundred and a million solar masses, are hypothesised to be surrounded by dense regions of dark matter known as dark matter spikes, where the annihilation of dark matter particles could produce detectable gamma rays. The detection of dark matter annihilation around IMBHs therefore offers a promising approach for probing the nature of dark matter. In this work, we search for dark matter annihilation around IMBHs using data from the Galactic Plane Survey, the Extragalactic Survey and a selection of satellite galaxies observed by the H.E.S.S. gamma-ray experiment in Namibia. Since no evidence for a gamma-ray signal from dark matter annihilation around IMBHs has been found, we set upper limits on the velocity-weighted annihilation cross section for dark matter masses between 800 GeV and 100 TeV.

Predictions for magnetic interactions and white-dwarf accretion scenarios</a><span class="id">[2510.03026]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>About 12 percent of the early-type Be stars, so-called gamma Cas stars, exhibit an unusually hard and bright thermal X-ray emission that could result from accretion onto a white dwarf companion or from magnetic interactions between the Be star and its decretion disk. Exploring the full power of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of gamma Cas stars requires comparison of observations of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines near 6.4 keV with synthetic profiles of this line complex computed in the framework of the magnetic interaction and the accreting WD scenarios. For the latter, we further distinguish between accretion onto a non-magnetic and a magnetic WD. Our models account for different reservoirs of reprocessing material: the Be circumstellar decretion disk, the Be photosphere, an accretion disk around the WD companion, a magnetically channelled accretion flow and the WD photosphere. We find considerably different line properties for the different scenarios. For a non-magnetic accreting WD, the global Fe Kalpha complex is extremely broad, reaching a full width of 140 eV, whilst it is   40 eV for the magnetic star-disk interaction and the magnetic accreting WD cases. In the magnetic star-disk interaction, the line centroid follows the orbital motion of the Be star, whereas it moves along with the WD in the case of an accreting WD. For gamma Cas, given the 15 times larger amplitude of the WD orbital motion, the shift in position for an accreting WD should be easily detectable with high-resolution spectrographs such as Resolve on XRISM, but remains essentially undetectable for the magnetic star-disk interaction. Upcoming high-resolution spectroscopy of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines in the X-ray spectra of gamma Cas stars will thus allow to distinguish between the competing scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BaBy Cosmic Tension</a><span class="id">[2510.03118]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that the recently released B-mode polarisation data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) favour a non-vanishing contribution of primordial gravitational waves of inflationary origin which is in tension with the previous BICEP-Keck (BK) measurements.

While systematic (model) uncertainties have been thoroughly studied, the statistical (parameter) ones have been more rarely explored, as constraining them is more challenging. We present here a methodology to determine coherently parameter uncertainties by anchoring the theoretical uncertainties to the experimentally known nuclear properties through the use of the Backward Forward Monte Carlo method. We use this methodology for two nucleosynthesis processes: the intermediate neutron capture process (i-process) and the rapid neutron capture process (r-process). We determine coherently for the i-process the uncertainties from the (n,$\gamma$) rates while we explore the impact of nuclear mass uncertainties for the r-process. The effect of parameter uncertainties on the final nucleosynthesis is in the same order as model uncertainties, suggesting the crucial need for more experimental constraints on key nuclei of interest. We show how key nuclear properties, such as relevant (n,$\gamma$) rates impacting the i-process tracers, could enhance tremendously the prediction of stellar evolution models by experimentally constraining them.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimising the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array and towards precision pulsar timing with SKA-mid</a><span class="id">[2510.03139]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are Galactic-scale nanohertz-frequency gravitational wave (GW) detectors. Recently, several PTAs have found evidence for the presence of GWs in their datasets, but none of them have achieved a community-defined definitive (&gt; 5$\sigma$) detection. Here, we identify limiting noise sources for PTAs and quantify their impact on sensitivity to GWs under different observing and noise modelling strategies. First, we search for intrinsic pulse jitter in a sample of 89 MSPs observed by the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array and obtain new jitter measurements for 20 MSPs. We then forecast jitter noise in pulsars for the future SKA-Mid telescope, finding that the timing precision of many of the best-timed MSPs would be dominated by jitter noise. We then consider dispersion measure variations from the interstellar medium and find that their effects are best mitigated by modelling them as a stationary Gaussian process with a power-law spectrum. Improving upon the established hasasia code for PTA sensitivity analysis, we assess the timing potential of the lower frequency UHF-band (544$-$1088 MHz) of MeerKAT and find a potential increase in GW background sensitivity by $\approx 8$\%, relative to observing at L-band. We show that this improvement relies on assumptions on the propagation through the interstellar medium, and highlight that if observing frequency-dependent propagation effects, such as scattering noise, are present, where noise is not completely correlated across observing frequency, then the improvement is significantly diminished. Using the multi-frequency receivers and sub-arraying flexibility of MeerKAT, we find that focussed, high-cadence observations of the best MSPs can enhance the sensitivity of the array for both the continuous GWs and stochastic GWB. These results highlight the role of MeerKAT and the MPTA in the context of international GW search efforts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Far beyond the Sun: III.

Over a nearly three-year campaign, the technique of Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI) was used to reconstruct 18 maps of the large-scale surface magnetic field of the star. These maps trace the evolution of the magnetic field morphology over approximately 139 stellar rotations. Our analysis uncovers pronounced temporal evolution, including multiple polarity reversals and changes in field strength and geometry. We examine the evolution of the poloidal and toroidal field components, with the toroidal component showing strong modulation in concert with the chromospheric activity. Furthermore, for the first time, we reconstruct stellar magnetic butterfly diagrams which are used to trace the migration of large-scale magnetic features across the stellar surface, determining a magnetic polarity reversal timescale of roughly 100 rotations ($\sim773$ d). In addition, by tracking the field-weighted latitudinal positions, we obtain the first estimates of the large-scale flow properties on a star other than the Sun, identifying possible pole-ward and equator-ward drift speeds for different field polarities. These results provide critical insights into the dynamo processes operating in young solar-type stars and offer a direct comparison with the solar magnetic cycle.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HESS J1831$-$098 - Exploring a pulsar halo scenario with H.E.S.S. data</a><span class="id">[2510.03183]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar halos are a class of extended very-high-energy (VHE) sources highlighted by the HAWC observatory towards the Geminga pulsar and PSR B0656$+$14.

Our aim is to search for new pulsar halos using H.E.S.S. data and to constrain their physical properties. Using a physically-motivated model of pulsar halos, we created template-based models of the spatial and energetic distributions of the expected gamma-ray emission using the Gammapy library. A promising candidate source to which this model can be effectively applied is HESS J1831$-$098, an extended VHE source spatially coincident with two energetic pulsars, which also exhibits spectral continuity and morphological compatibility with the ultra-high-energy source 1LHAASO J1831$-$1007u*.

However, we show that the location of this reversal is highly spin-dependent, shifting progressively closer to the ISCO, where gravitational-wave emission completely dominates the inspiral, as the spin of the central black hole increases. Spin also modifies the radial dependence of the Lindblad torques. We investigate whether Lindblad torques can be approximated by parametrised power laws of the form T_LR = A(r_s / 10M)^n_r (or combinations thereof), and find significant spin- and disc-dependent variations in the slope parameter n_r.

We compare the performance of an Eulerian galaxy bias expansion, using state-of-art prescriptions from the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFTofLSS), against a hybrid approach based on Lagrangian perturbation theory and high-resolution simulations. These models are benchmarked against comoving snapshots of the Flagship I N-body simulation at $z=(0.9,1.2,1.5,1.8)$, which have been populated with H$\alpha$ galaxies leading to catalogues of millions of objects within a volume of about $58\,h^{-3}\,{\rm Gpc}^3$. Our analysis suggests that both models can be used to provide a robust inference of the parameters $(h, \omega_{\rm c})$ in the redshift range under consideration, with comparable constraining power. We additionally determine the range of validity of the EFTofLSS model in terms of scale cuts and model degrees of freedom. From these tests, it emerges that the standard third-order Eulerian bias expansion can accurately describe the full shape of the real-space galaxy power spectrum up to the maximum wavenumber $k_{\rm max}=0.45\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, even with a measurement precision well below the percent level. In particular, this is true for a configuration with six free nuisance parameters, including local and non-local bias parameters, a matter counterterm, and a correction to the shot-noise contribution. Fixing either tidal bias parameters to physically-motivated relations still leads to unbiased cosmological constraints. We finally repeat our analysis assuming a volume that matches the expected footprint of Euclid, but without considering observational effects, as purity and completeness, showing that we can get consistent cosmological constraints over this range of scales and redshifts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESI results: Hint towards coupled dark matter and dark energy</a><span class="id">[2503.10806]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a scenario where a dark energy quintessence field $\phi$ with positive kinetic energy is coupled with dark matter. With two different self-interaction potentials for the field and a particular choice of the coupling function, we show explicitly how the observable effective equation of state parameter $w_{\rm eff}$ for the dark energy field crosses the phantom barrier ($w_{\rm eff} = -1$) while keeping the equation of state of the quintessence field $w_\phi &gt; -1$. With appropriate choices of parameters, $w_{\rm eff}$ crosses the phantom divide around redshift $z\sim 0.5$, transitioning from $w_{\rm eff} &lt;-1$ in the past to $w_{\rm eff}&gt;-1$ today. This explains DESI observations well. Our analysis reveals that the model remains consistent within the $2\sigma$ confidence intervals provided by DESI for several combinations of the scalar field parameters, highlighting its potential in explaining the dynamics of dark energy arising from a simple Yukawa-type long-range interaction in the dark sector. While the current findings offer a promising framework for interpreting DESI observations, future work, including a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, is necessary to constrain the parameter space further and strengthen the statistical significance of the results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How much has DESI dark energy evolved since DR1?</a><span class="id">[2504.04417]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>DESI has reported a dynamical dark energy (DE) signal based on the $w_0 w_a$CDM model that is in conflict with Hubble tension. Recalling that the combination of DESI DR1 BAO and DR1 full-shape (FS) modeling are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, in this letter we comment on the status of fluctuations in DR1 BAO documented in \cite{DESI:2024mwx, Colgain:2024xqj} in the DR2 update. In particular, we note that neither DR1 BAO nor DR2 BAO nor DR2 BAO+CMB confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model with relaxed model parameter priors confirm late-time accelerated expansion today. Translating DESI BAO constraints into flat $\Lambda$CDM constraints, we observe that the LRG1 constraint remains the most prominent outlier, a distinction now held jointly with ELG1, LRG2 switches from smaller to larger $\Omega_m$ values relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM, and ELG data drive the relatively low $\Omega_m$ in the full DR2 BAO. We observe that one cannot restore $w_0 = -1$ within one $1 \sigma$ by removing either LRG1 or ELG1 or LRG2, but LRG2 in DR2, in contrast to LRG1 in DR1, now has the greatest bearing on $w_0 &gt; -1$. We conclude that BAO has yet to stabilise, but the general trend is towards greater consistency with DESI DR1 FS modeling results, where there may be no dynamical DE signal in DESI data alone.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assessing the Role of Intrinsic Variability in Black Hole Parameter Inference using Multi-Epoch EHT Data</a><span class="id">[2504.05472]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* provide a means of constraining parameters of both the black hole and its surrounding plasma. However, intrinsic variability of the emitting material introduces a major source of systematic uncertainty, complicating parameter inference. The precise origin and structure of this variability remain uncertain, and previous studies have largely relied on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to estimate its effects. Here, we fit a semi-analytic, dual-cone model of the emitting plasma to multiple years of EHT observations to empirically assess the impact of intrinsic variability and improved array coverage on key measurements including the black hole mass-to-distance ratio, spin, and viewing inclination. Despite substantial differences in the images of the two epochs, we find that the inferred mass-to-distance ratio remains stable and mutually consistent. The black hole spin is unconstrained for both observations, despite the improved baseline coverage in 2018. The inferred position angle and inclination of the black hole spin axis are discrepant between the two years, suggesting that variability and model misspecification contribute significantly to the total error budget for these quantities. Our findings highlight both the promise and challenges of multi-epoch EHT observations: while they can refine parameter constraints, they also reveal the limitations of simple parametric models in capturing the full complexity of the source. Our analysis – the first to fit semi-analytic emission models to 2018 EHT observations – underscores the importance of systematic uncertainty quantification from intrinsic variability in future high-resolution imaging studies of black hole environments and the role of repeated observations in quantifying these uncertainties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09036" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crust composition and the Shallow Heat Source in KS 1731-260</a><span class="id">[2504.09036]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The presence of a strong shallow heat source of unknown origin in accreting neutron star crusts has been inferred by analyzing X-ray observations of their cooling in quiescence.

Determining the extent and duration of habitability (i.e., sustained habitability) requires characterizing the interior properties and the level and distribution of tidal heating in Enceladus. Inferring the intensity of geophysical activity in the core has direct implications for the potential hydrothermal activity and supply of chemical species important for habitability to the ocean. We build a statistical framework to constrain the interior using estimates of libration, shape, heat flux, gravity, and total mass. We use this framework to examine the extent that geodetic measurements can improve our understanding of the interior structure, with an emphasis on partitioning of dissipation between the shell and the core. We quantify plausible ranges of gravitational (k2) and displacement (h2, l2) tidal Love numbers consistent with existing observations. We demonstrate that measuring k2 alone can only constrain the total tidally dissipated energy, but not its radial distribution. However, measuring the amplitude and phase of h2 or l2 facilitates determining the extent of tidal dissipation in the shell and the core. We provide the precisions required for measuring k2, h2, and l2 that enable distinguishing between the main tidal heating scenarios, i.e., in the shell versus the core. We also explore the effect of the structural heterogeneities of the shell on the tidal response. Lastly, we evaluate the efficacy of future geodetic measurements to constrain key interior properties essential to understand the present-day (instantaneous) and long-term (sustained) habitability at Enceladus.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The mass of the exo-Venus Gliese 12 b, as revealed by HARPS-N, ESPRESSO, and CARMENES</a><span class="id">[2506.20564]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Small temperate planets are prime targets for exoplanet studies due to their possible similarities with the rocky planets in the Solar System. M dwarfs are promising hosts since the planetary signals are within our current detection capabilities. Gliese 12 b is a Venus-sized temperate planet orbiting a quiet M dwarf. We present here the first precise mass measurement of this small exoplanet. We performed a detailed analysis using HARPS-N, ESPRESSO, and CARMENES radial velocities, along with new and archival \tess, \cheops, and MuSCAT2/3 photometry data. From fitting the available data, we find that the planet has a radius of $R_\mathrm{p} = 0.93\pm0.06 \,\mathrm{R_\oplus}$ and a mass of $M_\mathrm{p} = 0.95^{+0.29}_{-0.30} \,\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ (a $3.2\sigma$ measurement of the semi-amplitude $K=0.67\pm0.21\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$), and is on an orbit with a period of $12.761418^{+0.000060}_{-0.000055}\,\mathrm{d}$. A variety of techniques were utilised to attenuate stellar activity signals. Gliese 12 b has an equilibrium temperature of $T_\mathrm{eq}=317 \pm 8\,\mathrm{K}$, assuming an albedo of zero, and a density consistent with that of Earth and Venus ($\rho_\mathrm{p}=6.4\pm2.4\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$). We find that Gliese 12 b has a predominantly rocky interior and simulations indicate that it is unlikely to have retained any of its primordial gaseous envelope. The bulk properties of Gliese 12 b place it in an extremely sparsely populated region of both mass–radius and density–$T_\mathrm{eq}$ parameter space, making it a prime target for follow-up observations, including Lyman-$\alpha$ studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Listening Across the Cosmic Time: Standard Sirens from Ground- and Space-Based Missions in the Next Decade</a><span class="id">[2506.24030]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Precise measurement of the Hubble parameter will enable stringent tests of the standard model for cosmology. Standard sirens, using the luminosity distances measured by gravitational-wave observations of compact binary mergers, are expected to provide such measurements independently in the next decade. With the ground- and space-based gravitational wave observatories, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), different types of standard sirens altogether will place constraints across a wide redshift range. In this paper, we forecast the precisions of standard siren Hubble parameter measurements and compare various scenarios, accounting for the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty. Specifically, we find a $2\%$ constraint on $H_0$, a $1.5-3\%$ constraint on $H(z)$ at $z=1$, and a $3-5\%$ constraint on $H(z)$ at $z=7$ when combining LVK and LISA standard sirens with precise redshift measurements from electromagnetic counterpart observations. We do not find a significant improvement when including standard sirens with no EM counterpart, but which rely on features in the black hole mass distribution, and the potential systematics introduced by the possible redshift evolution of such features could further degrade the measurement accuracy if not properly accounted for.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11266" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poro-viscoelastic tidal heating of Io</a><span class="id">[2507.11266]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Io's tidally driven global volcanism indicates widespread partial melting in its mantle. How this melt participates in the interior dynamics, and, in particular, the role it plays in tidal dissipation, is poorly understood. We model Io's tidal deformation by treating its mantle as a two-phase (solid and melt) system. By combining poro-viscous and poro-elastic compaction theories in a Maxwell framework with a consistent model of tidal and self-gravitation, we produce the first self-consistent evaluation of Io's tidal heating rate due to shearing, compaction, and Darcy flow. We find that Darcy dissipation can potentially exceed shear heating, but only for large (0.05 to 0.2) melt fractions, and if the grain size is large or melt viscosity ultra-low. Since grain sizes larger than 1cm are unlikely, this suggests that Darcy dissipation is secondary to shear dissipation. Compaction dissipation is maximised when the asthenosphere is highly resistive to isotropic stresses, but contributes at most 1% of Io's observed heating rate. This work represents a crucial step toward a self-consistent quantitative theory for the dynamics of Io's partially molten interior.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing gravitational physics by combining DESI DR1 and weak lensing datasets using the E_G estimator</a><span class="id">[2507.16098]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The action of gravitational physics across space-time creates observable signatures in the behaviour of light and matter.

The overall morphology of planet–disc interactions has ben shown to be similar in both 2D and 3D simulations, however, the ability of a 2D simulation to quantitatively match 3D results depends strongly on how the potential of the planet is handled. Typically, the 2D planetary potential is smoothed out using some `smoothing length', a free parameter, for which different values have been proposed, depending on the particular aspect of the interaction focused on. In this paper, we re-derive 2D Navier–Stokes in detail for planet–disc interactions to find better ways to represent the 2D gravitational force. We perform a large suite of 2D and 3D simulations to test these force prescriptions. We identify the parts of the interaction that are fundamentally 3D, and test how well our new force prescriptions, as well as traditional smoothed potentials, are able to match 3D simulations. Overall, we find that the optimal way to represent the planetary potential is the `Bessel-type potential', but that even in this case 2D simulations are unable to reproduce the correct scaling of the total torque with background gradients, and are at best able match the one-sided Lindblad torque and gap widths to level of 10 per cent. We find that analysis of observed gap structures based on standard 2D simulations may systematically underestimate planetary masses by a factor of two, and discuss the impacts of 3D effects on observations of velocity kinks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Icy or Rocky?

Unlike previous research that either impose rigid assumptions or rely on simplified empirical profiles, our approach bridges both paradigms. Starting from randomly generated density profiles, we applied an iterative algorithm that converges towards models that simultaneously satisfy hydrostatic equilibrium, match the observed gravitational moments, and remain thermodynamically and compositionally consistent. The inferred interior models for Uranus and Neptune span a wide range of possible interior structures, in particular encompassing both water-dominated and rock-dominated configurations (rock-to-water mass ratios between 0.04-3.92 for Uranus and 0.20-1.78 for Neptune). All models contain convective regions with ionic water and have temperature-pressure profiles that remain above the demixing curves for hydrogen-helium-water mixtures. This offers both a plausible explanation for the observed non-dipolar magnetic fields and indicates that no hydrogen-helium-water demixing occurs. We find a higher H-He mass fraction in the outermost convection zones for Uranus (0.62-0.73) compared to Neptune (0.25-0.49) and that Uranus' magnetic field is likely generated deeper in the interior compared to Neptune. We infer upper limits of 0.69-0.74 (Uranus) versus 0.78-0.92 (Neptune) for the outer edges of the dynamo regions in units of normalised radii. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional classification of Uranus and Neptune as 'ice giants' and underscore the need for improved observational data or formation constraints to break compositional degeneracy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pan-STARRS follow-up of the gravitational-wave event S250818k and the lightcurve of SN 2025ulz</a><span class="id">[2510.01142]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Kilonovae are the scientifically rich, but observationally elusive, optical transient phenomena associated with compact binary mergers. Only a handful of events have been discovered to date, all through multi-wavelength (gamma ray) and multi-messenger (gravitational wave) signals. Given their scarcity, it is important to maximise the discovery possibility of new kilonova events. To this end, we present our follow-up observations of the gravitational-wave signal, S250818k, a plausible binary neutron star merger at a distance of $237 \pm 62$ Mpc. Pan-STARRS tiled 286 and 318 square degrees (32% and 34% of the 90% sky localisation region) within 3 and 7 days of the GW signal, respectively. ATLAS covered 70% of the skymap within 3 days, but with lower sensitivity. These observations uncovered 47 new transients; however, none were deemed to be linked to S250818k. We undertook an expansive follow-up campaign of AT 2025ulz, the purported counterpart to S250818k. The griz-band lightcurve, combined with our redshift measurement ($z = 0.0849 \pm 0.0003$) all indicate that SN 2025ulz is a SN IIb, and thus not the counterpart to S250818k. We rule out the presence of a AT 2017gfo-like kilonova within $\approx 27$% of the distance posterior sampled by our Pan-STARRS pointings ($\approx 9.1$% across the total 90% three-dimensional sky localisation). We demonstrate that early observations are optimal for probing the distance posterior of the three-dimensional gravitational-wave skymap, and that SN 2025ulz was a plausible kilonova candidate for $\lesssim 5$ days, before ultimately being ruled out.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08880" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Properties of general stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: circularity and beyond</a><span class="id">[2505.08880]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyse properties of general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes, with a particular focus on circularity – an accidental symmetry enjoyed by the Kerr metric, and therefore widely assumed when searching for rotating black hole solutions in alternative theories of gravity as well as when constructing models of Kerr mimickers.

This result opens the way to investigating the consequences of circularity breaking in a controlled manner. In particular, we construct two simple analytical examples of non-circular deformations of the Kerr spacetime. The first one is &quot;minimal&quot;, since the horizon and the ergosphere are identical to their Kerr counterparts, except for the fact that the horizon is not Killing and its surface gravity is therefore not constant. The second is &quot;not so minimal&quot;, as the horizon's profile can be chosen arbitrarily and the difference between the horizon and the so-called rotosurface can be appreciated.

Therefore, in this work, we are able to investigate the influence of the back-reaction strength on the various phase transitions, including the zeroth and first order phase transitions. In addition, we confirm that the influence of the 4th and 6th power terms on the superfluid phase transition in the case of finite back-reaction are qualitative the same as in the probe limit, thus present universality.

Surprisingly, the pion distribution predicted by this gluon distribution for the production of high-energy proton collisions could answer two puzzles in astronomy and high-energy physics. We find that during ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray collisions, gluon condensation may abruptly produce a large number of low-momentum pions, whose electromagnetic decays have the typical breakout properties appearing in various cosmic gamma-ray spectra. On the other hand, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is well below the cosmic ray energy scale, also shows weak but recognisable signs of gluon condensation, which had been mistaken for BEC pions. The connection between these two phenomena, which occur at different scales in the Universe, supports the existence of a new structure within the proton-gluon condensation.</p></div></details></article></body>
