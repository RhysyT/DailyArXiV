One of the key source classes of LISA is merging massive black hole binaries in the 1e4-1e7 Msun mass range detectable to very high redshifts $z\sim 15$. MBHBs lighter than 1e6 Msun can potentially be identified during their inspiral weeks before coalescence, allowing for complementary electromagnetic observations before, during, and after the two MBHs merge. This white paper aims at defining the optimal strategy to maximize the number of detected EM counterparts of LISA MBHB events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Velocity Coupled Radial Acceleration Ansatz for Disk-Galaxy Rotation Curves: Fits to SPARC, Bayesian Inference, and Parameter Identifiability</a><span class="id">[2512.21376]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observed rotation curves of disk galaxies remain a sharp empirical probe of the relationship between baryons and dynamics.

XIX. Structures of molecular outflows</a><span class="id">[2512.21454]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As part of the ALMA Large Program &quot;Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks&quot; (eDisk), 12CO (2 - 1) was observed towards 19 nearby low-mass protostars. Of these objects, 15 sources are found to show molecular outflow emission. Based on their morphological and kinematical structures, the CO outflows are classified into three types: a wind-driven shell, where ambient material is swept up by a wide-angle wind from the star, a bow shock, and a slow disk wind, which is a conical or parabolic flow with onion-like velocity structure. We categorize 11 outflows as a slow disk wind, 7 as a wind-driven shell, and 1 as a bow shock. Four of these outflows were found to show signs of both slow disk wind and wind-driven shell characteristics. Five objects show misalignment between the red- and blue-shifted outflows. Seven objects show significant misalignment between the outflow axis (either or both of the red- and blue-shifted outflows) and the minor axis of the dust continuum emission around the protostar. For the objects showing wind-driven shell emission, we compare simple parametrized models with the observations to derive physical properties of the observed shells, such as their dynamical ages. This shows evidence of a time variability in the outflows, such as changes in their direction. In some objects, large differences are seen between the properties of the red- and blue-shifted outflows, possibly indicating differences in the properties of the ambient medium with which the outflow interacts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical Simulations of the Circularized Accretion Flow in Population III Star Tidal Disruption Events. I. The Accretion Flow and the Wind</a><span class="id">[2512.21500]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) have recently been proposed as potential probes for Population III stars. However, the properties of the accretion flow and the wind from the Pop III star TDE system are not clear. By performing radiative hydrodynamic simulations, we study the 'circularized' accretion flow of the Pop III star TDE system. The masses of the black hole (BH) and the disrupted star are $10^6$ and $300$ solar masses, respectively. We focus on the properties of the wind. We find that the black hole accretion rate is highly super-Eddington. A strong wind is driven by radiation pressure. Due to the presence of a strong wind, only $25\%$–$35\%$ of the fallback debris is accreted by the BH. The remaining part is taken away by the wind. The kinetic power of the wind can be as high as $10^{46} {\rm \ erg \ s^{-1}}$. The properties of the wind obtained in this paper may be useful for understanding the radiation properties of Pop III star TDEs in the context of the wind 'reprocessing' model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21632" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can A Kinematically Hot and Thick Disk Form A Bar? : Role of Highly Spinning Dark Matter Halos</a><span class="id">[2512.21632]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent JWST observations claim the existence of a significant fraction of bars in the kinematically hotter and thicker disk at high redshift Universe. These observations challenge the current understanding of disk stability in galaxies similar to the Milky Way. The analytical work and N-body simulations suggest that the kinematically hot (dispersion-dominated) and thick disk are stable against bar formation. In this work, we perform the controlled N-body simulations of a kinematically hot and thick disk, which is residing in a non-rotating and spinning dark matter halo. We report that the disk, which is classically stable against bar instability in the live and non-rotating halo, leads to bar formation in a spinning halo environment. The spinning halo model is 8 times more efficient in transporting angular momentum from the disk to the halo compared to the non-spinning halo. We claim that Ostriker-Peebles and ELN bar formation criteria do not predict bar formation for both the non-roating and spinning halo. The recent criteria from Jang-Kim successfully predict the bar stability for the non-rotating halo model, but not for the spinning halo model. These results provide an important insight into the bar formation processes for thick and hot disks at high redshift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A systematic study on the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon emission features of nearby galaxies using AKARI near-IR spectra</a><span class="id">[2512.21674]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interstellar hydrocarbon dust containing aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is believed to be processed by various factors including UV radiation fields and mechanical shocks in the galactic environments. We systematically investigate the processing of hydrocarbon dust, especially the likely causes for the variations of the luminosity ratio of aliphatic to aromatic hydrocarbon emission features, using the near-infrared (IR) spectral features at wavelengths 3.3 um and 3.4-3.6 um observed with AKARI/IRC. We analyzed 243 near-IR spectra of 240 star-forming (U)LIRGs (the total IR luminosity, $L_\rm{IR}&gt;10^{11}\ L_\odot$), 119 spectra of 105 star-forming IRGs ($10^{10}\ L_\odot&lt;L_\rm{IR}&lt;10^{11}\ L_\odot$), and 94 spectra of 65 sub-IRGs ($L_\rm{IR}&lt;10^{10}\ L_\odot$), in addition to 232 spectra of 36 Galactic HII regions as a reference sample. We performed near-IR spectral model fitting to estimate the luminosities of the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon features and the HI recombination line Br$\rm{\alpha}$. The result indicates that the luminosity ratios of the aliphatic to the aromatic hydrocarbons ($L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$) in the sample galaxies show considerably large variations, compared to those in the Galactic HII regions, $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$ systematically decreasing with $L_\rm{IR}$ and $L_\rm{Br\alpha}$. We find that (sub-)IRGs with continuum colors bluer at 4 um tend to have higher $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$, which is likely to reflect the intrinsic nature of PAHs outside the HII region where the PAHs remain non-processed by strong UV radiation fields. We also find that some ULIRGs with continuum colors redder at 4 um show extremely low $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$, which is likely to be caused by blending aliphatic emission and absorption features due to the presence of an obscured galactic nucleus in merger systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The rotation curve of the Milky Way measured by Classical Cepheids from Gaia DR3</a><span class="id">[2512.21780]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We determine the rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way in the range 6 &lt; R &lt; 18 kpc using a sample of 903 carefully selected classical Cepheids with precise proper motions and high-quality radial velocities from \emph{Gaia} DR3. Their distances can be accurately measured from the well-known Period-Wesenheit relations. The RC is computed from the three-dimensional velocity components of these Cepheids. Generally, the RC shows a slight decline with distance from the Galactic center. On top of this general trend, the newly constructed RC shows a dip around R   10-11 kpc, followed by a bump around R   13-14 kpc. This feature has also been reported in other RC measurements, mostly in RCs traced by young tracers like Cepheids. To better constrain the Milky Way mass, an averaged RC is then constructed by combining measurements from this work and previous efforts. Due to the ambiguous nature of the dip-and-bump feature, this averaged RC is constructed only within the radial range where the RC appears to be less influenced by this feature. By using this averaged RC, we determine the circular velocity at solar position and also build a parameterized mass model of our Milky Way. The result for the circular velocity at the solar position is $V_c(R_0) = 236.8 \pm 0.8\ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, which is in good agreement with previous measurements. The local dark matter density and the enclosed dark matter halo mass within 18 kpc are estimated from the averaged RC under different baryonic models, yielding a series of consistent results: a local density of $0.33-0.40\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and an enclosed mass of $1.19-1.45 \times 10^{11}\ M_\odot$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21927" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A large, long-lived, slowly-expanding superbubble across the Perseus Arm</a><span class="id">[2512.21927]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar feedback is a crucial mechanism in galactic evolution, as demonstrated by the widespread bubbles observed with JWST. In this study, we combine data from Gaia and LAMOST to obtain a sample of young O-B2 stars with full three-dimensional velocity information. Focusing on the largest known superbubble in the Milky Way, we identify groups of O-B2 stars at its periphery, exhibiting a transverse velocity of 25.8 km/s and an expansion velocity of 6.2 km/s. Using these velocities, we calculate a crossing time t_cross   20 Myr and an expansion timescale t_expansion   80 Myr. We estimate a survival timescale t_survival   250 Myr and a supernova interval t_SN   0.1 Myr. Together with the Galactic shear timescale t_shear   30 Myr, these values satisfy t_SN &lt; t_shear &lt; t_survival. The energy and momentum from supernovae are sufficient to sustain the bubble's growth against ambient pressure. This indicates that repeated supernovae replenish energy faster than shear and turbulent distort the cavity. Our analysis classifies the Giant Oval Cavity as a large, quasi-stationary superbubble, similar to the Phantom Bubble observed by JWST, stabilised by the interplay between stellar feedback and Galactic disk dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From emission to absorption: the FAST observation of the OH 18-cm lines from the Comet C2025/A6</a><span class="id">[2512.21969]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We observed comet C/2025 A6 with FAST telescope equipped with the ultra-wideband receiver from 23$^{\rm rd}$ October to 8$^{\rm th}$ November 2025 and detected the OH 18-cm lines for the first time.

We quantified intranight variability using a $\chi^2$ test and fractional variability. From variability timescales, we estimated the emitting region size and magnetic field. Long-term variability was studied by segmenting the light curve into 12 intervals and analyzing flux statistics. For multi-filter flares, we computed spectral slopes, redshift-corrected fluxes, monochromatic luminosities and generated Color-magnitude and color-time diagrams. From low-flux spectra, we measured Mg II line and estimated the black hole mass.\\ Results: Ton 599 showed strong optical variability.

Long-term color changes are modest, short-term are significant, with a negative correlation between the amplitude of color changes and the average flux. The estimated SMBH mass is order of $10^8 M_\odot$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of neglecting center-of-mass acceleration in parameter estimation of stellar-mass black holes</a><span class="id">[2512.21979]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A tertiary body near a coalescing binary can imprint its influence on the gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by that binary in the form of center-of-mass (CoM) acceleration. An example of such a scenario is a binary black hole (BBH) merging near a supermassive black hole, which is touted to occur frequently. The limited low-frequency sensitivity of current GW detectors makes it challenging to detect these effects, as the associated waveform phase remains elusive. However, next-generation (3G) detectors such as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), with improved sensitivity at lower frequencies, are expected to be capable of capturing such signatures. In our study, we focus on the stellar-mass BBHs and explore the parameter space where the CoM acceleration will play a dominant role affecting parameter inference of the binary. We demonstrate that an unaccounted CoM acceleration of a low-mass binary with a total mass of $5\, \rm{M}_{\odot} $ can lead to significant systematic biases, exceeding statistical errors in the estimation of the chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio when the CoM parameter $\alpha$ is as small as $\sim 10^{-9}$ and $10^{-10}$ $\rm{s}^{-1}$ for CE and ET, respectively. We also find that asymmetric binaries are more susceptible to systematic bias when CoM acceleration is neglected. When the effect of CoM acceleration is included in the GW phase, then $\alpha = 10^{-7} \rm s^{-1}$ can be constrained with a bound of $10^{-9} (10^{-11})\, \rm s^{-1}$ for CE (ET). Our study thus highlights the crucial implications of considering the presence of a tertiary body in the GW emitted by a stellar-mass BBH when observed in 3G detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14898" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self-Interacting Dark Matter with Mass Segregation: A Unified Explanation of Dwarf Cores and Small-Scale Lenses</a><span class="id">[2506.14898]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In two-component self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models with inter-species interactions, mass segregation arises naturally from collisional relaxation, enhancing central densities and gravothermal evolution. We demonstrate that models with velocity-dependent interactions, both within and between species, can connect several small-scale observations while remaining consistent with cluster-scale constraints. This combination enables core formation in dwarf halos, where the presence of baryons increases the inner densities and enhances the predicted strong lensing signatures. Using cosmological and controlled simulations alongside an accurate parametric model, we show that this framework explains the structure of dark perturbers observed in strong lensing systems, and significantly increases the efficiency of small-scale lenses by a factor of $\sim 5$, consistent with the galaxy-galaxy strong lensing excess reported in clusters. Importantly, mass segregation can enhance the Einstein radii of SIDM halos relative to their CDM counterparts, overcoming a key challenge in one-component SIDM scenarios. Our results establish mass segregation in two-component SIDM as a self-consistent and testable model capable of simultaneously addressing multiple small-scale challenges in structure formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HI Content of Group Galaxies from the FAST All Sky HI Survey</a><span class="id">[2510.22902]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the atomic gas (HI) content of galaxies in groups using early data from the FAST All Sky HI survey (FASHI). Taking advantage of FAST's blind, wide-area coverage and uniform sensitivity, we assemble a sample of $230$ group galaxies belonging to $182$ groups at $z\leq0.03$. These groups were identified using a halo-based group finder, and they have an median membership of $4$ galaxies. We also derived a matched control sample of isolated systems, and apply censored-data modeling to include both detections and non-detections. At fixed stellar mass and color, we find that the global median HI fraction of group galaxies differs from that of controls by only $-0.04$ dex ($95\%$ CI [$-0.18,\ 0.16$]), indicating at most a mild average offset. The signal is not uniform across populations: satellites are HI-poor (median $\Delta f_{\mathrm{HI}}=-0.12$ dex), whereas centrals are not HI-deficient (median $\Delta f_{\mathrm{HI}}=0.13$ dex). Group galaxies located within $0.5R_{180}$ and in denser systems (richness $&gt;10$ or local density $\Sigma&gt;10\ \mathrm{gal\ Mpc^{-2}}$) show stronger negative offsets, whereas galaxies in the outskirts are statistically indistinguishable from the controls. These results refine earlier reports of global group HI deficiency: with deeper blind data and uniform treatment of upper limits, we show that HI depletion is primarily confined to satellites and compact cores rather than being ubiquitous across groups.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-energy astrochemistry in the molecular interstellar medium</a><span class="id">[2512.10060]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a “high-energy astrochemistry”, defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Extended Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation for SDSS MaNGA Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2512.18577]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), a relationship between rotational velocity and baryonic mass in spiral galaxies, probes the relative content of baryonic and dark matter in galaxies and thus provides a good test of Lambda CDM. Using H-alpha kinematics to model the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, we construct the BTFR for 5743 SDSS MaNGA DR17 galaxies. To extend the BTFR to higher masses using elliptical galaxies, we estimate their total masses from their stellar velocity dispersions using the virial theorem and define the effective rotational velocity as the velocity a rotation-supported galaxy would exhibit given this mass. The baryonic mass of spiral galaxies is composed of stellar, HI, H2, and He mass, while only the stellar mass is used for the baryonic content of ellipticals. We construct and fit the BTFR for a matched subsample of spiral and elliptical MaNGA and IllustrisTNG 100-1 (TNG100) galaxies, finding BTFR slopes between 3.2 and 4.0. We fit a joint BTFR for the 5743 MaNGA spiral and elliptical galaxies and find a BTFR slope of 3.54 (+0.65/-0.48), which is in good agreement with TNG100 galaxies with baryonic masses greater than 10^9 Msun for which we find a BTFR slope of 3.57 (+0.48/-0.37). Within this mass range, the MaNGA galaxies are consistent with both the Lambda CDM simulation and the prediction from MOND; a sample of lower mass galaxies is necessary to differentiate between the two models.</p></div></details></article>

To address this bottleneck, we introduce a Dual-Channel Lensing feature extraction eXtended Long Short-Term Memory Network (DCL-xLSTM). Unlike conventional recurrent architectures, DCL-xLSTM employs a matrix-valued memory structure and a memory-mixing mechanism to effectively capture amplitude diffraction patterns that span the entire millihertz frequency band. Trained on data generated by Point Mass (PM) and Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) models accounting for the transition from wave-optics to geometric-optics, the proposed method achieves an area under the curve (AUC) exceeding 0.99, maintaining a true positive rate (TPR) above 98% at a false positive rate (FPR) below 1%.

Building upon the formalism for GW-induced shear distortions, we develop a signal-to-noise framework that incorporates realistic survey characteristics, including cadence, angular resolution, and depth. We model the effective galaxy population using a redshift- and luminosity-dependent distribution to evaluate the noise power spectral density across the survey. Applying this framework to both LSST-like and idealized survey configurations, we derive characteristic strain sensitivity curves and identify the detectable parameter space for SMBHBs. We find that while current surveys are limited by angular resolution, an ideal full-sky survey with milliarcsecond-level precision and rapid cadence could detect continuous GW signals from SMBHBs at cosmological distances and partially bridge the PTA-LISA sensitivity gap. Our analysis highlights the potential and limitations of weak-lensing surveys for low-frequency GW astronomy, with angular resolution emerging as the dominant constraint.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21407" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neural Network for Simulating Radio Emission from Extensive Air Showers</a><span class="id">[2512.21407]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic ray shower detection using large radio arrays has gained significant traction in recent years. With massive improvements in signal modelling and microscopic simulations, the analysis of incoming events is still severely limited by the simulation cost of radio emission to interpret the data. In this work, we show that a neural network can be used for simulating such radio pulses. This work serves as a proof of concept that simple neural networks can be used for emergent deterministic macroscopic phenomena of microscopic simulations. We also demonstrate how such a neural network can be used for the physics use case of $X_\mathrm{max}$ reconstruction, while retaining comparable resolution to using full Monte-Carlo simulations for radio emission.

However, accurately determining the amplification effects remains challenging due to the absence of 3D numerical simulation methods. In this study, we develop a high-order 3D finite element method (spectral-element method, SEM) to numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs below 20 mHz. We verify the accuracy of our method by comparing the resonant peaks of our results with those from semi-analytical solutions and find that the frequency deviation is less than 3% for the first peak at about 1 mHz and less than 0.8% for the subsequent peaks up to 10 mHz. Using this method, we evaluate the amplification of GW signals due to 3D topographic effects of the Moon, and we find enhancements at a series of specific frequency components. These results highlight the non-negligible effect of surface topography on the lunar response to GWs, as a fundamental factor that holds significant implications across both global and regional analyses. Our work paves the way for a comprehensive evaluation of the Moon's resonant response to GWs, helpful for the strategic planning of lunar GW detections.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21903" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TITAN DR1: An Improved, Validated, and Systematically-Controlled Recalibration of ATLAS Photometry toward Type Ia Supernova Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2512.21903]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial Last Alert System) is a time-domain survey using four telescopes, covering the entire sky. It has observed over 10,000 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), with thousands of cosmology-grade light curves (to be released as TITAN DR1). To prepare this massive, low-redshift dataset for cosmology, we evaluate and cross-calibrate ATLAS forced photometry using tertiary stars from the DES (Dark Energy Survey) Y6 release. The 5000 deg$^2$ DES footprint overlaps regions both in and out of the PS1 (Pan-STARRS DR1) footprint, allowing tests of the primary calibrator for the ATLAS Refcat2 catalog. Initial offsets are at the $\sim$40 mmag scale. To improve this we determine $\Delta$ zeropoint offsets for two cases: (1) pixel-to-pixel offsets within individual CCDs (reduced from $\sim$8 to $\sim$4 mmag RMS) and (2) chip-to-chip offsets across the 9 CCDs and filters (reduced from $\sim$17 to $\sim$3 mmag RMS). We also identify the largest systematic uncertainty as a transmission-function color dependence, requiring shifts in the assumed ATLAS filters at the $\sim$30 mmag level if uncorrected. We validate our calibration using (a) CALSPEC standards, (b) an independent tertiary catalog, and (c) distance moduli of cross-matched SNe Ia, all showing improved consistency. Overall, we estimate combined calibration-related systematics at the $\sim$5–10 mmag level, supporting competitive cosmological constraints with the TITAN SN Ia dataset.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21949" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WST spectroscopic variability alerts: discovery space, data flow system requirements</a><span class="id">[2512.21949]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The enormous multiplexity of the WST opens up the possibility to trigger alerts for variable objects - an option that has been reserved so far only for imaging surveys. WST can go further by detecting spectroscopic line profile and line strength variations. I review previous alert-issuing surveys that are limited to imaging, and describe some of the new research possibilities that this feature of the data flow system (DFS) would open up. The latter range from variability of emission line stars, such as Bes, WRs and LBVs to variability of active galaxies and quasars, including the so-called changing look objects that shift between Type 1 and Type 2. Furthermore, I describe the requirements that the WST DFS must meet to make this feasible. The most critical aspect is the rapid data processing for timely follow-up. Next, the alert system is tightly connected with the data reduction and archive, because it will need an extensive and continuously updated spectral reference database. The new spectra will have to be compared against these reference spectra to identify variations. The reference spectra can either be &quot;native&quot; from the WST itself or they can originate from other spectroscopic surveys. Two options for the DFS are considered: one is to conduct an automated search of the WST's own archive, and potentially of other spectroscopic archives and a second option is to allow the users to submit reference spectra on their own. The spectroscopic alert system will open up a completely new discovery space that is not accessible to the existing or planned near-future surveys. Finally, I discuss the advantages of moving the variability detection to physical parameters by modeling the observed and reference spectra and comparing the derived fitting parameters. This strategy offers a robust method for alert ranking.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic-Ray-Constrained LSTM Model for Geomagnetic Storm Prediction</a><span class="id">[2512.22003]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Geomagnetic storms (GSTs) driven by solar wind-magnetosphere coupling can severely disrupt technological systems, motivating the need for improved prediction accuracy and longer warning times. In this study, we develop a physics-informed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that incorporates cosmic-ray flux modulation as an additional precursor signal. As coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven disturbances propagate through the heliosphere, enhanced turbulence and magnetic-field compression reduce galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) flux measured by ground-based neutron monitors (Forbush decreases), providing early information that can precede near-Earth solar-wind signatures by 1–3 days. We integrate multi-source space-weather data, spanning 1995-2020, including cosmic-ray observations, solar wind plasma parameters, interplanetary magnetic-field data, and geomagnetic indices. Based on these data, we construct a 19-dimensional feature vector that includes flux background levels, decrease-related indicators, and inter-station correlation measures as model inputs. Employing a 50-unit LSTM architecture, the proposed model achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 5.106 nT, 8.315 nT, 10.854 nT, 12.883 nT, and 14.788 nT for 2-, 6-, 12-, 24-, and 48-hour predictions, respectively. Incorporating cosmic-ray information further improves 48-hour forecast skill by up to 25.84% (from 0.178 to 0.224). These results demonstrate the value of physics-informed deep learning and cosmic-ray precursors for advancing space-weather forecasting.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraviBERT: Transformer-based inference for gravitational-wave time series</a><span class="id">[2512.21390]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce GraviBERT, a novel deep learning framework for inference of gravitational-wave time series, which relies on an Inception-inspired multi-scale convolutional feature extractor combined with a transformer encoder and a suitable regression head. GraviBERT is trained in two stages: a BERT-style pretraining phase, in which the model learns to predict masked segments in feature space to capture universal patterns and physics, followed by supervised fine-tuning for accurate parameter estimation. This approach demonstrates impressive improvement across multiple metrics compared to training from scratch. On in-domain data, it reduces the mean absolute error for point-estimate parameter inference by up to $30\%$, and training convergence accelerates by up to a factor of six. Moreover, at low signal-to-noise ratio, the mean relative precision of the inferred masses and distances reaches the few-percent level, while the mean absolute error in the effective spin is about $10^{-3}$. For domain adaptation to new detector noise profiles, the pretrained model demonstrates remarkable efficiency, converging up to $15\times$ faster on small target datasets and reducing estimation errors by up to approximately $45\%$, indicating that it learns sufficient detector-agnostic representations. Cross-approximant transfer demonstrates comparable performance, achieving up to $44\%$ reductions in mean absolute error across all parameters and up to $15\times$ training speedups, with $R^2$ scores consistently exceeding 0.9 for mass parameters at signal-to-noise ratio 10, compared to 0.74 - 0.87 when training from scratch. Notably, GraviBERT works directly with noisy waveforms. The final regression head of the model can be adapted for a range of downstream tasks after pretraining, positioning it as a step towards foundation-style models in gravitational-wave and multi-messenger astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21738" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Methods for Detecting Gravitational Waves from mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals I: Statistics Based on Time-Frequency Signal Tracks</a><span class="id">[2512.21738]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mini-extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs), composed of a stellar-mass compact object and a much lighter companion, are promising sources of continuous gravitational waves in the frequency band of ground-based interferometers such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. Such systems, consisting of sub-solar-mass compact objects, provide a unique probe of exotic compact objects, including primordial black holes. Detecting such long-lived signals, however, remains challenging. Here, we adapt standard methods used in searches for quasi-monochromatic signals to search for mini-EMRIs, and derive a statistical framework that explicitly handles spectral leakage. In particular, we introduce a new method that sums along the tracks in the time-frequency plane carved out by possible mini-EMRI signals, which we call $\Sigma$Track. This refinement establishes a general basis for analyzing long-duration transient signals with rapid frequency evolutions, regardless of the underlying mechanism for gravitational-wave emission. We also compute a new semi-analytic sensitivity estimate within our new statistical framework, which is valid under the assumption that the signal is weak with respect to the noise level. We then establish a statistic that quantifies how to discretize the search parameter space for our method, which works for mini-EMRIs, as well as arbitrary signal types. Our results provide a foundation for mini-EMRI searches and demonstrate the potential of current ground-based detectors to probe the existence of sub-solar-mass compact objects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21739" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Methods for Detecting Gravitational Waves from mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals II: A Spectral-Leakage-Aware Framework</a><span class="id">[2512.21739]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (mini-EMRIs), comprising a sub-solar exotic compact object (such as a primordial black hole or boson star) orbiting a much heavier stellar-origin or exotic compact object, represent key targets for ground-based gravitational-wave detectors to probe the early universe and the nature of dark matter. However, detecting such systems, which could spend hours to years in LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA data, poses a computational challenge to standard matched-filtering methods. However, semi-coherent methods are constrained by the quasi-monochromatic assumption, which restricts the coherence time to avoid spectral leakage caused by frequency evolution. In this work, we extend the development of our method, $\Sigma$Track, to the regime in which the quasi-monochromatic approximation is relaxed, in two ways. First, we establish an analytical model for the spectral leakage, extending the validity of conventional analyses beyond the quasi-monochromatic regime. Second, we propose the $\Sigma R$ statistic – a novel detection metric formed by a weighted summation of power ratios – which effectively recovers the signal energy dispersed across adjacent frequency bins. Building on this framework, we further introduce an innovative frequency-layered search strategy that dynamically optimizes the coherence time across the observation band. We benchmark our method against a globally optimized Hough transform pipeline using a fiducial mini-EMRI signal from a binary with masses $(1.5, 10^{-5})\,M_\odot$. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves an order-of-magnitude enhancement in the effective detection volume, significantly expanding the horizon for discovering mini-EMRIs and sub-solar exotic compact objects with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. This approach can be similarly applied to EMRI searches for future space-based gravitational wave detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05737" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for Lorentz Invariance Violation with spectral lags of GRB 190114C using profile likelihood</a><span class="id">[2506.05737]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We search for Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) using the spectral lag data for GRB 190114C using frequentist analysis, where we deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters using profile likelihood.

Such observations may be instrumental for the detection of Galactic black holes via microlensing. We present our methodology and pipeline for precise astrometric measurements using seeing-limited observations. The method is a variant of Gaia's Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) that includes several detrending steps. Tests on 6,500 images of the same field, obtained by KMTNet with typical seeing condition of 1 arcsecond and pixel scale of 0.4 arcsecond, suggest that we can achieve, at the bright end (mag&lt;17), per-epoch relative astrometric precision of  5 and relative proper motion precision of 0.1-0.2 mas/yr over a baseline of approximately five years, using data from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) site. Time binning on 5–20 day cadences improves the bright-source precision to  2 mas per coordinate on astrometric microlensing-relevant timescales. The precision is estimated using bootstrap simulations and further validated by comparing results from two independent KMTNet telescopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probabilistic Link Budget Analysis for Low Earth Orbit Satellites in the Optical Regime</a><span class="id">[2507.20908]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Low Earth Orbit (LEO) optical satellite communication systems face performance challenges due to atmospheric effects such as scintillation, turbulence, wavefront distortion, beam spread, and jitter.
