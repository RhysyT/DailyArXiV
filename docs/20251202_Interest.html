The new principle, like that of Bell, forces Bell inequalities, but with two loopholes: one is retrocausation, known to Bell, but the other is nonuniqueness of remote outcomes, a loophole only for LOC, not for the Bell principle. I also set out a theory of physical probability, applicable to the Everett interpretation, in agreement with the Born rule, and therefore violating Bell inequalities. I show it is consistent with LOC. Surprisingly, both loopholes are exploited. I conclude not only that probability in the Everett interpretation involves no action at a distance, but that the observed violations of Bell inequalities is powerful evidence for many worlds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Heptalemma for Quantum Mechanics</a><span class="id">[2512.01982]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a seven-pronged no-go result for quantum mechanics: a &quot;heptalemma&quot;. It shows that seven initially plausible theses about physical reality are jointly inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics, while any six are jointly consistent. We must then decide which theses to retain and which to give up. Since different interpretations of quantum mechanics entail different responses to the heptalemma, we get a novel taxonomy of such interpretations. Beyond the application to quantum mechanics, the heptalemma offers a general diagnostic criterion for determining whether a given scientific domain should count as classical or not, and if not, how it departs from classicality.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blurred orbits and blurred particles: Heisenberg's 1926 helium atom</a><span class="id">[2504.04116]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work analyses the extent to which the &quot;blurred orbits&quot; of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose–Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Physical Basis for Information</a><span class="id">[2407.09567]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Information is typically understood as a structure that tells something about another structure, yet no widely accepted definition of information has been derived from first physical principles. Here we develop a substrate-agnostic framework that defines information directly from physical dynamics in systems ranging from molecular to neural, cultural, and technological. Persistent physical structures are represented as almost invariant sets of the underlying dynamics, and their structure-creating relations are encoded in a causal structure set whose nodes are long-lived structures and whose edges capture active generative influences. Within this setting we identify specific generative motifs - replication, heritable variation, and translation under shared templates - through which informational relations emerge: a structure carries information about another precisely when they are linked by these hereditary motifs. In this framework, information and evolution are ontologically intertwined: information is the hereditary causal agent in evolution, and evolution is the differential persistence of information variants within a causal structure set. We show how information entropy and information fitness can be constructed directly and algorithmically from the causal structure, providing substrate-independent measures of diversity and evolutionary success. Finally, by analogy with random directed graphs and catalytic networks, we formulate a hypothesis on the generic emergence of information: under broad structural conditions on persistence, generativity, and diversity, hereditary informational motifs should arise generically in sufficiently large causal-physical systems, making information-bearing, life-like processes expected rather than exceptional.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High schoolers excel at Oxford quantum course using pictorial mathematics</a><span class="id">[2512.00141]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We are at the dawn of the second quantum revolution, where our ability to create and control individual quantum systems is poised to drive transformative advancements in basic science, computation, and everyday life. However, quantum theory has long been conceived as notoriously hard to learn, creating a significant barrier to workforce development, informed decision-making by stakeholders and policymakers, and broader public understanding. This paper is concerned with Quantum Picturalism, a novel visual mathematical language for quantum physics. Originally developed over two decades ago to explore the foundational structure of quantum theory, this rigorous diagrammatic framework has since been adopted in both academia and industry as a powerful tool for quantum computing research and software development. Here, we demonstrate its potential as a transformative educational methodology. We report the findings from a pilot study involving 54 UK high school students, randomly selected from a pool of 734 volunteers across the UK. Despite the absence of advanced mathematical prerequisites, these students demonstrated a strong conceptual grasp of key quantum principles and operations. On an assessment comprising university graduate-level exam questions, participants achieved an 82% pass rate, with 48% obtaining a distinction-level grade. These results pave the way for making quantum more inclusive, lowering traditional cognitive and demographic barriers to quantum learning. This approach has the potential to broaden participation in the field and provide a promising new entry point for stakeholders, future experts, and the general public.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro-Animation – How Artists and Scientists Envision the Universe</a><span class="id">[2512.00535]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For several years, students at an art college, working with NASA astronomers, have produced animations inspired by research on black holes, dark matter and more. They can be whimsical or poetic but still constrained by scientific rigour. The animations are used for scientific outreach and are freely available. Our program received a positive assessment through an evaluation we undertook. We are now planning a mobile STEAM exhibition to engage teenagers from underrepresented communities who may not typically consider STE(A)M for their studies. &quot;Science anxiety&quot; has been reported to be a significant barrier to learning. Mixing animation with astronomy can stimulate interest in STEAM, making science engaging in an unconventional way. One component would be activities where participants create artistic responses to astronomy. We undertook a workshop at a local city-run school, specialising in the arts for ages 14-17, to brainstorm the art/science activities. There we gave short scientific presentations leading to art activities: a giant colouring wall with projected celestial phenomena, a stop-motion station, and colouring images of comet 67P to produce an animation. Surveys before and after the activities showed positive responses. The hand of the artist has long been an important concept in animation (Crafton 1991). In a film entitled &quot;The Movements of the Universe&quot;, this concept is adapted to the hands of scientists. Combining animation, filmed interviews at NASA (including a Nobel prize winner), and the scientists' hands, bring unexpected feelings of dream and humour to the audience. In this paper we explore three different viewpoints of these activities from a scientist, an animator, and an animation student.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Hands-On Molecular Communication Testbed for Undergraduate Education</a><span class="id">[2512.01904]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work presents a hands-on molecular communication (MC) testbed developed for the undergraduate \textit{Communication Engineering} lab course at the Institute for Communications Technology (IfN), TU Braunschweig. The goal of the experiment is to provide students with an intuitive and reproducible introduction to MC concepts using a low-cost and accessible fluidic setup. The system employs a background water flow into which three dye colors are injected and symbols are detected by a multi-wavelength photosensor. A zero-forcing–based estimator is used to separate the spectral components and reliably identify the transmitted colors. The experiment is designed to be completed independently by students within a single laboratory session and requires only basic prior knowledge from introductory communication engineering courses. A detailed script accompanies the experiment, guiding students through channel characterization, color detection, pseudoinverse computation, and simple data transmission using on-off keying. In pilot trials, students successfully reproduced the entire communication chain and achieved stable data rates of up to 0.5 bit/s over a 15 cm channel. The proposed testbed demonstrates that fundamental principles of MC can be taught effectively using a compact and inexpensive experimental setup. The experiment will be integrated into an undergraduate lab course.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Gauge Principle and Foundations of The Standard Model: A Pedagogical Introduction Through QED</a><span class="id">[2512.00799]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Standard Model of particle physics is built on the principle of local gauge symmetry. This work provides a pedagogical introduction for advanced undergraduates by using quantum electrodynamics (QED) as the simplest example of a gauge theory. Beginning with the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics, special relativity, and basic quantum mechanics, we develop classical field theory, reformulate electromagnetism in covariant form, introduce the Dirac equation for spin 1/2 particles, and finally arrive at the gauge principle. By showing how the requirement of local U(1) invariance leads naturally to the electromagnetic interaction, we illustrate the essential logic behind gauge theories and highlight the conceptual structure that underlies the Standard Model Lagrangian.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Classical Reconstruction of the PMNS Matrix Using a Mechanical Neutrino Oscillator</a><span class="id">[2512.01851]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutrino oscillations arise from quantum interference between neutrino mass eigenstates and are governed by the PMNS matrix.
