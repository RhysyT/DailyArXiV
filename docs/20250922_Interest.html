<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15387" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Der Stern von Bethlehem – Einige Theorien und Hintergruende: Von der altorientalischen Astrologie ueber Kepler zu Newton</a><span class="id">[2509.15387]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many have have taken in hand to write a treatise on the Star of Bethlehem, particularly on Kepler's explanation as a stellar birth, triggered by Mars joining a great conjunction (a meeting of Jupiter and Saturn), as he observed it in October 1604. It is the aim of my short treatise to introduce, at a hopefully well digestible level, into underlying antiquity's concepts of physics, astrology, and astronomy around the time of Christ's birth and to demonstrate their essential developments up to the early modern period. In the latter, Kepler played a significant role. His contributions enabled him to calculate back to the year 7 BC with astonishing precision, locating a triple great conjunction in Pisces, which was then complemented by Mars. This is confirmed by both Babylonian tradition and modern astronomy. The following background provided may be specifically helpful for a more theologically oriented audience, also because the controversy surrounding &quot;geocentric&quot; and &quot;heliocentric&quot; world systems (Copernicus) is touched upon. And, because the overall context raises questions for theology, with which the epilogue concludes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15866" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dualities in Physics</a><span class="id">[2509.15866]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For more than half a century, dualities have been at the heart of modern physics. From quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, quantum field theory and quantum gravity, dualities have proven useful in solving problems that are otherwise quite intractable. Being surprising and unexpected, dualities have been taken to raise philosophical questions about the nature and formulation of scientific theories, scientific realism, emergence, symmetries, explanation, understanding, and theory construction. This book discusses what dualities are, gives a selection of examples, explores the themes and roles that make dualities interesting, and highlights their most salient types. It aims to be an entry point into discussions of dualities in both physics and philosophy. The philosophical discussion emphasises three main topics: whether duals are theoretically equivalent, the view of scientific theories that is suggested by dualities (namely, a geometric view of theories), and the compatibility between duality and emergence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Timeless Game: A Game-Theoretic Model of Mass-Geometry Relations</a><span class="id">[2509.15229]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a minimal, timeless game-theoretic representation of the mass-geometry relation. An &quot;Object&quot; (mass) and &quot;Space&quot; (geometry) choose strategies in a static normal-form game; utilities encode stability as mutual consistency rather than dynamical payoffs. In a 2x2 toy model, the equilibria correspond to &quot;light-flat&quot; and &quot;heavy-curved&quot; configurations; a continuous variant clarifies when only trivial interior equilibria appear versus a continuum along a matching ray. Philosophically, the point is representational: a global description may be static while the experience of temporal flow for embedded observers arises from informational asymmetry, coarse-graining, and records. The framework separates time as parameter from relational constraint without committing to specific physical dynamics.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational Astrophysics Research through Cross Institutional Research Partnerships</a><span class="id">[2509.15743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Undergraduate research in STEM can be a transformative experience, especially for Community College students, many of whom come from under-represented backgrounds. However, undergraduate research at Community Colleges is relatively rare, due in part to their focus on teaching excellence. Research partnerships with four year colleges about exciting and accessible science topics, facilitated by researchers such as postdoctoral fellows, can be a powerful path forward. We describe our program, the Dead Stars Society (DSS), as a successful example of such a research partnership, focused on the topic of observational astronomy, specifically stellar science with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and X-ray astronomy with Chandra, NICER and NuSTAR.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kh2d-solver: A Python Library for Idealized Two-Dimensional Incompressible Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability</a><span class="id">[2509.16080]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an open-source Python library for simulating two-dimensional incompressible Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in stratified shear flows. The solver employs a fractional-step projection method with spectral Poisson solution via Fast Sine Transform, achieving second-order spatial accuracy. Implementation leverages NumPy, SciPy, and Numba JIT compilation for efficient computation. Four canonical test cases explore Reynolds numbers 1000–5000 and Richardson numbers 0.1–0.3: classical shear layer, double shear configuration, rotating flow, and forced turbulence. Statistical analysis using Shannon entropy and complexity indices reveals that double shear layers achieve 2.8$\times$ higher mixing rates than forced turbulence despite lower Reynolds numbers. The solver runs efficiently on standard desktop hardware, with 384$\times$192 grid simulations completing in approximately 31 minutes. Results demonstrate that mixing efficiency depends on instability generation pathways rather than intensity measures alone, challenging Richardson number-based parameterizations and suggesting refinements for subgrid-scale representation in climate models.</p></div></details></article></body>
