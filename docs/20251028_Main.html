While the core accretion paradigm is widely accepted as the dominant mechanism for forming low- and intermediate-mass planets, the origin of the most massive planets remains debated, with gravitational instability often invoked to explain their existence. In this study, we analyze the dependence of planet formation on metallicity using the total heavy-element mass fraction (Z), which is a proxy for the composition of the protoplanetary disk inferred from stellar photospheres. We show that even the most massive planets form preferentially in metal-rich environments. Z correlates not only with the presence of planets, but also with planetary system multiplicity and total planetary mass. The most massive planets are found in the most metal-rich environments, and, in agreement with core-accretion theory, only the upper end of the planetary mass distribution shows a clear positive correlation with metallicity. These findings suggest that the chemical enrichment of protoplanetary disks plays a central role in shaping the full spectrum of planetary masses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Definition of Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2510.21895]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This chapter reviews the definition of exoplanets and of brown dwarfs. Emphasis is given to the separation of these two populations. A traditional view is to declare « planet » objects with a mass &lt; 13 M Jup and « brown dwarf » objects with a mass &gt; 13 M Jup . By analogy with Solar System planets, a better definition is to call « planets » objects formed by accretion of dust and planetesimals in a disk. An by extension of the primitive introduction of the word « brown dwarf » for failed stars by Jill Tarter, this term must be reserved to objects formed by gravitational collapse in a molecular gas cloud. The two definitions do not coincide since a « brown dwarf » can have a mass down to about 6 Jupiter mass. And there is no physical reason to assert that a 20 Jupiter mass object has not been formed by accretion. From there, the difficulty is to decide if an object of say 20 Jupiter mass is formed by dust accretion or by gravitational collapse. A future observational test to solve this difficulty is presented.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suppressed &quot;lump&quot; EM signature in radiation pressure dominated accreting massive black hole binaries</a><span class="id">[2510.21919]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of radiation pressure on electromagnetic signatures of accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at milli-parsec separations, using 3D hyper-Lagrangian resolution hydrodynamical simulations. We model binaries embedded in a self-gravitating circumbinary disc that evolves following an adiabatic equation of state, including viscous heating and black-body cooling. Focusing on binaries with a total mass of $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, eccentricities $e=0,0.45,0.9$ and mass ratios $q=1, 0.7$, we find that radiation pressure significantly affects both the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the light curves (LCs). The emission from the mini-discs shifts from the optical towards UV frequencies and with a peak luminosity orders of magnitude higher, while the circumbinary disc becomes colder and dimmer as a result of its geometrically thinner configuration. Temporal variability is affected as well: near UV and soft-X ray fluxes are higher and more variable. Crucially, radiation pressure suppresses the characteristic &quot;lump&quot; formation in equal-mass circular systems, while a lump is formed for higher eccentricities without imprinting any modulation on the flux. In the circular case we still find a modulation on the cavity edge timescale at a frequency $0.36 \, f_{\rm K}$, while in eccentric binaries, only robust orbital period modulations ($f=1,2 \, f_{\rm K}$) are observed, with no modulation associated with the cavity orbital motion. Moreover, the enhanced emission from the mini-discs and streams due to radiation pressure, one redshifted, results in brighter flux in the optical G band, proving detectability of MBHBs signatures even at higher redshift ($z=0.6-1.0$). Our results reveal that radiation pressure plays a crucial role in shaping MBHBs spectral and time-domain features, with implications for their identification in time-domain surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illuminating the Diffuse Radio Emission in Low-Mass Cluster: Abell 13</a><span class="id">[2510.21926]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent advances in high-sensitivity radio observations have uncovered a population of faint, ultra-steep-spectrum sources in galaxy clusters, commonly known as radio phoenixes. However, their observational classification remains poorly constrained due to the limited number of confirmed detections. This study presents a detailed multi-frequency, high-sensitivity, and high-resolution analysis of diffuse radio emission in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 13. Using GMRT (147.5 MHz), uGMRT (400 MHz), ASKAP-low (887.5 MHz), and MGCLS (1284 MHz) images, we detect complex, filamentary diffuse emission with a largest linear extent of 521 kpc. This emission originates from the cluster center and extends westward, confined within the X-ray-emitting intra-cluster medium (ICM). Chandra X-ray data confirm that Abell 13 is undergoing a merger, and the radio morphology reflects signatures of this ongoing dynamical activity. We observed filamentary structures extending towards east-northeast and southwest directions. The spectral index across the emission appears irregular and lacks a coherent spatial gradient. The integrated spectrum reveals a steep spectral index of -1.85 +/- 0.05 and a spectral curvature of -0.93 +/- 0.21. These spectral properties, along with the observed morphology and brightness distribution, are consistent with a re-energization of a fossil radio plasma driven by adiabatic compression, supporting the classification of the emission as a radio phoenix.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Dark Energy Meets Varying Electron Mass: Implications for Phantom Crossing and the Hubble Constant</a><span class="id">[2510.21931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the interplay between varying electron mass ($m_e$) and dynamical dark energy by analysing the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization and its non-crossing variants, both with and without a varying-$m_e$ component. Our aim is to assess whether the preference for late-time dynamics and phantom divide line (PDL) crossing persists when early-time physics is introduced, and whether these combined models improve the alleviation of the Hubble tension compared to the varying-$m_e$ extension alone. Using the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova datasets, we derive updated constraints on $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and their extensions, and examine their impact on $H_0$ and the preference for late-time dynamics. We find that $\Lambda$CDM+$m_e$ yields the largest upward shift in $H_0$, while replacing $\Lambda$ with the CPL parametrization or its non-crossing variants provides modest improvements in the overall fit. The data consistently favour dynamical dark energy and a phantom divide line crossing at scale factors $a_{\rm c}\simeq0.6-0.9$, and these preferences remain robust, though somewhat weaker ($\gtrsim2\sigma$), when the electron mass is also allowed to vary. Among the late-time models, CPL performs better than its non-crossing variants, further reinforcing the evidence for a genuine phantom divide crossing. The alleviation of the $H_0$ tension in the varying-$m_e$ case arises from late-time data breaking the strong $\Omega_m$-$m_e$ degeneracy in the CMB, while the additional degrees of freedom in CPL models allow the late-time dynamics to absorb this impact, thereby weakening the degeneracy breaking and further lowering $H_0$ through their ability to yield a decreasing dark energy contribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPYGLASS. VII-A. The Demographics and Ages of Small Nearby Young Associations</a><span class="id">[2510.21936]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent Gaia-based young stellar association surveys have revealed dozens of low-mass populations that have, until recently, been too small or sparse to detect. These populations represent a largely unstudied demographic with unknown origins, and their relative isolation may minimize gravitational disruptions that impact traceback, making them compelling targets for dynamical studies. In this paper, we survey 15 of these isolated young associations for the first time: Andromeda South (SCYA-97), Aquila East, Aries South (SCYA-104), Cassiopeia East (SCYA-43), Canis Major North, Leo Central (SCYA-2), Leo East (SCYA-3), Theia 72, Ophiuchus Southeast, Scutum North (SCYA-70), Taurus-Orion 1 (TOR1), Theia 78, Vulpecula East (UPK 88), SCYA-54, and SCYA-79. By combining Gaia astrometry and photometry with new ground-based spectroscopic measurements, we assess the membership of each population, search for substructure, analyze their demographics, and compute ages. We find that the smallest populations in our sample contain $&lt;20$ $M_{\odot}$ of stellar mass, making them the smallest associations ever detected. Four host substantial substructure, including TOR1, where we discover TOR1B, a new 9 $M_{\odot}$ association with radial velocities inconsistent with an origin in the parent complex. Using PARSEC isochrones, we produce self-consistent ages for all populations supported by dynamical and lithium depletion ages, which range from 6.9 $\pm$ 0.5 Myr in TOR1 to 42.8 $\pm$ 2.4 in AndS. Our results provide the first detailed overview of the properties of these populations, characterizing a largely unknown category of young associations that may have an important role in tracing the processes that guide local star formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for Dynamical Dark Energy using DESI DR2 Ly$α$ Forest</a><span class="id">[2510.21976]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of the cosmological implications of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) Lyman-$\alpha$ forest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, combined with complementary datasets DESI DR2 galaxy BAO, Type Ia supernova (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5Y, and Union3), and compressed CMB likelihood. We test several dynamical dark energy models CPL, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE as well as $\omega$CDM and non-flat extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM and $\omega$CDM models. Using the Metropolis Hastings MCMC algorithm implemented in \texttt{SimpleMC}, we constrain the cosmological parameters of each model and evaluate the Bayesian evidence using \texttt{MCEvidence} to assess each model's performance relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Our results show that the inclusion of DESI DR2 Ly$\alpha$ data modestly enhances sensitivity to departures from $\Lambda$CDM. Our results show non-flat extensions remain consistent with spatial flatness ($\Omega_k \approx 0$ within $1$-$2\sigma$). Further, all redshift dependent dark energy models predict $\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$, favor a dynamical dark energy scenario characterized by Quintom-B type, and we found that dynamical dark energy favors over the $\Lambda$CDM model ranging from 0.24-2.60$\sigma$, depending on the choice of model and corresponding combination of datasets. Bayesian evidence comparison favors the $\omega$CDM model with moderate evidence over $\Lambda$CDM, whereas other parameterizations remain statistically inconclusive.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the acceleration of cosmic rays at the post-adiabatic shocks of supernova remnants</a><span class="id">[2510.21988]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When a supernova remnant (SNR) interacts with the dense material of an interstellar cloud, its shock wave decelerates rapidly, and the post-shock temperature drops to levels that permit efficient cooling of the shocked plasma. At this stage, the shock enters the post-adiabatic phase of its evolution. During this phase, the internal structure of the SNR undergoes significant changes, particularly in the immediate post-shock region, at spatial scales relevant to cosmic ray acceleration. Once the shock enters the post-adiabatic regime, the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration increases due to a higher plasma compression, to a change in the direction of the advection velocity, and to an increased rate of momentum gain. As a result, the momentum spectrum of relativistic particles hardens, deviating from a pure power law at high energies. Particles could reach higher maximum values compared to classical predictions. We highlight the dynamics of post-adiabatic flows in SNRs, study their impact on particle acceleration, and present supporting observational evidence in the radio band.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22061" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quasi-Biennial Oscillations and Rieger-type Periodicities in a Babcock-Leighton Solar Dynamo</a><span class="id">[2510.22061]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Sun's magnetic field shows the 11-year solar cycle and shorter periodicities, popularly known as the quasi-biennial oscillations (QBOs) and Rieger-type periods, or “season of the Sun.&quot; Although several theories have been proposed to explain the origin of QBOs and Rieger-type periods, no single theory has widespread acceptance. We explore whether the \bl\ dynamo can produce Rieger-type periodicity and QBOs and investigate their underlying physical mechanisms. We use the observationally guided three-dimensional kinematic \bl\ dynamo model, which has emerged as a successful model for reproducing many characteristic features of the solar cycle. We use Morlet wavelet and global wavelet power spectrum techniques to analyze the data obtained from the model. In our model, we report QBOs and Rieger-type periods for the first time. Further, we investigate the individual \bl\ parameters (fluctuations in flux, latitude, time delay and tilt scatter) role in the occurrence of QBOs and Rieger-type periods. We find that while fluctuations in the individual parameters of the \bl\ process can produce QBOs and Rieger-type periodicity, their occurrence probability is enhanced when we consider combined fluctuations of all parameters in the \bl\ process. Finally, we find that with the increase of dynamo supercriticality, the model tends to suppress the generation of Rieger-type periodicity. Thus, this result supports earlier studies that suggest the solar dynamo is not highly supercritical.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of multi-temperature coronal mass ejection signatures from a young solar analogue</a><span class="id">[2510.22110]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the early Sun may have profoundly influenced the planetary atmospheres of early Solar System planets.

During and before a Carrington-class ($\sim$10$^{32}$ erg) flare, warm FUV lines ($\sim$10$^5$ K) exhibit blueshifted emission at 300-550 km s$^{-1}$, indicative of a warm eruption. 10 minutes later, the H$\alpha$ line shows slow (70 km s$^{-1}$), long-lasting ($\gtrsim$2 hrs) blueshifted absorptions, suggesting a cool ($\sim$10$^4$ K) filament eruption. This provides evidence of multi-temperature and multi-component nature of a stellar CME.

Results from Five-year Dedicated Optical Observations of EK Draconis and V889 Hercules</a><span class="id">[2510.22111]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report results from a five-year (132-night) dedicated observational campaign targeting two nearby young solar-type stars, EK Draconis ($\sim$50-125 Myr age) and V889 Hercules ($\sim$30 Myr age), using the 3.8m Seimei Telescope and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The aim is to observationally constrain statistical properties of flaring radiation/heating as well as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), through high time-cadence H$\alpha$ spectroscopy. We obtained an unprecedented sample of 15 H$\alpha$ superflares, including two blueshifted absorption, two blueshifted emission, one redshifted emission, and nine line broadening events. We obtain the following results: (1) Larger flares exhibit broader H$\alpha$ line widths, up to 14.1$_{\pm 2.4}$ Å, indicating higher chromospheric heating than solar flares. (2) The long-lasting redshifted event at $\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$ may indicate dense post-flare loops. (3) H$\alpha$ blueshifted absorptions/emissions provide evidence of massive filament/prominence eruptions, the core structures of CMEs. One newly identified event showed an unexpected rapid decrease in velocity. (4) The lower limit of the CME/eruption association rate with superflares is 27$_{-16}^{+25}$%, yielding occurrence rates of 0.21$_{\pm0.12}$ and $&lt;$0.32$^{+0.46}_{-0.32}$ events per day for EK Draconis and V889 Hercules, respectively. (5) We derived the first direct estimate of the lower limit of the mass-loss rate driven by super-CMEs ($\gtrsim10^{33}$ erg) for EK Dra as $4 \times (10^{-13}$-$10^{-12})$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to the stellar wind mass loss at a similar age. This study provides critical observational constraints on the radiation and plasma environment around young solar-type stars and the early Sun, which can drive planetary space weather and stellar mass/angular momentum loss.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coronal Mass Ejections from Young Suns: Insights from Solar and Stellar Observations and Models</a><span class="id">[2510.22112]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent discoveries have revealed exoplanets orbiting young Sun-like stars, offering a window into the early solar system. These young stars frequently produce extreme magnetic explosions known as superflares, roughly once a day, potentially leading to fast and massive coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Recent research have highlighted the importance of stellar CMEs, as these events and associated particles can trigger atmospheric loss and initiate chemical reactions in planetary atmospheres. However, the observation of these associated CMEs remains largely unexplored, marking a crucial first step in assessing the particle environment. Here we present the results of 5-years multi-wavelength observations of young Sun-like stars, providing the critical clues to the common picture of solar and stellar CMEs. First, through optical spectroscopic observations, we found four of fifteen superflares are associated with fast prominence eruptions, precursors to CMEs. The stellar data greatly resemble solar counterparts, indicating a common picture of solar/stellar eruptions. Second, one of the eruptions is associated with potential coronal dimming in X-rays, indicating that the prominence eruptions evolved into stellar CMEs propagating through interplanetary space. Furthermore, the extension of solar MHD model supports the above indication and suggests that the eruption originates from the active region inferred by Zeeman Doppler Imaging and TESS light curve modeling. This comprehensive study suggests that further advancing the use of solar model could provide the first empirical inputs into calculations of atmospheric escape/chemical reactions for young planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The oscillation properties of the Blue Large Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs): relative change rate of periods, excitations, and period relations</a><span class="id">[2510.22144]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>\textbf{B}lue \textbf{L}arge \textbf{A}mplitude \textbf{P}ulsators (BLAPs) are a type of variable star that has been identified relatively recently. They are characterized by their large amplitude, high gravity, and long periods (2-75 minutes). Some BLAPs exhibit a rich helium abundance on their surfaces, while some of the others show rich hydrogen atmospheres. Up to date, both the mode identification and formation pathways of BLAPs remain subjects of ongoing debate. In this work, we gave an non-adiabatic pulsation analyses for low-order radial and non-radial dipole modes on a theoretical model grid to explore the characterist ics of BLAPs. The effects of element diffusion and radiative levitation are not taken into account our theoretical models. This because that these processes could lead to discrepancies in surface element abundance of the sdB or BLAP stars between theoretical models and observations. Based on the theoretical model grid, our analyses revealed that the radial fundamental modes align well with various observed properties of BLAPs, including the pulsation instability, the position of the excitable models on the HR diagram, surface element compositions, period ranges, and period changes. Our theoretical models also predicted a period-gravity ($\log g$) relation with a narrow distribution, while the observations exhibit a broader range. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the excitation of pulsation in BLAPs is primarily influenced by metal abundance. The thickness of the outer rich hydrogen envelope and the ratio of helium to hydrogen on the surface almost do not affect the pulsation instability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Hubble Constant using Cross-Correlation of Gravitational Wave Events with Flux-Limited Galaxy Catalog</a><span class="id">[2510.22187]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves (GWs) from the compact binary coalescence provide direct measurement of the luminosity distance to the event.

In this study, we demonstrate a novel Bayesian formalism to infer $H_0$ utilizing the $3$D cross-correlation of GW events with galaxies from flux-limited catalog in configuration space. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with $300$ simulated GW events distributed within $1$ Gpc in colored Gaussian noise of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors operating at O4 sensitivity. We show that such measurements can constrain the Hubble constant with a precision of $\sim 9 \%$ ($90\%$ highest density interval).

However, the recently discovered QPEs in ZTF19acnskyy (&quot;Ansky&quot;) appear to be linked to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) rather than a TDE, as their slow decay and AGN-like variability differ markedly from that of typical TDEs. This finding may imply broader formation channels for QPEs. To further investigate Ansky's nature, we obtained a timely ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which reveals a featureless, TDE-like spectrum devoid of broad optical or UV emission lines. Additionally, the steep UV continuum, fitted by a power law with an index of -2.6, aligns more closely with TDEs than with AGNs. Compared to other featureless TDEs, Ansky exhibits a significantly lower blackbody luminosity (10^43 erg s^-1) and much longer rise and decay timescales, suggesting a distinct TDE subclass. An offset TDE involving an intermediate-mass black hole is unlikely, given its position consistent with the galactic center with a 3 sigma upper limit of 54 pc. Instead, we propose that Ansky may result from the tidal disruption of a post-main-sequence star by a typical supermassive black hole. Our findings strengthen the growing evidence for TDE-QPE associations, although other formation channels for QPEs remain plausible and await future observational efforts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avoiding PBH overproduction in inflation model with modified dispersion relation</a><span class="id">[2510.22218]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data of nano-Hertz gravitational waves released in 2023 implies that if such gravitational waves comes from the scalar perturbation induction at the end of inflation, the accompanied primordial black holes (PBHs) will be over-produced, with the fraction exceed the upper bound of unity.

From the constraint on PTA data, we obtain a posterior distribution of the parameters of primordial perturbation, and find that the MDR model, where the $k^4$ term becomes important at later time, can give rise to a broken-power-law (BPL) power spectrum which can alleviate the overproduction problem to nearly $2\sigma$ level.

V0508 And, V0844 Aur, and V0699 Cep are found to be A-type low-mass-ratio medium-contact binaries, while NSVS 6259046 is found to be an A-type deep-contact binary. O - C analysis indicates no long-term variation in V0844 Aur. However, the orbital periods of the other three targets are increasing. We conclude that V0844 Aur, V0699 Cep and NSVS 6259046 are magnetically active, as evidenced by the presence and variable nature of the O'Connell effect in these systems. By analyzing the LAMOST spectroscopic data, we find out that NSVS 6259046 and V0508 And exhibit no chromospheric activity on the dates the LAMOST spectra were taken, while the low signal-to-noise ratio in LAMOST data for V0844 Aur prevents us from obtaining reliable results. We discover that V0699 Cep is an early-type contact binary with chromospheric activity. Their initial masses and ages are calculated. All four systems are determined to be currently stable. We collect 217 contact binaries with both spectroscopic and photometric observations, and compare the differences between short-period and long-period systems in terms of mass-luminosity relation and mass-radius relation, using 0.7 days as the period boundary.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analyzing GW231109_235456 and understanding its potential implications for population studies, nuclear physics, and multi-messenger astronomy</a><span class="id">[2510.22290]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the gravitational-wave trigger GW231109_235456, a sub-threshold binary neutron star merger candidate observed in the first part of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.

We assess the implications for population studies, nuclear physics, and multi-messenger astronomy. Analysing the component masses, we find that GW231109_235456 supports the proposed double Gaussian mass distribution of neutron star masses. Moreover, we find that the remnant most likely collapsed promptly to a black hole and that, because of the large distance, a possible kilonova connected to the merger was noticeably dimmer than AT2017gfo. In addition, we provide constraints on the equation of state from GW231109_235456 alone, as well as combined with GW170817 and GW190425. In our projections for the future, we simulate a similar event using the upcoming generation of gravitational-wave detectors. Our findings indicate that we can constrain the neutron star radius with an accuracy of 400 meters using the Einstein Telescope alone, or 300 meters when combined with the Cosmic Explorer, both at 90% credibility.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22381" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instability and vertical eccentricity variation in global hydrodynamic disk simulations</a><span class="id">[2510.22381]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many dynamical interactions can induce eccentricities in astrophysical accretion disks. Disk eccentricities in turn seed a variety of instabilities, even in ideal hydrodynamics. We use 3D nonlinear simulations and 2+1D linear calculations to characterize local and global instabilities in strongly distorted disks. On local scales, our simulations show the growth of parametrically excited inertial waves, which drive wave turbulence. The inertial waves' growth rates and localizations agree with the predictions of local theory. On global scales, we observe the growth of a separate family of low-frequency, vertically structured modes that compare favorably with eigenmodes computed from the linear theory of an eccentric background state. These low-frequency modes interact nonlinearly with the inertial wave turbulence driven by parametric instability, and they induce variation in eccentricity profiles that are initially uniform in the vertical direction. Extrapolating from our vertically local framework, we postulate that these secondary distortions may correspond to the corrugation of an initially planar eccentric disk. Our simulations demonstrate that strong disk eccentricities drive numerous dynamical phenomena even in a purely hydrodynamic, Newtonian framework.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multivariate Time Series Classification of Fermi - Detected Gamma-Ray Transients Using Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Networks</a><span class="id">[2510.22412]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has detected a diverse range of gamma-ray transients since its launch in 2008. Over the years, Fermi has accumulated an extensive public archive of transient events. Traditional classification methods for these events typically rely on fixed thresholds, localisation accuracy, and characteristic light curve features. However, in the current era of time-critical, multi-wavelength, and multi-messenger astronomy, rapid and reliable classification is essential to enable timely follow-up and coordinated observations. In this work, we develop and present two deep learning-based classifiers that integrate convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures. Using multivariate time-series inputs derived from Fermi-GBM data, our models are trained to distinguish among four classes of gamma-ray transients: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs), Solar Flares (SFLAREs), and Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs). Furthermore, the models are designed to flag events that do not conform to any of these categories, providing a pathway for identifying potentially new or rare transient types. Training was conducted using a carefully curated subset of high-confidence Fermi events. The resulting models achieve an overall classification accuracy of 93%, and identify approximately 2.5% of the triggers as outliers of unknown origin. When applied to Fermi events with uncertain classifications, our models assign 60% of them to the TGF category with over 60% confidence. These results demonstrate that incorporating deep learning-based classification into onboard or automated data pipelines can significantly enhance transient identification, minimize misclassification, and improve the discovery potential of new phenomena in future high-energy astrophysics missions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing AGN-ISM Feedback through Extended X-ray Emission in ESO 137-G034</a><span class="id">[2510.22453]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed analysis of the X-ray emission of the Compton-thick (CT) AGN ESO 137-G034 based on deep ($\sim230$ ks) Chandra observations.

With spatially resolved spectral modeling, we show that the extended emission within the bi-cone regions { is most readily explained} as from a mixture of photo-ionized gas and shock-heated plasma, reflecting the combined effects of radiative and kinematic AGN feedback. By comparing the morphology of the { X-ray emission in narrow spectral bands and that of the 3 cm radio jet, we find suggestive evidence of thermal, possibly shocked emission associated with the SE termination of the radio jet. This interpretation is also supported by the lack of [O III] relative to the $0.3-3.0$ keV flux in the inner $3^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim600$ pc) of the SE cone, which would be consistent with an additional thermal X-ray component on top of the photonized emission of an outflowing wind. A similar effect is only seen within the inner $1^{\prime\prime}$ ($200$ pc) of the NW cone. In the radial profile of the [OIII]/X-ray flux ratio and the X-ray hardness ratio within the inner $\sim3^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim600$ pc) of the SE cone we see an asymmetry, with no counterpart in the NW cone.

These isotopes are accessible via MgH molecular features in cool stellar atmospheres, though their measurement remains challenging across spectral types. We assess the reliability of MgH spectral regions for extracting magnesium isotopic ratios ($^{24}$Mg, $^{25}$Mg, $^{26}$Mg) in stars from M to G types and evaluate consistency with nucleosynthetic expectations. Using spectrum synthesis, we applied an analysis pipeline, validated by three well-studied reference stars, to a sample of five additional dwarf and giant stars. Individual MgH band regions were analysed for sensitivity to isotopic variation. Europium (Eu) and barium (Ba) abundances were also measured to explore correlations with Mg isotopic ratios as r- and s-process proxies. Of ten previously studied MgH wavelength regions, we identify seven as most reliable for isotopic analysis; others showed limited sensitivity across stellar types. Derived Mg isotope ratios ($^{24}$Mg, $^{25}$Mg, $^{26}$Mg) include: HD 11695-81:7:12; HD 18884-81:7:12; HD 18907-69:9:23; HD 22049-71:16:13; HD 23249-66:13:22; HD 128621-67:17:16; HD 10700-78:10:12; HD 100407-65:10:25. Comparison of Eu abundances with Mg isotopes reveals strong correlations, particularly with ($^{24}$Mg, which is predominantly produced by hydrostatic $\alpha$-capture in massive stars, a process preceding the r-process responsible for Eu. In contrast, Ba shows no significant correlation with $^{25}$Mg or $^{26}$Mg, despite their shared s-process origin. Our results demonstrate that selected MgH regions can reliably measure Mg isotopes in cool stars, providing a reproducible framework for future studies of stellar nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22573" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detecting ultralight dark matter in the Galactic Center with pulsars around Sgr A*</a><span class="id">[2510.22573]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) model is a leading dark matter candidate that arises naturally in extensions of the Standard Model.

We show that a helical magnetic field existing prior to the CMB epoch can generate an excess population of photons carrying net circular polarization due to the axion-photon conversion mechanism. Consequently, current measurements of the angular power spectrum of circular polarization ($V$-mode) in the CMB can be used to constrain the parameter space of ALP mass and its coupling to photons.

We prove that the peculiar afterglow light curves of three bursts can be well fitted by structured jets propagated in free-to-shocked stellar wind environment of stellar wind blown bubbles. This scenario offers a self-consistent explanation for the observed subclass of afterglows that exhibit rebrightening that characterized by steep rises and rapid decays. It also provides a unified solution for such events and offers pathways to study both the jet generation mechanism and the propagation process of jets through the envelope of progenitor. This study reveals that the structured jets produced by such events exhibit a narrow jet core and a steep angle-dependent energy decay index, suggesting highly magnetized jets. The derived transition radii from free stellar winds to shocked stellar winds for all three events are smaller than 0.5 pc, with statistical analysis of similar events indicating a median value of 0.1 pc, which conflicts with numerical simulation results.

Three alternative models (i.e. dissipative photosphere, internal shock, and ICMART) have been proposed to interpret the observations of GRB prompt emission, but none of them can fully interpret all of the observational data collected so far. The question is that what is the fraction of these three theoretical models in the prompt emission of GRB, respectively. In this paper, we propose to utilize an innovative method, and constrain the fraction of GRB prompt emission models via its non-detected diffuse neutrinos. By adopting two methods (e.g., summing up the individual GRB contributions and assumed luminosity functions of GRB) to calculate diffuse neutrino flux of GRBs for given the benchmark parameters of $\Gamma=300$ and $\varepsilon_{p} \text{/} \varepsilon_{e}=10$, both approaches indicate that most GRBs should be originated from the ICMART model.

For the method of luminosity functions, the fractions of above three models are constrained to be [0, $6.1\%$], [0, $8.2\%$], and [$91.8\%$, 1], respectively.

The morphology of the synthetic $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission is sensitive to gas temperature and does not coincide with the actual gas disk structures, particularly in the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and clump-infall models, which exhibit peculiar temperature distributions. This highlights the need for careful interpretation of morphologies of line emission from disks under accretion outbursts. The synthetic $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission of each model exhibits distinct kinematic features that can be used to distinguish outburst scenarios. In the MRI model, kinematic features of the gravitational instability (GI), which fuels MRI-driven accretion bursts, are small in both amplitude and spatial extent, resulting in no prominent local features in the residual velocity map at a typical distance for FU Orionis-type objects. In contrast, the clump-infall model shows a clear sign of gas expansion along a spiral, which is caused by exchange of angular momentum between an infalling clump and surrounding gas. The intruder model exhibits a highly asymmetric velocity structure with respect to the systemic velocity of the primary protostar in velocity channel maps. These distinct kinematic features may serve as promising diagnostics for distinguishing the physical mechanisms responsible for FU Orionis-type outbursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Subsurface Temperature Gradients on Emission Spectra of Airless Exoplanets: the Solid-state Greenhouse and Anti-Greenhouse</a><span class="id">[2510.22932]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>An emerging goal of exoplanet science is to constrain the surface composition of airless exoplanets. Without the protection of an atmosphere, these planets are likely covered by a powder-like regolith, similar to the Moon. Laboratory studies show that, under vacuum conditions, such regoliths can develop subsurface temperature gradients, also known as the solid-state greenhouse effect. This effect can significantly modify the emission features of airless bodies, but its potential impact on exoplanets is still unexplored. Here we derive analytic solutions of the two-stream radiative transfer equations with scattering, absorption, plus emission, and combine them with Mie theory calculations to model subsurface temperature gradients and emission spectra of airless exoplanets. The results show exo-regoliths can develop strong solid-state greenhouse or anti-greenhouse effects, with temperature gradients $&gt;200$ K in the upper-most subsurface ($\mathcal{O}(100)\mu$m). These temperature gradients alter surface emission features, modify secondary eclipse depths by up to $\sim50\%$, and can produce higher-than-blackbody emission at some wavelengths. In addition, we study whether subsurface temperature gradients can be disentangled from other microscopic effects, such as changes in space weathering or particle size. At least in some cases, the co-existence of these effects makes it essentially impossible to distinguish different surface compositions within the precisions achievable by JWST. Overall, subsurface temperature gradients thus open potentially new ways to characterize surfaces of airless exoplanets, but they also complicate the interpretation of airless exoplanet spectra. In either case, their effect can be important and should be included in future modeling studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coronal Mass Ejections Deflected by Newly Emerging Flux: A Combined Analytic and Numerical Study</a><span class="id">[2510.22958]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Newly emerging flux (NEF) has been widely studied as a trigger of solar filament eruptions, but its influence on the subsequent dynamics remains poorly explored. Because NEF typically emerges adjacent to filaments, it imposes magnetic asymmetry that can drive non-radial eruptions and complicate space-weather forecasting. We bridge analytic catastrophe theory with 2D resistive MHD simulations: analytic solutions provide magnetic configurations containing a flux rope at the loss-of-equilibrium point, which are then used as initial conditions for simulations to examine the following dynamics. We find that NEF governs the kinematics of filament eruptions in two ways. First, by reshaping coronal stability, NEF can create or eliminate a higher equilibrium in corona, thereby producing failed eruptions or CMEs. In the transitional situation where a metastable equilibrium appears, the rising filament decelerates and stalls before re-accelerating into a CME, consistent with observed two-step eruptions. Second, by breaking symmetry, NEF deflects eruptions away from the radial direction: depending on its polarity, it acts as a repulsor or an attractor on eruptive filaments, and the deflection magnitude increases with the degree of asymmetry. Our theory yields two characteristic angles that predict the deflection directions of CMEs and failed eruptions, and simulations closely aligns with these predictors. These results highlight the NEF not only as a trigger but also as a key factor that governs both the acceleration and deflection of eruptions during their propagation in the low corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A test of Amati relation using HII galaxy distances</a><span class="id">[2510.22979]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use model-independent luminosity distances of 186 HII galaxy observations to address the circularity problem in the Amati relation for Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs).

This implies that the Amati relation using HII galaxies as distance anchors cannot be used as a probe of precision cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN2017ckj: A linearly declining Type IIb supernova with a relatively massive hydrogen envelope</a><span class="id">[2510.22989]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present optical observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN) 2017ckj, covering approximately 180 days after the explosion. Its early-time multi-band light curves display no clear evidence of a shock-cooling tail, resembling the behavior of SN2008ax. The $V$-band light curve exhibits a short rise time of about 5 days and reaches an absolute peak magnitude of $M_{\rm V}=-18.58\pm0.17\mathrm{mag}$. The late-time multi-band light curves reveal a linear decline. We modelled the bolometric light curve of SN2017ckj to constrain the progenitor and the explosion parameters. We estimated a total mass of $\rm ^{56}Ni$ synthesized by SN2017ckj of $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\ M_\odot$, with a massive H-rich envelope of $M_{\rm env} = 0.4^{+0.1}_{-0.1}\ M_\odot$. Both the $\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass and the envelope mass of SN2017ckj are higher than those of typical SNe IIb, in agreement with its peculiar light curve evolution. The early-time spectra of SN2017ckj are dominated by a blue continuum, accompanied by narrow $\rm H_\alpha$ and \Heii emission lines. The earliest spectrum exhibits flash ionization features, from which we estimated a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\sim 3.4\times10^{-4}M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. At later epochs, the spectra develop broad P-Cygni profiles and become increasingly similar to those of SNe IIb, especially SN2018gk. The late-time spectrum at around 139 days does not show a distinct decline in the strength of $\rm H_\alpha$ emission profile, also indicating a relatively massive envelope of its progenitor. Aside from the $\rm H_\alpha$ feature, the nebular spectrum exhibits prominent emission lines of \Oi, \Caii, [\Caii], and \Mgi], which are consistent with the prototypical SN1993J.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2024iss: A Double-peaked Type IIb Supernova with Evidence of Circumstellar Interaction</a><span class="id">[2510.22997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray observations of supernova (SN) 2024iss, a Type IIb SN that shows a prominent double-peaked light curve. We modeled the first peak with a semianalytical shock-cooling model and the X-ray emission with a free-free model. We compare the envelope radius and mass-loss rate with other Type IIb SNe to explore the relationships between the progenitor envelope and the circumstellar material (CSM). The shock-cooling peak in the $V$-band light curve reached $M_V = -17.33\pm 0.26$mag, while the $^{56}$Ni-powered second peak attained $M_V = -17.43\pm 0.26$mag. Early spectra show an photospheric velocity of $\sim19,400\,km\,s^{-1}$ at 3.82days from the H$\alpha$ P Cygni profile. The Balmer lines persist at least +87 days after the explosion, characterizing hydrogen-rich ejecta. Modeling the first light-curve peak suggests an extended envelope with a mass of $0.11\pm0.04\,M_{\odot}$ and a radius of $244\pm43~R_{\odot}$. Fitting the second light-curve peak with an Arnett-like model indicates a typical $^{56}$Ni mass of $ 0.117\pm0.013~M_{\odot}$ and a relatively low ejecta mass of $1.272\pm0.343\,M_{\odot}$. X-ray observations reveal bright thermal bremsstrahlung emission and indicate a mass-loss rate of $1.6\times10^{-5}\ M_{\odot} \ \rm{yr}^{-1}$. SN 2024iss occupies a transitional position between the two subclasses of extended (eIIb) and compact (cIIb) Type IIb SNe. Its envelope radius and pre-explosion mass-loss rate appear to be correlated as theoretically predicted. The observational properties of SN 2024iss are compatible with a binary interaction scenario being the dominant mechanism for envelope stripping. Furthermore, the low column density of neutral hydrogen suggests a compact CSM with an outer radius of $\lesssim1.3\times10^{14}$ cm, indicating that the progenitor star experienced eruptive mass loss within $\sim4\,yr$ of its terminal explosion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23029" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the accelerating black holes from the observations of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray binaries</a><span class="id">[2510.23029]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Black holes in dense astrophysical environments, such as globular clusters or in the vicinity of other massive objects, may possess accelerations. Such acceleration would modulate the characteristics of the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray black hole binaries. In this paper, we explore the influence of spin-aligned acceleration of a black hole on QPOs observed in X-ray binaries. For this purpose, we compute the fundamental frequencies arising from the motion of test particles around an accelerating (spin-aligned) black hole and apply the relativistic precession, parametric resonance, and forced resonance models to establish their correspondence with several observed QPOs of X-ray binaries (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, XTE J1859+226, GRS 1915+105, H1743-322, M82 X-1, and Sgr A$^{*}$). We then employ the Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the black hole parameters. Our results show no evidence for spin-aligned acceleration in any of the analyzed sources, suggesting that most of these X-ray binaries reside in isolated environments and therefore experience only small perturbations to the background spacetime geometries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23037" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the cosmic distance duality relation using model-independent approach</a><span class="id">[2510.23037]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) using the arbitrary redshift pivot Padé-(2,1) expansion methodology developed in arXiv:2509.16196 .

This article investigates the relationship between delta-ARs and flares over the course of three solar cycles (SCs), from 1996 to 2024, with respect to the former's area, lifetime, latitudinal distribution, and phase of its magnetic complexity. Solar cycle 25 has produced the least number of delta-ARs in comparison to the previous two solar cycles, yet the number of M- and X-class flares exceed that of cycle 24 by 25%. Flare occurrence is higher in C-, M-, and X-class events during the presence of the delta-configuration which is seen in all 3 SCs. The total number of flares produced by delta- and non-delta-ARs were 15875 and 17033, respectively across all 3 SCs. The latter are dominated by B- and C-class flares, while the number of M- and X-class flares across all 3 SCs was significantly less than compared to delta-ARs. The median lifetime of an AR in the delta- and non-delta phase is about 5 and 8 days, respectively. The typical number of flares produced by a delta-AR is 20, with maximum values ranging from 80-156 for lifetimes between 6-13 days. However, about 30% of delta-ARs do not produce flares when their lifetimes are between 6-12 days. The latitudinal distribution of delta-ARs across the northern and southern hemispheres is nearly symmetric on either side of the equator for SCs 23 and 24, peaking around +/-10 deg-20 deg. For solar cycles 23 and 24, about 30% of the host delta-ARs have an area exceeding the mean value over the above latitudinal belt while for SC 25, there is a large scatter possibly due to the cycle still being in progress. It remains to be seen if the latter phase of SC 25 will be as active as its earlier phase and whether the number of delta-ARs emerging during that period scale with the total sunspot number.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23072" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evaluating the chromospheric structure model of AD Leo using RH1.5D and magnetic field data</a><span class="id">[2510.23072]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. The interplay between surface magnetic topology and chromospheric heating in active M dwarfs remains poorly constrained, limiting our understanding of their magnetic cycles and high-energy environments. Aims. We aim to test whether detailed Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) maps of AD Leo can be used to spatially anchor a multi-component chromospheric model and validate the link between magnetic flux distribution and emission-line formation. Methods. We analyze high-resolution CARMENES spectra of H-alpha and the Ca II infrared triplet, together with ZDI maps. Synthetic profiles are computed using the RH1.5D non-LTE radiative transfer code with two active atmospheric components (low-latitude near the equator and polar near the pole) and a quiet background. Their relative filling factors and temperature structures are optimized per epoch. The ZDI maps serve as qualitative references for the large-scale magnetic topology but are not used as input to the optimization. Results. Our model reproduces the spectral line profiles across multiple epochs. The low-latitude active region shows notable variability, accounting for approximately 55-86% of the emission, while the polar region remains relatively constant in area (12-17%) but exhibits temperature variations over time, particularly during periods of increased activity. The spatial locations of the active regions derived from spectroscopy agree well with the radial magnetic field distribution from ZDI. Conclusions. Combining spectroscopic modeling with magnetic field maps is an effective approach for mapping magneto-chromospheric structures in M dwarfs. This framework deepens our understanding of stellar magnetic cycles and chromospheric dynamics, paving the way for detailed time-resolved studies in active low-mass stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Search for Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidates in 46-Year Radio Light Curves of 83 Blazars</a><span class="id">[2510.23103]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The combined University of Michigan Radio Astronomy Observatory (UMRAO) and Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) blazar monitoring programs at 14.5/15 GHz provide uninterrupted light curves of $\sim~46-50$ yr duration for 83 blazars, selected from amongst the brightest and most rapidly flaring blazars north of declination $-20^\circ$. In a search for supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidates, we carried out tests for periodic variability using generalized Lomb-Scargle (GLS), weighted wavelet-Z (WWZ), and sine-wave fitting (SWF) analyses of this sample. We used simulations to test the effects of the power law spectrum of the power spectral density (PSD) on our findings, and show that the irregular sampling in the observed light curves has very little effect on the GLS spectra. Apparent periodicities and putative harmonics appear in all 83 of the GLS spectra of the blazars in our sample. We tested the reality of these apparent periodicities and harmonics with simulations, and found that in the overwhelming majority of cases they are due to the steep slope of the PSD, and should therefore be treated with great caution. We find one new SMBHB candidate: PKS 1309+1154, which exhibits a 17.9 year periodicity. The fraction of SMBHB candidates in our sample is $2.4_{-0.8}^{+3.2}\%$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining and Comparing the Dynamical Dark Energy and f(R) Modified Gravity Models with Cosmological Distance Measurements</a><span class="id">[2510.23105]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We constrain and compare the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM dynamical dark energy model and three $f(R)$ modified gravity models using the current cosmological distance measurements, including 112 high-quality localized FRBs, BAO measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI-DR2) and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 12 (BOSS-DR12), SNe Ia from the PantheonPlus compilation and the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) sample, cosmic chronometers (CC), and the angular scale of the first acoustic peak of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from Planck 2018. These datasets allow us to effectively break parameter degeneracy, obtain stringent cosmological constraint results, and conduct systematic model comparison and selection. By using the FRB+PantheonPlus+DESI+CC+CMB dataset, we constrain the parameters of the dark energy equation of state in the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model, obtaining $w_{0} = -0.866 \pm 0.060$ and $w_{a} = -0.37^{+0.27}_{-0.25}$. For the $f(R)$ modified gravity models, the deviation parameter $b$, which characterizes departure from general relativity, is constrained to be $b = 0.199 \pm 0.082$, $b = 0.690^{+0.200}_{-0.130}$, and $b = 0.193 \pm 0.080$ for Hu-Sawicki, Starobinsky, and ArcTanh models, respectively. Besides, we compare the impacts of different SNe Ia datasets (PantheonPlus and DESY5) and BAO datasets (DESI-DR2 and BOSS-DR12) on the constraints of the cosmological models. By employing Bayesian evidence and other model selection criteria, we find that the choice of SNe Ia and BAO datasets can significantly influence the inferred preference for cosmological models. Specifically, the DESY5 and DESI datasets tend to favor $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM and $f(R)$ models, whereas the PantheonPlus and BOSS datasets show a comparatively stronger preference for the $\Lambda$CDM model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Absorption in Cosmic Propagation under the Combined Effects of Axion-Like Particles and Lorentz Violation</a><span class="id">[2510.23113]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Very high energy (VHE) gama rays above 100 GeV are expected to undergo significant attenuation during cosmic propagation due to pair production with thr extralactic background light (EBL). However, recent observations - particulary the tentative detection of gamma ray burst GRB 221009A up to 18 TeV by LHASSO and up to 251 TeV by Carpet-2, challenge the predictions of classical EBL absorption models. These exceptionally high-energy photons suggest the possibility of new physics affecting photon propagation over cosmological distances. In this context, the gamma-ray spectrum in the tens to hundreds of TeV range serves as a valuable probe for potential Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) effects or for modifications to photon attenuation due to axion-like particles (ALPs) mixing with photons in cosmic magnetic fields. However, both LIV and ALPs explanations, when considered separately, face certain limitations in fully accounting for the observed transparency. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that combines the effects of ALPs and LIV to explain the unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. Specifically, we investigate the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this synergistic scenario, demonstrating that for photons at 18 TeV and 251 TeV, the combined influence of ALPs with coupling $g_{a\gamma} = 13.353 \times 10^{-11}\ \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass $m_a = 9.492 \times 10^{-7}\ \mathrm{eV}$, together with LIV characterized by energy scales $E_1 = 2.4~E_{\rm Planck}$ for $n = 1$ , can substantially enhance the photon survival probability. This synergy offers a compelling explanation for the observed VHE gamma-ray transparency in extreme astrophysical environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23115" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luminosity Functions and Detectability of Binary Neutron Star Merger-nova Signals with Various Merger Remnants</a><span class="id">[2510.23115]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the rapid advancements in next-generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, it is anticipated that $10^3$-$10^5$ binary neutron star (BNS) mergers per year will be detected, with a significant fraction accompanied by observable merger-nova signals through future sky surveys. Merger-novae are typically powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized via the r-process. If the post-merger remnant is a long-lived rapid-rotating neutron star, the merger-nova can be significantly enhanced due to strong magnetized winds. In this paper, we generate mock BNS merger samples using binary population synthesis model and classify their post-merger remnants–black hole (BH) and magnetar, (i.e., long-lived supramassive NS and stable NS), based on results from numerical simulations. We then construct merger-nova radiation models to estimate their luminosity function. We find that the luminosity function may exhibit a distinctive triple-peak structure, with the relative positions and heights of these peaks depending on the equation of state (EOS) of the BNS. Furthermore, we estimate the average Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) detection efficiency $\langle f_{\rm eff} \rangle$ with the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) and find that due to possible enhanced luminosity, the largest source redshift with $\langle f_{\rm eff} \rangle&gt;0.1$ can be enlarged from $z_{\rm s}\sim 0.5$ to $z_{\rm s}\sim 1-1.5$.

Stellar coronae are unresolved in X-rays, so inferences about their structure rely on spectral analysis. The &quot;Sun-as-an-X-ray-star&quot; (SaXS) approach uses the Sun as a spatially resolved template to interpret stellar spectra, but previous SaXS implementations were indirect and computationally heavy. Aims. We present a new SaXS implementation that converts solar emission measure distributions (EMDs) of distinct coronal region types into XSPEC spectral components and test whether broad-band X-ray spectra alone can recover their filling factors. Methods. We built XSPEC multi-temperature spectral models for four solar region types (background/quiet corona, active regions, cores, and flares) by using EMDs derived from Yohkoh/SXT data and translating each EMD bin into an isothermal apec component. These models were fit (using PyXspec) to two one-hour DAXSS spectra representative of quiescent (2022-06-29) and flaring (2022-04-25) states. Best-fit normalizations were converted into projected areas and filling factors and compared with near-coincident Hinode/XRT full-disk images. Results. Using the Yohkoh/SXT EMDs, the quiescent Sun spectrum is dominated by active region emission (filling factor  22%), with the background corona poorly constrained. The flaring Sun spectrum is best described by a combination of active regions, cores, and flares with filling factors of  47.5%,  4.1%, and  0.062%, respectively. The dominant components match spatial features seen in Hinode/XRT images. Limitations include the DAXSS low-energy cutoff ( 0.7 keV) and the small, non-uniform Yohkoh EMD sample. Conclusions. Our SaXS implementation enables direct retrieval of coronal filling factors from broad-band X-ray spectra and provides a physically motivated alternative to ad hoc few-temperature fits, suitable for stellar X-ray analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recasting and Forecasting Dark Matter Limits Without Raw Data: A Generalized Algorithm for Gamma-Ray Telescopes</a><span class="id">[2510.23168]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel method for both forecasting and recasting upper limits (ULs) on dark matter (DM) annihilation cross sections, $\left&lt; \sigma v \right&gt;^{UL}$, or decay lifetime $\tau^{LL}$ . The forecasting method relies solely on the instrument response functions (IRFs) to predict ULs for a given observational setup, without the need for full analysis pipelines. The recasting procedure uses published ULs to reinterpret constraints for alternative DM models or channels. We demonstrate its utility across a range of canonical annihilation channels, including $b\bar{b}$, $W^+W^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $\mu^+\mu^-$, and apply it to several major gamma-ray experiments, including MAGIC, \textit{Fermi}-LAT, and CTAO. Notably, we develop a recasting approach that remains effective even when the IRF is unavailable by extracting generalized IRF-dependent coefficients from benchmark channels. We apply this method to reinterpret ULs derived from standard spectra (e.g., PPPC4DMID) in terms of more recent DM scenarios, including a Higgsino-like model with mixed final states and spectra generated with the CosmiXs model. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and direct comparison with published results confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method, with discrepancies remaining within statistical uncertainties. The algorithm is generally applicable to any scenario where the expected signal model is parametric, offering a powerful tool for reinterpreting existing gamma-ray limits and efficiently exploring the DM parameter space in current and future indirect detection experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spinning-down RU Lup.

In this work, we aim at characterizing the multi-component outflow of RU Lup. The unprecedented high resolution of the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) enabled a detailed study of the forbidden emission lines and the blueshifted absorption in the lines of the Na I and Ca II doublets, which we resolved in three discrete absorption components at low, medium, and high velocities. We developed a method that disentangles vertical and toroidal velocities in the absorption components and infers the wind launching radius, magnetic lever arm, and mass-loss rate. We identified a low-velocity broad component in the [O I] 5577 line, consistent with a rotating magnetohydrodynamic disk wind launched near the disk truncation radius. We showed that the discrete absorption components trace spatially and physically distinct regions of the outflow. The medium and low velocity components are launched from the inner disk (&lt; 6.76 stellar radii) with low lever arms indicative of warm, highly mass-loaded streamlines. However, the two components differ mainly in vertical velocity. The low velocity absorption is consistent with an outer absorbing shell, while the medium velocity absorption forms near the disk truncation radius. Its higher vertical velocity is compatible with either a slightly larger lever arm, or additional heating at the base of the flow. For plausible ionization levels in the inner disk, this outflow component removes a substantial fraction of the accretion spin-up torque. In conclusion, our work shows that RU Lup hosts a stratified, rotating, warm disk wind launched across a narrow annulus near the disk truncation radius, which is sufficiently mass-loaded to extract a large amount of the stellar spin-up torque. The observations disfavor an X-wind scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundamental effective temperature measurements for eclipsing binary stars - VI.

The extensive spectroscopy used to detect this circumbinary planet has also been used to directly measure the masses of the stars in the eclipsing binary. We have used light curves from the TESS mission combined with these mass measurements to directly measure the following radii and surface gravities for the stars in this system: $R_1 = 1.386 \pm 0.010\,R_{\odot}$, $\log g_1 = 4.190 \pm 0.004$, $R_2 = 0.274 \pm 0.002\,R_{\odot}$, $\log g_2 = 4.979 \pm 0.002$.

For spectroscopic analysis of these fine structures, we applied machine-learning methods (k-means clustering) and Gaussian fitting. Using k-means, we identified elongated features in the flare ribbons, termed as &quot;riblets&quot;, which are short-lived and jet-like small-scale structures that extend as plasma columns from the flare ribbons. Riblets are more prominent near the solar limb and represent the ribbon front. Riblet widths are consistent across observations, ranging from 110-310 km (0&quot;.15-0&quot;.41), while vertical lengths span 620-1220 km (0&quot;.83-1&quot;.66), with a potential maximum of 2000 km (2&quot;.67), after accounting for projection effects. Detailed H-beta spectral analysis reveals that riblets exhibit a single, redshifted emission component, with velocities of 16-21 km s^1, independent of viewing angle. Our high-resolution observations of the three flare ribbons show that they are not continuous structures, but are composed of vertically extended, fine-scale substructures. These irregular features indicate that the reconnection region is not a smooth, laminar current sheet, but rather a fragmented zone filled with magnetic islands, consistent with the theory of patchy reconnection within the coronal current sheet.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23277" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energetics of star-planet magnetic interactions: Novel insights from 3D modelling</a><span class="id">[2510.23277]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Star-planet magnetic interactions (SPMI) occurring in the sub-Alfvenic regime can, in principle, induce stellar chromospheric hotspots. Currently, estimates of the power generated by SPMI primarily rely on analytical scaling laws that relate stellar and planetary parameters to the interaction energetics. The existing scaling laws published in the literature so far do not agree with each other by at least an order of magnitude. Our aim is to quantify an absolute upper limit on the power that a planet can channel back to its host star during such interactions, which in turn lead to the formation of stellar hotspots. By performing a series of 3D MHD simulations with varied parameters known to influence the energetics of SPMI, we derive a numerically supported scaling law that can be used to reliably estimate the energy channeled from the planet back to the star. Our results suggest that existing analytical scaling laws may not fully capture the power transferred from the planet to the star through SPMI. The scaling law derived from our numerical simulations appears to provide a more comprehensive estimate, reflecting dependencies on common stellar and planetary parameters also considered in earlier models. Moreover, our findings indicate that power generation involves not only the planetary obstacle itself but also the extended magnetic structure of the Alfven wings interacting with the streaming stellar wind. This study suggests that care should be taken when applying analogies directly from jovian sub-Alfvenic interactions to SPMI, as the underlying physical conditions (specifically the value of the Alfvenic Mach number) may not be directly comparable. Our numerically derived scaling law offers a potentially improved approach for estimating SPMI power, capturing some of the interaction's complexities exclusive to SPMI.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The effects of stellar activity cycles on planetary atmospheric escape and the HeI 1083nm transit signature</a><span class="id">[2510.23282]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The HeI 1083nm transit signature is commonly used in tracing escaping planetary atmospheres. However, it can be affected by stellar activity, complicating detections and interpretations of atmospheric escape. We model how stellar activity cycles affect the atmospheric escape and HeI 1083nm signatures of four types of highly irradiated exoplanets, at 0.025 and 0.05 au, during minimum and maximum cycle phases. We consider two stars, exhibiting different cycle behaviours: the Sun and the more active star iota Hor, for which we reconstruct its spectral energy distributions at minimum and maximum phases using X-ray observations and photospheric models. We show that over a modulated activity cycle, the release of extreme ultraviolet photons, responsible for atmospheric escape, varies substantially more than that of mid-UV photons, capable of photoionising HeI (23S). This leads to consistently stronger helium signatures during maximum phases. We show that planets at the largest orbit are more affected by cycles, showing larger variations in escape rates and absorptions between minimum and maximum. We also confirm the counter-intuitive behaviour that, despite the fall-off in escape rate with orbital distance, the HeI 1083nm absorption is not significantly weaker at further orbits, even strengthening with orbital distance for some iota Hor planets. We partially explain this behaviour with the lower mid-UV fluxes at more distant orbits, leading to less HeI (23S) photoionisations. Finally, we propose that stellar cycles could explain some of the conflicting HeI 1083nm observations of the same planet, with detections more likely during a phase of activity maximum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23287" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can KM3-230213A be compatible with a cosmogenic origin?</a><span class="id">[2510.23287]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>On the 13th February 2023 the KM3NeT/ARCA telescope observed a track-like event compatible with a ultra-high-energy muon with an estimated energy of 120 PeV, produced by a neutrino with an even higher energy, making it the most energetic neutrino event ever detected. The reported equivalent flux suggest the possible existence of a new diffuse component. A diffuse cosmogenic flux is expected to originate from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with ambient photon and matter fields. Here we show that this component can be compatible with the reported flux level only integrating the cosmogenic emission, at least up to redshift  $z = 6 $ and assuming a subdominant fraction of protons in the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray flux, thus placing constraints on known cosmic accelerators.

However, large homogeneous catalogues of rotational velocities derived from high-resolution stellar spectra are still lacking. The main objective of this work is to determine the line-broadening parameter (Vbroad), a proxy for the stellar rotational velocity, in a large sample of FGKM stars based on their ESO/FEROS spectra, previously parameterised by the AMBRE Project. Vbroad was estimated by cross-correlating the FEROS spectra with AMBRE binary masks. This methodology also relies on a specific calibration of a coupling constant between the rotational velocity and the width of the cross-correlation function. This fundamental step was performed by adopting the AMBRE grid of synthetic spectra. The derived Vbroad were then validated using data from the literature, ground-based spectroscopic surveys, and Gaia/RVS. After analysing more than 5,000 FEROS spectra (including repeated spectra for several stars), we obtained the line-broadening coefficients for 2,584 stars covering the FGKM spectral types, any stellar gravity, and metallicities between the metal-poor up to sub-solar regimes. The mean Vbroad relative uncertainty of this sample was found to be smaller than 8%. As expected, most stars were found to be slow rotators (below a few km/s), in particular, cool dwarfs and giants. However, several hot dwarfs and high-luminosity stars with high-Vbroad rates were identified, most of them not previously classified as fast rotators and/or affected by large macro-turbulent effects. The measured rotational broadening values are of high-quality and verified on the basis of literature comparisons. We publicly provide this catalogue of Vbroad parameters, including stellar atmospheric and quality parameters, for the analysed AMBRE/FEROS sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23345" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First detection of ultra-high energy emission from gamma-ray binary LS I +61 303</a><span class="id">[2510.23345]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the first detection of gamma-ray emission up to ultra-high-energy (UHE; $&gt;$100 TeV) emission from the prototypical gamma-ray binary system LS I +61 303 using data from the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO).

Such a convectively stable layer could have a strong influence on the internal fluid waves propagating underneath the core-mantle boundary (CMB) that are used to probe the outermost region of the core through the wave interaction with the geomagnetic field and the rotation of the mantle. Here, we numerically investigate the effect of a top stable layer on the outer core fluid waves by calculating the eigenmodes in a neutrally stratified sphere permeated by a magnetic field with and without a top stable layer. We use a numerical model, assuming a flow with an m-fold azimuthal symmetry, that allows for radial motions across the lower boundary of the stable layer and angular momentum exchanges across the CMB through viscous and electromagnetic coupling. On interannual time-scales, we find torsional Alfvén waves that are only marginally affected by weak to moderate stratification strength in the outer layer. At decadal time-scales similarly weak stable layers promote the appearance of waves that propagate primarily within the stable layer itself and resemble Magneto-Archimedes-Coriolis (MAC) waves, even though they interact with the adiabatic fluid core below. These waves can exert viscous and electromagnetic torques on the mantle that are several orders of magnitude larger than those in the neutrally stratified case.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23367" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Rare Events to a Population: Discovering Overlooked Extragalactic Magnetar Giant Flare Candidates in Archival Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor Data</a><span class="id">[2510.23367]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetar giant flares (MGFs) are rare, extremely bright bursts of gamma-rays from highly magnetized neutron stars. These events are challenging to identify because, at extragalactic distances, they can appear similar to other astrophysical phenomena. Only a handful have been confidently identified to date, limiting our understanding of their origin and physical properties. This study focuses on expanding the sample of known events and enabling a more detailed characterization of their observational features and intrinsic properties, while introducing significant improvements in the methods used to identify and analyze them. When applied to archival data from the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on the \Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, this approach added four previously unidentified events the known sample, expanding the total to 13 MGFs. This demonstrates both the effectiveness of the method and the likelihood that additional MGFs remain hidden in existing gamma-ray burst catalogs. We utilize this expanded sample to gain a deeper understanding of the broader population of MGFs. We develop a statistical modeling framework that combines previously considered data with modern observations from Fermi/GBM. The model accounts for instrumental sensitivity and the expected diversity in event characteristics. We infer a volumetric rate of events above $1.2\times10^{44}\,\rm{erg}$ of $R_{MGF}=5.5^{+4.5}_{-2.7}\times10^5\rm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$. The results show that individual magnetars must produce multiple flares throughout their lifetimes, reinforcing the idea that these are recurring phenomena rather than singular explosive events. Expanding the sample of known MGFs improves our understanding of magnetars and their role in other astrophysical phenomena, including possible links to fast radio bursts, gravitational waves, and the creation of heavy elements in extreme astrophysical environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Near-Ultraviolet Spectra of FU Orionis Accretion Disks</a><span class="id">[2510.23390]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the results of the first high-sensitivity NUV (1800 to 3200 Å) survey of FU Ori objects, using the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) STIS spectrograph.

(2013) by further analyzing the influence of dynamical friction on the evolution of cosmological perturbations within the framework of the spherical collapse model (SCM) in a Universe dominated by generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG). Specifically, we investigate how dynamical friction alters the growth rate of density perturbations, the effective sound speed, the equation-of-state parameter www, and the evolution of the cosmic expansion rate. Our results demonstrate that dynamical friction significantly delays the collapse process compared to the standard SCM. Accurate computation of these parameters is crucial for obtaining consistent results and reliable physical interpretations when employing the GCG model. Furthermore, our analysis confirms that the suppression of perturbation growth due to dynamical friction is considerably more pronounced than that caused by shear and rotation, as previously indicated by Del Popolo et al.

This enhanced suppression effectively addresses the instability issues, such as oscillations or exponential divergences in the dark-matter power spectrum, highlighted in linear perturbation studies, such as those by Sandvik et al.

For DES Y6, photometric redshift distributions are estimated using self-organizing maps (SOMs), calibrated with spectroscopic and many-band photometric data. To overcome limitations from color-redshift degeneracies and incomplete spectroscopic coverage, we enhance this approach by incorporating clustering-based redshift constraints (clustering-z, or WZ) from angular cross-correlations with BOSS and eBOSS galaxies, and eBOSS quasar samples. We define a WZ likelihood and apply importance sampling to a large ensemble of SOM-derived $n(z)$ realizations, selecting those consistent with the clustering measurements to produce a posterior sample for each lens and source bin. The analysis uses angular scales of 1.5-5 Mpc to optimize signal-to-noise while mitigating modeling uncertainties, and marginalizes over redshift-dependent galaxy bias and other systematics informed by the N-body simulation Cardinal. While a sparser spectroscopic reference sample limits WZ constraining power at $z&gt;1.1$, particularly for source bins, we demonstrate that combining SOMPZ with WZ improves redshift accuracy and enhances the overall cosmological constraining power of DES Y6.

However, the physical meaning of these learned features remains underexplored, limiting the interpretability of such models. In this work, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines a CNN-based feature extractor with a random forest (RF) classifier to improve both detection performance and interpretability. Unlike prior approaches that directly connect classifiers to CNN outputs, our method introduces four physically interpretable metrics - variance, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), waveform overlap, and peak amplitude - computed from the final convolutional layer. These are jointly used with the CNN output in the RF classifier to enable more informed decision boundaries. Tested on long-duration strain datasets, our hybrid model outperforms a baseline CNN model, achieving a relative improvement of 21\% in sensitivity at a fixed false alarm rate of 10 events per month. Notably, it also shows improved detection of low-SNR signals (SNR $\le$ 10), which are especially vulnerable to misclassification in noisy environments. Feature attribution via the RF model reveals that both CNN-extracted and handcrafted features contribute significantly to classification decisions, with learned variance and CNN outputs ranked among the most informative. These findings suggest that physically motivated post-processing of CNN feature maps can serve as a valuable tool for interpretable and efficient GW detection, bridging the gap between deep learning and domain knowledge.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21824" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond Point Matching: Evaluating Multiscale Dubuc Distance for Time Series Similarity</a><span class="id">[2510.21824]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Time series are high-dimensional and complex data objects, making their efficient search and indexing a longstanding challenge in data mining.

This work underscores the importance of incorporating topographic effects in the design and optimization of next-generation neutrino telescopes, as is done in the context of mountain-based detectors such as TAMBO. We present a numerical code which can be used to easily extend this topographical analysis to other experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21942" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bubble wall velocity with out-of-equilibrium corrections</a><span class="id">[2510.21942]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study how out-of-equilibrium effects modify the steady-state propagation of bubble walls during a cosmological first-order electroweak phase transition. Going beyond the local thermal equilibrium approximation, we numerically solve the coupled system of scalar field, hydrodynamic and Boltzmann equations using a spectral algorithm that allows a first-principle treatment of the collision integral. This approach enables a quantitative assessment of non-equilibrium perturbations in the plasma and their backreaction on the wall motion. Focusing on the singlet extension of the Standard Model as a minimal benchmark scenario, we find that out-of-equilibrium corrections substantially enhance the effective friction on the expanding front, leading to slower wall velocities and broader wall profiles compared to the equilibrium case. These modifications have significant implications for cosmological observables. For instance, they enhance the efficiency of electroweak baryogenesis, thus improving the viability of baryon asymmetry generation within realistic parameter regions that can also be probed by future gravitational wave interferometers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inferring neutron-star Love-Q relations from gravitational waves in the hierarchical Bayesian framework</a><span class="id">[2510.22137]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Despite the large uncertainties in the equation of state for neutron stars (NSs), a tight universal “Love-Q” relation exists between their dimensionless tidal deformability, $\Lambda$, and the dimensionless quadrupole moment, $Q$. However, this relation has not yet been directly measured through observations. Gravitational waves (GWs) emitted from binary NS (BNS) coalescences provide an avenue for such a measurement. In this study, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian framework and combine multiple simulated GW events to measure the Love-Q relation. We simulate 1000 GW sources and select 20 events with the highest signal-to-noise ratios and NS spins for the analysis. By inspecting four parameterization models of the Love-Q relation, we observe strong correlations between the model parameters. We verify that a linear relation between $\ln\Lambda$ and $\ln Q$ is practically sufficient to describe the Love-Q relation with the precision expected from next-generation GW detectors. Furthermore, we utilize the inferred Love-Q relation to test modified gravity. Taking the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as an example, our results suggest that the characteristic length can be constrained to $10\, \mathrm{km}$ or less with future GW observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22248" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ultra Slow-Roll Phase Of Warm Inflation In Braneworld Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2510.22248]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Slow-roll of the inflaton (inflationary field) defines the standard dynamics of the inflationary epoch. However, the inflaton deviates from slow-roll when it encounters an extremely flat region in the inflationary potential, and enters a phase dubbed Ultra Slow Roll (USR). In previous studies, there have been various theories which modify the theory of general relativity, all of them having different motivations based on different paradigms. Among these, braneworld gravity, motivated from string theory; is one of the most prominent theories as it provides a geometrical explanation for the weakness of gravity. In this article, we explore two possible braneworld background theories, the Randall-Sundrum (RS-II) model and the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porratai (DGP) model, and then realize an USR phase in a particularly interesting inflationary scenario, called warm inflation. In the warm inflationary scenario, a thermal radiation bath coexists with the inflationary energy density as an effect of the dissipative dynamics. We then derive inflationary slow roll parameters and the primordial power spectrum of scalar curvature perturbations in such a setup. We then numerically investigate the evolution of the inflaton and the primordial power spectrum of scalar curvature perturbations. Our analysis shows that the braneworld contributions become progressively suppressed as the USR conditions are made more stringent, indicating that the USR phase effectively diminishes brane-induced corrections to standard inflationary dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symmetry principles of gravitational perturbations in thermal environments</a><span class="id">[2510.22346]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The instantaneous elastic response of gravitational perturbations to the thermal plasma can modify their dynamics near the horizon scale in the early universe.

In this work we investigate the behavior of thermodynamic geodesic of Bardeen regular black hole in thermodynamic space defined by three different GTD metrics. Based on the behavior of thermodynamic geodesic as well as thermodynamic curvature we argued that conventional GTD metric need some modifications to reflect all the thermodynamical properties of a system. We also modified the conventional GTD metrics and explore the behavior of thermodynamic geodesic defined by the modified metrics. Our study shows that the modified GTD metrics contain most of the information about the thermodynamical boundaries such as temperature vanishing line, spinodal line etc. of a black hole system. Based on the property of geodesic and Ricci scalar defined by the modified metrics we argued that the modified version of GTD metric are most suitable metric structures for studying the underlying thermodynamic behavior of a black hole system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Refined Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Lepton Flavor Violating Axions</a><span class="id">[2510.22523]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The supernova (SN) core, characterized by its extreme temperature and density, serves as a unique laboratory for new-physics searches. Low-energy supernovae (LESNe) provide particularly powerful probes, as their low explosion energies place stringent limits on any additional energy deposition in the mantle by new particles. We present refined LESN constraints on lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) with electron-muon couplings. We consider four production channels in the SN: muon decay, lepton bremsstrahlung, electron-muon coalescence, and semi-Compton scattering, the last of which is investigated here for the first time in the context of LFV-ALPs. We find that muon decay dominates in the low-mass regime, electron-muon coalescence in the high-mass regime, and semi-Compton scattering in the intermediate-mass range. To derive accurate limits, we compute both the energy transfer from the SN core to the mantle and the energy loss due to ALP production in the mantle, which can be substantial for both large and small couplings – the latter case, to our knowledge, not previously noted in the literature. We find that LESNe provide the most stringent constraints on the parameter space for ALP masses above $\sim 110$ MeV. These refined results strengthen previous SN bounds and highlight the exceptional sensitivity of LESNe to LFV new physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some Properties of Multi-Component Axion Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2510.22569]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a mechanism for multi-component dark matter (DM) that originates from axion mixing.

This framework can be realized in the type IIB string axiverse with hierarchical axion masses and decay constants. Our investigation reveals that in the light QCD axion scenario, the energy density of the lightest ALP often dominates after mixing, invalidating the canonical light axion scenario. On the other hand, in the heavy QCD axion scenario, both the QCD axion and non-lightest ALPs may dominate, depending on the ALP decay constants. Under certain conditions, the canonical heavy axion scenario remains valid. Finally, we briefly discuss a theoretical framework featuring $\sim\mathcal{O}(100)$ axions, with hierarchical axion masses and decay constants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial black hole formation from collapsing domain walls with full general relativity</a><span class="id">[2510.22759]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the dynamics of isolated closed domain walls with 3+1 numerical relativity.

First, we focus on spherically symmetric closed domain walls and clarify whether they finally evolve into black holes. Naively, the wall can collapse if its thickness is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius which is determined by the initial surface energy. Our numerical results support this naive criterion for the black hole formation, and indicate that more than 80% of the initial wall energy falls into the black hole. We also investigate the nonspherical collapse by considering the ellipsoidal configurations for the closed domain walls, and it turns out that black holes can be formed even when the ratio of semi-major to semi-minor axes is 1.5.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the Landscape of Spontaneous CP Violation in Supersymmetric Theories</a><span class="id">[2510.23033]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The strong CP problem remains one of the most important unresolved issues in the Standard Model. Spontaneous CP violation (SCPV) is a promising approach to the problem by assuming that CP is an exact symmetry of the Lagrangian but broken spontaneously at the vacuum, which enables the generation of the observed Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) phase without reintroducing a nonzero strong CP phase. Supersymmetry (SUSY) provides a natural framework to accommodate such a mechanism, as SUSY can not only protect the scale of SCPV from radiative corrections but also suppress problematic higher-dimensional operators generating a strong CP phase. In the present study, we explore the realization of SCPV in two distinct SUSY scenarios. First, we investigate SCPV in the exact SUSY limit, extending the spurion formalism developed in non-supersymmetric theories and introducing a method to determine whether the given superpotential satisfies the necessary condition for SCPV. Second, we construct a model in which CP is spontaneously broken at an intermediate scale along pseudo-flat directions, stabilized by soft SUSY breaking and non-perturbative effects of a gauge theory. The latter setup predicts light scalars in the SCPV sector whose masses are determined by the SUSY breaking scale.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lensing, not luck!

This may produce multiple copies of the signals (i.e., lensed images) arriving at different times at the detector. These, if observed, could offer new probes of astrophysics and cosmology. However, identification of lensed image pairs among a large number of unrelated GW events is challenging. Though the number of lensed events increases with improved detector sensitivity, the false alarms increase quadratically faster. While this &quot;lensing or luck&quot; problem would appear to be insurmountable, we show that the expected increase in measurement precision of source parameters will efficiently weed out false alarms. Based on current astrophysical models and anticipated sensitivities, we predict that the first confident detection could occur in the fifth observing run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. We expect computational costs to be a major hurdle in achieving such a detection, and show that the Posterior Overlap 2.0 method may offer a near-optimal solution to this challenge.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observable Signatures of Quarkyonic Phase in Neutron Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.23405]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this letter, we perform Bayesian inference on quarkyonic equation-of-state models and find they remain viable under all current astrophysical constraints.

We demonstrate analytically that the selection effect inevitably introduces a bias in the redshift-space power spectrum on scales from linear to nonlinear scales. To quantitatively assess the impact of the selection effect, we construct mock galaxy catalogs from halos in N-body simulations by selecting halos above redshift-dependent mass thresholds such that the resulting redshift distribution of the halos, $n(z)$, matches that of SDSS-like galaxies. We find that the selection effect causes fractional changes of up to only 1% and 2% in the monopole and quadrupole moments of the redshift-space power spectrum at $k\lesssim 0.3~h{\rm{Mpc}}^{-1}$, respectively, compared to the moments for the single mass-threshold (therefore single tracer) sample, for $n_{\rm g}(z)$ of the SDSS-like galaxy samples.

The LCS can, in principle, constrain the reionization model and history by quantifying the morphology of neutral hydrogen (\HI) distribution during the different stages of the EoR. Specifically, the percolation transition of ionized regions, quantified and constrained via LCS, provides a crucial insight about the underlying reionization model. The previous LCS analysis of EoR 21 cm maps demonstrates that the convolution of the synthesized beam of the radio interferometric arrays, e.g. SKA1-Low with the target signal, shifts the apparent percolation transition of ionized regions towards the lower redshifts. In this study, we present an optimal thresholding strategy to reduce this bias in the recovered percolation transition. We assess the robustness of LCS analysis of the 21 cm maps, considering the effects of antenna-based gain calibration errors and instrumental noise for SKA1-Low. This analysis is performed using synthetic observations simulated by the \textsc{21cmE2E} pipeline, considering SKA1-Low AA4 configuration within a radius of 2 km from the array centre. Our findings suggest that a minimum of $2000$ hours of observation (SNR $\gtrapprox 3$) are required for the LCS analysis to credibly suppress the confusion introduced by thermal noise. Further, we also demonstrate that for a maximum antenna-based calibration error tolerance of $\sim 0.02\%$ (post calibration), the reionization history can be recovered in a robust and relatively unbiased manner using the LCS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03555" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forecasts for interacting dark energy with time-dependent momentum exchange</a><span class="id">[2504.03555]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Models of interacting dark energy and dark matter offer a possible solution to cosmological tensions.

Using hydromagnetic mean-field simulations of $\alpha\Omega$-type dynamos in rotating shearing-periodic boxes, we show that for negative shear, the MRI can operate above a certain critical shear parameter. This parameter scales inversely with the equipartition magnetic field strength above which $\alpha$ quenching set in. Like the usual $\Omega$ effect, the MRI produces toroidal magnetic field when the field is sufficiently strong. The work done by the Lorentz force is positive, so the magnetic field drives kinetic energy and not the other way around, as in a turbulent dynamo. This results in strong kinetic energy production and dissipation, which occurs at the expense of the magnetic energy. In view of the application to the solar NSSL, we conclude that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity may be too large for the MRI to be excited and that therefore only the standard $\Omega$ effect is expected to operate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">93.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08737" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling the Light Curve and Spectra of SN 2023aew</a><span class="id">[2505.08737]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose that the delayed conversion of a neutron star (NS) into either a quark star (QS) or a hybrid star (HS), occurring approximately 105-109 days after the supernova (SN) explosion, injects   2e49 erg of thermal energy into the expanded SN ejecta. This energy, delivered over   40 days via a quark-nova (QN) shock or the spin-down power of the HS, can reproduce the photometric and spectral features observed in SN 2023aew. In this model, the first light curve peak corresponds to the 56Ni-powered SN resulting from a stripped-envelope progenitor with a zero-age main sequence mass of at least   (15-16)M_sun. The plateau between the two peaks may result from interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM). Alternatively, it could be explained by the spin-down power of the NS prior to its conversion into a highly magnetized HS, which is responsible for powering the second bump. A scenario involving two phases of spin-down power - first from the NS and later from the HS - is compelling and supports the hypothesis that some magnetars are, in fact, HSs. These HSs acquire their ultra-strong magnetic fields through a quark matter phase capable of sustaining core fields on the order of   1e18 G. In our model, the spin-down energy of the HS powers the QN ejecta - the outermost layers of the NS - before this energy is transferred to the expanded SN ejecta. This process produces luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs). The model establishes a potential connection between superluminous SNe (SLSNe) and LFBOTs, with significant implications for high-energy astrophysics and the r-process nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. Potential consequences for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are also discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">94.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The mantle-inner core gravitational mode of oscillation in a strong magnetic field regime</a><span class="id">[2505.21271]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The mantle-inner core gravitational (MICG) mode is the free mode axial oscillation between the mantle and inner core sustained by the gravitational torque between their degree 2 order 2 density structures. Here, we investigate how the MICG mode is affected by oscillations of cylindrical surfaces in the fluid outer core in the form of Alfvén waves. The latter are triggered by oscillations of the tangent cylinder (TC) moving jointly with the inner core and propagate away from the rotation axis. We show that the MICG mode remains a distinct normal mode of oscillation of the core-mantle system only when the triggered Alfvén waves are attenuated before they traverse the width of the fluid core. For an internal magnetic field strength of a few mT, as we expect in Earth's core, Alfvén waves can readily traverse the width of the core, and the MICG mode is absorbed into the spectrum of torsional oscillation (TO) modes. The MICG period retains a dynamical influence, acting as a point of resonance for TO modes, and marking the transition from a TO mode in which the motion of the TC (including the inner core) is weakly impacted by gravitational coupling to one in which the oscillating motion of the TC is strongly restricted. Our results imply that the observed 6-year periodic signal in the length of day cannot be interpreted as the signature of the MICG mode and must instead be caused by TO modes, or more generally, by the propagation of Alfvén waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">95.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation-magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Accretion Flow Formation After a Tidal Disruption Event</a><span class="id">[2506.00109]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of the fallback debris after a tidal disruption event.

We find that large magnetic fields can increase the debris stream thickness, moderately reducing the efficiency of the radiative acceleration of outflows during the first self-intersecting collisions. As gas accumulates and the collisions happen instead between the infalling stream and the accretion flow, magnetized and nonmagnetized systems evolve similarly at these early times: radiation-driven outflows dominate early after the initial stream-stream collision and a few days later, the accretion rate exceeds the mass outflow rate. We find that the MRI does not play a significant role in angular momentum transport and dissipation. Nor do we find evidence of a magnetocentrifugal driven outflow. Instead, collisions continue to dissipate kinetic energy into radiation that launches outflows and powers TDE luminosities reaching $L\sim4-6\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Shock-driven outflows and inflows redistribute angular momentum throughout the extent ($\sim50 r_s$) of the forming eccentric disk. Even in the presence of magnetic stresses, the accretion flow remains mostly eccentric with $e\sim0.2-0.3$ for $r\lesssim8r_s$ and $e\sim0.4-0.5$ for $10\lesssim r\,(r_s)\lesssim50$.

Snapshots are saved at multiple redshifts for each simulation and post-processed using the watershed void finder VIDE to identify cosmic voids. For each simulation code, we measure the following statistics: void size function, void ellipticity function, core density function, and the void radial density profile. We use these statistics to quantify the accuracy of PINOCCHIO relative to OpenGADGET3 in the context of cosmic voids. Results. We find agreement for all void statistics at better than 2{\sigma} between PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, with no systematic difference in redshift trends. This demonstrates that the PINOCCHIO code can reliably produce void statistics with high computational efficiency compared to full N-body simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">97.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hybrid Quark Stars with Quark-Quark Phase Transitions</a><span class="id">[2507.00776]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the possibility of phase transitions between different quark matter phases occurring within quark stars, giving rise to the hybrid quark stars (HybQSs). First, we obtain the generic phase diagram of possible mass-radius relation forms for the HybQSs. Then, utilizing a well-established general parameterization of interacting quark matter, we construct quark star models featuring sharp first-order quark-quark phase transitions of various types, in contrast to the hadron-quark transition in conventional hybrid stars. We systematically investigate how recent observations, such as the pulsar mass measurement $M_{\rm TOV}\gtrsim2M_{\odot}$ and the GW170817's tidal deformability bound $\Lambda_{1.4M_{\odot}}&lt;800$, constrain the viable parameter space. We also identified twin stars in some of the HybQS parameter space. Furthermore, we found that the quark-quark phase transitions in hybrid quark stars may also cause the deviation from the approximate universal relation between the dominant postmerger frequency $f_{\rm peak}$ and tidal deformability $\Lambda_{1.35M_{\odot}}$, which was previously believed to only be caused by the hadron-quark phase transitions in hybrid neutron stars. This work unveils new possibilities of phase transitions and the resulting new types of compact stars in realistic astrophysical scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">98.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harnessing the potential of PyStoch: detecting continuous gravitational waves from interesting supernova remnant targets</a><span class="id">[2507.15027]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detecting continuous gravitational waves (CWs) is challenging due to their weak amplitude and high computational demands, especially with poorly constrained source parameters. Stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) searches using cross-correlation techniques can identify unresolved astrophysical sources, including CWs, at lower computational cost, albeit with reduced sensitivity. This motivates a hybrid approach where SGWB algorithms act as a first-pass filter to identify CW candidates for follow-up with dedicated CW pipelines. We evaluated the discovery potential of the SGWB analysis tool PyStoch for detecting CWs, using simulated signals from spinning down NSs. We then applied the method to data from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3), covering the (20-1726) Hz frequency band, and targeting four supernova remnants: Vela Jr., G347.3-0.5, Cassiopeia A, and the NS associated with the 1987A supernova remnant. If necessary, significant candidates are followed up using the 5-vector Resampling and Band-Sampled Data Frequency-Hough techniques. However, since no interesting candidates were identified in the real O3 analysis, we set 95\% confidence-level upper limits on the CW strain amplitude $h_0$. The most stringent limit was obtained for Cassiopeia A, and is $h_0 = 1.13 \times 10^{-25}$ at $201.57$ Hz with a frequency resolution of $1/32$ Hz. As for the other targets, the best upper limits have been set with the same frequency resolution, and correspond to $h_0 = 1.20 \times 10^{-25} $ at $202.16$ Hz for G347.3-0.5, $1.20 \times 10^{-25}$ at $217.81$ Hz for Vela Jr., and $1.47 \times 10^{-25}$ at $186.41$ Hz for the NS in the 1987A supernova remnant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">99.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Emission from a Nearby M dwarf Binary</a><span class="id">[2507.20681]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the detection of the binary system 2MASS J02132062+3648506 AB using the Karl G.

If the association with this gamma-ray burst is real, it poses two puzzles. First, why was this photon not absorbed by the extragalactic background light? “New physics” beyond the Standard Model is required to explain how it managed to reach Earth from a cosmological distance. Second, why was this photon detected when the VHE afterglow observed by LHAASO already faded? A novel astrophysical mechanism is required to explain this delay. In this work we show that Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which arises as a low-energy limit of certain quantum gravity theories, can solve both puzzles. It shifts thresholds of particle interaction and changes the opacity of the extragalactic background, and cause energy-dependent variations of the photon velocity, which changes the photon time of flight. We investigate the LIV parameter space assuming that the 300 TeV photon is a part of the VHE afterglow detected by LHAASO in the TeV range. We identify viable solutions and place stringent two-sided constraints on the LIV energy scale required to resolve the observational puzzles. First-order LIV appears to be incompatible with the constraints set by analyzing the TeV afterglow of this GRB. Viable solutions emerge for higher orders. In particular, the commonly studied second-order subluminal LIV with $E_{\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ (95.4% credibility level; $E_{\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy) is consistent with all the observed data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">101.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carpet-3 300 TeV Photon Event as an Evidence for Lorentz Violation</a><span class="id">[2508.08984]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection by the Carpet-3 Group of a 300 TeV photon, observed 4536 seconds after the prompt emission of the historic gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, provides unprecedented opportunities to test Lorentz invariance violation (LV) at energy scales approaching the Planck regime.

While only three Galactic events have been firmly detected, several extragalactic candidates have recently been reported, motivating the need for sensitive, rapid-response gamma- and X-ray facilities to constrain their rates and energetics. We present a feasibility study of detecting MGFs with the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), focusing on two complementary pathways: (i) serendipitous discovery of the prompt gamma-ray spike within the field of view, and (ii) rapid follow-up of MGF tails in nearby galaxies. Using sensitivity rescaling and volumetric rate estimates, we find that serendipitous detection of prompt spikes during the mission lifetime is possible but unlikely, primarily because of their short duration and primarily because of their short duration and hard spectrum, in the assumption that the hard gamma-ray spectrum can be reliably extrapolated to the instrument's energy range. In contrast, AXIS's superior sensitivity, if accompanied by fast repointing capabilities, offer an extraordinary opportunity to detect pulsating X-ray tails out to about 20 Mpc, enabling the first extragalactic measurements of periodic modulations from a magnetar and potentially constraining emission geometry and fireball physics. Finally, we evaluate the detectability of soft X-ray line emission from r-process nucleosynthesis in MGFs, finding that such signals are extremely faint and confining the detection to Galactic distances. Our study offer a general framework for assessing the detectability of short transients with future missions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">104.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neural Enhancement of the Traditional Wang-Sheeley-Arge Solar Wind Relation</a><span class="id">[2509.06181]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model has been the cornerstone of operational solar wind forecasting for nearly two decades, owing to its simplicity and physics-based formalism. However, its performance is strongly dependent on several empirical parameters that are typically fixed or tuned manually, limiting its adaptability across varying solar conditions. In this study, we present a neural enhancement to the WSA framework (referred to as WSA+) that systematically optimizes the empirical parameters of the WSA solar wind speed relation using in-situ observations within a differentiable physics-constrained pipeline. The approach operates in two stages: first, a neural optimizer adjusts WSA parameters independently for each Carrington Rotation to better match the observed solar wind data. Then, a neural network learns to predict these optimized speed maps directly from magnetogram-derived features. This enables generalization of the optimization process and allows inference for new solar conditions without manual tuning. The developed WSA+ preserves the interpretability of the original relation while significantly improving the match with OMNI in-situ data across multiple performance metrics, including correlation and error statistics. It consistently outperforms the traditional WSA relation across both low and high solar activity periods, with average improvements of approximately 40 percent. By integrating data-driven learning with physical constraints, WSA+ offers a robust and adaptable enhancement, with immediate utility as a drop-in replacement in global heliospheric modeling pipelines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">105.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamic or Systematic?

A key parameter that characterizes this turbulence is the correlation scale of fluctuations, which determines the injection of turbulent energy into the plasma and the diffusive transport of solar energetic particles. This study employs magnetogram data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory to characterize an ensemble of spatial autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of turbulence in the photosphere. It is shown that the two-point ACFs satisfy the similarity-decay hypothesis of von Kármán and Howarth, a fundamental property of turbulent systems: rescaling the ACFs by their respective energies and correlation lengths yields a quasi-universal exponential form. The probability distribution function of transverse correlation lengths (\(\lambda\)) is shown to be approximately log-normal, which is consistent with observations of turbulence in the solar wind. A “mosaic” of the spatial distribution of \(\lambda\) over the photosphere is presented; the “quiet Sun” tends to have \(\lambda\sim 1500\) km (albeit with a wide distribution), which is close to the scale of solar granulation; systematically longer lengths are associated with active regions. A positive correlation is observed between mean magnetic field magnitude and \(\lambda\), and empirical fits quantify this relationship. These results improve our understanding of solar turbulence while providing observational constraints for models that describe turbulence transport from solar and stellar photospheres into their atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">107.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Giant Peanut-shaped Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Emitter Off the Galactic Plane</a><span class="id">[2510.06786]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-high-energy (UHE), exceeding 100 TeV (10^12 electronvolts), {\gamma}-rays manifests extreme particle acceleration in astrophysical sources. Recent observations by {\gamma}-ray telescopes, particularly by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), have revealed a few tens of UHE sources, indicating numerous Galactic sources capable of accelerating particles to PeV (10^15 electronvolts) energies. However, discerning the dominant acceleration mechanisms (leptonic versus hadronic), the relative contributions of specific source classes, and the role of particle transport in shaping their observed emission are central goals of modern UHE astrophysics. Here we report the discovery of a giant UHE {\gamma}-ray emitter at -17.5° off the Galactic plane - a region where UHE {\gamma}-ray sources are rarely found. The emitter exhibits a distinctive asymmetric shape, resembling a giant &quot;Peanut&quot; spanning 0.45° \times 4.6°, indicative of anisotropic particle distribution over a large area. A highly aged millisecond pulsar (MSP) J0218+4232 is the sole candidate accelerator positionally coincident with the Peanut region. Its association with UHE {\gamma}-rays extending to 0.7 PeV, if confirmed, would provide the first evidence of a millisecond pulsar powering PeV particles. Such a finding challenges prevailing models, which posit that millisecond pulsars cannot sustain acceleration to PeV energies. The detection reveals fundamental gaps in understanding particle acceleration, cosmic-ray transport, and interstellar magnetic field effects, potentially revealing new PeV accelerator (PeVatron) classes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">108.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Observations of SN 2024ggi II: NIRSpec Spectroscopy and CO Modeling at 285 and 385 Days Past the Explosion</a><span class="id">[2510.09600]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec observations of SN 2024ggi, spanning wavelengths of 1.7–5.5 micron at +285.51 and +385.27 days post-explosion. These nebular spectra are dominated by asymmetric emission lines from atomic species including H, Ca, Ar, C, Mg, Ni, Co, and Fe, indicative of an aspherical explosion. The other strong features are molecular CO vibrational bands from the fundamental and first overtone. We introduce a novel, data-driven approach using non-LTE 3D radiative transfer simulations to model the CO emission with high fidelity. This method enables us to constrain the three-dimensional CO distribution and its radial temperature structure. CO formation is found to occur prior to day +285, with subsequent evolution characterized by progressive evaporation. The CO mass decreases from approximately 8.7 to 1.3*E-3 Mo, while the average temperature drops from about 2900 K to 2500 K. Concurrently, the CO distribution transitions from nearly homogeneous to highly clumped (density contrast increasing from fc=1.2 to 2). The minimum velocity of the CO-emitting region remains nearly constant (v1 = 1200 to 1100 km/s), significantly above the receding photosphere velocity (v(ph) = 500 km/s), suggesting the photosphere resides within Si-rich layers. However, the temperature profile indicates that only a narrow zone reaches the conditions necessary for SiO formation. Due to a lack of observational constraints, SiO clumping is not modeled, and thus, synthetic SiO profiles for mass estimates are not highlighted. We discuss the implications of these findings for dust formation processes in SN 2024ggi.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">109.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12296" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spatio-Temporal Evolution of the March 2022 ICME Revealed by Multi-Point Observations of Forbush Decreases</a><span class="id">[2510.12296]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) cause Forbush Decreases (FDs) effects, which are local decreases in background galactic cosmic rays (GCR). Even though FDs can be observed with simple particle instruments, their amplitude and shape provide physical profiles of passing ICMEs. However, in some cases, previous statistical studies of the heliocentric distance dependence of FD changes associated with ICME propagation have found no strong correlation. We need the criteria for evaluating the relationship between ICMEs structure and FD, necessary for FDs statistical analysis. This study investigates the effect of evolutions and interactions of ICMEs on FDs profiles in the inner Solar System, using multipoint comparisons. We focus on multipoint ICME observations by Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, and near-Earth spacecraft from March 10-16, 2022, when these spacecraft were ideally located for studying the radial and longitudinal evolutions of ICME and accompanying FDs. We compared GCR variations with the multiple in-situ data and ICME model, clarifying the correspondence between the evolution of each ICME structure in radial and azimuthal directions and the depth and gradients of the FD. The radial comparison revealed decreases in FD intensities and gradients associated with the expansion of the ICME. The longitudinal difference found in FD intensity indicates longitudinal variations of the ICMEs shielding effect. These results suggest that accurate multi-point FD comparisons require determining the relationship between the observers position and the inner structure of the passing ICMEs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">110.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIPLODOCUS II: Implementation of transport equations and test cases relevant to micro-scale physics of jetted astrophysical sources</a><span class="id">[2510.12505]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>DIPLODOCUS (Distribution-In-PLateaux methODOlogy for the CompUtation of transport equationS) is a framework being developed for the general transport of particle distribution functions through the seven dimensions of phase space, including forcing terms and interactions between particles.

In this work we implement a specific realisation of these scenarios into an $N$-body code to explore the non-linear regime. We include two populations of particles to describe the interacting dark matter and the non-interacting baryons respectively. On linear scales we recover the suppression of structures obtained from Boltzmann codes, while non-linear scales exhibit an enhancement of the matter power. We find that fewer massive halos are formed at low redshift as a consequence of the elastic interaction and that dark matter halos are more compact than in the standard model. Furthermore, the ratio of dark matter and baryons density profiles is not constant. Finally, we corroborate that baryons efficiently cluster around dark matter halos so they provide good tracers of the dark matter velocity field despite the presence of the interaction.

While the stellar components usually display similar masses, some binaries with extremely low mass ratios were also observed. Some of them are primordial, while others arise from binary interactions. The identification of systems with extreme mass ratios brings valuable information, notably on the origin of fast rotation in massive stars. We identify new short-period systems with extreme mass ratios through the detection of eclipses and reflection effects. The physical properties of a dozen newly identified cases were precisely evaluated through high-quality photometry and spectroscopy. In addition to characterizing these binaries, we found a clear signature of apsidal motion in one system, and three other systems display long-term shifts in eclipse times. All systems we reported here are composed of a massive star and a cool low-mass companion. They are therefore primordial cases. This doubles the known number of these systems in the Galaxy. In this context, it is important to note that most massive stars in these systems, as well as in previous systems reported in the literature, rotate fast (supersynchronous compared to the orbital motion). The high incidence of fast rotation in these nascent binaries provides strong constraints for star formation models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">113.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimizing Kilonova Searches: A Case Study of the Type IIb SN 2025ulz in the Localization Volume of the Low-Significance Gravitational Wave Event S250818k</a><span class="id">[2510.17104]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Kilonovae, the ultraviolet/optical/infrared counterparts to binary neutron star mergers, are an exceptionally rare class of transients.

In this work, we present an analysis of the multi-wavelength dataset of supernova (SN) 2025ulz, a proposed kilonova candidate following the low-significance detection of gravitational waves originating from the potential binary neutron star merger S250818k. Despite an early rapid decline in brightness, our multi-wavelength observations of SN 2025ulz reveal that it is a type IIb supernova. As part of this analysis, we demonstrate the capabilities of a novel quantitative scoring algorithm to determine the likelihood that a transient candidate is a kilonova, based primarily on its 3D location and light curve evolution.

Given the expected low amplitude of the signal, its estimate-parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$-is highly susceptible to contamination from Galactic foreground residuals that remain after component separation. In this work, we introduce a model-independent procedure to construct a spectral template of residual foreground contamination in the observed angular power spectrum. Specifically, a cleaned multifrequency set of foreground-emission maps is blindly reconstructed from the observed data using the Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) technique. These maps are then combined with the weights adopted for CMB reconstruction, yielding an estimate of the spatial distribution of foreground residuals after component separation. The power spectrum of this estimated residual map is incorporated into the spectral model of the cosmological likelihood. We validate the proposed method using realistic simulations of a LiteBIRD-like experiment processed with two Internal Linear Combination (ILC) component-separation techniques, focusing on constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. When the foreground contribution is not included in the model, the resulting $r$ posteriors are biased, irrespective of its input value, the assumed foreground model, or the adopted masking strategy. Conversely, when the residual template is included in the likelihood, the analysis yields unbiased estimates of $r$ for all considered cases, thereby demonstrating the robustness of the proposed procedure.

We performed a systematic search for periodic signals in the $I$-band light curves of more than 400 million stars with magnitudes down to $I = 21$. Our search effectively doubles the number of these variables to almost 200. The detected BLAPs exhibit pulsation periods between roughly 5 and 76 minutes. The analyzed dataset covers a timespan from 2001 to 2024, with some stars observed up to 20,000 times, providing the temporal coverage needed to study period and amplitude variations. We report on three objects that show enormous period changes, at a rate of $10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$, which could provide important clues to the evolutionary status of BLAPs. Full dataset is incorporated into the publicly available OGLE Collection of Variable Stars (OCVS), enabling future studies of these enigmatic objects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">116.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Superradiant scattering of electromagnetic fields from ringing black holes</a><span class="id">[2310.01548]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detection of gravitational waves (GWs) paves the beginning of a new era of gravitational wave astronomy. Black holes (BHs) in their ringdown phase provide the cleanest signal of emitted GWs that imprint the fundamental nature of BHs under low energy perturbation. Apart from GWs, any complementary signature of ringing BHs can be of paramount importance. Motivated by this we analyzed the scattering of electromagnetic waves in such a background and demonstrated that the absorption cross section of a ringing Schwarzschild BH can be superradiant. Moreover, we have found out that such superradiant phenomena are transient in nature with a characteristic time scale equal to the GW oscillation time scale. We further point out that the existing ground-based Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), radio telescopes, may be able to detect such transient signals from BHs of mass range $M\sim 10^{-1} - 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$, which should necessarily be of primordial origin. Our present result opens up an intriguing possibility of observing the black hole merging phenomena through electromagnetic waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">117.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07672" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Non-Gaussianity from Light Compact Scalars</a><span class="id">[2501.07672]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the non-Gaussianities generated by light axions, or compact scalar fields, during inflation. To correctly calculate their impact on primordial statistics, we will argue that it is necessary to account for the periodicity, or gauge symmetry, of the compact scalars. We illustrate this point by comparing the predictions for the squeezed kinematic limit of the primordial bispectrum generated by two cases: a non-compact scalar $\sigma$ and a compact scalar $\varphi$. We demonstrate that while a light non-compact scalar predicts a bispectrum of the so-called local shape, the light compact scalar predicts a qualitatively different shape characterised by the ratio of the Hubble scale to its field-space circumference. In doing so, we show that ignoring the gauge symmetry of the compact scalar during inflation leads to spurious infrared enhancements which are softened by working with appropriate gauge-invariant operators. In addition, we connect our results for the primordial bispectrum with late-time cosmological observables and show that it is possible to measure the decay constant of the compact scalar using galaxy clustering measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">118.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase transitions in the inner crust of neutron stars within the superfluid band theory: Competition between $^1\text{S}_0$ pairing and spin polarization under finite temperature and magnetic field</a><span class="id">[2503.06250]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Phase transitions of matter under changes of external environment such as temperature and magnetic field have attracted great interests to various quantum many-body systems. Several phase transitions must have occurred in neutron stars as well such as transitions from normal to superfluid/superconducting phases and crust formation. In this work, we extend the superfluid band theory, which has been formulated in our previous work [K. Yoshimura and K. Sekizawa, Phys. Rev. C 109, 065804 (2024)] based on the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) for superfluid systems, into the finite temperature and finite magnetic field systems. As a result of the finite temperature calculations, we find that the superfluidity of neutrons dissapears at around $k_\text{B}T=0.6$–$0.9\,$ MeV, and “melting” of nuclear slabs, that is, a structural change into the uniform matter, takes place at around $k_\text{B}T=2.5$–$4.5\,$ MeV. We also reveal that these transition temperatures exhibit a systematical dependence on the baryon densities. By turning on the magnetic field, we find that protons' spin gets polarized at around $B=10^{16}\,$G, whereas neutrons' spin is kept unpolarized on average up to around $B=10^{17}\,$G. Intriguingly, our microscopic calculations reveal that neutrons' spin is actually polarized locally inside and outside of the slab already at $B\sim10^{16}\,$G, while keeping the system unpolarized in total. As a conclusion, we have demonstrated validity and usefulness of the fully self-consistent superfluid nuclear band theory for describing neutron star matter under arbitrary temperature and magnetic field. Critical temperatures and magnetic fields have been predicted for 1) superfluid to normal transition, 2) crust formation, and 3) spin polarization, under conditions relevant to realistic neutron star environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">119.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entanglement between pair-created twin universes with opposite time arrows should leave a birthmark on CMB spectrum</a><span class="id">[2505.02807]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Why (and how) the Universe was born is one of the ultimate questions in physics. Another big puzzle is about the arrow of time: why is there only one direction of time? Are these two issues related? One way to solve both puzzles at one stroke is to posit that our universe was pair-created with a twin, whose time arrow is opposite to ours. If so, then the twins must naturally be quantum entangled. In Euclidean quantum gravity, this implies the existence of a Euclidean wormhole bridging the twin universes. Each universe is then in a mixed-state and the mutual entanglement shall leave signatures in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum. Invoking the Klebanov-Susskind-Banks wormhole as a toy model for the sake of tractability, we show that the entanglement selects a novel and unique global vacuum for the total inflaton perturbations in both universes. This is equivalent to imposing a simple harmonic oscillator boundary condition on the Euclidean wavefunction of the total perturbations, and it turns out that the entanglement enhances the CMB power spectrum for long-wavelength modes. Such a birthmark renders our notion refutable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">120.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Coexistence of Freeze-in Dark Matter and Primordial Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2505.02935]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Particle dark matter and primordial black holes (PBH) might coexist with appreciable cosmic abundances, with both contributing to the observed dark matter density $\Omega_{\rm DM}$. Large populations of PBH (with $\Omega_{\rm PBH}\sim \Omega_{\rm DM}$) are tightly constrained for PBH heavier than $10^{-11} M_\odot$. However, large fractional abundances with $ f_{\rm PBH}\simeq \Omega_{\rm PBH}/\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim0.01$ are consistent with the limits on PBH for a wide range of PBH masses. Scenarios with significant populations of both particle dark matter and PBH are intriguing. Notably, if the particle dark matter has interactions with the Standard Model, new constraints arise due to pair-annihilations that are enhanced by the PBHs, resulting in dark matter indirect detection constraints on $f_{\rm PBH}$. Here we derive the bounds on mixed scenarios in which PBHs coexist with particle dark matter whose relic abundance is set via freeze-in (“FIMPs”). We show that while the restrictions on $f_{\rm PBH}$ are less constraining for FIMPs than WIMPs, modest bounds still arise for large classes of models. We examine both IR and UV freeze-in scenarios, including the case of “superheavy” particle dark matter with PeV scale mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">121.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can local White Dwarfs constrain Dark Matter interactions?</a><span class="id">[2505.13629]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate whether nearby white dwarfs (WDs) can constrain dark matter (DM) interactions with ordinary matter. As experimental sensitivity improves, driven by the Gaia mission, the sample volume of nearby WDs has been increasing over recent years. We carefully select a sample of ten cold, isolated, non-magnetic WDs within 13 pc of the Sun. We model their carbon-oxygen interior using a finite temperature relativistic equation of state and model atmospheres to infer their core temperatures. This enables us to perform a thorough estimation of the DM capture rate and evaporation mass using actual astrophysical observations. Given the low local DM density, we focus on DM that annihilates into long-lived mediators, which escape the WD and later decay into photons. While \textit{Fermi}-LAT data shows no significant gamma-ray excess, future telescopes, CTA North &amp; South, LHAASO, SWGO, could probe DM-nucleon cross sections down to $\sim 10^{-41}~\text{cm}^2$ for DM masses above the TeV scale. Our results are competitive with current direct detection bounds (e.g., LZ) in the multi-TeV regime. This work underscores the importance of systematic WD studies in the broader landscape of DM detection and demonstrates the synergy between astrophysical and terrestrial searches in exploring DM interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">122.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Present Status of Inflationary Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2505.13646]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We give a brief review of the basic principles of inflationary theory and discuss the present status of the simplest inflationary models that can describe Planck/BICEP/Keck observational data by choice of a single model parameter.

We study the cosmological dynamics for a recently proposed descending dark energy model, namely, Q-SC-CDM. Initially, we choose distinct values of coupling parameter. For some values of $\xi$, the evolution of the universe is split up into three different phases: {\it decelerated expansion (early time), accelerated expansion (late-time) and slow-contraction (future era)}, and provide Big Crunch Singularity at distant future. In other scenario, the phase of slow-contraction vanishes, cosmic acceleration is obtained at current epoch, and the universe gets de-Sitter expansion at distant future. It is remarkable to see that the Big Crunch Singularity is redundant in the later case. Next, we investigate the phase space analysis for the model under consideration. Our investigation brings new asymptotic regimes and finds stable de-Sitter solution. Eventually, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using recent cosmological observations, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (DESI DR2) data. The results demonstrate that the present model yield constraints on key cosmological parameters \Omega_{0m}, H_0 and the sound horizon r_d that are consistent with {\Lambda}CDM within 68\% confidence level, yet exhibit mild tension with Pantheon+ measurements. Additionally, we employ the Om(z) diagnostic test, Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria to distinguish our model from {\Lambda}CDM. The Statistical comparison reveals moderate support for the current model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">124.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smooth hybrid inflation in light of ACT DR6 data</a><span class="id">[2506.15965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Smooth hybrid inflation is a hybrid inflation model which is free from topological defects and predicts the density perturbation with the spectral index of about $0.97$.

Using the sBBHs population constraints obtained by the LIGO–Virgo–Kagra collaboration, we compute the expected SGWB and develop a phenomenological parametric model that can accurately capture the effect of dynamical friction and accretion. Using our model, we perform Bayesian inference on simulated signals to assess the detectability of these environmental effects. We find that even for large injected values of the Eddington ratio, the effect of accretion in the SGWB is undetectable by LISA. However, LISA will be able to constrain the effect of dynamical friction with an upper bound on the gas density of $\rho \lesssim 7.6 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{g \, cm^{-3}}$, thus probing the sBBH environment forming in typical thin accretion disks around Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). For injected densities of $\rho \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-9} \mathrm{g} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, dynamical friction effects can be well measured and clearly distinguished from vacuum, with Bayes factors reaching up to $\sim$ 60, even when the Galactic foreground is included.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">126.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A comprehensive dynamical and phenomenological analysis of structure growth in curvature-modulated coupled quintessence scenario</a><span class="id">[2507.09169]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate an interacting dark energy-dark matter model within the quintessence framework, characterized by the coupling term $Q_0 = \alpha \kappa \rho_m \dot{\phi} \left[1 - \beta R/(6H^2) \right]$, and the scalar field evolves under an exponential potential $V(\phi) = V_0 e^{-\lambda \kappa \phi}$, with parameters $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\beta$.

The Ricci scalar term, controlled by $\beta$, significantly affects the stability of critical points, with attractors transitioning to repellers for higher values of $\beta$. We also analyze linear scalar perturbations, focusing on the matter density contrast $\delta_m$ and the growth index $\gamma$.

Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR.

Many different cosmological scenarios have been proposed that establish the abundance of axion DM in qualitatively different ways. In this paper we emphasize that, despite this variety of backgrounds, the perturbations in axion DM can be understood from universal principles. How does a feebly interacting axion field acquire perturbations proportional to those of photons? How do the isocurvature power spectrum and non-Gaussianity depend on the background evolution of the universe? We answer these questions for a completely general choice of cosmological background and temperature-dependent axion potential. We show that the most general solution to the axion field equation on super-horizon scales is entirely determined by the family of background solutions for different initial field values $\theta_{\rm ini}$. This holds for both the component in the field perturbation solution contributing to the DM isocurvature perturbation (enhanced at late times by the sensitivity of the DM abundance to the initial condition, $\partial \Omega_a / \partial \theta_{\rm ini}$, which can be large for initial conditions near the hilltop), and the other component that contributes to the DM curvature perturbation. In particular, we explain that an unperturbed axion field in the early universe evolving into one with nontrivial adiabatic perturbations is guaranteed by Weinberg's theorem on adiabatic modes. These results have been derived before with various assumptions, such as a radiation dominated background or a quadratic potential. Our aim is to give a clear, simple derivation that is manifestly independent of those assumptions, and thus can be applied to any cosmological axion scenario.</p></div></details></article></body>
