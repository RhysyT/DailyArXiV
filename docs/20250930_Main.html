While this is established since decades for the contribution of quasars to the diffuse emission above 1 keV energies, the possible contribution of undetected stars in the Milky Way to the softer band (0.5-1 keV) background emission is still poorly constrained. The overall unresolved X-ray flux from the stars is the product between the stellar spatial distribution in the Milky Way and the underlying X-ray luminosity function (XLF). In this work, we build the XLF of the stars and study its structure with respect to a set of main-sequence spectral types (F, G, K, M) and evolutionary stages (giants and white dwarfs). We build the XLF in volume-limited subsamples of increasing maximum distance and corresponding minimum X-ray luminosity using the HamStar catalog of X-ray emitting stars detected in the Western Galactic hemisphere with the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) space observatory. We build an extinction-corrected Gaia color-magnitude diagram and decompose the XLF into the relative contribution of different groups of stars. We provide an empirical polynomial description of the XLF for the total sample and for the different stellar subgroups that can be used to estimate the unresolved contribution from the stars to the soft X-ray background of the Milky Way in a flux-limited survey.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Spectroscopy of GRB 250702B: An Extremely Rare and Exceptionally Energetic Burst in a Dusty, Massive Galaxy at $z=1.036$</a><span class="id">[2509.22778]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present follow-up observations of the day-long, repeating GRB 250702B with the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Through the identification of narrow hydrogen emission lines at a consistent redshift of $z = 1.036 \pm 0.004$, we calibrate the distance scale, and therefore the energetics, of this unique extragalactic transient. At this distance, the resulting $\gamma$-ray energy release is at least $E_{\gamma,\rm iso} = 2.2 \times 10^{54}$ erg. We find no evidence for ongoing transient emission at the GRB position, and exclude any accompanying supernova with a luminosity comparable to the Type Ic broad-line SN 2023lcr, though we are unable to constrain fainter events. The inferred rate of such events, assuming at most one in the lifetime of {\em Fermi}, suggests that such bursts are very rare, with volumetric rates $&gt;1,000$ times lower than normal high luminosity long GRBs and $&gt; 10^5$ times lower than core collapse supernovae when corrected for beaming. Furthermore, we find that the host galaxy is unique amongst GRB host galaxies, and extremely rare in the general galaxy population, being extremely large, dusty and with high stellar mass. The identification of such an exotic GRB in such an unusual galaxy raises the possibility that the environment was important in the progenitor channel for this event.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-long Gamma-ray Bursts from Micro-Tidal Disruption Events: The Case of GRB 250702B</a><span class="id">[2509.22779]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs), a rare class of high-energy transients with durations $&gt;10^3$,s, remain poorly understood. GRB,250702B ($z=1.04$) is notable for its multi-hour prompt emission, an X-ray precursor $\sim$1 day earlier, off-nuclear host position, and hard, rapidly variable gamma-rays. This combination is difficult to explain with standard ULGRB progenitors such as blue-supergiant collapsars, magnetar engines, or white-dwarf tidal disruptions by intermediate-mass black holes. We interpret the event as a micro-tidal disruption event ($\mu$TDE), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star partially or fully disrupts a main-sequence star. Three $\mu$TDE pathways can reproduce the observed precursor-main flare delay: (i) a \emph{dynamical (partial/repeating)} disruption, in which a grazing passage yields a faint precursor and the core returns after $\sim$day for a deeper encounter; (ii) a \emph{natal-kick} disruption, where the delay reflects the ballistic motion of a newborn compact object relative to its companion, leading to full disruption; and (iii) a \emph{hybrid natal-kick + partial} case, in which the kick seeds the close encounter but the first passage is only partial, with the core returning on the day-scale period. Cross-section scalings imply comparable rates for partial and full outcomes in both dynamical and natal-kick scenarios. The highly variable, hard $\gamma$-ray emission supports association with a stellar-mass compact object. Fallback and viscous accretion naturally explain the ultra-long duration, energetics, and ks-scale X-ray variability. We outline observational discriminants between the three channels and argue that $\mu$TDEs offer a compelling framework for ULGRBs such as GRB 250702B.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optical/infrared observations of the extraordinary GRB 250702B: a highly obscured afterglow in a massive galaxy consistent with multiple possible progenitors</a><span class="id">[2509.22784]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRB 250702B was the longest gamma-ray burst ever observed, with a duration that challenges standard collapsar models and suggests an exotic progenitor. We collected a rich set of optical and infrared follow-up observations of its rapidly fading afterglow using a suite of telescopes including the W. M. Keck Observatory, the Gemini telescopes, the Magellan Baade Telescope, the Victor M. Blanco 4-meter telescope, and the Fraunhofer Telescope at Wendelstein Observatory. Our analysis reveals that the afterglow emission is well described by forward shock emission from a highly obscured relativistic jet. Deep photometric observations of the host galaxy reveal a massive 10^10.66 solar masses, dusty, and extremely asymmetric system that is consistent with two galaxies undergoing a major merger. The galactocentric offset, host galaxy properties, and jet characteristics do not definitively distinguish between competing progenitor scenarios. We find that the afterglow and host are consistent with a range of progenitors including a collapsar, a merger between a helium star and a stellar mass black hole, the disruption of a star by a stellar mass compact object, and the tidal disruption of a star by an off-nuclear intermediate mass black hole.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Re-accretion of Giant Impact Ejecta Can Drive Significant Atmospheric Erosion on Terrestrial Planets</a><span class="id">[2509.22785]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Giant impacts, the collisions between planetary embryos, play a crucial role in sculpting the planets and their orbital architectures. Numerical simulations have advanced our understanding of these events, enabling estimations of mass and atmospheric loss during the primary impacts. However, high computational costs have restricted investigations to the immediate aftermath, limiting our understanding of the longer-term consequences. In this study, we investigate the effect of re-accretion of giant impact debris, a process previously overlooked, on the atmospheres of terrestrial planets. Following the collisional and dynamical evolution of the debris ejected during the primary impacts, we quantify the amount of debris that would be re-accreted by the progenitor. We find that $\sim 0.003\ M_{\oplus}$ would be re-accreted over a wide range of Earth-like planet properties, assuming $1\%$ of their mass is ejected as non-vaporised debris. Over a prolonged period, the secondary impacts during re-accretion drive enhanced atmospheric loss. Notably, the impacts from the debris of the canonical Moon-forming impact would have gradually eroded an atmosphere similar to present-day Earth's in $\sim 30$ Myr. More generally, any planet growing via giant impacts within $2$ au is likely to experience significant post-impact atmospheric erosion unless the initial atmosphere was at least $5$ times more massive than Earth's. Our results highlight the crucial role secondary impacts from giant-impact ejecta could have in driving the long-term atmospheric evolution of Earth-like planets, and demonstrate that giant impacts can be significantly more effective at eroding such atmospheres than previously thought, when re-accretion of debris is considered.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Refined Orbital Ephemeris for the Intermediate Polar FO Aquarii and Evidence for a Period Derivative</a><span class="id">[2509.22786]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We combine more than 40 years of eclipse timings of the intermediate polar FO Aqr and derive new orbital ephemerides.

However, unlike any known GRB, a soft X-ray precursor was discovered by the Einstein Probe up to 24 hours before the gamma-ray triggers. We present comprehensive X-ray observations of the transient's afterglow obtained with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory between 0.5 to 65 days (observer frame) after the initial high-energy trigger. The X-ray emission decays steeply as $\sim t^{-1.9}$, and shows short timescale X-ray variability ($\Delta T/T &lt; 0.03$) in both Swift and NuSTAR, consistent with flares superposed on an external shock continuum. Serendipitous detections by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) out to $\sim$0.3 days and continued NuSTAR variability to $\sim$2 days imply sustained central engine activity; including the precursor, the required engine duration is $\gtrsim 3$ days. Afterglow modeling favors the combination of forward and reverse shock emission in a wind-like ($k \approx 2$) environment. These properties, especially the long-lived engine and soft X-ray precursor, are difficult to reconcile with a collapsar origin, and GRB 250702B does not fit neatly with canonical ultra-long GRBs or relativistic tidal disruption events (TDEs). A hybrid scenario in which a star is disrupted by a stellar-mass black hole (a micro-TDE) provides a plausible explanation, although a relativistic TDE from an intermediate-mass black hole remains viable. Decisive discrimination between progenitors will require sensitive late-time X-ray observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GRB 250702B: Discovery of a Gamma-Ray Burst from a Black Hole Falling into a Star</a><span class="id">[2509.22792]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts are the most luminous electromagnetic events in the universe. Their prompt gamma-ray emission has typical durations between a fraction of a second and several minutes. A rare subset of these events have durations in excess of a thousand seconds, referred to as ultra-long gamma-ray bursts. Here, we report the discovery of the longest gamma-ray burst ever seen with a  25,000 s gamma-ray duration, GRB 250702B, and characterize this event using data from four instruments in the InterPlanetary Network and the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image. We find a hard spectrum, subsecond variability, and high total energy, which are only known to arise from ultrarelativistic jets powered by a rapidly-spinning stellar-mass central engine. These properties and the extreme duration are together incompatible with all confirmed gamma-ray burst progenitors and nearly all models in the literature. This burst is naturally explained with the helium merger model, where a field binary ends when a black hole falls into a stripped star and proceeds to consume and explode it from within. Under this paradigm, GRB 250702B adds to the growing evidence that helium stars expand and that some ultra-long GRBs have similar evolutionary pathways as collapsars, stellar-mass gravitational wave sources, and potentially rare types of supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22797" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the origin of the X-ray and optical emission in the z=3.1 strongly lensed radio-quiet quasar GraL J065904.1+162909 to milliarcsecond resolution</a><span class="id">[2509.22797]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform milliarcsecond X-ray astrometry of the quadruply lensed radio-quiet quasar GraL J065904.1+162909 (J0659). This z = 3.083 quasar is lensed into four images and was discovered with the second Data Release of the Gaia Space Observatory (Gaia DR2). The methodology of using gravitational lenses as high resolution telescopes has been applied, so far, to five lensed quasars (including J0659) and shows potential to elucidate the spatial origin of the X-ray and optical emitting regions in distant quasars. We use Gaia DR3 and HST observations of J0659 and infer a mass model for the deflector that reproduces the positions of the quasar lensed images to milliarcsecond precision. Next, we apply archival Chandra observations of J0659, together with our lens model, to conduct a Bayesian test evaluating whether the X-ray emitting region coincides with the optical source position predicted by our mass model. We constrain the origin of the X-ray emission to be within a 0.”030 x 0.”020 ellipse at the 99.7% level, finding the maximum possible distance between the X-ray and optical source is 44.7 milliarcseconds. Our methodology enhances Chandra's spatial resolution at high-z by a factor of 6. We provide a novel approach that extends the methodology towards investigating the origin of the soft and hard X-ray emitting regions in lensed quasars. We elaborate on the potential of upcoming broadband and spectrally resolved X-ray astrometric studies to probe complex quasar morphology at high-z and to identify dual and binary AGN candidates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ross 458c: Gas Giant or Brown Dwarf?</a><span class="id">[2509.22803]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ross 458c is a widely separated planetary mass companion at a distance of 1100 AU from its host binary, Ross 458AB. It is a member of a class of very low-mass companions at distances of hundreds to thousands of AU from their host stars. We aim to constrain Ross 458c's formation history by fitting its near-IR spectrum to models to constrain its composition. If its composition is similar to its host star, we infer that it likely formed through turbulent fragmentation of the same molecular cloud that formed the host. If its composition is enhanced in heavy elements relative to the host, this lends evidence to formation in the disk and subsequent migration to its current separation. Here, we present high-resolution (R$\sim$2700) emission spectra of Ross 458c with JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit in the F070LP, F100LP, and F170LP filters from 0.8 to 3.1 $\mu$m. We fit these spectra using both grids of forward models (Sonora Bobcat, Sonora Elf Owl, and ExoREM) and atmospheric retrievals (POSEIDON). We also constrain the composition of Ross 458AB by fitting an archival SpeX spectrum with PHOENIX forward models. The forward model grids prefer an enhanced atmospheric metallicity for Ross 458c relative to the host, but our retrievals return a metallicity consistent with the host within 1$\sigma$. Our results offer new insights into the formation history of Ross 458c, as well as the efficacy of fitting forward model grids versus retrievals to derive atmospheric properties of directly imaged companions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steady state of fast-oscillating neutrinos in an inhomogeneous medium</a><span class="id">[2509.22805]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The streaming of neutrinos in an inhomogeneous medium is known to affect the physics of flavor conversion. We employ an ensemble of single-crossed angular distributions and explore the physics of flavor conversion, while neutrinos propagate across a one-dimensional inhomogeneous medium. The advective term in the neutrino equations of motion is responsible for the cascade of flavor waves towards ever smaller spatial and angular scales. However, as the system evolves, perturbations with large wavenumbers are damped, with a resulting smearing of the flavor configuration. We provide a simple recipe that allows to forecast the steady-state flavor configuration achieved by neutrinos without solving their kinetic equations. In particular, we find that flavor equipartition on one side of the angular spectrum and the cancellation of the spectral crossing in the lepton number distributions, proposed in the literature as generic flavor outcome, is a special solution depending on the degree of neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry. This work constitutes a step forward towards the development of semi-analytic schemes to account for flavor conversion physics in hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star merger remnants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating non-LTE abundances of Neodymium (Nd) in metal-poor FGK stars</a><span class="id">[2509.22811]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dominant site(s) of the $r$-process are a subject of current debate. Ejecta from $r$-process enrichment events like kilonovae are difficult to directly measure, so we must instead probe abundances in metal-poor stars to constrain $r$-process models. This requires state-of-the-art Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) modeling, as LTE is a poor approximation for the low-opacity atmospheres of metal-poor giants. Neodymium (Nd) is a prominent $r$-process element detected in both near-infrared kilonovae spectra and spectra of metal-poor stars, so precise Nd stellar abundances are particularly needed to model kilonovae and constrain $r$-process sites. We thus constructed a Nd I / Nd II model atom to compute NLTE abundances in FGK metal-poor stars. We obtain $\mathrm{A(Nd)}_\odot = 1.44\pm0.05$, in agreement with the meteoritic value, when calibrating the model atom with a Drawin hydrogen collision factor of $S_H=0.1$. For a sample of metal-poor $r$-process enhanced stars with observed optical and near-infrared Nd II lines, we find NLTE Nd corrections in the range $-0.3$ to $0.3$ dex. Optical and UV lines have positive NLTE corrections, whereas H band lines have negative corrections. Additionally, we compute a large grid of NLTE corrections for 122 Nd II spectral lines ranging from the UV to the H band, for stellar parameters of typical metal-poor FGK dwarfs and giants with $-3.00\le\mbox{[Fe/H]}\le-1.00$ and $-2.0\le\mathrm{A(Nd)}\le2.0$. Within this grid, we find NLTE corrections ranging from $-0.3$ to $+0.5$ dex. Deviations from LTE are found to be strongest for blue lines with low excitation potentials in the most metal-poor giants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the Impact of Planet-stirring, Self-stirring, and Mixed-stirring on Debris Disc Architecture: A Case Study of HD 16743</a><span class="id">[2509.22822]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dynamical interactions between planets and debris discs can excite the orbits of embedded planetesimals to such a degree that a collisional cascade is triggered, generating detectable amounts of dust. Millimetre wavelength observations are sensitive to emission from large and cold dust grains, which are unperturbed by radiation forces and act as a proxy for the location of the planetesimals. The influence of unseen planetary companions on debris discs can be inferred with high-resolution imaging observations at millimetre wavelengths, tracing the radial and vertical structure of these belts. Here we present a set of dynamical $N$-body simulations modelling ALMA millimetre-wavelength observations of the HD 16743 debris disc system. In these simulations, we consider a range of relative contributions from either a single planetary companion and/or a set of embedded massive planetesimals to reproduce the disc's observed radial and vertical structure. We compare our dynamical results for the limiting cases of planet-stirring and self-stirring, finding them to be consistent with theoretical expectations for each scenario. For the case of HD 16743, we find that a set of massive planetesimals on mildly eccentric orbits, confined to a relatively narrow range of semimajor axes (compared to the observed belt width), offers the best results to reproduce the vertical and radial extent of the observed emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tonalli: a 3D Magnetohydrodynamic Model, simplified Multi-species using Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium Approximation for the Solar Chromosphere</a><span class="id">[2509.22842]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we present the development of the Tonalli code: a simplified multi-species (HI, HII, H-, and e) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model in Non-local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) focused on solar chromospheric conditions. This new model integrates two well established models, Newtonian CAFE (MHD) and PakalMPI (NLTE), through a self-convergence system that links the state equations used by both codes to calculate density, pressure and temperature, with the mean molecular weight ($\mu$) serving as a proxy. Newtonian CAFE computes the plasma variables using the ideal MHD while PakalMPI calculates the species densities of neutral Hydrogen (HI), protons (HII), negative Hydrogen (H-), and electrons (ne) under the NLTE approximation. We used Tonalli to test the stability of the hydrostatic C7 model, covering 3000 km of the solar chromosphere with a vertical constant field of 30 Gauss and a vertical constant gravity field of 274.0 ms-2. As a result, Tonalli generates 3D cubes of densities, temperature, pressure, mean molecular weight, and the departure coefficient of Hydrogen in its first energy level b1, providing a detailed representation of the ionization states of the plasma at chromosphere altitudes. Despite the fact that MHD conditions can lead to numerical diffusion of the plasma, we demonstrate robustness and consistency, and self-convergence of the model with the relative error of electron density reaching values of $3.7x10^{-7}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can GRB 250702B be explained as the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole? Yes</a><span class="id">[2509.22843]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRB 250702B is a unique astrophysical transient characterised by its nature as a repeating gamma-ray trigger. Its properties include possible periodicity in its gamma-ray light curve, an X-ray counterpart that rose prior to the gamma-ray outbursts and faded quickly, and radio and infrared counterparts. These features are difficult to reconcile with most models of high energy transients but we show that they are compatible with a white dwarf bound to an intermediate mass black hole that is tidally stripped over multiple pericentre passages before being fully disrupted. Accretion onto the black hole powers a mildly relativistic jet that produces the X-rays through internal processes and the infrared and radio counterparts through thermal emission and external shocks respectively but is unable to produce the gamma-ray emission on its own. We propose that chaotic debris streams from the multiple stripping episodes can collide with a period roughly the same as the orbital period of the star. These shocks produce hard X-ray photons that are upscattered by the jet to produce the observed gamma-ray emission. Future analysis of the jet properties will allow us to place firmer constraints on our model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shedding Light on Desert Dwellers</a><span class="id">[2509.22893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The “sub-Jovian desert&quot; ($2{\lesssim}R_{\rm p}{\lesssim}10 \ R_{\oplus}$, periods $\lesssim$3 days) is sparsely populated but no longer empty. Recent surveys have revealed that planets residing in the desert are dense (${\rho}{\gtrsim}1$ g/cm$^{3}$), massive ($\sim$10${-}$50 $M_{\oplus}$), and orbit metal-rich stars that are indistinguishable from those hosting hot Jupiters. However, their origins remain mysterious. In this work we adopt and test the hypothesis that tidal destruction of hot Jupiters can populate the sub-Jovian desert with stripped remnant planets. We first show that stars hosting desert dwellers exhibit Galactic kinematics indicative of an older population descended from those hosting hot Jupiters. We highlight that tidally-driven Roche lobe overflow (RLO) can indeed populate the desert with planets similar to those observed, but only if angular momentum transfer during RLO is inefficient (“lossy&quot; RLO). The entire width of the sub-Jovian desert can be backfilled with the remnants of hot Jupiters that possessed their empirically inferred spread in entropy. In this picture, current desert dwellers such as LTT 9779b should be tidally decaying at an observationally testable rate of ${\sim}0.5$ ms/yr. Our theory also predicts that desert dweller host stars may rotate up to an order of magnitude more rapidly than field stars; rotation period differences may persist ${\sim}$Gyr after RLO. Lossy RLO may also manifest as a burst of IR excess that could outshine the host star for up to ${\sim}10^{3}$ yr. If these predictions are confirmed by observations, our theory indicates that desert dwellers can be leveraged to study the interiors of giant planets in exquisite detail.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Induced-Flare Candidates from the TESS Mission</a><span class="id">[2509.22918]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The empirical underabundance of close-in planets with radii 1.5-2.0 times that of the Earth, referred to as the radius irradiation valley, may be linked to the inability of gas dwarfs under certain conditions to retain their volatile envelopes due to photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. In either case, the extent to which a planet can preserve its atmosphere critically depends on poorly understood planetary magnetism. An effective probe of planetary magnetic fields is the interaction between a star and its close-in planet, where the planet magnetically interacts with its host, inducing flares as it moves near its periastron within the Alfvén surface of its host star. We construct a pipeline, \textsc{ardor}, to detect and characterize potentially planet-induced flares in time-series photometric data using a physically motivated forward model of star-planet interactions, with a focus on recovering flares located near the noise floor. We perform extensive injection-recovery simulations to determine our sensitivity to flares correlating with the planetary phase over a range of stellar types and orbital architectures. We identify one close-in, eccentric ($e=0.18$) system, TOI-1062 b, which exhibits flaring during periastron consistent with being induced with $p_{KS}=2.2\times10^{-5}$ and a $5.1\sigma$ detection through unbinned likelihood analysis and goodness-of-fit tests. We also identify an additional eccentric ($e=0.363$) candidate, Gliese 49b, which exhibits moderately significant ($2.5\sigma$) flare clustering at periastron, requiring additional photometric observations to confirm its significance. TOI-1062b and Gliese 49b are promising candidates for induced flares, underscoring the need for radio and UV follow-up observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coupled Planetary Interior and Tidal Evolution</a><span class="id">[2509.22923]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new planetary structure/thermal evolution model, designed for use in problems that couple orbital dynamics with planetary structure. We first benchmark our structural/thermal evolution calculations against the \texttt{MESA} stellar evolution code, finding excellent agreement across a wide range of planet mass, equilibrium temperature, entropy, and extra heating deposited at various depths in the planet. We then apply our method to study the tidal migration histories of Neptunes in the recently identified “ridge&quot; (periods ${\sim}3{-}6$ days), a feature that has been suggested to be populated via high eccentricity migration (HEM) of more distant Neptunes. We find that it is difficult to form a circularized Neptune in the ridge without instigating runaway tidal inflation and likely atmospheric destruction; low eccentricity Neptunes in the ridge can only be emplaced by HEM if they are metal-rich and exhibit finely-tuned tidal quality factors. If follow-up observations confirm that low eccentricity Neptunes in the ridge did arrive via HEM and are not strongly enriched in metals, our calculations indicate that their tidal heating mechanism must operate in the upper reaches of the planet to avoid runaway inflation. Gravity modes excited in upper radiative layers are a possible candidate mechanism, while friction in the core or turbulent dissipation in convective zones could be ruled out.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22933" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two Brief Geometric Derivations of the Shklovskii Effect in Pulsars</a><span class="id">[2509.22933]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I provide two short derivations for the Shklovskii effect, which describes the apparent secular period drift of a periodic source due to its motion on the sky.

The longer orbital periods and transit durations of warm Jupiters make it more difficult to measure the obliquities of their host stars. However, the longer periods also mean any misalignments persist due to the longer tidal realignment timescales. As a result, measuring these obliquities is necessary to understand how these types of planets form and how their formation and evolution differ from that of hot Jupiters. Here, we report the measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the TOI-4127 system using the HARPS-N spectrograph. We model the system using our new HARPS-N radial velocity measurements in addition to archival TESS photometry and NEID and SOPHIE radial velocities. We find that the host star is well-aligned with the highly eccentric (e=0.75) warm Jupiter TOI-4127 b, with a sky-projected obliquity ${\lambda} = {4^\circ}^{+17^\circ}_{-16^\circ}$. This makes TOI-4127 one of the most eccentric well-aligned systems to date and one of the longest period systems with a measured obliquity. Conclusions. The origin of its highly eccentric yet well-aligned orbit remains a mystery, however, and we investigate possible scenarios that could explain it. While typical in-situ formation and disk migration scenarios cannot explain this system, certain scenarios involving resonant interactions between the planet and protoplanetary disc could. Similarly, specific cases of planet-planet scattering or Kozai-Lidov oscillations can result in a highly-eccentric and well-aligned orbit. Coplanar high-eccentricity migration could also explain this system. However, both this mechanism and Kozai-Lidov oscillations require an additional planet in the system that has not yet been detected.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luminous Blue Variables</a><span class="id">[2509.22990]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are a class of massive blue supergiants exhibiting irregular and eruptive instability, sometimes accompanied by extreme mass loss. While they have often been considered to be a brief but very important transitional phase in the evolution of massive single stars, mounting evidence suggests that LBVs are actually a phenomenon associated with binary star evolution by way of mass gainers and mergers. If true, this would leave single massive stars without a way to shed their H envelopes and become Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, requiring a revision of our most basic paradigm of massive star evolution. Understanding their properties and role in evolution is therefore extremely important. The eruptive mass loss of LBVs is also invoked to account for some of the most extraordinary supernovae (SNe) with dense circumstellar material (CSM), which again contradicts the standard single star scenario where LBVs are massive stars in transition to the WR phase. This chapter reviews many aspects of LBVs including terminology and classification, the physical properties of the stars, their mass loss, and their variability, as well as their observed companion stars, implications of their surrounding stellar populations, and their circumstellar nebulae. These are put into context with proposed evolutionary scenarios and possible mechanisms that drive their eruptive variability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23123" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining Inflationary Particle Production with CMB Polarization</a><span class="id">[2509.23123]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inflation generates correlated temperature ($T$) and polarization ($E$-mode) fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which differ only by their transfer functions. Following Philcox et al. (2025), we investigate a scenario with a massive partner to the inflaton ($\mathcal{O}(100)$ times the inflationary Hubble scale), in which particles are produced during a narrow time period, leaving characteristic hot- or cold-spots in the CMB. Using tools developed for thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster-finding, we search component-separated $\textit{Planck}$ PR4 $E$-mode maps for these hotspots, and compare to analogous results in $T$. Our analysis pipeline is validated on simulated observations and gives unbiased constraints for sufficiently large and bright hotspots. We find no strong evidence for primordial hotspots and thereby place novel bounds on the marginal and relevant coupling between the inflaton and massive scalars during inflation, probing physics at energies many orders of magnitude above any feasible terrestrial collider. Due to the large noise in $\textit{Planck}$ polarization, the temperature data dominate constraints for small hotspots, but for sufficiently large hotspots, our bounds improve on those of Philcox et al. (2025) by $\sim 25\%$. We also forecast the inferred bounds on inflationary physics for a search using Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data, and from an optimistic cosmic-variance-limited experiment (CV), for which $E$-mode data provide stronger constraints than $T$ on nearly all scales. ACT should improve on the $\textit{Planck}$ constraints by $\gtrsim25\%$, nearing the CV limit on intermediate scales. Finally, we compare the constraining power of localized searches to that of a power spectrum analysis, and demonstrate that for sufficiently few produced particles the localized search performed herein is dominant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for increasing dark energy in DESI from the Local Distance Ladder</a><span class="id">[2509.23168]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The {\it Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument} (DESI) provides a comprehensive survey of {\it Baryon Acoustic Oscillation} (BAO) in the {\it Large Scale Structure} (LSS), {in stratified data covering a finite redshift range.} Extracting cosmological parameters in a joint analysis of LSS-CMB data is hereby inherently a nonlinear problem. In particular, this nonlinearity may concern the unknown equation of state of dark energy $w(a)$, defined in the general $w(a)$CDM framework. Nevertheless, a common approach is the linearized approximation hereto notably $w_0w_a$CDM, also applied by DESI. Here, we consider a potential source of a systematic uncertainty in this linearization due to non-commutativity between $w_0w_a$CDM and {\it a posteriori} linearization of $w(a)$CDM, identified with a symmetry in the latter, which is violated in the former. We shall refer to these as early and late linearization, respectively. We demonstrate this in the analysis of the Hubble expansion in the Local Distance Ladder (LDL). Strikingly, opposite results are found for the evolution of dark energy by early versus late linearization, indicating a thawing or respectively, increasing dark energy. It is unlikely that the DESI pipeline is immune to the same contradiction. Our results show rather than thawing, claimed by DESI, dark energy may in fact be increasing.

These observations suggest that, despite the harsh radiative conditions, large carbonaceous molecules can form, process and survive in the ejecta of massive stars. Complementary optical spectroscopy with SALT HRS shows multiple P Cygni profiles in H$\alpha$, He \textsc{i}, and Fe \textsc{ii} lines, which are indicative of a dense, expanding wind and substantial mass loss. Furthermore, analysis of decade long photometric data shows short-term brightness variations of $\sim$ 0.5 mag. These results not only reinforce the classification of WRAY 16-232 as a strong LBV candidate but also provide new insights into the mechanisms of dust formation and the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium by massive stars.

Using cleaned Chandra and VLA data, we derive two-dimensional (2D) and one-dimensional (1D) autocorrelation functions and power spectra, revealing that the fluctuations in both X-ray brightness (approximately tracing plasma density) and radio brightness (tracing magnetic field strength) follow the power-law distributions consistent with Kolmogorov-type turbulence. Specifically, power spectra exhibit a slope $8/3$ in 2D and $5/3$ in 1D analyses, indicating fully developed turbulence across a broad range of spatial scales. The structure functions and spectral slopes remain robust with and without correction for line-of-sight integration effects, suggesting the presence of Kolmogorov-like turbulence locally throughout the remnant's volume. Anisotropies in the 2D autocorrelation function are aligned with known density and magnetic field gradients. Analysis of the 1D radial properties of turbulence confirms Kolmogorov scaling and indicates that modes in the power spectra may be related either to periodicity in the fluctuations or to the physical sizes of bright or dim features in the surface brightness. Our results demonstrate that the Tycho SNR hosts a spatially and temporally developed turbulent cascade, providing insight into the physics of turbulence in SNRs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comological Prediction from the joint observation of MeerKAT and CSST at $z$ = 0.4 $\sim$ 1.2</a><span class="id">[2509.23343]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cross-correlating neutral hydrogen (HI) 21cm intensity mapping with galaxy surveys provides an effective probe of astrophysical and cosmological information.

We present the CRs of the SSC process radiated from the reverse-shock region for the case of a thick and thin shell, considering that the reverse shock lies in the adiabatic regime and evolves in an environment with a homogeneous and stratified medium. We analyze these CRs with the spectral and temporal characteristics of the bursts described in the second \textit{Fermi}-LAT GRB catalog (2FLGC) and found that i) the thin shell case is preferred over a thick shell and a constant-density medium over a stellar-wind environment, ii) bursts with an atypical and hard spectral index could be successfully described by this scenario in different cooling conditions, iii) the early optical flash and GeV emission exhibited in GRB 160625B and 180720B were generated from the same accelerated region and electron population, concluding that LAT emission originated during the early afterglow, and iv) the maximum synchrotron energy radiated from the reverse-shock scenario could explain only a few photons with the exception of a pair of bursts, so that scattered photons by the SSC process must be required.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23406" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How clear are the skies of WASP-80b?: 3D Cloud feedback on the atmosphere and spectra of the warm Jupiter</a><span class="id">[2509.23406]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Close-in warm Jupiters orbiting M-dwarf stars are expected to exhibit diverse atmospheric chemistry, with clouds playing a key role in shaping their albedo, heat distribution, and spectral properties.

Using high-quality data from the Chinese New Vacuum Solar Telescope, the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, this work presents highly suggestive direct imaging evidence of magnetic reconnection during the untangling of braided magnetic structures above a sunspot. These magnetic structures, visible as bright superpenumbral threads in extreme ultraviolet passbands, initially bridge opposite-polarity magnetic fluxes and then gradually tangle in their middle section. Magnetic extrapolation reveals the fibrils to form a small flux rope that is twisted and braided, possibly created by persistent and complex photospheric motions. During untangling, repetitive reconnection events occur inside the flux rope, accompanied by transient plasma heating, bidirectional outflowing blobs, and signatures of nanojets. Emission analysis reveals that the outflowing blobs are multi-thermal structures with temperatures well below 1 MK, undergoing rapid cooling and leaving emission imprints in H{\alpha} images. The measured reconnection angles indicate that 16%-22% of the magnetic field along each thread is anti-parallel, with the remaining field acting as a guide field. The estimated energy released during these reconnection events is comparable to nanoflares, which can be powered by up to 6% of the magnetic energy stored in the anti-parallel field. This work presents a textbook example of magnetic flux rope reconnection in the solar atmosphere, providing new insights into fine-scale energy release processes within sunspot superpenumbral fibrils.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Improved reconstruction of the century-long solar magnetic field by incorporating morphological asymmetry in sunspots</a><span class="id">[2509.23691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurately modeling the solar magnetic field is important for understanding long-term solar activity and space weather, but it is challenging due to limited observations, especially near the poles. The Surface Flux Transport (SFT) model simulates how magnetic flux moves across the solar surface and contributes to the polar field, but it parametrizes emerged sunspots as simple symmetric bipolar regions and needs improvement by including more realistic sunspot features. In this study, we reconstruct the century-long evolution of the solar magnetic field, including the polar regions, using an improved SFT model. We incorporate cycle-dependent morphological asymmetry between leading and following sunspots, along with observationally derived tilt angles and sunspot area data for a century (1913-2016), to better represent magnetic flux transport and investigate the impact of asymmetry on polar field development. To study morphological asymmetry, we consider two cases: first, a long-term asymmetry factor calculated from the ratio of leading and following sunspot areas spanning over a century; second, the temporal asymmetry factor observed during solar cycle 23 applied to every solar cycle. Our simulated magnetic flux transport with inclusion of morphological asymmetry for both cases gets improved compared to the no asymmetry case in terms of enhanced low and mid-latitude magnetic flux and matches closely with observations. The simulated polar fields with asymmetry also show a better agreement with polar field observations for most cycles, particularly in capturing the timing of the polar field reversals and the peak amplitude during solar minima, which has severe consequences in solar cycle prediction</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of OH and Fe in the dayside atmosphere of the hottest ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-9b with SPIRou</a><span class="id">[2509.23850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Simultaneous measurements of volatile and refractory elements are essential for tracing the formation and migration of ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs). High-resolution infrared emission spectroscopy has been widely used to probe their atmospheres, covering molecules and atoms. For the hottest known planet, KELT-9b, whose dayside atmosphere is nearly fully dissociated and ionized, no molecules had been firmly detected. Here we report the first detection of OH in the dayside atmosphere of KELT-9b, based on two thermal emission observations with the SPIRou spectrograph, and confirm the presence of Fe. We performed a self-consistent retrieval under chemical equilibrium, constraining elemental abundances and metallicity. A significant thermal inversion layer is confirmed. No significant Doppler shifts were found, and the retrieved equatorial rotation matches the tidally locked value. The oxygen abundance is consistent with solar to supersolar (0.61$_{-0.58}^{+1.19}$ dex), while the C/O ratio and metallicity are subsolar to solar. The low metallicity may indicate a well-mixed envelope and interior. Constraints remain broad, and the data are consistent with supersolar C/O and subsolar O. Combined [C/O] and [O/H] are compatible with formation beyond the water snowline followed by inward migration, though other scenarios cannot be excluded. Volatile-to-refractory ratios, [O/Fe] = 1.25$_{-0.74}^{+0.99}$ dex and [C/Fe] = 0.60$_{-0.74}^{+0.62}$ dex, lie in the solar to supersolar range, but uncertainties limit firm conclusions. Results provide tentative evidence for volatile enrichment. Future high-resolution optical-to-infrared spectra with JWST will enable more precise abundance constraints and stronger insights into UHJ formation and migration. We also advocate a retrieval-guided cross-correlation strategy to reduce risk of missing marginal detections, as illustrated by tentative evidence for CO.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23897" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aligned Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in AGN disks revealed by GWTC-4</a><span class="id">[2509.23897]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion disks are ideal sites for hierarchical black hole (BH) mergers. To robustly probe such a possibility, we analyze binary black hole mergers in the GWTC-4 with a flexible mixture population model for component masses, spin magnitudes, and spin tilt angles, and identify two distinct subpopulations. In the second subpopulation characterized by high spin magnitudes $\chi\sim 0.8$ as well as the broad mass distribution up to $\gtrsim 150M_\odot$, we find a pronounced preference for spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum: an isotropic tilt distribution is strongly disfavored (logarithmic Bayes factor = 4.5). The aligned events account for $\sim 0.57^{+0.23}_{-0.31}$ of the second subpopulation, corresponding to a local rate of $\sim 0.25^{+0.38}_{-0.16} ~ {\rm Gpc}^{-3} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ (all values reflect central 90\% credible intervals). These notable features naturally arise from hierarchical mergers embedded in AGN disks, where gas torques can effectively align spins. Our results identify AGN-disk hierarchical assembly as an important channel in the present gravitational-wave sample and provide concrete, testable predictions for future detection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the large-scale magnetic field inside the Sun from three decades of observed surface magnetograms</a><span class="id">[2509.23959]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Space-weather and disturbances in the heliosphere are manifestations of the solar magnetic field, which is solely driven by the interior dynamo, and constraining the solar interior magnetic field and its oscillatory behavior is one of the major challenges in solar physics. Observationally, none of the techniques, including helioseismology, are able to provide an estimation of the interior magnetic field. We reconstruct, for the first time, the dynamics of the interior large-scale magnetic fields by assimilating observed line-of-sight photospheric magnetogram data from MDI/SOHO &amp; HMI/SDO along with helioseismic differential rotation data for three decades (1996-2025) into a 3D dynamo model. Our data-driven model successfully reproduces key observational features such as the surface butterfly diagram, polar field evolution, and axial dipole moment. The reconstructed interior field dominated by toroidal component exhibits an equatorward migration and reproduces the realistic amplitude and modulation of cycles 23-25. The non-axisymmetric behaviour of the interior toroidal field becomes less prominent as we move deep towards the tachocline. A strong correlation between the simulated toroidal field and sunspot number/area establishes our 3D magnetogram-driven model as a robust predictive model of the solar cycle.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the strangeness enhancement scenario of the UHECR muon puzzle with LHC experiments</a><span class="id">[2509.24021]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The excess of muons observed in ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray air showers relative to simulation predictions, known as the muon puzzle, provides indirect evidence of our incomplete understanding of high-energy hadronic interactions. An unambiguous resolution requires that each proposed solution be directly tested through collider experiments probing hadronic interactions. In this work, we develop a framework to assess the strangeness enhancement scenario, wherein an increased yield of kaons relative to pions boosts muon production. Using the MCEQ air-shower simulation package, we first identify the key phase-space regions of hadronic interactions that drive muon yields in this scenario. We then demonstrate that combining Pierre Auger Observatory muon measurements with forthcoming kaon-to-pion ratio data from LHC Run 3 can robustly constrain the scenario's parameters. In particular, we find that achieving 10.8% precision on the kaon-to-pion ratio at LHCb and 8.4% at FASER is sufficient to test the strangeness enhancement hypothesis over its viable parameter space. These upcoming experimental results will provide the first direct constraints on strangeness enhancement as a potential resolution of the muon puzzle.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renormalization group corrections to $Λ$CDM model and observational consequences for $H_0$ tension</a><span class="id">[2509.24026]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the renormalization group-based extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model as a potential solution to the current cosmological tensions.

The corresponding cosmological model is consistent with the principles of quantum field theory, based on the covariance of the vacuum effective action, and is characterized by an unique extra parameter $\nu$. Our analysis yields a best-fit value of $\nu = - (2.5 \pm 1.3)\times 10^{-4}$, placing the $\Lambda$CDM limit at the $2\sigma$ region of the $\nu$ posterior. This narrow range is consistent with data from CMB (Planck), BAO (DESI), and SN Ia (DES Y5).

In this work, we investigate the formation of USP planets in two-planet systems consisting of an inner terrestrial planet accompanied by an outer hot Jupiter (HJ). Our simulation results show USP planets can form through a process driven by secular perturbations from the outer companion, which induce eccentricity excitation, tidal dissipation, and subsequent orbital decay of the inner planet. The probability of USP formation is governed by key factors, including the mass ratio between two planets, their orbital eccentricities, and the tidal dissipation process. 6.7\% of our simulations form USP planets, and USP planets form most efficiently when the mass ratio is around 4 $M_{\oplus}{\rm /}M_{\rm J}$, with the inner planet less than 8 $M_{\oplus}$. Furthermore, the eccentricity of the outer HJ plays a crucial role-moderate eccentricities ($e_{\rm outer}&lt;0.1$) favor USP formation, whereas higher eccentricities ($e_{\rm outer}&gt;0.1$) enhance the likelihood of orbital instability, often resulting in a lonely HJ. USP planets form more efficiently when the tidal dissipation function of the inner planet is comparable to the values estimated for terrestrial planets in the solar system. Comparison with observed planetary systems reveals that systems with large mass ratios or nearly circular outer planets tend to produce short-period (SP) planets instead of USP planets. Our findings offer a potential explanation for the most commonly observed system architectures, which predominantly feature either an HJ with an inner SP planet or a lonely HJ.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inferring Cosmological Parameters with Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Networks</a><span class="id">[2509.24327]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine the use of a novel variant of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to predict cosmological parameters from recent supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) datasets.

These arrays measure the sampling air shower size $\Sigma\rho$ and the total muon number $\Sigma N_{\mu}$ of each air shower event. These parameters are known to contain information on the energy and mass of the primary particle. To reconstruct the energy spectra of individual cosmic-ray mass groups, we apply a multidimensional unfolding method based on Bayes' theorem to the two-dimensional distribution of $\Sigma\rho$ and $\Sigma N_{\mu}$ produced by Monte Carlo simulation. Simulated datasets with combinations of the EPOS-LHC, SIBYLL-2.3c, and QGSJET II-04 high-energy hadronic interaction models and a helium-dominant composition model are analyzed while using a response matrix produced by EPOS-LHC. The unfolded spectra of the EPOS + helium-dominant composition model dataset show a deviation from the input flux within $\pm$10\% except for a few bins, meaning that the uncertainty of the technique itself and the composition model dependence is at that level. It is also shown that the deviation in the all-particle spectrum is within $\pm$10\% even when using different hadronic interaction models in the dataset and the response matrix. On the other hand, the unfolded spectra of individual mass groups have a clear dependence on the hadronic interaction model. The model dependence of the proton and helium spectra amounts to \pm25% below 10$^{6.5}$ GeV. The dependence in the carbon group is at a \pm25% level below 10$^{6}$ GeV, and for the iron spectrum, it amounts to +55% and -30% in the energy range of 10$^{5.1}$ GeV to 10$^{6.7}$ GeV.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LST-1 observations of GRB 221009A: Insights into its late-time VHE afterglow</a><span class="id">[2509.24475]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from explosions at cosmological distances, generating collimated jets. GRB 221009A, exploded on 9 October 2022, has been established as the brightest GRB to date. Its bright and long emission was extensively followed up from radio to gamma rays. LHAASO firmly detected the onset of the afterglow emission at energies up to $\sim$13 TeV within about an hour after the burst, starting just a few minutes after the trigger. While this VHE emission component can be accounted for in a narrow jet scenario, such an interpretation cannot reproduce the broadband emission observed at later times, which exceeds the theoretical expectations. This discrepancy can be settled if more complex models are considered, providing the first strong evidence for a structured jet in a long GRB. Unfortunately, the VHE emission after a few hours is poorly constrained, as sensitive VHE observations by Cherenkov Telescopes were prevented due to strong moonlight conditions. The first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory began observations about one day after the burst under high night sky background conditions. These observations are the first ones performed on GRB 221009A by a Cherenkov telescope, revealing a hint of a signal with a statistical significance of about 4$\sigma$ during the observations performed at 1.3 days after the burst. The monitoring campaign continued until the end of November 2022, making it the deepest observation campaign performed on a GRB with the LST-1. In this contribution, we will present the analysis results of the LST-1 observation campaign on GRB 221009A in October 2022.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark matter and fundamental physics with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</a><span class="id">[2509.24523]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will be the next-generation major ground-based gamma-ray observatory.

The baseline coverage of the 2021 observations is significantly improved through the addition of two new EHT stations: the 12 m Kitt Peak Telescope and the Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA). All observations result in images dominated by a bright, asymmetric ring with a persistent diameter of $43.9\pm 0.6\,\muas$, consistent with expectations for lensed synchrotron emission encircling the apparent shadow of a supermassive black hole. We find that the total intensity and linear polarization of \m87 vary significantly across the three epochs. Specifically, the azimuthal brightness distribution of the total intensity images varies from year to year, as expected for a stochastic accretion flow. However, despite a gamma-ray flare erupting in M87 quasi-contemporaneously to the 2018 observations, the 2018 and 2021 images look remarkably similar. The resolved linear polarization fractions in 2018 and 2021 peak at $\sim$5\%, compared to $\sim$15\% in 2017. The spiral polarization pattern on the ring also varies from year to year, including a change in the electric vector position angle helicity in 2021 that could reflect changes in the magnetized accretion flow or an external Faraday screen. The improved 2021 coverage also provides the first EHT constraints on jet emission outside the ring, on scales of $\lesssim 1$ mas. Overall, these observations provide strong proof of the reliability of the EHT images and probe the dynamic properties of the horizon-scale accretion flow surrounding \m87.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarization at millimeter wavelengths caused by drifting grains in protoplanetary disks</a><span class="id">[2509.24594]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During the evolution of protoplanetary disks, dust grains start to grow, form larger particles, settle to the midplane, and rearrange the disk, mainly by the inward radial drift. Because of this, dust pebbles with an irregular shape usually align mechanically and thus cause polarization signatures in their thermal radiation due to dichroic emission or absorption. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the potential to trace the impact of mechanical grain alignment in protoplanetary disks on the observed degree and orientation of linear polarization at millimeter wavelengths. We combined 3D radiation hydrodynamical simulations to determine the density distribution and the velocity field of gas and dust particles, Monte Carlo dust-gas interaction simulations to calculate the mechanical alignment of dust in a gas flow, and, finally, 3D Monte Carlo polarized radiative transfer simulations to obtain synthetic polarimetric observations. We find that large grains, which contribute the most to the net polarization, are potentially mechanically aligned in the protoplanetary disk under the effect of the vertical shear instability (VSI). Thereby, the drift velocity is parallel to the rotational disk axis. Assuming oblate dust grains that are aligned with their short axis parallel to the direction of the drift velocity, the resulting polarization is usually along the major axis of the disk. This is in contrast to typical drift models that propose either a radial or azimuthal drift velocity component. If hydrodynamical instabilities, such as the VSI, dominate the kinematics in protoplanetary disks, the mechanical alignment of dust is a promising mechanism for grain alignment in these systems. In that case, the resulting millimeter polarization allows us to trace the orientation of aligned millimeter-sized grains.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capture and escape from the 2:1 resonance between Ariel and Umbriel in a fast-migration scenario of the Uranian system</a><span class="id">[2509.24631]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent measurements suggest that Uranus may exhibit a higher tidal dissipation than previously assumed. This enhanced dissipation leads to a faster orbital migration of its five major moons: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Consequently, resonant encounters that have always been discarded in previous works need to be included. In particular, Ariel's fast migration implies that the crossing of the 2:1 mean motion resonance with Umbriel is extremely likely and it could have occurred in recent times. Capture into this strong resonance would have induced significant tidal heating within Ariel, possibly explaining its resurfacing. Therefore, in this work, we aim to explore the orbital history of the Uranian moons in a context of fast tidal migration, including the crossing of the 2:1 mean motion resonance between Ariel and Umbriel. For small initial eccentricities, we confirm that the moons are always captured into this resonance. As the system is not currently involved in any mean motion resonance, we investigated possible dynamical mechanisms for exiting the 2:1 resonance. We show that the resonance could have been broken by a further resonant encounter with Titania. We analyzed the crossing of the 4:2:1 and 3:2:1 resonant chains, and looked for the parameter space where the probability of escaping the resonance is maximized. Taking a dissipative parameter of Ariel $k_{2,2}/Q_2&lt;10^{-3}$, the passage through the 3:2:1 resonance succeeds in disrupting the 2:1 Ariel-Umbriel mean motion resonance in more than $60\%$ of our numerical experiments. A fraction of our simulations results in final low eccentricities and inclinations, which can eventually match the current orbital features of the system. As the proposed orbital history requires specific ranges of the dissipative parameters for the system, future Uranus mission data will validate (or disprove) this scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMB Hemispherical Power Asymmetry from Early Phase of Inflation</a><span class="id">[2509.24712]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the hemispherical power asymmetry observed in the CMBR by attributing it to an early inhomogeneous phase of cosmic expansion.

Our analysis builds on previously developed empirical models of inhomogeneous primordial power spectrum models based on dipole modulation. Using in-in formalism, we compute two-point correlations directly from the metric and demonstrate that, at leading order, this introduces a direction-dependent power spectrum that breaks rotational symmetry and naturally selects a preferred direction, relating observed violation of the cosmological principle to inflationary power spectra arising from scalar field fluctuations. Additionally, we find that this framework produces correlations between multipoles separated by $\Delta l=1$, leading to distinctive signatures in the multipole space.

They frequently display systematic asymmetric and anti-correlated spatial variations of their particle density and temperature across the current sheet, leaving the plasma pressure essentially uniform. These observations of asymmetries have previously been modelled theoretically by adding additional terms to both the ion and electron distribution functions of self-consistent force-free collisionless current sheet models with constant density and temperature profiles. In this paper we present the results of a modification of these models in which only the electron distribution function has a term added to it, whereas the ion distribution function is kept as a thermal (Maxwellian) distribution function. In this case the nonlinear quasineutrality condition no longer has a simple analytical solution and therefore has to be solved alongside Ampère's law. We find that while the magnetic field remains approximately force-free, the non-zero quasineutral electric field gives rise to an additional spatial substructure of the plasma density inside the current sheet.

Disc turbulence and dust fragility matter at almost every stage. Previous studies typically vary one of them while fixing the other, failing to provide a complete picture. Here, we use analytical models and numerical dust evolution models DustPy to study the combinations of gas turbulence and dust fragility that can reproduce multi-wavelength ALMA observables. We find only appropriate combinations – fragile dust (fragmentation velocity $v_\mathrm{frag}$= 1-2 m/s) in discs with viscous $\alpha=10^{-4}$ or resilient dust ($v_\mathrm{frag}$= 6-10 m/s) in discs with viscous $\alpha=10^{-3}$ – can reproduce observations. Our result is robust to two widely used opacities (DSHARP and Ricci opacities). Regardless of the strength of disc turbulence, reproducing observations requires observed dust rings to be optically thick at $\lambda=1.3$ and $3$ mm. As only small dust can be lifted above the midplane to reach the emitting layers, SED analysis probably yields lower limits on the maximum grain sizes. We highlight the challenge of creating detectable dust rings at large radii when incorporating bouncing in models, and the need for earlier formation of dust rings at smaller radii to reproduce the decreasing ring brightness with radius observed across ALMA wavelengths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24939" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AGN hosting jets.

However, computationally demanding as they are, their use is limited to a relatively small number of representative cases. When comparing to the distribution of large samples of objects in the luminosity-distance plane (P-D plane), the most efficient approach is to use analytical or semi-analytical models that reproduce the evolution of the main parameters governing the dynamics and radio luminosity of the sources. Our aim is to build a semi-analytical model that allows us to produce mock samples of radio galaxies to be compared with real populations and use this approach to constrain the general properties of active galaxies with jets in a cosmological context. In this work, we present a new model for the evolution of radio galaxies based on the resolution of ordinary differential equations and inspired both by previous experience on numerical simulations of jets across several orders of magnitude in power, and by observational evidence. Our results show remarkable agreement between the results given by the semi-analytical model and those obtained by both 2D and 3D relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of jets ranging from 1.e35 W to 1.e39 W. From the derived trajectories of powerful radio galaxies through the P-D diagram (powers greater than 1.e36 W), our model agrees with typical lifetimes of galactic activity of &lt; 500 Myr. We also compare our results with previous models in the literature. In a follow-up paper, we use this model to generate mock populations of radio galaxies at low redshifts and compare them to the LoTSS sample.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST/MIRI Imaging of the Warm Dust Component of the Epsilon Eridani Debris Disk</a><span class="id">[2509.24976]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present JWST/MIRI observations of the debris disk surrounding the nearby, solar analog Epsilon Eridani obtained as part of the Archetypal Debris Disk GTO program.

In a companion paper arXiv:2508.00798 , we previously leveraged the gradient expansion formalism (GEF) to investigate pure axion inflation (PAI), i.e., axion inflaton coupled to a pure gauge sector. In this paper, we extend our analysis to fermionic axion inflation (FAI), i.e., we allow for the presence of fermions in the gauge sector. PAI predicts a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum; in our GEF benchmark study, all parameter regions leading to observable GWs turned out to violate the upper limit on the number of extra relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. As we demonstrate in this paper, the situation is different for FAI: Schwinger pair creation of the charged fermions results in a damping of the gauge-field production, which attenuates the GW signal. As a result, the GW signal from FAI can fall into the sensitivity reach of LISA and ET without violating the upper limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. This result notably applies to the arguably most realistic variant of Abelian axion inflation, in which the axion couples to the hypercharge sector of the Standard Model. Besides, we discuss GW emission from the fermion gas, which may further enhance the total GW signal but which also requires a more quantitative investigation in future work. Additionally, we identify a new backreaction regime in which fermion production moderates the axion–vector dynamics. In this regime, the axion velocity and all energy-density components exhibit oscillations analogous to the strong backreaction in PAI, but here, the oscillations occur around the slow-roll trajectory and are damped by the presence of charged fermions. These observations define again an interesting GEF benchmark for future lattice studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25036" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XMM-Newton view of pulsating iron fluorescent emission from Centaurus X3</a><span class="id">[2509.25036]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cen X-3 is a bright, high-mass X-ray binary pulsar. We present a pulse phase-resolved X-ray spectral analysis of data from an archival XMM-Newton observation of Cen X-3 taken during the high state of the source. The observation was entirely in the out-of-eclipse part of the binary orbit. We study the pulse phase variability of the three K${\alpha}$ fluorescent emission lines from near-neutral, Helium-like and Hydrogen-like iron, along with the iron K${\beta}$ emission line. All four lines show clear modulation with the pulse phase of the neutron star, and modulation is found to be higher for the lines from highly ionised iron compared to the neutral lines. Structures within the light travel distance corresponding to the pulse period of the neutron star are likely responsible for the pulse phase modulation of the emission lines. We have also investigated the orbital phase dependence of the pulse phase variability in the iron lines by dividing the data into four segments at different orbital phases of Cen X-3. The pulse phase modulation behaviour of the four lines is quite identical at different orbital phases of Cen X-3, indicating the pulsed iron emission region is persistent in nature and probably phase aligned with respect to the observer. The accretion stream intercepting the line of sight can probably produce the observed phase dependence of the iron fluorescence emission lines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avalanches in Magnetohydrodynamical simulations</a><span class="id">[2509.25066]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scale invariance is a hallmark of many natural systems, including solar flares, where energy release spans a vast range of scales. Recent computational advances, at the level of both algorithmics and hardware, have enabled high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to span multiple scales, offering new insights into magnetic energy dissipation processes. Here, we study scale invariance of magnetic energy dissipation in two distinct MHD simulations. Current sheets are identified and analyzed over time. Results demonstrate that dissipative events exhibit scale invariance, with power-law distributions characterizing their energy dissipation and lifetimes. Remarkably, these distributions are consistent across the two simulations, despite differing numerical and physical setups, suggesting universality in the process of magnetic energy dissipation. Comparisons between the evolution of dissipation regions reveals distinct growth behaviors in high plasma-beta regions (convective zone) and low plasma-beta regions (atmosphere). The latter display spatiotemporal dynamics similar to those of avalanche models, suggesting self-organized criticality and a common universality class.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25083" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extended mass distribution of PBHs during QCD phase transition: SGWB and mini-EMRIs</a><span class="id">[2509.25083]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) are one of the most important tracers of cosmic history. In this work, we investigate the formation of PBHs around the time of the QCD phase transition from a broadly peaked inflationary scalar power spectrum, which naturally produces an extended PBH mass function. This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25088" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Dark Radiation to Dark Energy: Unified Cosmological Evolution in K-essence Models</a><span class="id">[2509.25088]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study a class of Unified Dark Matter (UDM) models based on generalized K-essence, where a single scalar field with non-canonical kinetic terms accounts for dark radiation, dark matter, and dark energy.

All models are implemented in a modified version of \texttt{Hi\_CLASS} and confronted with data from \textit{Planck} 2018, DESI DR1, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The scenarios reproduce the full sequence of cosmic epochs: an early radiation-like phase, a matter-dominated era, and late-time accelerated expansion.

The quadratic potential requires an ultralight mass that makes it effectively indistinguishable from the Scherrer solution.

We find that high mantle temperature, iron content, and melt fraction all suppress the overall induction heating efficiency due to increased mantle conductivity and magnetic shielding. In GJ 486b, induction heating likely exceeds both radiogenic heating and tidal heating, driving persistent surface volcanism and early volatile depletion, whereas HD 3167b and GJ 357b experience insignificant induction heating due to weak stellar magnetic fields.

There are large uncertainties in the physical description of IA, and analytical calculations are often out of reach for weak lensing statistics beyond two-point functions. We present here a set of six flexible IA models infused directly into weak lensing simulations, constructed from the mass shells, the projected tidal fields and, optionally, dark matter halo catalogues. We start with the non-linear linear alignment (NLA) and progressively sophisticate the galaxy bias and the tidal coupling models, including the commonly-used extended NLA (also known as the e-NLA or $\delta$-NLA) and the tidal torque (TT) models. We validate our methods with MCMC analyses from two-point shear statistics, then compute the impact on non-Gaussian cosmic shear probes from these catalogues as well as from reconstructed convergence maps. We find that the $\delta$-NLA model has by far the largest impact on most probes, at times more than twice the strength of the NLA. We also observe large differences between the IA models in under-dense regions, which makes minima, void profiles and lensing PDF the best probes for model rejection. Furthermore, our bias models allow us to separately study the source-clustering term for each of these probes, finding good agreement with the existing literature, and extending the results to these new probes. The third-order aperture mass statistics ($M^3_{ap}$) and the integrated three-point functions are particularly sensitive to this when including low-redshift data, often exceeding a 20% impact on the data vector. Our IA models are straightforward to implement and rescale from a single simulated IA-infused galaxy catalogue, allowing for fast model exploration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hidden massive eclipsing binaries in red supergiant systems: The hierarchical triple system KQ Puppis and other candidates</a><span class="id">[2509.25168]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The majority of massive stars are part of binary systems that may interact during their evolution. This has important consequences for systems in which one star develops into a Red supergiant (RSG); however, not many RSGs are known binaries. We aim to better constrain the properties of some of the known RSGs in binaries. We first focus on the VV Cephei type RSG KQ Pup (RSG+B-type companion, orbital period of 26 yr), where we have enough data to constrain the system's properties. We use archival photometry and UV spectroscopy, along with newly taken optical spectra and interferometric data. For KQ Pup, as well as for all other Galactic RSGs, we also analyzed the available TESS data. Using TESS photometry, we discovered eclipses with a period of $17.2596 \: \rm d$, associated with the hot B companion, making it a Ba+Bb pair. Meanwhile, the detection of the hydrogen Br$\gamma$ line with VLTI-GRAVITY enabled us to track the orbital motion of the KQ Pup Ba+Bb pair and thus to determine the astrometric orbit. The dynamical masses agree with independent estimates from asteroseismology and evolutionary models. The results give a mass of $ \sim 9 \: \rm M_{\odot} $ for the RSG and $ \sim 14 \: \rm M_{\odot} $ for the sum of the hot components Ba+Bb. The observed properties of the system are compatible with a coeval hierarchical triple-star, where we constrain the minimum mass of KQ Pup Bb as $ \gtrsim 1.2 \: \rm M_{\odot} $. The variability of Balmer lines and the detection of Br$\gamma$ represent a strong signature of Wind Roche Lobe Overflow, with enhanced signatures of disk-accretion to the Ba+Bb pair during the periastron. Meanwhile, TESS light curves show that about $\sim 10 \%$ of known Galactic binary RSGs may be eclipsing hierarchical triple systems, which suggests that a large fraction of other binary RSGs could also be triples.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colors of Life in the Clouds: Biopigments of atmospheric microorganisms as a new signature to detect life on planets like Earth</a><span class="id">[2509.25173]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When Carl Sagan and Ed Salpeter envisioned potential Sinkers, Floaters, and Hunters living in Jupiter's clouds in 1976 (C.

In this work, we extend the DM21cm code package, which models the effects of spatially inhomogeneous energy emission and deposition on 21-cm cosmology, to study three well-motivated scenarios which 21-cm measurements are particularly well-suited to probe: dark matter annihilation through $p$-wave processes, the Hawking radiation of light primordial black holes, and energetic emission from accreting solar-mass primordial black holes. We project sensitivities to each of these scenarios, demonstrating that leading or near leading sensitivity to each can be achieved through 21-cm probes.

In this article, we study how Big Bang Nucleosynthesis can constrain models of Ultra-Light Dark Matter diagonally coupled to neutrinos. We follow an adiabatic formalism which allows to average-out the rapid oscillations of the Dark Matter field and consistently take into account the feedback between the neutrino and the Dark Matter fields. This feedback alters the early Universe dynamics, causing the Dark Matter energy density to scale as radiation, while the neutrino mass scales as $a^{-1}$. These two effects modify primordial element abundances by modifying interaction rates and the expansion rate during nucleosynthesis. Then, we use primordial abundances to obtain leading cosmological bounds on the coupling in the range $m_\phi/{\rm eV}\in (10^{-22},10^{-17})$, namely $g\lesssim 0.13(m_\phi/{\rm eV})$ for $m_\phi \gtrsim 3\times 10^{-20}\,\rm eV$ and $g\lesssim 1.8\times 10^{-11}\sqrt{m_\phi/\rm eV}$ for $m_\phi \lesssim 3\times 10^{-20}\,\rm eV$.

Incorporating the electric charge $q_E$ and the magnetic charge $q_M$, we first show that nonsingular BHs can exist only if $q_M = 0$. We then study the stability of purely electric BHs by analyzing the behavior of perturbations in the metric and the vector field. Nonsingular electric BHs are unstable due to a Laplacian instability in the vector perturbation near the regular center. In the absence of the HVT coupling ($\beta=0$), singular BHs in power-law NED theories can be consistent with all linear stability conditions, while Born-Infeld BHs encounter strong coupling due to a vanishing propagation speed as $r \to 0$. In power-law NED and Born-Infeld theories with $\beta \neq 0$, the electric fields for singular BHs are regular near $r=0$, while the metric functions behave as $\propto r^{-1}$. Nevertheless, we show that Laplacian instabilities occur for regions inside the outer horizon $r_h$, unless the HVT coupling constant $\beta$ is significantly smaller than $r_h^2$. For $\beta \neq 0$, we also reconstruct the NED Lagrangian so that one of the metric functions takes the Reissner-Nordström form. In this case, there exists a branch where all squared propagation speeds are positive, but the ghost and strong coupling problems are present around the BH center. Thus, the dominance of the HVT coupling generally leads to BH instability in the high-curvature regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complete Classification of Domain Wall Solutions in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric 2HDM</a><span class="id">[2509.23332]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a complete classification of domain wall solutions in the two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) with a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, categorised as superconducting, CP-violating, or neither, depending on the scalar particle masses and the ratio of the two Higgs doublets' vacuum expectation values.

Unfortunately, the density dependence of the effective mass of nucleons in these models does not align with the predictions of ab initio models with three body forces. In this work, we investigate the thermal response for a set of extended Skyrme interactions that feature widely different density dependencies of the effective mass of the nucleons. Thermal contributions to the energy density and pressure are studied along with a few thermal coefficients over wide domains of density, temperature and isospin asymmetry, relevant for the physics of hot compact objects. For some of the effective interactions, the thermal pressure is negative at high densities. This results in a situation where hot compact stars can support less mass before collapsing into a black hole compared to their cold counterparts.

In this work, we investigate such solutions within the framework of General Relativity (GR), assuming spherical symmetry and static geometry. It is well established in the literature that, in order to sustain such geometries, the source of Einstein's equations in the BB context can be composed of a scalar field $\varphi$ and a nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). In our model, in addition to the Lagrangian associated with the scalar field in the action, we also include an interaction term of the form $W(\varphi)\mathcal{L}(F)$, which introduces a nonminimal coupling between the scalar field and the electromagnetic sector. Notably, the usual minimal coupling configuration is recovered by setting $W(\varphi)=1$. In contrast to approaches where the function $W(\varphi)$ is assumed a priori, here we determine its functional form by modeling the radial dependence of the derivative of the electromagnetic Lagrangian as a power law, namely $\mathcal{L}_F(r) \sim F^n$. This approach enables us to determine $W(r)$ directly from the obtained solutions. We apply this procedure to two specific geometries: the Simpson-Visser-type BB solution and the Bardeen-type BB solution, both analyzed in the purely magnetic ($q_m \neq 0$, $q_e=0$) and purely electric ($q_m=0$, $q_e \neq 0$) cases. In all scenarios, we find that these BB spacetime solutions can be described with a linear electrodynamics, which is a noteworthy result. Furthermore, we examine the regularity of the spacetime through the Kretschmann scalar and briefly discuss the associated energy conditions for the solutions obtained.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24114" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telling apart black holes and naked singularities with trajectories of massive particles</a><span class="id">[2509.24114]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We performed a numerical study of the dynamics of massive particles orbiting black holes and naked singularities in the Reissner-Nordström geometry.

The leading neutron star finite-size effect is an additional phase contribution due to tidal deformations induced by the gravitational coupling between the two inspiralling objects in the binary. We show how neglecting this effect in the templates reduces the search sensitivity close to the detection threshold. This is particularly true for binary neutron stars systems, where tidal effects are larger. In this work we therefore propose a new technique for the construction of binary neutron star template banks that accounts for neutron star tidal deformabilities as degrees of freedom of the parameter space to be searched over. A first attempt in this direction was carried out by Harry &amp; Lundgren [Physical Review D 104, 043008 (2021)], who proposed to extract randomly the tidal deformabilities of the stars over a uniform interval, regardless of the binary neutron star component masses. We show that this approach yields 33% additional templates with respect to the equivalent point-like template bank. Our proposed approach, instead, adopts a more physically motivated tidal deformability prior with a support that is informed by the value of the neutron star mass and compatible with the neutron star equation of state constraint provided by the observation of GW170817.

Here we present further developments of this approach, focussing our attention at perturbative aspects and stability of solutions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding the Nature of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2509.24774]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We offer a physical interpretation of the origin of the scalar-induced gravitational wave background, showing that it is mainly produced around the peaks of the scalar perturbations.

It is usually assumed that topological defects are produced if the temperature becomes sufficiently high, but in reality their formation depends on the post-inflationary dynamics of a symmetry-breaking scalar. We analyze the dynamics of a symmetry-breaking scalar field in the early universe within models that provide an effective negative mass term at the origin, and show that the symmetry can remain broken so that topological defects are never formed. In particular, we demonstrate that nonthermally produced particles (such as the Standard Model Higgs) during preheating can generate such an effective negative mass term, allowing the scalar field to follow a time-dependent minimum even in renormalizable models with a quartic coupling. We also discuss the implications of this result for the Peccei-Quinn scalar in axion models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High Reheating Temperature without Axion Domain Walls</a><span class="id">[2509.24812]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a cosmological scenario in which the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry remains broken in the entire history of the Universe, thereby avoiding the formation of axion strings and domain walls. Contrary to the conventional expectation, it is demonstrated that appropriately chosen scalar interactions are able to keep the PQ symmetry broken at arbitrarily high temperatures. We carefully examine the finite-temperature effective potential in a model with two PQ breaking scalar fields. The existence of flat directions plays a vital role in suppressing axion isocurvature perturbations during inflation by stabilizing a PQ field at a large field value. The viable parameter space consistent with theoretical and observational constraints is identified. Our scenario provides a minimal path for PQ symmetry breaking that addresses both the axion domain wall and isocurvature problems while permitting arbitrarily high reheating temperatures accommodating high-scale baryogenesis scenarios such as thermal leptogenesis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Precision calculation of $^3$He$(α,γ)^7$Be for solar physics</a><span class="id">[2509.24931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We calculate the cross section for radiative capture $^3$He$(\alpha,\gamma)^7$Be at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO).

A salient property of dark matter is its negligible or null coupling to ordinary matter, with the exception of gravitational interaction. This poses a significant challenge in producing the requisite amount of dark particles through processes within the Standard Model. In this study, we examine the production of a vector field during inflation due to its direct interaction with the inflaton field through kinetic and axion-like couplings as well as the field-dependent mass. The gradient-expansion formalism, previously proposed for massless Abelian gauge fields, is extended to include the longitudinal polarization of a massive vector field. We derive a coupled system of equations of motion for a set of bilinear functions of the vector field. This enables us to address the nonlinear dynamics of inflationary vector field production, including backreaction on background evolution. To illustrate this point, we apply our general formalism to a low-mass vector field whose kinetic and mass terms are coupled to the inflaton via the Ratra-type exponential function. The present study investigates the production of its transverse and longitudinal polarization components in a benchmark inflationary model with a quadratic inflaton potential. It has been demonstrated that pure mass coupling is able to enhance only the longitudinal components. By turning on also the kinetic coupling, one can get different scenarios. As the coupling function decreases, the primary contribution to the energy density is derived from the transverse polarizations of the vector field. Conversely, for an increasing coupling function, the longitudinal component becomes increasingly significant and rapidly propels the system into the strong backreaction regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational entropy of fluids with energy flux</a><span class="id">[2509.25007]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine gravitational entropy growth within the formalism of Clifton, Ellis and Tavakol (CET) applied to a class of spherically symmetric exact solutions whose source is a shear-free fluid with energy flux in a comoving frame.

In the present paper we examine the integrability of the CET entropy form in connection with Einstein's equations in the fluid flow approach, proving as well that all expanding configurations comply with the growth of CET gravitational entropy. Finally, we examine the connection between the CET gravitational entropy and the notion of a gravitational “arrow of time” based on the ratio of Weyl to Ricci curvature.

Here, we reevaluate those original results, but in the context of warm inflation, in which a substantial radiation component (produced by the inflaton) exists throughout the inflationary period. We demonstrate that the same general requirements found in the context of ordinary (cold) inflation also hold true in warm inflation; indeed an even tinier amount of negative running is sufficient to prevent eternal inflation. This is particularly pertinent, as models featuring negative running are more generic in warm inflation scenarios. Finally, the condition for the existence of eternal inflation in cold inflation – that the curvature perturbation amplitude exceed unity on superhorizon scales – becomes more restrictive in the case of warm inflation. The curvature perturbations must be even larger, i.e. even farther out on the potential, away from the part of the potential where observables, e.g. in the Cosmic Microwave Background, are produced.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the nonstandard propagating gravitational waves in the cosmological background with GWTC-3</a><span class="id">[2405.10031]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to test the fundamental nature of gravity. We present constraints on the nonstandard propagation of GWs using the spectral siren method applied to binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). The spectral siren method exploits the redshift distribution of BBHs to probe the cosmic expansion history and break degeneracies between cosmology and modified gravity effects. We focus on the friction term $\nu$ in the nonstandard GW propagation equation, which characterizes the running of the Planck mass. Assuming the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find $\nu = 0.5^{+3.5}_{-2.6}$ (median and $90\%$ credible interval), improving upon previous constraints from the bright siren event GW170817 by an order of magnitude. This improvement is due to the higher redshifts of BBHs in GWTC-3, reaching up to $z \sim 1$. Our result suggests that the propagation of GWs is consistent with the predictions of general relativity, placing limits on modified gravity theories that predict a time-varying Planck mass. As the sensitivity of GW detectors improves, the spectral siren method will provide a powerful tool for testing gravity on cosmological scales and probing the physics of the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2D BAO vs 3D BAO: Hints for new physics?</a><span class="id">[2406.05453]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As next-generation telescopes and observational surveys continue to expand the boundaries of our understanding, tensions and discrepancies between observational datasets are becoming increasingly prominent. In this work, we focus on one such discrepancy: the differences between 2D and 3D Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. Without extending beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, we systematically study and highlight this discrepancy in different parameter spaces. This work examines the constraints on fundamental cosmological parameters ($H_0$, $r_d$, $\Omega_m$) derived from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data. By analyzing BAO observational datasets from two distinct methodologies (2D and 3D) alongside the Pantheon Plus SNIa sample, we identify a significant systematic difference: 2D BAO measurements consistently yield higher values of $hr_d$ compared to both 3D BAO and DESI analyses. While 2D BAO measurements appear to bridge the Hubble tension by simultaneously accommodating both a higher $H_0$ value (aligning with SH0ES) and a larger sound horizon $r_d$ (matching Planck), this apparent reconciliation comes at the cost of introducing tension with the well-constrained Planck measurement of $\Omega_{m0}h^2$. This behavior arises because of systematically higher values of the product $H_0r_d$ observed in 2D BAO analysis compared to 3D analyses. Therefore, given these systematic differences, we advocate for careful consideration when using 2D BAO measurements to address the Hubble tension, suggesting that understanding the origin of this 2D-3D discrepancy should be a priority for future investigations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sporadic radio pulses from a white dwarf binary at the orbital period</a><span class="id">[2408.11536]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations have revealed rare, previously unknown flashes of cosmic radio waves lasting from milliseconds to minutes, and with periodicity of minutes to an hour. These transient radio signals must originate from sources in the Milky Way, and from coherent emission processes in astrophysical plasma. They are theorized to be produced in the extreme and highly magnetised environments around white dwarfs or neutron stars. However, the astrophysical origin of these signals remains contested, and multiple progenitor models may be needed to explain their diverse properties. Here we present the discovery of a transient radio source, ILT J1101+5521, whose roughly minute-long pulses arrive with a periodicity of 125.5 minutes. We find that ILT J1101+5521 is an M dwarf – white dwarf binary system with an orbital period that matches the period of the radio pulses, which are observed when the two stars are in conjunction. The binary nature of ILT J1101+5521 establishes that some long-period radio transients originate from orbital motion modulating the observed emission, as opposed to an isolated rotating star. We conclude that ILT J1101+5521 is likely a polar system where magnetic interaction has synchronised the rotational and orbital periods of the white dwarf. Magnetic interaction and plasma exchange between two stars has been theorized to generate sporadic radio emission, making ILT J1101+5521 a potential low-mass analogue to such mechanisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">89.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Large-Scale Structure Systematics on Cosmological Parameter Estimation</a><span class="id">[2409.14265]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large near-future galaxy surveys offer sufficient statistical power to make our cosmology analyses data-driven, limited primarily by systematic errors. Understanding the impact of systematics is therefore critical. We perform an end-to-end analysis to investigate the impact of some of the systematics that affect large-scale structure studies by doing an inference analysis using simulated density maps with various systematics; these include systematics caused by photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s), Galactic dust, structure induced by the telescope observing strategy and observing conditions, and incomplete covariance matrices. Specifically, we consider the impacts of incorrect photo-$z$ distributions (photometric biases, scatter, outliers; spectroscopic calibration biases), dust map resolution, incorrect dust law, selecting none or only some contaminant templates for deprojection, and using a diagonal covariance matrix instead of a full one. We quantify the biases induced by these systematics on cosmological parameter estimation using tomographic galaxy angular power spectra, with a focus on identifying whether the maximum plausible level of each systematic has an adverse impact on the estimation of key cosmological parameters from a galaxy clustering analysis with Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find photo-$z$ systematics to be the most pressing out of the systematics investigated, with spectroscopic calibration biases leading to the greatest adverse impact while helpfully being flagged by a high $\chi^2$ value for the best fit model. Larger-than-expected photo-$z$ scatter, on the other hand, has a significant impact without necessarily indicating a poor fit. In contrast, in the analysis framework used in this work, biases from observational systematics and incomplete covariance matrices are comfortably subdominant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">90.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10367" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is inflationary magnetogenesis sensitive to the post-inflationary history ?</a><span class="id">[2412.10367]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Considering inflationary magnetogenesis induced by time-dependent kinetic and axial couplings of a massless Abelian vector boson field breaking the conformal invariance we show in this article that, surprisingly, the spectral shape of the large-scale primordial magnetic field power spectrum is insensitive to the post-inflationary history, namely the barotropic parameter ($w$) and the gauge coupling functions of the post-inflationary era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Hole Formation from Power Spectrum with Finite-width</a><span class="id">[2501.00295]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) can form from gravitational collapse of large overdensities in the early Universe, giving rise to rich phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology.

In this work, we develop a neural network (NN) emulator to generate model thermal bolometric X-ray light curves of millisecond pulsars with multipolar magnetic fields. We assess the NN's predictive and computational performance across a broad parameter space. We find that for a static vacuum field model, the NN provides a &gt;400 times speedup. We integrate this NN emulator into a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) framework to replace the computationally expensive physical model during parameter exploration. Applied to PSR J0030+0451, this approach allows the MCMC to reach equilibrium in  1 day on 4000 cores, where with the original physical model alone it would have taken more than a year on the same hardware. We compare posterior distributions by running equivalent MCMC iterations with both the NN and the physical model, evaluate differences in distributions when continuing the physical model MCMC from the NN MCMC equilibrium state, and assess variations in posterior distributions resulting from NNs trained on datasets of different sizes. Our NN architecture is agnostic to the underlying physics of the physical model and can be trained for any other physical model, opening many previously intractable avenues of analysis. The NN speed remains the same regardless of the complexity of the physical model it was trained to emulate, allowing greater speedups for more complex physical models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">93.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13788" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free-Streaming Neutrinos and Their Phase Shift in Current and Future CMB Power Spectra</a><span class="id">[2501.13788]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmic neutrino background and other light relics leave distinct imprints in the cosmic microwave background anisotropies through their gravitational influence. Since neutrinos decoupled from the primordial plasma about one second after the big bang, they have been free-streaming through the universe. This induced a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks as a unique signature. In this work, we constrain the free-streaming nature of these relativistic species and other light relics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics by establishing two complementary template-based approaches to robustly infer the size of this phase shift from the temperature and polarization power spectra. One template shifts the multipoles in these spectra, while the other novel template more fundamentally isolates the phase shift at the level of the underlying photon-baryon perturbations. Applying these methods to Planck data, we detect the neutrino-induced phase shift at about $10\sigma$ significance, which rises to roughly $14\sigma$ with additional data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. We also infer that the data is consistent with the Standard Model prediction of three free-streaming neutrinos. In addition, we forecast the capabilities of future experiments which will enable significantly more precise phase-shift measurements, with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 reducing the $1\sigma$ uncertainties to roughly 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. More generally, we establish a new analysis pipeline for the phase shift induced by neutrinos and other free-streaming dark radiation which additionally offers new avenues for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model in a signature-driven and model-agnostic way.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">94.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07469" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Influence of finite-temperature effects on CMB power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2503.07469]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the implications of finite-temperature quantum field theory effects on cosmological parameters within the framework of the $Ł$CDM model and its modification.

The Poynting flux exhibits pulsations at twice the orbital frequency, $2\Omega$, and is highly anisotropic, following a power-law dependence on orbital frequency. The index ranges from 1 to 6, shaped by the intricate dynamics of the magnetospheres. Furthermore, we present the first computation of: (1) The EM forces acting on the star surfaces, revealing the presence of torques that, for highly-magnetized stars, could influence the orbital dynamics or break the crust. (2) The high-energy emission signals from these systems by adopting the established isolated pulsar theory. Assuming curvature radiation in the radiation reaction limit, we find that photons could reach TeV–PeV energies in the last $\sim$ ms for magnetic field strengths $10^{10}-10^{15}$ G. However, our analysis of single photon magnetic pair production suggests that these photons are unlikely to escape, with the MeV band emerging as a promising observational window for precursor high-energy emission. In this framework, we construct high-energy emission skymaps and light curves, exploring observational implications.

GWs interact gravitationally with astrophysical objects, which makes it possible to use gravitational lensing by objects in the same gravitational system (self-lensing) to learn about their environments. We quantify the probability of self-lensing through the optical depth $\tau$ for the main channels of detectable GWs at frequencies $f_{\rm GW}\sim (1-10^3)\,{\rm Hz}$. We then analyze the detectability of the lensing effect (imprint). In star clusters, the probability of self-lensing by stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is low, $\tau\simeq10^{-7}$, even when taking into account nearby BHs in resonant interactions, $\tau\simeq 10^{-5}$. Additionally, the lensing imprint of a stellar-mass lens (diffraction and interference) is too marginal to be detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and most Einstein Telescope signals. For a massive BH lens in the center of a cluster, the probability can reach $\tau\simeq 10^{-4}$ either via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai induced mergers of BBHs orbiting a central massive BH, or BBHs formed as GW captures in single-single interactions in the Bahcall-Wolf cusp of a nuclear cluster. For self-lensing by a supermassive BH for BBHs in the migration trap of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, $\tau \simeq 10^{-2}$. The imprint of these massive lenses are multiple images that are already detectable. Moreover, self-lensed signals from AGN disks have a distinct linear polarization. The probability depends on the extent of the detectability through the threshold impact parameter $y_{\rm max}$, which can increase for future detectors. We conclude that constraining the environment of BBHs is possible by combining self-lensing imprints with other waveform signatures such as eccentricity and polarization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">98.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae with no electromagnetic counterparts</a><span class="id">[2506.03581]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are regularly observed electromagnetically, prompting targetted searches for their gravitational-wave emission.

A regular CCSN explosion may be obscured by matter in the Galaxy. A star may undergo a failed CCSN explosion, where the stalled shockwave is not revived, and would eventually form a black hole. Higher mass progenitor stars may revive the shock, but form a black hole too quickly for the shockwave to reach the surface of the star and produce an electromagnetic signal. Previous work has shown that we can determine if a black hole forms from the CCSN neutrino emission if there are long duration sinusoidal modulations in the neutrino signal caused by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). The SASI also produces an observable signature in the gravitational-wave emission. In this paper, we investigate if we can distinguish between different scenarios for electromagnetically dark CCSNe using the gravitational-wave emission alone. We find, using a reconstruction of the SASI mode, abrupt end times of the gravitational-wave emission, and the rate of change of frequency of the dominant mode, that we are able to accurately distinguish between an obscured CCSN, a failed CCSN, and an explosion with fast black hole formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">99.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10096" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QPEs from EMRI Debris Streams Impacting Accretion Disks in Galactic Nuclei</a><span class="id">[2506.10096]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) sources in galactic nuclei are often associated with a stellar object orbiting a supermassive black hole with hours-days period, brought in as an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In the presence of an accretion disk, repeated star-disk collisions lead to ablation of a small fraction of the stellar mass during each disk passage. We analytically follow the evolution of the stellar debris as it is tidally stretched outside the EMRI's Hill sphere, forming an elongated, dilute stream, that subsequently collides with the disk, half an orbit after the previous star-disk encounter. At sufficiently long orbital periods ($\gtrsim 12$ hr), the stream is too dilute to penetrate the disk, and is instead strongly shocked and deflected at its surface through a reverse shock. We obtain the resulting emission and explore implications for QPE observations. Due to their low optical depth and prolonged interaction time, radiation from the shocked streams typically dominates over that from shocked disk gas directly impacted by the star or by ejecta confined within its Hill sphere, as was first proposed by Yao et al. 2025. We find that: (1) QPE flare durations reflect the stream-disk collision timescale; (2) Flare luminosities of $10^{42-43}$ erg/s, consistent with observed QPEs, are robustly produced; (3) Soft X-ray flares with temperatures of ${\sim}$100 eV arise when the stream mass is sufficient to sustain a radiation mediated shock at the collision interface. Higher mass streams yield softer flares, typically outshone by the disk, while lower mass streams result in collisionless shocks, which likely produce fainter and harder flares. We discuss observational implications of the temporal evolution of the underlying disk, assuming it is the remnant of a prior tidal disruption event in the same galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">100.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic Field Configurations in Binary Neutron Star Mergers I: Post-merger Remnant and Disk</a><span class="id">[2506.18995]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers performed with the code GR-Athena++.

Magnetic field amplification occurs shortly after the merger due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability; later, the field keeps evolving with a predominantly toroidal configuration due to winding and turbulence. The initial magnetic field topology leaves an imprint on the field structure and affects magnetic field amplification for the initial magnetic field values commonly assumed in the literature and the limited resolution of the simulations. Enforcing equatorial reflection symmetry partially suppresses the development of turbulence near the equatorial plane and impacts the post-merger magnetic field evolution. Stiffer EOSs produce larger, less compact remnants that may retain memory of the pre-merger strong poloidal field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">101.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VegasAfterglow: A High-Performance Framework for Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows</a><span class="id">[2507.10829]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous astrophysical transients, known to be associated with core collapse of massive stars or mergers of two compact objects such as two neutron stars. They are followed by multi-wavelength afterglow emission originating from the deceleration of the relativistic jets by the ambient medium. The study of afterglow emission offers crucial insights into the physics of relativistic shocks, the properties of the circumburst environment, the physical and geometrical structure of relativistic jets, as well as the viewing geometry of the observer. We present {\tt VegasAfterglow}, a newly developed, high-performance C++ framework designed for modeling GRB afterglows with flexibility and computational efficiency as key features of design. The framework self-consistently solves forward and reverse shock dynamics and calculates synchrotron (including self-absorption or all spectral regimes) and inverse Compton radiation (including Klein-Nishina corrections); it can handle arbitrary user-defined ambient density profiles, central engine activity histories, viewing angles, and the jet structures of energy, Lorentz factor, and magnetization profiles. It supports both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes and includes lateral jet spreading effects. In this paper, we describe the numerical implementation of the framework and assess its computational performance. Our results demonstrate that {\tt VegasAfterglow} is well-suited for interpreting current and future multi-wavelength observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">102.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13446" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the Origin of Hot Jupiters with Atmospheric Surveys</a><span class="id">[2507.13446]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In spite of their long detection history, the origin of hot Jupiters remains to be resolved. While multiple dynamical evidence suggests high-eccentricity migration is most likely, conflicts remain when considering hot Jupiters as a population in the context of warm and cold Jupiters. Here, we turn to atmospheric signatures as an alternative mean to test the origin theory of hot Jupiters, focusing on population level trends that arise from post-formation pollution, motivated by the upcoming Ariel space mission whose goal is to deliver a uniform sample of exoplanet atmospheric constraints. We experiment with post-formation pollution by planetesimal accretion, pebble accretion, and disk-induced migration and find that an observable signature of post-formation pollution is only possible under pebble accretion in metal-heavy disks. If most hot Jupiters arrive at their present orbit by high-eccentricity migration while warm Jupiters emerge largely in situ, we expect the atmospheric water abundance of hot Jupiters to be significantly elevated compared to warm Jupiters. We report on the detectability of such signatures and further provide suggestions for future comparative atmospheric characterization between hot Jupiters and wide-orbit directly imaged planets to elucidate the properties of the dust substructures in protoplanetary disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">103.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energy Cascade and Damping in Fast-Mode Compressible Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2508.03443]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Compressible turbulence governs energy transfer across scales in space and astrophysical systems. Capturing both the turbulence cascade and damping is therefore crucial for models of energy conversion, plasma heating, and particle transport in diverse plasma environments, but remains challenging. Progress is constrained by two unresolved fundamental questions: the persistence of the turbulence cascade in the presence of shocks and discontinuities, and the validity of classical wave theories under strong nonlinearity. In particular, it remains unclear whether meaningful cascade dynamics can be defined in compressible turbulence with phase steepening, and whether frameworks developed for monochromatic waves remain applicable to complex, broadband fluctuations. Using large-scale, high-resolution kinetic simulations, we analyze turbulence-particle interactions, which are beyond the capability of standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We show that compressible turbulence damping at MHD scales in quantitative agreement with transit-time damping theory, even in fully developed nonlinear states. Moreover, the cascade persists despite the generation of shocks and discontinuities due to phase steepening, revealing a surprising robustness of cross-scale energy transfer under extreme conditions. We further provide the spectral expression of compressible turbulence. These results close a long-standing gap in the physics of compressible turbulence and establish a robust foundation for turbulence modeling from the heliosphere to galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">104.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13941" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Catalog of M&amp;M Eclipsing Binaries with TESS</a><span class="id">[2508.13941]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a catalog of 1292 low-mass (M&amp;M) short-period eclipsing binaries observed by the TESS mission. Eclipsing binaries are useful for many aspects of stellar astrophysics, including calibrating stellar models, and catalogs of eclipsing binary properties provide context for population-level inferences. In this work, we present our selection criteria for our catalog, along with steps taken to characterize the orbital and physical properties of our EBs. We further detail crucial steps in vetting our catalog to ensure that the systems in our catalog have a high likelihood of being true M&amp;Ms. Our sample consists primarily of binaries with short-period, circular orbits and often manifest as high-mass ratio &quot;twin&quot; M&amp;Ms. We find that our sample of M&amp;Ms does not exhibit the same excess of contact binaries that similar samples of solar-type binaries do. Using a novel statistical approach, we find a tidal circularization period of approximately 2.0 days for these binaries, which is significantly shorter than the value typically given in the literature of 7 days. Finally, we explore the prospects for additional companions to our M&amp;Ms. Future avenues include spectroscopic follow-up of bright M&amp;Ms to better-characterize low-mass stellar properties and a deeper assessment of the presence of tertiary companions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">105.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A pseudo-Newtonian stationary circumbinary slim disk model</a><span class="id">[2508.15150]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a pseudo-Newtonian stationary circumbinary slim disk model.

We find that; (1) due to the different disk density profiles, the integrated tidal torque exerted on the disk is significantly smaller for the slim disk than for the thin disk; as a result thin disks onto binary black holes can be radiatively significantly more efficient than slim disks; (2) The presence of the secondary alters the emission of the circumbinary disk, making it different from the spectrum of a single black hole Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN); (3) The tidal torque boosts the viscous torque in the outer part of the disk (radii greater than the binary separation), which is strongly dependent on the disk parameters, including the binary mass ratio $q$, the orbital separation $a$, the viscous parameter $\alpha$ and the accretion rate $\dot M$; (4) The vertical component of the potential of the secondary slightly decreases the integrated tidal torque. However, both the vertical and radial components of the potential of the secondary have small impact on the disk radiative flux; (5) Using the integrated disk tidal torque backreacting on the secondary at different orbital separations, we find that the disk provides an efficient way to shrink the binary orbital separation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">106.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15887" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spinning into the Gap: Direct-Horizon Collapse as the Origin of GW231123 from End-to-End GRMHD Simulations</a><span class="id">[2508.15887]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BH) merger observed to date, involves component BHs with masses inside the pair-instability mass gap and unusually high spins. This challenges standard formation channels such as classical stellar evolution and hierarchical mergers. However, stellar rotation and magnetic fields, which have not been systematically incorporated in prior models, can strongly influence the BH properties. We present the first self-consistent simulations tracking a massive, low-metallicity helium star from helium core burning through collapse, BH formation, and post-BH formation accretion using 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. Starting from a $250\,M_\odot$ helium core, we show that collapse above the pair-instability mass gap, aided by rotation and magnetic fields, drives mass loss through disk winds and jet launching. This enables the formation of highly spinning BHs within the mass gap and reveals a BH spin-mass correlation. Strong magnetic fields extract angular momentum from the BH through magnetically driven outflows, which in turn suppress accretion, resulting in slowly spinning BHs within the mass gap. In contrast, stars with weak fields permit nearly complete collapse and spin-up of the BH to $ a\approx1$. We show that massive low-metallicity stars with moderate magnetic fields naturally produce BHs whose masses and spins match those inferred for GW231123, and are also consistent with those of GW190521. The outflows may impart a BH kick, which can induce spin-orbit misalignment and widen the post-collapse orbit, delaying the merger. The outflows launched during collapse may power short-lived, high-luminosity jets comparable to the most energetic $\gamma$-ray bursts, offering a potential observational signature of such events in the early universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">107.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19701" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time-resolved protoplanetary disk physics in DQ Tau with JWST</a><span class="id">[2508.19701]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accretion variability is ubiquitous in YSOs. While large outbursts may strongly affect the disk, the effects of moderate bursts are less understood. We aim to study the physical response of the disk around the eccentric binary system DQ Tau to its periodic accretion changes. We organized a multi-wavelength campaign centered on four JWST/MIRI spectra. We targeted three periastrons (high accretion state) and one apastron (quiescence). We used optical and near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry to measure how the accretion luminosity varies. We decomposed the multi-epoch SEDs into stellar, accretion, and rim components. We fitted the solid-state features using various opacity curves and the molecular features using slab models. We find the inner disk of DQ Tau to be highly dynamic. The temperature, luminosity, and location of the inner dust rim vary in response to the movement of stars and the L_acc variations. This causes variable shadowing of the outer disk, leading to an anti-correlation between the rim temperature and the strength of the silicate feature. The dust mineralogy remains constant, dominated by large amorphous olivine and pyroxene grains, with smaller fractions of crystalline forsterite. The excitation of CO (1550-2260 K), HCN (880-980 K), and hot H2O (740-860 K) molecules as well as the luminosity of the [NeII] line correlate with the accretion rate, while the warm (650 K) and cold (170-200 K) H2O components are mostly constant. CO emission, originating from a hot (&gt;1500 K) region likely within the dust sublimation radius, is most sensitive to L_acc changes. In comparison with other T Tauri disks, DQ Tau is highly C-poor and displays moderately inefficient pebble drift. We conclude that even moderate accretion rate changes affect the thermal structure in the planet-forming disk regions on short timescales, providing a crucial benchmark for understanding disk evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">108.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First look at Vela X-1 with XRISM: A simultaneous campaign with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR</a><span class="id">[2509.07258]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) serve as useful laboratories for exploring the behaviour of accreted matter onto compact objects and for probing the complex wind environments of massive stars. These investigations are essential for understanding stellar life cycles and the dynamics of the Milky Way, and they are prominent topics in the science cases for XRISM and NewAthena. We report, for the first time, a XRISM observation of the HMXB Vela X-1, conducted during the first cycle of the XRISM general observer programme and complemented by simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR coverage. This campaign targeted a critical orbital phase – when the neutron star is in inferior conjunction – during which significant changes in absorption are expected. We performed absorption-resolved spectral analyses during two time intervals of interest: the soft and hard hardness ratio (HR) intervals, as it is strongly correlated with absorption variability. We observed a sudden transition in the HR from a soft to a hard state, coinciding with an increase in the absorption column density. This is likely attributed to the onset of the accretion structure crossing our line of sight. With XRISM/Resolve, we also investigated the Fe K region, and we report for the first time the presence of a Fe K$\alpha$ doublet in the spectrum of Vela X-1, together with the presence of already known Fe K$\beta$ and Ni K$\alpha$ lines that are produced in cold clumps embedded in the hot ionised wind. The measured line velocities of the order of $10^2 \ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ are consistent with production sites in the vicinity of the neutron star. This precursor study with Vela X-1 shows the potential of XRISM in studying in unprecedented details the spectral evolution of wind-accreting X-ray binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">109.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Validating DIRECD: Statistical Evaluation of Coronal Mass Ejections Direction Estimates from Coronal Dimmings</a><span class="id">[2509.19987]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are among the most energetic phenomena in our solar system, with significant implications for space weather. Understanding their early dynamics remains challenging due to observational limitations in the low corona. We present a statistical evaluation of the DIRECD (Dimming InfeRred Estimation of CME Direction) method, which provides a novel approach to determining initial CME propagation directions using coronal dimmings. We analyze 33 coronal dimming events well observed by SDO/AIA and validate our DIRECD results with 3D reconstructions from the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model. We find generally good agreement between the DIRECD-derived inclinations and the GCS model. In the meridional plane (north–south direction), the mean difference in inclinations is $0.3^\circ \pm 7.8^\circ$. In the equatorial plane (east–west direction), the mean difference is $-2.9^\circ \pm 18.9^\circ$. In 3D, the inclinations show a mean difference of $1.2^\circ \pm 10.4^\circ$. We further visually compare our method by projecting the DIRECD cones onto LASCO/C2 observations, and verify the model's ability to capture both the primary CME structure and associated secondary dimming regions. This work establishes DIRECD as a powerful, observationally grounded technique for determining the initial CME direction, offering new insights that complement existing reconstruction methods. The technique's unique capability to determine early CME direction in the low corona using coronal dimmings observed in EUV images makes it particularly valuable for improving space weather forecasting models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">110.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21078" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PENELLOPE VII: Revisiting empirical relations to measure accretion luminosity</a><span class="id">[2509.21078]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The accretion luminosity (Lacc) in young, low-mass stars is crucial for understanding stellar formation, but direct measurements are often hindered by limited spectral coverage and challenges in UV-excess modeling. Empirical relations linking Lacc to various accretion tracers are widely used to overcome these limitations. This work revisits these empirical relations using the PENELLOPE dataset, evaluating their applicability across different star-forming regions and to accreting young objects other than Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs). We analyzed the PENELLOPE VLT/X-Shooter dataset of 64 CTTSs, measuring fluxes of several accretion tracers and adopting the stellar and accretion parameters derived from PENELLOPE works. We supplemented our analysis with the ODYSSEUS HST data set, which covers a wider spectral range in NUV bands. We compared the Lacc values obtained in the PENELLOPE and ODYSSEUS surveys finding statistically consistent results. Our analysis confirms that existing empirical relations, previously derived for the Lupus sample, provide reliable Lacc estimates for CTTSs in several other star-forming regions. We revisit empirical relations for accretion tracers in our dataset, based on HST-fit, with coefficients which are consistent within 1sigma with XS-fit results for most lines. We also propose a method to estimate extinction using these relations and investigate the empirical relations for Brackett lines (Br8 to Br21). The Lacc vs Lline empirical relations can be successfully used for statistical studies of accretion on young forming objects in different star-forming regions. These relations also offer a promising approach to independently estimate extinction in CTTSs. We confirm that near-infrared lines (PaB and BrG) reliably trace Lacc in high accretors, making them valuable tools for probing accretion properties of high accreting young stars not accessible in the UVB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">111.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resistive Scaling in the Magnetic Helicity-Driven Inverse Cascade</a><span class="id">[2509.21141]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The inverse cascade in MHD turbulence plays a crucial role in various astrophysical processes such as galaxy cluster formation, solar and stellar dynamo mechanisms, and the evolution of primordial magnetic fields in the early universe.

Previous simulations have already suggested a resistive dependence of inverse transfer rates and demonstrated the significant influence of magnetic helicity flux density $\epsilon_\mathrm{H}$ on this process. On dimensional grounds, we have $E_\mathrm{M}(k,t)=C_\mathrm{H} \epsilon_\mathrm{H}^{2/3} k^{-1}$ where $C_\mathrm{H}$ represents a potentially universal dimensionless coefficient analogous to the Kolmogorov constant. We present a summary of the 25 distinct simulations conducted with the \textsc{Pencil Code}, systematically varying the forcing wavenumber $k_\mathrm{f}$, magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$, grid resolution $N^3$, and Lundquist number $Lu$. We obtained $C_\mathrm{H}$ and corresponding error bars by calculating the compensated spectrum and investigated its dependence with $Lu$ and $k_\mathrm{f}$.

In addition, we require that the de Sitter scalaron mass is also a monotonically increasing function of the Ricci scalar, or it has an extremum. Also the $F(R)$ gravity function is required to depend on the two known fundamental scales in cosmology, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the mass scale $m_s^2=\frac{\kappa^2 \rho_m^{(0)}}{3}$, with $\rho_m^{(0)}$ denoting the energy density of the cold dark matter at the present epoch, that is $F(R)=F(R,\Lambda,m_s^2)$. Using these general assumptions we provide the general features of viable classes of $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theories which remarkably can also simultaneously describe successfully the dark energy era. This unique feature of a unified description of the dark energy and inflationary eras stems from the requirement of the monotonicity of the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$. These viable classes are either deformations of the $R^2$ model or $\alpha$-attractors type theories. The analysis of the viability of a general $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theory is reduced in evaluating the parameter $x=\frac{R F_{RRR}}{F_{RR}}$ and the first slow-roll index of the theory, either numerically or approximately.

This study analyses relativistic and ultra-relativistic electron occurrence and loss timescales within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several strong and severe geomagnetic storms that all, remarkably, flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons. These allow the first definitive multi-MeV electron lifetimes to be calculated in this region and indicate an elevated risk to satellites in slot region orbits during periods of heightened solar activity. The HEEF outer belt loss timescales are broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles, but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster-decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions, but the variability within the spread is not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This suggests the limitations of using pitch-angle diffusion to account for the decay of elevated electrons following geomagnetic storms, and the need for more sophisticated space weather indices for radiation belt forecasting.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">117.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhancing gravitational-wave detection: a machine learning pipeline combination approach with robust uncertainty quantification</a><span class="id">[2504.17587]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational-wave data from advanced-era interferometric detectors consists of background Gaussian noise, frequent transient artefacts, and rare astrophysical signals.

In this paper we study the production and evolution of these GWs. Specifically, we investigate the emission of thermal gravitons (gravitons emitted by a thermal bath) from particle scattering in the bath and the evolution of the corresponding GWs. We find that the bulk of thermal graviton production in WI occurs during the transition to radiation domination after inflation. Further, the energy density of thermal gravitons is enhanced by roughly one to two orders of magnitude compared to that in a radiation-dominated scenario with the same reheating temperature. We also calculate the spectrum of the resulting stochastic GW background and find that it has a distinctive shape, consisting of a peak at high frequencies  100 GHz and an almost flat spectrum extending to low frequencies. The peak arises from emission of sub-horizon modes that follow the temperature of the bath. The flat part of the spectrum corresponds to the modes that exit the horizon during WI and re-enter during radiation domination. We show that the detection prospects for the high-frequency peak of the GW spectrum, while improved slightly compared to the radiation-dominated case, still remain challenging. The thermal spectrum's low-frequency plateau is typically subdominant to the amplitude of the standard vacuum tensor modes from inflation, although WI models can exist where the thermal graviton plateau surpasses the vacuum contribution without exceeding current observational limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Furthermore, we calculate the thermal graviton contribution from WI to dark radiation and show that WI models are generally expected to satisfy current observational bounds, including those from the cosmic microwave background.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">120.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Attenuation of the ultra-high-energy neutrino flux by dark matter scatterings</a><span class="id">[2508.02869]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A flux of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos, produced by astrophysical sources at cosmological distances, is anticipated to exist and reach Earth.

Finally, we explore all this phenomenology with the recent UHE neutrino event KM3230213A, and place the corresponding limits on the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross section.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">121.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electron Inertia and Magnetic Reconnection</a><span class="id">[2509.14400]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The finite electron mass can cause magnetic reconnection even in the absence of any other non-ideal effect. It will be shown that when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of a magnetic field $\vec{B}$, there is a related field that evolves ideally. This field is $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (c/\omega_{pe})^2\mu_0\vec{j} \right)$ with $\omega_{pe}$ the plasma frequency and $\vec{j}$ the current density. In three dimensional space, the practical importance of the ideal evolution of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ on its reconnection appears limited. When the evolution velocity of modified field is chaotic, $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ will reconnect on a timescale that depends only logarithmically on any non-ideal effect that is diffusive, such as resistivity, with a current density enhancement that is also proportional to the logarithm. In near ideal magnetic fields, this logarithm is typically of order ten, and it is difficult to conceive of a physically realistic situation in which it larger than a hundred.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">122.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14701" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhancement of Weak Interactions in Phase Transitions</a><span class="id">[2509.14701]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Weak interactions cause small parity-violating energy differences between left- and right-handed chiral systems. Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">123.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarimetry imprints of exotic compact objects: relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars</a><span class="id">[2509.20344]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations of polarimetric parameters of active galactic nuclei motivate the study of polarization in the spacetime of exotic compact objects which can mimic the features of black holes in the strong field regime of gravity. In this work, we study the properties of two models for ultra-compact objects containing light rings - relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars. We have simulated the orbit of a hot spot around the considered objects in the polarization ray-tracing software GYOTO, and extracted observables, namely integrated images of the Stokes parameters I, Q, U; their evolution during the orbit in the QU-plane, and the electric vector position angle (EVPA). Our models resemble the black hole qualitatively, with slight additional imprints which provide a useful tool to constrain the spacetime metric of supermassive compact objects with current and future observations, and probe the fundamental properties of these objects. We have found that one fluid star model with a pressure singularity resembles the black hole entirely, while another gravastar features notable differences in the EVPA curve in the low-inclination case. Since differences between the models become more pronounced for a higher inclination, our results could potentially restrict the adequateness of ECO classes with future high-inclination observations.</p></div></details></article></body>
