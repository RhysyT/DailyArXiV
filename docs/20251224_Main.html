The accuracy of this measurement is predicated on the assumption that standardized Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities do not evolve with redshift. If present, SN Ia luminosity evolution is expected to be most detectable in the dark matter-dominated era of the Universe ($z \gtrsim 1.5$), with its effects becoming more easily distinguishable from dark energy variation at increasing redshift. We present JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of SN 2025ogs, a normal SN Ia at $z = 2.05 \pm 0.01$. This SN offers a key point of comparison for interpreting future high-redshift SN Ia samples. The NIRCam light curve indicates a blue color ($B - V = -0.27 \pm 0.06$ mag) and a moderately fast decline ($\Delta m_{15}(B) = 1.55 \pm 0.15$ mag), both within standard criteria for inclusion in cosmological analyses. Its luminosity distance is in $1.0\sigma$ agreement with a standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model, as well as with current cosmological constraints from the Dark Energy Survey (DES 5yr) and Pantheon+. The NIRSpec spectrum displays all of the hallmark absorption features of a normal SN Ia observed at peak brightness. We find that the rest-frame optical color, rest-frame near-ultraviolet properties, and Si II line strengths are all consistent with the moderately fast decline inferred from the light curve. Multiple absorption features (Ca II H&amp;K, O I $\lambda7774$, and the Ca II NIR triplet) all appear at a lower blueshift relative to a sample of low-$z$ SNe Ia. Together, these results suggest that SN Ia standardization remains robust at $z \approx 2$, and also highlight the importance of JWST spectroscopy for uncovering evolutionary effects that could impact Roman's high-precision cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New and updated timing models for seven young energetic X-ray pulsars, including the Big Glitcher PSR J0537-6910</a><span class="id">[2512.19800]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new timing models and update our previous ones for the rotational evolution of seven young energetic pulsars, including four of the top five in spin-down luminosity Edot among all known pulsars. For each of the six pulsars that were monitored on a regular basis by NICER, their rotation phase-connected timing model covers the entire period of NICER observations, in many cases from 2017-2025. For PSR J0058-7218, which was only identified in 2021, we extend the baseline of its timing model by 3 years and report detections of its first three glitches. The timing model for PSR J0537-6910 over the entire 8 years of NICER monitoring is presented, including a total of 23 glitches; we also report its spin frequency and pulsed spectrum from a 2016 NuSTAR observation. For PSR B0540-69, its complete timing model from 2015-2025 is provided, including a braking index evolution from near 0 to 1.6 during this period. The 8-year timing model for PSR J1412+7922 (also known as Calvera) is reported, which includes a position that is consistent with that measured from imaging. For PSR J1811-1925, we present its 3.5-year timing model. For PSR J1813-1749, its incoherent timing model is extended through early 2025 using new Chandra observations. For PSR J1849-0001, its 7-year timing model is provided, including a position that is consistent with and more accurate than its imaging position and its first glitch that is one of the largest ever measured. Our timing models of these seven X-ray pulsars enable their study at other energies and in gravitational wave data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19835" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VERITAS contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference</a><span class="id">[2512.19835]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Compilation of papers presented by the VERITAS Collaboration at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC), held July 14 through July 24, 2025 in Geneva, Switzerland.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19845" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The EUV Late-Phase: Statistical Results from 15 Years of Solar Dynamics Observatory Observations</a><span class="id">[2512.19845]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Since its launch in 2010, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has provided continuous high-cadence, multi-wavelength observations of the Sun, capturing thousands of solar flares and offering new insights into coronal dynamics. Among the discoveries enabled by SDO is the EUV late-phase (ELP), characterised by a secondary enhancement in warm coronal emission occurring tens of minutes after the main flare. While recent work has demonstrated the relevance of the ELP for space weather, its statistical behaviour and physical origin remain poorly constrained. Here, we present the most comprehensive review of the ELP to date, based on 15 years of Fe XVI observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard SDO (SDO/AIA). From a sample of 5335 isolated flares between 2010 and 2025, we identify and validate 467 ELP events. The overall ELP occurrence rate is 8 percent, with no significant dependence on the solar cycle and only a modest enhancement in the low-to-mid M-class range. The ELP typically exhibits and onset delay of 19 minutes, a peak-to-peak delay of 88 minutes, and a duration of 93 minutes. Strong correlations are found between ELP rise and decay rates (p=0.76), and between flare and ELP impulsivity (p=0.61), while no significant correlation is observed between flare and ELP phases. A Principal Component Analysis revealed three dominant axes of variation, corresponding to a timescale component, an energy-release intensity axis, and a partitioning of energy between the flare and ELP. These results suggest that ELP evolution is governed by both flare loop properties and reconnection-driven energetics, likely modulated by a finite magnetic energy budget, and highlight the importance of SDO's long-term observations for understanding flare evolution and the Sun-Earth connection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19862" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unfolding the Energy Spectrum of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays Using Pierre Auger Open Data</a><span class="id">[2512.19862]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We reconstruct the energy spectrum of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays using the publicly released Pierre Auger Observatory data set. Since event-level Monte Carlo truth information is not included in the open data, we develop a consistent procedure to regenerate a pseudo-Monte Carlo sample directly from the published quantities: the registered event counts $N$, the unfolded spectrum $N_\mathrm{corr}$, and the detector response matrix $R_{ij}$ from the Auger 2020 spectrum data analysis. Using the row-normalized response matrix and the published unfolded spectrum as a truth prior, we construct an absolute-level migration matrix and generate the event-by-event truth and reconstructed-level pairs by drawing from a two-dimensional probability distribution function. The resulting sample statistically replicates the detector response properties of the Pierre Auger Surface Detector. This pseudo-MC sample allows for the application of classical unfolding techniques (bin-by-bin and iterative Bayesian unfolding via RooUnfold) as well as a machine-learning-based unfolding using OmniFold. We demonstrate that using such publicly available information this approach allows the full unfolding procedure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19876" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Double-hump spectrum, pulse profile dip, and pulsed fraction spectra from the low-accretion regime in the X-ray pulsar MAXI J0655-013</a><span class="id">[2512.19876]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accreting X-ray pulsars (XRPs) undergo different physical regimes depending on the mass accretion rate. Recent observations have shown a dramatic change in the emission properties of this class of sources observed at low luminosity. We explore the timing and spectral properties of the XRP MAXI J0655-013 observed in the low-luminosity regime (about 5x$10^{33}$ erg/s) to witness the corresponding spectral shape and pulse profiles. We employ recent $XMM$ and $NuSTAR$ pointed observations of the MAXI J0655-013 X-ray activity during the low-luminosity stage. We explore several spectral models to fit the data and test theoretical expectations of the dramatic transition of the spectral shape. We study the pulsating nature of the source and find a phase-connected timing solution. We explore the energy-resolved pulse profiles and the derived energy-dependence of different pulsed fraction estimators ($PF_{minmax}$ and $PF_{rms}$). We also obtain $NuSTAR$ pulsed fraction spectra (PFS) at different luminosity regimes. MAXI J0655-013 spectrum is well fitted by a double Comptonization model, in agreement with recent observational results and theoretical expectations that explain the observed spectrum as being composed of two distinct bumps, each dominated by different polarization modes. We measure a spin period of $1081.86\pm0.02$ s, consistent with the source spinning-up compared to previous observations, yielding an upper limit for the magnetic field strength of B&lt;9x$10^{13}$ G. The pulse profiles show a single broad peak interrupted by a sharp dip that coincides with an increase in the hardness ratio. For the low-luminosity observation, the $PF_{minmax}$ increases with energy up to $\sim100\%$ in the 10-30 keV band, while the $PF_{rms}$ remains steady at $\sim60\%$. The PFS obtained at high luminosity shows evidence of an iron $K\alpha$ emission line but no indications of a cyclotron line.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19888" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational constraints on early time non-phantom behaviour of dynamical dark energy</a><span class="id">[2512.19888]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study dynamical dark energy models that allow for general late time behaviour while admitting non-phantom dynamics at early times, including thawing, scaling$+$thawing, and effective fluid extensions. Using current cosmological data, we find that the standard background parameters remain tightly constrained and stable across all models, indicating no significant impact of these dynamics on the late time expansion history. At low redshift, parametrizations with a time-dependent equation of state, particularly CPL, show a $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolution away from $w=-1$, driven by phantom-like behaviour. We then examine the observational consequences of allowing non-phantom dark energy at early times through scaling type dynamics. The data impose strong lower bounds on the steepness of the exponential potential $\gtrsim 20-30$, forcing the dark energy density to remain below the percent level around matter-radiation equality. Consequently, early dark energy is tightly constrained, and neither scaling nor tracker-type dynamics can produce a sufficiently large early dark energy component to alleviate the Hubble tension. While late time dynamical dark energy can improve the goodness of fit, the inclusion of early time scaling does not provide additional improvement and is strongly penalised by model selection criteria, leading to a disfavouring of such scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19892" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Superluminal Wave Activation at Relativistic Magnetized Shocks</a><span class="id">[2512.19892]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely energetic radio transients, some are generated in magnetar magnetospheres and winds. Despite a growing number of observations, their emission mechanisms remain elusive. It has recently been proposed that Alfvénic perturbations can convert into superluminal O-modes at magnetized shocks and propagate in the downstream as a radio signal. We validate this superluminal wave activation mechanism using pair-plasma theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Theory predicts two different downstream modes: non-propagating Alfvénic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency. Our simulations model both monochromatic upstream waves and broadband spectra with the downstream plasma frequency acting like a high-pass filter for superluminal O-modes. We discuss implications for FRB generation in relativistic magnetized winds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19907" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astrophysical constraints on the cold equation of state of the strongly interacting matter</a><span class="id">[2512.19907]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>At present, the only experimental access to the properties of cold, dense strongly interacting matter is provided by astrophysical observations. Neutron stars are the only known systems in the Universe that reach densities several times higher than normal nuclear density at nearly zero temperature, making them unique laboratories for studying dense matter. Since most neutron-star observables are sensitive to the equation of state (EOS), observational data place stringent constraints on the EOS of strongly interacting matter. In this work, we investigate constraints arising from the mass of the heaviest observed neutron star (a black widow pulsar), perturbative QCD calculations at asymptotically high densities, NICER mass-radius measurements, and the tidal deformability inferred from the binary neutron star merger GW170817. We parametrize the EOS and allow its parameters to vary freely, using observational data to constrain the admissible parameter space. We find that neutron-star observations significantly restrict the EOS of dense strongly interacting matter. While NICER has already provided measurements for five pulsars, the associated uncertainties remain relatively large. In contrast, the existence of very massive neutron stars and constraints on the tidal deformability emerge as particularly powerful probes of the EOS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19942" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observation of Large-Scale Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability Wave Driven by a Coronal Mass Ejection</a><span class="id">[2512.19942]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) can occur when there is a relative motion between two adjacent fluids. In the case of magnetized plasma, the shear velocity must exceed the local Alfvén speed for the instability to develop. The KHI produces nonlinear waves that eventually roll up into vortices and contribute to turbulence and dissipation. In the solar atmosphere KHI has been detected in coronal mass ejections (CMEs), jets, and prominences, mainly in the low corona. Only a few studies have reported the KHI in the upper corona, and its vortex development there has not been previously observed. We report the event with large-scale KHI waves observed from $\sim 6$ to 14 $R_{\odot}$ on 2024-Feb-16 using SOHO/LASCO and STEREO-A coronagraphs. KHI appeared during the passage of a fast CME and evolved into the nonlinear stage showing evidence of vortices. A closely timed subsequent CME in the same region has further developed the fully nonlinear KHI waves along its flank. We find that the radial speed of the CMEs exceeds the estimated local Alfven speed obtained from in-situ Parker Solar Probe (PSP) magnetic field data at perihelia. We propose that such events are rare because the fast CME created specific conditions favorable for instability growth in its trailing edge, including radial elongation of magnetic-field lines, reduced plasma density, and enhanced velocity and magnetic-field shear along the developing interface. The observed growth rate of KHI wave is in qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stable mass transfer in massive binaries leading to merging black holes</a><span class="id">[2512.20054]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The vast majority of massive binary systems in the universe is evidently unsuited to produce merging binary black holes. However, several narrow evolutionary paths of isolated massive binaries towards this goal have recently been identified. Due to the high degree of simplification and assumptions applied in previous modelling of these paths, conclusions remained vague so far. For one of these paths, the stable mass transfer channel, we now construct detailed binary evolution models which include internal differential rotation as well as mass and angular momentum transfer between the stars, all the way from the zero-age main sequence to the formation of the black holes, only skipping the rapid late burning stages. This allows us to follow the mass and chemical structure evolution of the mass accreting component, which turns out to have a key influence on the phase of reverse mass transfer, that allows the obtained black hole spins and mass ratios to naturally fall into the regime observed for the gravitational-wave source in the 10–25$M_\odot$ primary black hole mass range. As for this channel, also a large number of progenitor binaries are known, we conclude that it likely contributes to the observed population of gravitational wave sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20085" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling the Dual Nature of V1180 Cas: UXor-like Dips and EXor-like Bursts Across a Decade</a><span class="id">[2512.20085]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed analysis of the long-term photometric and spectroscopic evolution of V1180 Cas over a decade, aiming to identify the dominant mechanisms behind its variability. We combine multi-band light curves from 1999 to 2025 with over 30 epochs of optical to near-infrared spectroscopy (0.5-2.5 $\mu$m), analyzing variability patterns, color behavior, and emission line diagnostics. We investigate the temporal evolution of accretion and outflow indicators and their correlation with photometric states. The light curve reveals a transition from sporadic early dimming events to a quasi-periodic pattern since 2018, with eleven major dips showing asymmetry and stochastic sub-structure. Color-magnitude diagrams show classic UXor-like blueing during deep minima, while near-infrared and mid-infrared color changes indicate thermal evolution of disk. Spectroscopic analysis reveals persistent hydrogen, Ca II, He I, and forbidden line emission. Accretion diagnostics track photometric variability, and forbidden lines often intensify during dips, implying a physical link between extinction and outflows. Estimated accretion rates range from $\sim10^{-8}-10^{-7}$ $M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$; the outflow rate and density diagnostics are consistent with disk winds and shock-excited jets. V1180 Cas demonstrates dual-mode variability driven by both variable circumstellar extinction and episodic accretion events. The hybrid UXor/EXor behavior, combined with evolving disk signatures and persistent outflows, suggests a young stellar object undergoing coupled accretion-extinction-outflow evolution. Continued monitoring will be essential to fully resolve the physical processes shaping its variability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20087" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of dark companions via the combination of eclipse timing variation, Hipparcos and/or Gaia astrometry: the cases of V Puppis and CY Ari</a><span class="id">[2512.20087]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The third body is expected to shape the formation and evolution of close binary systems. In this work, we develop a method to detect and characterize the tertiary companion around eclipsing binaries through the combined analysis of eclipse timing variation, Hipparcos and/or Gaia astrometry. This method allows us to determine both the true mass and the inclination of the tertiary body that inferred from light-travel time effect. For the massive B-type binary V Pup, we do not confirm the previously reported 5.47-yr signal; instead, we identify a longer period of 14 yr. The orbital semi-major axis and mass of the outer body are revised to $a_C={17.88}_{-0.15}^{+0.15}$ au and $M_C={7.73}_{-0.14}^{+0.14}\,M_\odot$, confirming it as a promising stellar-mass black-hole candidate for further follow-up study. For the tertiary of the contact binary CY Ari, we obtain $P_C=5.406_{-0.016}^{+0.017}$ yr, $e_C=0.526_{-0.027}^{+0.032}$, $I_C={85.6}_{-6.5}^{+7.8}$$^\circ$, and a true mass of $M_C=0.640_{-0.029}^{+0.029}\,M_\odot$, supporting the white dwarf hypothesis proposed in previous study. The orbits of both systems are nearly edge-on ($I=90^{\circ}$), implying that they may form in a coplanar environment. We highlight the advantages of our method for detecting dark companions in binary and triple systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alfvénic solar wind intervals observed by Solar Orbiter: Exploiting the capability of the SWA plasma suite and source region investigation</a><span class="id">[2512.20098]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast and slow solar wind have distinct properties linked to their solar sources.Alfvénic slow wind complicates the usual speed-based classification, especially at intermediate speeds. Solar Orbiter's Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA) offers unique capabilities to investigate how Alfvénic slow wind differs from fast wind and relate these differences to their solar origins. In September 2022, Solar Orbiter observed several Alfvénic streams: one fast wind, three Alfvénic slow wind (AS1, AS2, AS3), and a moderate fast (FH) interval. We analyze these streams, combining plasma parameters from all SWA sensors with magnetic field measurements from the Magnetometer (MAG). A spectral analysis of magnetic and velocity fluctuations is used to characterize Alfvénicity. The magnetic connectivity of each stream to its solar source is examined using Potential Field Source Surface extrapolation combined with ballistic backmapping from the spacecraft. Proton velocity distribution functions show anisotropies and field-aligned beams characteristic of Alfvénic streams, while electron pitch-angle distributions reveal clear strahl populations. Oxygen and carbon charge-state ratios are low in fast wind but higher in AS1-AS3, consistent with slow wind origins. Magnetic connectivity suggests the fast wind originates from a large coronal hole; AS1 links to a pseudostreamer with high expansion factor; AS2, AS3, and FH connect to a negative-polarity coronal hole whose field lines cross a pseudostreamer that later dissipates. Spectral analysis indicates near energy equipartition in all intervals except AS2. The combined SWA observations offer key insights into the physical processes shaping Alfvénic solar wind streams. Our results reinforce that the simple fast/slow wind classification is inadequate for linking solar wind to sources, and suggest that Alfvénicity relates to the solar source conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Solirad (So) as a Convenient Unit for Quoting Astronomical Irradiances for Planetary Insolations and Exoplanetary Instellations</a><span class="id">[2512.20126]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Measurements of physical parameters for stars and (exo)planets are often quoted in units normalized to the Sun and/or Earth. The nominal total solar irradiance, ${S}^{\rm N}_{\odot}$, while based on a current best estimate with uncertainties, was adopted to be an exact reference value of 1361 W m$^{-2}$ by IAU 2015 Resolution B3, corresponding to “the mean total electromagnetic energy from the Sun, integrated over all wavelengths, incident per unit area per unit time at distance 1 au”. In the planetary and exoplanetary science literature, the units employed for “flux”, “insolation”, “instellation”, etc., are often cumbersome or inconsistent. To simplify the quoting of irradiance units for astronomical applications, we introduce the portmanteau solirad, short for solar irradiance, as an abbreviated version of the longer IAU term “nominal total solar irradiance”. The solirad (So) is a unit of irradiance, where 1 solirad = 1 So = 1361 W m$^{-2}$, equivalent to the IAU nominal total solar irradiance, and to an apparent bolometric magnitude of $m_{bol}$ = -26.832 mag (per IAU 2015 Resolution B2).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20132" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parity-odd Four-Point Correlation Function from DESI Data Release 1 Luminous Red Galaxy Sample</a><span class="id">[2512.20132]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The parity-odd four-point function provides a unique probe of fundamental symmetries and potential new physics in the large-scale structure of the Universe. We present measurements of the parity-odd four-point function using the DESI DR1 LRG sample and assess its detection significance. Our analysis considers both auto- and cross-correlations, using two complementary approaches to the covariance: (i) the full analytic covariance matrix applied to the uncompressed data vector, and (ii) a compressed data vector combined with a hybrid covariance matrix constructed from simulations and analytic estimates. When using the full analytic covariance matrix without corrections, we observe apparent auto-correlation signals with significance up to $4\sigma$. However, this excess is also consistent with a mismatch between the statistical fluctuations estimated from the simulations and those present in the real data. Our findings therefore suggest that the parity-odd signal in the current DESI DR1 LRG sample is consistent with zero. We note, however, that the low completeness of this sample may have a non-negligible impact on the detection sensitivity. Future data releases with improved completeness will be crucial for further investigation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abundance of cosmic voids in EFT of dark energy</a><span class="id">[2512.20171]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic voids in the large-scale structure are among the useful probes for testing gravity on cosmological scales. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of voids in the Horndeski theory using the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy. Modeling the void formation with the dynamics of spherical mass shells, we study how modifications of gravity encoded into the EFT of dark energy change the linearly extrapolated critical density contrast that is relevant for the criterion for void formation, with particular focus on the time-dependent parameter characterizing the effect of kinetic braiding. It is found that the change in the critical density contrast is one order of magnitude smaller than the dimensionless EFT parameter because of a slight imbalance between two compensating effects. We then compute the void abundance using the Sheth–van de Weygaert void size function and demonstrate that it exhibits scale-dependent modifications. It is shown that the modifications to the void size function on small scales are almost entirely determined by the modified linear matter power spectrum, while the modifications on large scales are dominated by the contributions from the linear matter spectrum and the critical density contrast.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of an optically thick shocked shell in the very fast nova V1674 Herculis: the origin of superbrightness</a><span class="id">[2512.20175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>V1674 Her is the fastest ($t_2\sim 1$ day) classical nova in our Galaxy and its absolute $V$ peak of $M_{V,\rm max}\sim -10.2$ is one magnitude brighter than typical very fast novae.

Using our fully self-consistent nova outburst model combined with the optically thick winds on a $1.35 ~M_\odot$ white dwarf (WD) with a mass accretion rate of $1\times 10^{-11} ~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, we have clarified that a strong reverse shock arises $0.3$ days after the outburst, which is just after the maximum expansion of the WD photosphere. The shocked shell is optically thick and expanding with the velocity of $\sim 3500$ km s$^{-1}$. Its $V$ brightness reaches maximum of $M_{V,\rm max}=-10.2$ when the shocked shell expands to $R_{\rm shell}\sim 300 ~R_\odot$ on day $\sim 0.7$. After that, the shocked shell turns to optically thin and becomes fainter than the brightness of free-free emission from the nova wind. In chronological order, the optical brightness of free-free emission reaches maximum of $M_V=-9$ on day 0.3. However, it is overtaken on day 0.5–0.7 by the $\sim$1 mag brighter luminosity of the optically thick shocked shell. The GeV gamma-ray flux reaches maximum on day 0.4 because the gamma-rays are emitted by the shock that arises on day 0.3. Our model consistently explains both the superbrightness and chronological order that the gamma-ray peak precedes substantially before the optical $V$ peak. We also present a similar light curve model for another superbright nova V1500 Cyg.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep learning-driven atmospheric parameter prediction for hot subdwarf stars with synthetic and observed spectra</a><span class="id">[2512.20185]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We design a convolutional neural network (CNN) incorporating channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms to predict atmospheric parameters of hot subdwarfs.

The trained deep learning models achieves mean absolute errors (AME) in predicting hot subdwarf atmospheric parameters of 730 K for effective temperature (Teff ), 0.09 dex for surface gravity (log g), and 0.03 dex for helium abundance (log(nHe/nH)), respectively, which reaches the accuracy of traditional spectral fitting methods. Utilizing the trained deep learning models and low-resolution spectra from LAMOST DR12, we confirm 1512 hot subdwarfs from the catalog of hot subdwarf candidates, of which 291 are newly identified. Our results demonstrate that the deep learning model not only achieves accuracy comparable to traditional methods in obtaining hot subdwarf atmospheric parameters, but also far exceeds them in speed and efficiency, making it particularly suitable for the analysis of large datasets of hot subdwarf spectra.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decay of $f(R)$ quintessence into dark matter: mitigating the Hubble tension?</a><span class="id">[2512.20193]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a revised cosmological scenario that extends the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) framework by incorporating metric $f(R)$ gravity in the Jordan frame. In this model, the dark energy component arises from a non-minimally coupled scalar field, decomposed into a smooth background (set to unity to recover General Relativity) and a rapidly varying, massive fluctuation that decays into the dark matter sector. In the near-GR limit, this setup provides a phenomenological extension of $\Lambda$CDM characterized by two additional parameters: the present-day value of the scalar fluctuation and a normalized decay rate. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of low-redshift cosmological data, comprising Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometer measurements, we find that the proposed model achieves a better overall fit than $\Lambda$CDM, while the Bayesian evidence remains statistically inconclusive given the inclusion of two extra parameters. The model predicts a moderate increase in the inferred value of $H_0$ and an improved consistency with DESI BAO data when adopting the SH0ES prior. Furthermore, describing dark matter particle creation as a transition phase in the late Universe offers an intriguing physical interpretation, potentially capturing features already present in current data and providing a promising avenue to explore extensions of the standard cosmological model within modified gravity frameworks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super-Eddington Accretion through a Multiwavelength Lens: Searching for Counterparts of Ultraluminous X-ray Sources</a><span class="id">[2512.20265]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) represent the closest and most accessible laboratories to study sustained super-Eddington accretion onto compact objects.

Despite the increasing number of available X-ray data and the significant progress in theoretical modeling and simulations, our understanding of ULXs remains incomplete. Key open questions include the nature and mass distribution of the compact objects, the type of the donor stars, the geometry of the accretion disc and its contribution to the observed broadband emission, the mechanisms responsible for the wide spectral and temporal phenomenology, the duration of the super-Eddington accretion phase and its feedback on the host-galaxy environment.

It is demonstrated via maps at the sample Fraunhofer lines within the band from 516.38 to 539.89nm, reconstructed from one set of spatially successive raster scanning data. The dataset was obtained from a spectrograph during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024, at Oden, Arkansas, USA. It is revealed from these maps that both the scattering and its spatial distribution depend on spectral lines, yielded from different ionization and excitation states of neutral metal atoms and ions. The distributions show asymmetry and feature of diffusion originated from the photosphere and chromosphere. Ratio of the Fraunhofer line depth to the continuum intensity evaluated over the observational band peaks at 0.25$\%$ and has an average of 0.32$\%$. More discrete and weaker diffusion of emission counterparts of some Fraunhofer lines are detected simultaneously. These properties are critically different from those owned by that F-corona yielded via dust grain scattering beyond heights of about two and half solar radii. Hence a term 'inner F-corona' is dubbed for the assembly of scattering by this new particle source. It becomes definite now that the solar corona consists of not only free electrons and ions but also much fewer yet non-negligible neutral atoms. It is emphasized that global distributions of the outward neutral atom fluxes and coronal magnetic loops can make the abnormal Cowling resistance the most primary mechanism responsible for the coronal heating, via collisions of the neutral atoms injected with ions in the coronal loops. This likes the heating process in Tokamak with neutral beam injection(NBI).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Spectrum of Cosmological Rips and Their Observational Signatures</a><span class="id">[2512.20383]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a unified dark energy framework capable of generating a continuous spectrum of cosmological “rip” scenarios – including the Big Rip, Grand Rip, Mild Rip, Little Rip, Little Sibling of the Big Rip, and the newly found Dollhouse Rip – while ensuring a physically consistent evolution across cosmic history. Building on earlier phenomenological proposals, we introduce a barotropic equation-of-state parameter with a sigmoid-like correction to guarantee a strictly positive dark energy density and to avoid early-time pathologies commonly present in previous models. Using this formulation, closed-form analytic expressions for the energy density can be obtained. This, in turn, enables a systematic classification of future singularities based on the signs and magnitudes of two key parameters of the model. We test these scenarios with state-of-the-art cosmological probes, including DESI DR2 BAO, cosmic chronometers, CMB compressed likelihoods, and the Pantheon+ supernovae sample. According to our Bayesian analysis, all rip scenarios yield best-fit parameters compatible with $\Lambda$CDM at the $1\sigma$ level, with Bayes factors weakly favoring $\Lambda$CDM. The mild, logarithmic evolution of the proposed dark energy density prevents current observations from distinguishing among the different future fates. We conclude that, for rip cosmologies to gain observational support over $\Lambda$CDM, they must display more accentuated late-time dynamical features – such as perhaps rapid transitions or a phantom-divide crossing – within the redshift range probed by present surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Cosmology to Cosmonomy</a><span class="id">[2512.20416]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For most of its history, cosmology was a qualitatively constrained discourse on the universe, shaped by limited observational access and the absence of global dynamical laws. This situation has changed decisively in recent decades. Modern cosmology is now driven by an unprecedented flow of high-precision data from a wide range of independent probes, including the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational lensing, cosmic chronometers, redshift-space distortions, gravitational-wave standard sirens, and emerging 21-cm observations, among others. This observational wealth is matched by a concrete theoretical and mathematical framework, based on general relativity, which provides the dynamical equations governing the evolution of spacetime and matter at cosmic scales. Combined with explicit background and perturbative equations, this framework enables quantitative, predictive, and falsifiable descriptions of cosmic evolution. Thus, cosmology operates today as a nomological natural science of the observable universe, characterized by general laws, predictive power, and systematic empirical testing. We argue that this epistemic transformation motivates a corresponding conceptual shift, directly analogous to the historical transition from astrology to astronomy. In this sense, the transition from cosmology to \emph{cosmonomy} should begin to be discussed among cosmologists, or, more precisely, among cosmonomers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Indian Pulsar Timing Array Data Release 2: II.

We model various stochastic noise sources present in the dataset using stationary Gaussian processes and estimate the noise budget of the InPTA-DR2 using Bayesian inference, involving model selection, Fourier harmonics selection, and parameter estimation for each pulsar. We check the efficacy of our noise characterisation by performing the Anderson-Darling test for Gaussianity on the noise-subtracted residuals. We find that all 11 pulsars with time baseline $\lesssim2.5\,\text{yr}$ show Gaussian residuals and do not have evidence for any red noise process in the optimal model, except for PSR J1944$+$0907, which shows presence of DM noise. PSRs J0437$-$4715, J1909$-$3744 and J1939$+$2134 show preference for the most complicated noise model, having achromatic and chromatic red noise processes. Only 4 out of 15 pulsars with time baseline $\gtrsim2.5\,\text{yr}$ show significant non-Gaussianity in noise-subtracted residuals. We suspect that this may require more advanced methods to model noise processes properly. A comparative study of six pulsars with data removed near solar conjunctions showed deviations from the parameter estimates obtained with the original dataset, indicating potential bias in red noise processes due to unmodeled solar-wind effects. The results presented in this work remain broadly consistent with the InPTA-DR1 noise budget, with better constraints obtained on noise processes for several pulsars and support for achromatic red noise in PSR J1012$+$5307 due to the extended time baseline.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sensitivity of PUEO to Cosmogenic Neutrinos and Exotic Physics Scenarios</a><span class="id">[2512.20594]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Several observatories designed to detect ultrahigh-energy neutrinos are planned for the next decade.

In this work, we assess the scientific reach of PUEO. In particular, we evaluate the sensitivity of this observatory to cosmogenic neutrinos and, in turn, to the proton fraction of the ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray spectrum. We also consider the potential of PUEO to probe scenarios in which neutrinos are produced through the decays of ultraheavy dark matter particles or are radiated from cosmic strings. We find that PUEO will be able to constrain the proton composition of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays in scenarios that feature very strong source evolution and in which protons are accelerated to extremely high energies. Although gamma-ray observations are generally more sensitive to decaying particles than neutrino observations, PUEO is expected to set the strongest neutrino-detector constraints above 10^19 eV. PUEO will also provide the strongest constraints on some models of cosmic strings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Dark Energy models in light of the latest observations</a><span class="id">[2512.20616]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we study several models and parameterizations of dynamical dark energy (DE) that have been studied already in the past, in conjunction with the recently proposed model $w$XCDM, the running vacuum model (RVM) with and without a threshold at $z=1$ and two variants of it, the RRVM and the “flipped RVM”, and compare them all with the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model and the popular $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization. We use two standard sets of cosmological data, one including distant supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and the other from DES-Y5. The rest of the data (BAO from DESI DR2 and CMB from Planck PR4) are shared by the two sets. They are analyzed with the help of \texttt{CLASS}. No structure formation data are utilized for this analysis and no use is made of the SH0ES calibration of $H_0$. Even so, we find that the flipped RVM and to a lesser extent the $w$XCDM and the RVM with threshold, point to significant evidence of dynamical DE, at a level comparable to $w_0w_a$CDM, more conspicuously for the dataset that involves DES-Y5 observations. We also find that while more traditional models studied in the past, in which there is an exchange between vacuum energy and cold dark matter (through e.g. an interactive source proportional either to the density of dark matter or to that of vacuum) still hint at dynamical DE, the strength of the statistical signal (which we assess through information criteria and other estimators) is nevertheless less pronounced.

It is often said that both types of mass cannot be distinguished in neutrino oscillation phenomena. This is in fact not true if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac (strictly speaking still Majorana) where they mix almost maximally with sterile neutrinos to form pseudo-Dirac pairs. If this is indeed realized in Nature, what we observe experimentally as three mass eigenstates are actually three pairs of mass eigenstates with yet-to-be-measured new mass splitting among each pair. While the new mass squared splitting of the first and second mass eigenstates have stringent constraints from solar neutrino to be $|\delta m_{1,2}^2| \lesssim10^{-11}\,\textrm{eV}^{2}$, the one regarding the third mass eigenstate has a weaker constraint $|\delta m_3^2| \lesssim10^{-5}\,\textrm{eV}^{2}$. By keeping only one nonzero pseudo-Dirac mass squared splitting at a time, we derive an effective 3+1 description for the pseudo-Dirac scenario. Then we use the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraint on neutrino relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\textrm{eff}}$ to derive a new constraint $|\delta m_3^2| &lt; 2 \times 10^{-6}\,{\rm eV}^2$ and show that the future CMB-S4 and CMB-HD can improve this bound by an order of magnitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19793" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time-dependent flux backgrounds in type IIB supergravity</a><span class="id">[2512.19793]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analytically construct families of type IIB supergravity backgrounds in ten dimensions in which the four-dimensional metric is time dependent, while the six-dimensional internal space is an arbitrary compact Calabi-Yau manifold (with no restriction on holonomy) up to an overall time-dependent scale factor.

The stability of these configurations is assessed through their dynamical evolution using a fully non-linear relativistic code. For stable configurations, we compute the oscillation spectrum and identify the fundamental mode frequency. We found that, while the isotropic and Horvat models become unstable close to the maximum-mass point, the Bowers-Liang and Covariant models become unstable at lower central densities, indicating that the standard turning-point criterion may not reliably predict the onset of dynamical instability in anisotropic stars. Based on our results, we also determine the neutral-stability line and verify that configurations lying to the right of this line are indeed unstable under radial perturbations and collapse. Overall, given an equation of state, pressure anisotropy can increase the maximum mass of an stable configuration by up to  30 % compared to the isotropic case. It also allows for more compact stable configurations that may collapse on longer timescales once they become unstable. Finally, we show that these compact stars could initially mimic a black hole's gravitational-wave ringdown. However, the production of subsequent echoes is not guaranteed by high compactness; instead, it depends critically on the star's specific internal structure and equation of state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dissipative cosmology with $Λ$ from the first law of thermodynamics</a><span class="id">[2512.19911]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We phenomenologically derive a cosmological model that includes both a cosmological constant term $\Lambda/3$ and a dissipative driving term $\beta (2 H^{2} + \dot{H})$ by applying the first law of thermodynamics to matter creation cosmology.

Both models face challenges, including explaining the nature of dark matter, the origin of the Universe's initial conditions, and the fine-tuning of the Higgs boson mass. This thesis investigates the cosmological implications of spontaneous symmetry breaking to address some of these issues, focusing on theories with a non-trivial vacuum structure. We introduce a novel class of elementary scalars called ”accidents”, which emerge as accidentally flat directions in the vacuum manifold: unlike Nambu-Goldstone boson directions, accident directions are not related to any symmetry. Radiative corrections induce a mass for the accidents that is one-loop suppressed with respect to naive expectations, making them naturally light. We propose that accidents can act as viable dark matter candidates, and as the inflaton driving cosmic inflation. We construct a model of hybrid inflation in which the inflaton potential is an accident direction and is naturally flat. In models of accident inflation where the vacuum manifold has a non-trivial topology, cosmic strings and domain walls form after the end of inflation. Such topological defects generate a stochastic background of gravitational waves. Finally, we investigate the cosmological production of dark magnetic monopoles. Focusing on 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles from SO(3)$\rightarrow$SO(2) symmetry breaking, we explore both second-order and first-order phase transitions, and we identify the regions of parameter space where the monopole relic density matches the one of dark matter. This model also features stable massive gauge bosons. We find that the relic density of dark gauge bosons is always far larger than the one of monopoles, concluding that dark monopoles cannot constitute a sizeable fraction of dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-equilibrium Quantum Field Theory and Axion Electrodynamics in curved spacetimes</a><span class="id">[2512.20521]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axions are hypothetical pseudoscalar particles introduced initially as a solution to the Strong CP problem in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and they also arise naturally in a broad class of low-energy compactifications of string theory.

These topics address the production of axions and their associated topological defects in the early Universe, as well as the interactions of axions with Standard Model particles. The analysis combines methods from non-equilibrium quantum field theory and quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. After reviewing the foundations of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and cosmology, the thesis introduces the Strong CP problem and the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, including the PQWW axion model and its invisible extensions. Ultraviolet completions of QCD axion theories are discussed in both field-theoretic and extra-dimensional frameworks. A significant part of the thesis is devoted to axion electrodynamics, where a classical axion background modifies Maxwell's equations and electromagnetic observables. The non-equilibrium dynamics of self-interacting axion fields coupled to the Standard Model or to a dark sector are also studied using the two-particle-irreducible effective action, and applied to pre- and post-inflationary cosmological scenarios, yielding new insights and preliminary constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20592" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signatures of High-Frequency Gravitational Waves in Electromagnetic Cavities</a><span class="id">[2512.20592]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Similar to axions, gravitational waves (GW) can induce oscillating electromagnetic fields inside electromagnetic cavities.

Finally, I conclude with the suggestion that more than one mechanism may be operating in concert with each other and propose various avenues for future progress in understanding these objects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05364" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Young Supernova Selection Pipeline For The LSST Era</a><span class="id">[2412.05364]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Early-time spectroscopy of supernovae (SNe), acquired within days of explosion, yields crucial insights into their outermost ejecta layers, facilitating the study of their environments, progenitor systems, and explosion mechanisms. Recent efforts in early discovery and follow-up of SNe have shown the potential insights that can be gained from early-time spectra. Surveys such as the Time-Domain Extragalactic Survey (TiDES), conducted with the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST), will provide spectroscopic follow-up of transients discovered by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Current simulations indicate that early-time spectroscopic studies conducted with TiDES data will be limited by the current SN selection criteria. To enhance early-time SN spectroscopic studies from TiDES-like surveys, we propose a set of selection criteria focusing on young SNe (YSNe), which we define as SNe prior to -10 days before peak brightness. Utilising the Zwicky Transient Facility transient alerts, we developed criteria to select YSNe while minimising the sample's contamination rate to 23 percent. The developed criteria were applied to LSST simulations, yielding a sample of 694 Deep Drilling Field survey SNe and 56,260 Wide Fast Deep survey SNe for follow-up. We demonstrate that our criteria enables the selection of SNe at early-times, enhancing future early-time spectroscopic SN studies from TiDES-like surveys. Finally, we investigated 4MOST-like observing strategies to increase the sample of spectroscopically observed YSNe. We propose that a 4MOST-like observing strategy that follows LSST with a delay of 3 days is optimal for a TiDES-like SN survey in terms of the number of classifiable spectra obtained, while a 1 day delay is most optimal for enhancing the early-time science in conjunction with our YSN selection criteria.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Dynamical Dark Energy Necessary?

This discrepancy has been cited as evidence for dynamical dark energy (DDE). Given the profound implications of DDE for fundamental physics, we explore whether the tension can instead be resolved by modifying the physics of recombination. We find that a phenomenological model of modified recombination can effectively reconcile the BAO and CMB datasets and, unlike DDE, also predicts a higher Hubble constant $H_0$, thereby partially alleviating the Hubble tension. A global fit to BAO, CMB, and calibrated SN data favors modified recombination over DDE.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from self-resonant preheating in $α$-attractor models</a><span class="id">[2504.17602]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>After the inflationary phase, the universe enters the preheating phase, during which the inflaton field rolls down its potential and oscillates. When the potential significantly deviates from a parabolic shape at its minimum, these oscillations trigger an instability in the scalar perturbations, leading to their amplification. This phenomenon, known as self-resonance, has important implications in cosmology. Notably, since scalar perturbations couple to tensor perturbations at second order in the equations of motion, this amplification results in the production of Gravitational Waves (GWs), referred to as Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs). In this study, we investigate the production of SIGWs during the preheating phase for a class of inflationary models known as $\alpha$-attractors, characterized by a single parameter $\alpha$. We focus on small values of this parameter, specifically $\alpha \sim O(10^{-1} - 10^{-4})$, where the self-resonance effect is particularly pronounced. We obtain lower bounds on this parameter, $\log_{10}(\alpha)&gt;-3.54$ for the T-model and $\log_{10}(\alpha)&gt;-3.17$ for the E-model, based on the energy density of SIGWs constrained by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which ultimately translates into lower bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r&gt;9.61\times10^{-7}$ for the T-model and $r&gt;2.25\times10^{-6}$ for the E-model. Note that these bounds on $\alpha$ and $r$ are derived within the linear framework of tensor fluctuations at the level of equations of motion, which nevertheless include scalar-scalar-tensor interactions with metric and matter fields. However, fully non-linear approaches, with all higher-order metric fluctuations, would be needed in the future to further validate these conclusions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lense-Thirring Precession Modulates Repeated Lensing of Continues Gravitational Wave Source from AGN Disks</a><span class="id">[2506.04196]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) offers a novel observational channel that complements traditional electromagnetic approaches and provides unique insights into the astrophysical environments of GW sources. In this work, we investigate the repeated lensing of continuous gravitational wave (CW) sources in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks by central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), focusing on the imprint of SMBH spin via the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect. Although typically weak and challenging to observe, the spin-induced precession of source orbits can accumulate over time, thereby modulating the lensing geometry. Such modulations influence the magnification, duration, and waveform structure of each repeated lensing event, and enhance the overall probability of lensing occurrences. Using matched filtering, we demonstrate that spin-dependent signatures may be detectable, suggesting that lensed CW signals could serve as an indirect probe of SMBH spin in AGNs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bispectrum of Intrinsic Alignments: II.

We show that their multipoles with respect to the line of sight can be accurately described by a tree-level perturbation theory model on large scales ($k\lesssim 0.11\,h$/Mpc) at $z=0$. For these scales and in a simulation volume of 1 (Gpc/$h)^3$, we detect the bispectrum monopole $B_{\delta\delta E}^{00}$ at SNR $\sim 30$ and the two quadrupoles $B_{\delta \delta E}^{11}$ and $B_{\delta \delta E}^{20}$ at SNR $\sim 25$ and SNR $\sim 15$, respectively. We also report similar SNR for the lowest order multipoles of $B_{\delta EE}$ and $B_{EEE}$, although these are largely driven by stochastic contributions. We show that the first and second order EFT parameters are consistent with those obtained from fitting the IA power spectrum analysis at next-to-leading order, without requiring any priors to break degeneracies for the quadratic bias parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of higher multipole moments of $B_{\delta\delta E}$ greatly reduces the errors on second order bias parameters, by factors of 5 or more. The IA bispectrum thus provides an effective means of determining higher order shape bias parameters, thereby characterizing the scale dependence of the IA signal. We also detect parity-odd bispectra such as $B_{\delta \delta B}$ and $B_{\delta EB}$ at $\sim 10 \sigma$ significance or more for $k&lt;0.15\,h$/Mpc and they are consistent with the parity-even sector. Furthermore, we check that the Gaussian covariance approximation works reasonably well on the scales we consider here. These results lay the groundwork for using the bispectrum of IA in cosmological analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating FRB 20240114A with FAST: Morphological Classification and Drifting Rate Measurements in a Burst-Cluster Framework</a><span class="id">[2507.14711]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study investigates the morphological classification and drifting rate measurement of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB20240114A using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST).

During a continuous 15,780-second monitoring session on March 12, 2024, 3,203 bursts (2,109 burst-clusters) were detected. We refine the definitions of sub-bursts, bursts, and burst-clusters. Using an average dispersion measure (DM) of 529.2 pc cm$^{-3}$, burst-clusters were classified into Downward Drifting, Upward Drifting, No Drifting, No Evidence for Drifting, Not-Clear, and Complex categories. Notably, 233 (23.82%) of the 978 drifting burst-clusters showed upward drifting. Excluding 142 upward drifting single-component clusters, the remaining 91 upward drifting double- or multiple-components clusters account for 10.89% of the drifting sample. Further restricting to those with consecutive time intervals, only 9 upward drifting bursts remain. An inverse correlation is found between drifting rate and sub-burst effective width. Upward drifting single-component clusters tend to have smaller effective widths, bandwidths, and fluxes than downward drifting ones. For these upward drifting clusters, drifting rate increases with peak frequency. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test reveals longer consecutive intervals in upward drifting clusters compared to downward ones, suggesting differing underlying mechanisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of 3D macro physics and nuclear physics on the p nuclei in O-C shell mergers</a><span class="id">[2507.16965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>O-C shell mergers in massive stars are a site for producing the p nuclei by the $\gamma$ process, but 1D stellar models rely on mixing length theory, which does not match the radial velocity profiles of 3D hydrodynamic simulations.

We post-process the O-shell of the $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, $Z = 0.02$ model from the NuGrid stellar data set. Applying a downturn to velocities at the boundary and increasing velocities across the shell as obtained in previous results, we find non-linear, non-monotonic increase in p-nuclei production with a spread of 0.96 dex, and find that isotopic ratios can change. Reducing C-shell ingestion rates as found in 3D simulations suppresses production, with spreads of 1.22-1.84 dex across MLT and downturn scenarios. Applying dips to the diffusion profile to mimic quenching events also suppresses production, with a 0.51 dex spread. We analyze the impact of varying all photo-disintegration rates of unstable n-deficient isotopes from Se-Po by a factor of 10 up and down. The nuclear physics variations for the MLT and downturn cases have a spread of 0.56-0.78 dex. We also provide which reaction rates are correlated with the p nuclei, and find few correlations shared between mixing scenarios.

We point out the similarity of the rings in the Cir X-1 CCSN remnant to a ring in the Cygnus Loop CCSN remnant. While the X-ray binary system Cir X-1 actively launches jets, no such activity exists in the Cygnus Loop. In both CCSN remnants, we attribute the rings to jets associated with the explosion process, within the framework of the jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We also identify such a ring in the CCSN remnant 107.7-5.1, which we also attribute to exploding jets. We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of late jets inside an exploding massive stellar core, and demonstrate the feasibility of this scenario for ring formation. The Cir X-1 CCSN remnant has a large blowout, similar to that of the Cygnus Loop and to a large protrusion in the CCSN remnant G0.9+0.1. Based on these similarities, we suggest that other exploding jets inflated the blowout of the Cir X-1 nebula, consistent with an earlier claim regarding the formation of the blowout of the Cygnus Loop. We identify a point-symmetric structure in the Cir X-1 CCSN remnant, strengthening the JJEM. This study further demonstrates that the JJEM is a successful explosion mechanism to analyze CCSNe and CCSN remnants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hurst Index of Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curves and Its Statistical Study</a><span class="id">[2509.11631]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) rank among the most powerful astrophysical phenomena, characterized by complex and highly variable prompt emission light curves that reflect the dynamics of their central engines.

We further explore statistical correlations between the Hurst index and 12 other observational parameters through regression and correlation analyses. Our results reveal anti-correlations between the Hurst index and the burst durations (T50, T90), and moderate positive correlations with peak photon flux proxies (P_{pk1}–P_{pk3}). In contrast, correlations between the Hurst index and standard spectral parameters (including the low-energy index \alpha) are weak in our sample. We do not find a clear monotonic weakening of the correlation strength from 64 ms to 1024 ms peak-flux measures; rather, the correlation coefficients for P_{pk1}–P_{pk3} are comparable within uncertainties. The results offer new perspectives on the temporal structure of the GRB emission and its potential link to the underlying physical mechanisms driving these bursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmographic Footprints of Dynamical Dark Energy</a><span class="id">[2509.16196]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a novel cosmographic framework to trace the late-time kinematics of the Universe without assuming any underlying dynamics. The method relies on generalized Padé-$(2,1)$ expansions around arbitrary pivot redshifts, which, compared to state-of-the-art calculations, reduce truncation errors by up to two orders of magnitude at high redshift and yield more precise constraints by defining cosmographic parameters exactly where the data lie. This avoids extrapolations, mitigates degeneracies, and enables a clean disentangling of their effects. Using the latest low-redshift datasets, we center the generalized expansion in multiple bins across $z\in[0,1]$ and obtain precise constraints on the redshift evolution of cosmographic parameters. We find that all key parameters deviate from their $\Lambda$CDM predictions in a redshift-dependent way that can be naturally explained within dynamical Dark Energy scenarios. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ follows a redshift evolution consistent with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization, while the generalized $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows deviations of up to $\sim4\sigma$ from the constant $\Lambda$CDM expectation, closely matching the CPL predictions. Taken together, these results point to footprints of dynamical Dark Energy in the kinematics of the Universe at $z\lesssim 1$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can GRB 250702B be explained as the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole?

Its properties include possible periodicity in its gamma-ray light curve, an X-ray counterpart that rose prior to the gamma-ray outbursts and faded quickly, and radio and infrared counterparts. These features are difficult to reconcile with most models of high energy transients but we show that they are compatible with a white dwarf bound to an intermediate mass black hole that is tidally stripped over multiple pericentre passages before being fully disrupted. Accretion onto the black hole powers a mildly relativistic jet that produces the X-rays through internal processes and the infrared and radio counterparts through thermal emission and external shocks respectively but is unable to produce the gamma-ray emission on its own. We propose that chaotic debris streams from the multiple stripping episodes can collide with a period roughly the same as the orbital period of the star. These shocks produce hard X-ray photons that are upscattered by the jet to produce the observed MeV gamma-ray emission. Future analysis of the jet properties will allow us to place firmer constraints on our model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23406" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How clear are the skies of WASP-80b?: 3D Cloud feedback on the atmosphere and spectra of the warm Jupiter</a><span class="id">[2509.23406]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Close-in warm Jupiters orbiting M-dwarf stars are expected to exhibit diverse atmospheric chemistry, with clouds playing a key role in shaping their albedo, heat distribution, and spectral properties. We study WASP-80b, a warm Jupiter orbiting an M-dwarf star, using the latest JWST panchromatic emission and transmission spectra to comprehensively characterise its atmosphere, including cloud coverage, chemical composition, and particle sizes, and compare the observations with predictions from the General Circulation Models (GCM). We use a GCM, ADAM (ADvanced Atmospheric MITgcm, formerly known as SPARC/MITgcm), combined with the latest JWST data to study the atmosphere of WASP-80b. A cloud module with radiatively active, tracer-based clouds is integrated with the GCM to study the effects on the atmosphere and the spectrum. Our results indicate that both emission and transmission spectra of WASP-80b are best reproduced by cloudless GCMs or by atmospheres containing large cloud particles ($\geq 10~\mu$m for Na$_2$S, $\geq 1~\mu$m for KCl, and $\geq 5~\mu$m for MgSiO$_3$), with smaller particles ruled out due to their strong radiative feedback. These findings emphasize the importance of particle size and composition in interpreting exoplanet atmospheric spectra and showcase the power of global modelling in constraining cloud properties. Among the expected clouds to form in WASP-80b, we show that only Na$_2$S clouds forming particles larger than 10 $\mu m$, KCl clouds larger than 1 $\mu m$, or MgSiO$_3$ clouds with particles larger than $5 \mu m$ can be compatible with the apparently cloudless emission and transmission spectra. Observations at shorter wavelengths in both emission and transmission could further distinguish between these cloudy scenarios and a truly cloudless atmosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A fast powerful X-ray transient from possible tidal disruption of a white dwarf</a><span class="id">[2509.25877]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stars captured by black holes (BHs) can be torn apart by strong tidal forces, producing electromagnetic flares. To date, more than 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been observed, each involving invariably normal gaseous stars whose debris falls onto the BH, sustaining the flares over years. White dwarfs (WDs), which are the most prevalent compact stars and a million times denser–and therefore tougher–than gaseous stars, can only be disrupted by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of 10^2–10^5 solar masses. WD-TDEs are considered to generate more powerful and short-lived flares, but their evidence has been lacking. Here we report observations of a fast and luminous X-ray transient EP250702a detected by Einstein Probe. Its one-day-long X-ray peak as luminous as 10^(47-49) erg/s showed strong recurrent flares with hard spectra extending to several tens of MeV gamma-rays, as detected by Fermi/GBM and Konus-Wind, indicating relativistic jet emission. The jet's X-ray dropped sharply from 3 x 10^49 erg/s to around 10^44 erg/s within 20 days (10 days in the source rest frame). These characteristics are inconsistent with any known transient phenomena other than a jetted-TDE evolving over an unprecedentedly short timescale, indicating the disruption of a WD by an IMBH. At late times, a new soft component progressively dominates the X-ray spectrum, exhibiting an extreme super-Eddington luminosity, which possibly originates from an accretion disc. WD-TDEs open a new window for investigating the elusive IMBHs and their surrounding stellar environments, and they are prime sources of gravitational waves in the band of space-based interferometers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Observations of SN 2024ggi II: NIRSpec Spectroscopy and CO Modeling at 285 and 385 Days Past the Explosion</a><span class="id">[2510.09600]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec observations of SN 2024ggi, spanning wavelengths of 1.7–5.5 micron at +285.51 and +385.27 days post-explosion. These nebular spectra are dominated by asymmetric emission lines from atomic species including H, Ca, Ar, C, Mg, Ni, Co, and Fe, indicative of an aspherical explosion. The other strong features are molecular CO vibrational bands from the fundamental and first overtone. We introduce a novel, data-driven approach using non-LTE 3D radiative transfer simulations to model the CO emission with high fidelity. This method enables us to constrain the three-dimensional CO distribution and its radial temperature structure. CO formation is found to occur prior to day +285, with subsequent evolution characterized by progressive evaporation. The CO mass decreases from approximately 8.7 to 1.3*E-3 Mo, while the average temperature drops from about 2900 K to 2500 K. Concurrently, the CO distribution transitions from nearly homogeneous to highly clumped (density contrast increasing from fc=1.2 to 2). The minimum velocity of the CO-emitting region remains nearly constant (v1 = 1200 to 1100 km/s), significantly above the receding photosphere velocity (v(ph) = 500 km/s), suggesting the photosphere resides within Si-rich layers. However, the temperature profile indicates that only a narrow zone reaches the conditions necessary for SiO formation. Due to a lack of observational constraints, SiO clumping is not modeled, and thus, synthetic SiO profiles for mass estimates are not highlighted. We discuss the implications of these findings for dust formation processes in SN 2024ggi.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Holes from Primordial Voids</a><span class="id">[2510.11611]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a compelling dark matter candidate and a unique probe of small-scale cosmological fluctuations.

The results suggest a preference for dark energy to be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. Several recent analyses of DESI data indicate that the universe's expansion may not be accelerating in the way suggested by supernova based cosmology. Motivated by these studies, we investigated a tachyon type scalar field $\phi$ as a model for dark energy, assuming an exponential potential for the field and performed parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Such a model offers solutions that have $w \sim -1$ and are decelerating without requiring a phantom like equation of state. The present day value of the equation of state parameter is treated as a free parameter; however, for the reference model, we fix its present value to $-1$. The analysis is carried out using the latest Supernovae dataset (Pantheon+) and BAO measurements from DESI. The results show that both types of datasets consistently predict a turnaround in the equation of state, regardless of whether $w_{\phi 0}$ is treated as a free parameter or fixed to $-1$. The corresponding deceleration parameter also exhibits a future turnaround for both datasets when $w_{\phi 0}$ is free. However, in the reference model with $w_{\phi 0} = -1$, the deceleration parameter instead approaches $-1$ asymptotically. A model comparison using the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria shows that the Pantheon+ dataset favors the free $w_{\phi 0}$ scenario, while BAO observations prefer the $w_{\phi 0} = -1$ case. This indicates a disagreement in the future evolution trends predicted by the two datasets within the tachyon type dark energy model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17705" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pre-supernova O-C shell mergers could produce more $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ than the explosion</a><span class="id">[2512.17705]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formation of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ in massive stars is thought to occur during explosive nucleosynthesis, however recent studies have shown it can be produced during O-C shell mergers prior to core collapse.

We discuss the conformal invariance of the MHD equations for a radiation-dominated fluid and different types of scaling of the fluid variables that are relevant for other equations of state when the bulk velocity is subrelativistic. In particular, we review the super-comoving coordinates that scale the time coordinate with the Universe expansion, and present a particular choice that allows the equations to become conformally flat for any choice of the equation of state. Imperfect relativistic fluids are briefly described but their detailed study is not included in this work. We review the propagation of sound waves, Alfvén waves, and magnetosonic waves in the early Universe plasma. The Boris correction for relativistic Alfvén speeds is presented and adapted for early Universe applications. This review is an extension, including new results, of part of the lectures presented at the minicourse “Simulations of Early Universe Magnetohydrodynamics” lectured by A. Roper Pol and J. Schober at EPFL, as part of the six-week program “Generation, evolution, and observations of cosmological magnetic fields” at the Bernoulli Center in May 2024.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14686" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective field theory reproducing the MOND phenomenology based on a non-Abelian Yang-Mills graviphoton</a><span class="id">[2502.14686]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Motivated by the phenomenology of MOND, we propose a theory based on a fundamental non Abelian Yang-Mills gauge field with gravitational coupling constant (a &quot;graviphoton&quot;) emerging in a regime of weak acceleration, i.e. below the MOND acceleration scale. Using the formalism of the effective field theory and invoking a mechanism of gravitational polarization of the dark matter medium, we show that generic solutions of this theory reproduce the deep MOND limit without having to introduce in an ad hoc way an arbitrary function in the action. In this framework, MOND is due to the existence of a new sector of the standard model of particle physics. Furthermore, the model involves a violation of the local Lorentz invariance in the low acceleration regime. We show how to restore the general covariance of the model by adding one gravitational degree of freedom in the form of the scalar Khronon field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multifaceted Supercooling: From PTA to LIGO</a><span class="id">[2506.21397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supercooled phase transitions, as predicted, e.g., in near-conformal and confining extensions of the Standard Model (SM), are established sources of strong stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). In this work, we investigate another facet of such transitions: their significant and largely uncharted impact on gravitational wave spectra originating from independent cosmological sources. Focusing on gravitational waves produced by a metastable cosmic string network, we show that an intervening supercooled phase, initiating thermal inflation, can reshape and suppress the high-frequency part of the spectrum. This mechanism reopens regions of string parameter space previously excluded by LIGO's null results, while remaining compatible with the nanohertz SGWB signal reported by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The resulting total spectrum typically exhibits a dual-component structure, sourced by both string decay and the phase transition itself, rendering the scenario observationally distinctive. We systematically classify the viable parameter space and identify regions accessible to upcoming detectors such as Advanced LIGO, LISA, and ET.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decay and lifetime of oscillons coupled to an external scalar field: Insights from instability band analysis</a><span class="id">[2507.13276]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Oscillons are long-lived, spherically symmetric solitons that can arise in real scalar field theories with potentials shallower than quadratic ones. They are considered to form via parametric resonance during the preheating stage after inflation and have extended lifetimes. However, the estimation of their lifespan becomes complicated when taking into account the interactions between the inflaton field and other fields, as naturally expected in realistic reheating scenarios. In this study, we investigate how the lifetime of a single oscillon is affected by the coupling to the external real scalar field. By numerically computing the instability bands of the external field with the inhomogeneous oscillon profile as background, we show that the resonance behavior depends intricately on the coupling strength and shape of the oscillon. We analyze distinct instability mechanisms that dominate across different regimes of the coupling strength and oscillon shapes. Especially, we show that the parametric resonance fails to occur when the oscillon size is too limited to drive enhancement of the external field. Furthermore, our simulations show that as the oscillon loses energy, the exponential growth of the external field can terminate before the oscillon reaches its critical energy for collapse, which indicates that the external field does not necessarily lead to rapid destruction of oscillons even in the presence of strong coupling or with large amplitudes. These results suggest that oscillons can remain long-lived across a wide range of coupling strengths, with potential implications for their role in cosmological evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vacuum breakdown around a Kerr black hole surrounded by a magnetic field</a><span class="id">[2510.23886]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the invariant characterization of the region where vacuum breakdown into electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pairs occurs due to an overcritical electric field, the dyadoregion, in the case of a Kerr black hole (BH) in the presence of an external, asymptotically uniform test magnetic field aligned with the BH rotation axis, using the Wald solution. We calculate the dyadoregion morphology, the electromagnetic energy available to the pairs, the pair-creation rate, the pair number density, the average energy per pair, and the pair energy density and pressure.

After reviewing the LL reduction and its removal of runaway and preacceleration behavior, we verify energy balance in several relativistic single-particle scenarios by demonstrating agreement between the LL Larmor power and the loss of mechanical energy. We then construct an N-body framework based on the conservative Darwin Hamiltonian supplemented with the leading 1.5PN radiation–reaction term. Numerical simulations of charge-neutral binary systems of both symmetric and asymmetric mass configurations show orbital decay, circularization, and monotonic Hamiltonian decrease consistent with dipole radiative losses. The resulting framework provides a simple analogue of gravitational PN radiation reaction and a tractable system for studying dissipative and potentially chaotic electromagnetic dynamics.</p></div></details></article></body>
