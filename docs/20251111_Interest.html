<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contemporary Perspectivism as a Framework of Scientific Inquiry in Quantum Mechanics and Beyond</a><span class="id">[2511.05504]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Contemporary perspectivism is viewed as a framework of scientific inquiry concerning the origin, generation and systematization of scientific knowledge of nature by focusing on the conditions under which such knowledge may arise in perspectivist terms and investigating the essential ramifications of these conditions. To this end, we develop the conceptual, methodological and semantic framework of contemporary perspectivism according to the norms of the proposed endo-theoretic approach. Implementation of the preceding three-fold scheme in quantum mechanics implies that the global structure of a quantum algebra of events can be consistently comprehended through a multilevel structure of locally variable Boolean perspectives, interconnected in a category-theoretic environment, yielding jointly all the information encoded in the former. In this respect, the proposed approach validates the perspectivist/contextual nature of quantum mechanics at a fundamental level of discourse. Furthermore, due to its general character, it may acquire the form of a theoretical pattern of scientific inquiry in the natural sciences, especially when dealing with complex trans-perspectival phenomena, the analysis of which requires the use of information resulting from more than one perspective. Finally, in the appendix, we provide a concise comparative assessment between our perspectivist framework of quantum theory and Rovelli's relational interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nearly forgotten results in development of physical cosmology</a><span class="id">[2511.06018]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It would be reasonable to recall some critical issues in physical cosmology development. GR was created by A. Einstein in 1915. In 1917 Einstein proposed the first (static) cosmological model. Soon after the A. Eddington proved that the model is unstable therefore it can not be realizable in nature. In 1922 and 1924 A. A. Friedmann found non-stationary solutions for cosmological equations written in the framework of GR. In 1927 G. Lemaitre obtained very similar results and, in addition, he derived the Hubble law (E. Hubble obtained this law from observations). Unfortunately, G. Lemaitre published his paper in not very popular Belgium journal. In 1931 Lemaitre proposed the first version of hot Universe model (he called it hypothesis of the primeval atom). In his book Lemaitre predicted even a background radiation as a signature of his model. One of the important property of the Lemaitre – Gamow model was a prediction of CMB radiation with a temperature around a few K. It was recalled that the discovery of CMB radiation was done by T. Shmaonov in 1956 and his paper was published in 1957 (several years before Penzias and Wilson). In 1965, 1970 E. B. Gliner proposed vacuum like equation of matter which could correspond to exponential explosion of the Universe which was later called inflation. For decades in USSR, Friedmann's cosmological non-stationary models were treated as purely mathematical results without cosmologocal applications. On September 16, 1925 passed away untimely and it would be reasonable to remind today his great contribution in physical cosmology since the authors of book on Friedmann wrote that &quot;similarly to Copernicus who forced the Earth to move Friedmann forced the Universe to expand&quot;.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A computational framework for evaluating an edge-integrated, multi-ramp construction model of the Great Pyramid of Giza</a><span class="id">[2511.06112]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Despite decades of study, a quantitative, integrated framework to evaluate minutescale throughput, geometric control, and a zero external footprint for Khufu's pyramid has been lacking. We test the Integrated Edge-Ramp (IER) model-a helical path formed by omitting and backfilling perimeter courses-using a unified, end-to-end pipeline coupling parametric geometry, discrete-event logistics, and staged finite-element analysis (FEA). An adaptive multiramp strategy can sustain 4-6-minute dispatches and yields a median on-site duration of 13.8-20.6 years (95% CI); including quarrying, river transport, and seasonal pauses gives 20-27 years. FEA indicates that stresses and settlements remain within plausible limits for Old Kingdom limestone under self-weight. The model's geometry is also consistent with internal voids identified by muon imaging (a hypothesis-generating result). The IER helps reconcile throughput, survey access, and zero-footprint closure, and produces falsifiable predictions (edge-fill signatures, corner wear). Our study provides a transferable, open-data/code framework for testing construction hypotheses for ancient megastructures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06444" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander Dalgarno and the development of astrochemistry</a><span class="id">[2511.06444]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The interdisciplinary field of astrochemistry arose during the 1970s as observations in previously unexplored parts of the electromagnetic spectrum began to reveal the extent of a molecular component of interstellar matter with a surprisingly rich chemistry. Astrochemistry expanded further in order to explain the role of atomic and molecular processes in a broad range of phenomena in the universe. It is instructive to describe the current scope of astrochemistry using the career and accomplishments of Alexander Dalgarno as an organizing principle. Dalgarno helped to establish a self-sustaining community of astrochemists around the world. His own research interests highlight the early development of astrochemistry and anticipate much of its later evolution. His theoretical investigations of fundamental atomic and molecular processes lie at the heart of the subject.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Geometric View of Theories</a><span class="id">[2511.07015]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent critiques of the semantic conception of scientific theories suggest that a theory is not best formulated as a collection of models satisfying some set of kinematical or dynamical conditions. Thus it has been argued that additional structure on the set of models is required. Furthermore, there are calls for developing a 'theory of theories', where what was formerly a 'theory' is seen as a 'model' within a larger theoretical structure. This paper makes a two-pronged proposal for the &quot;shape&quot; that physical theories should take, based on recent insights on dualities and quasi-dualities in physics. First, I develop a geometric view of theories, according to which a physical theory is a set of models with topological and geometric structure on it. This general view is briefly illustrated in an example from quantum cosmology. Second, I make a more specific proposal for a natural structure that can encompass various 'theories' as its models, with topological and algebraic-geometric structure on them. I call the latter more specific structure a 'model bundle', where the models are in the fibres and there is a moduli space in the base. I illustrate my second proposal in the Seiberg-Witten theory (Seiberg and Witten, 1994a,b), where the moduli space is the complex plane with three punctures, the states and quantities are in the fibres, and the modular group is the structure group that acts on the fibres. This view highlights the important role of quasi-dualities as local transition functions between fibres; dualities are recovered as global transition functions when the bundle is trivial. I discuss some philosophical issues that this geometric view of physical theories opens up, such as its realist interpretation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum-Like Correlations from Local Hidden-Variable Theories Under Conservation Law</a><span class="id">[2511.06043]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The precision with which we can measure operators that do not commute with conserved quantities is limited by the need to preserve the associated global symmetries. We show how to construct a local hidden-variable model that violates Bell inequalities by interpreting this measurement error as altering the measure space of the hidden variables. This provides a physically-motivated example of a supermeasured model, where the statistical independence assumption used to form Bell inequalities is violated without there being a causal dependence of the measurement settings on the hidden variables (superdeterminism) or a causal dependence of the hidden variables on the measurement settings (retrocausality). The model also gives subtly different predictions to quantum mechanics, that could be tested experimentally.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sufficiency of the counterfactual account of Lüders' rule to rule out ontological models of quantum mechanics</a><span class="id">[2502.15615]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ontological models, as used in the generalised contextuality literature, play a central role in current research on quantum foundations, providing a framework for defining classicality, constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena, and examining the ontology of quantum states. In this work, we show that a counterfactual account of Lüders' rule – which we argue is naturally implied by the mathematical structure of the rule itself – renders such models inherently incompatible with the quantum formalism. This incompatibility arises because the counterfactual update requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn which in turn renders predictions of sequential measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given (this, typically implicitly-assumed account of) quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05754" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Niñas Atómicas&quot; (Atomic Girls): An initiative that generates opportunities for young girls in STEM</a><span class="id">[2511.05754]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on an initiative that seeks to encourage high school girls to develop critical thinking and transferable skills widely used in scientific work, as well as to generate a concrete space of opportunities for girls to experience how real science is done. Our &quot;Niñas Atómicas&quot; workshop combines the teaching of particle physics, electronics, programming and scientific methodology through building and operating a dedicated experiment: a muon counter. Girls from all over Chile can apply to this workshop, where every year they are guided by female scientists for two weeks. We report on the contents and methodology of our workshop and provide details on how to build the muon detector counter experiment. We report results on muon flux and proper lifetime, two muon properties which can be extracted from the data collected by the girls with the muon detectors they built themselves. Insights into the girl's experiences during the 2024 and 2025 editions of the workshop are also detailed, with the aim to contribute to the wider physics education research and outreach communities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18537" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 2017 Merrimack College Mobile Lightboard: Personalized Office-Based Lightboarding on a Shared Mobile Board</a><span class="id">[2509.18537]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present and evaluate the Merrimack College Mobile Lightboard, which we built in 2017 and which is still in use in 2025. Our design was closely based on that of the groundbreaking 2014 Duke University Lightboard but with a smaller glass pane, 5 feet wide instead of 6 feet wide. The resulting scaled-down board is small enough to move in and out of individual faculty offices, but large enough to make detailed videos. An updated construction cost estimate is provided, and recent upgrades are briefly discussed. We believe that personalized office-based lightboarding represents an attractive option for many faculty members, with strengths that complement those of centralized installations. Our successful build suggests that this option is technically and financially feasible at many if not most higher education institutions.</p></div></details></article></body>
