A natural step in extending inference pipelines to other summary statistics is to include higher order N-point correlation functions (NPCFs), which are computationally expensive and difficult to model. At the same time it is unclear how many NPCFs one would have to include to reasonably exhaust the cosmological information in the observable fields. An efficient alternative is given by learned and optimized summary statistics, largely driven by overparametrization through neural networks. This, however, largely abandons our physical intuition on the NPCF formalism and information extraction becomes opaque to the practitioner. We design a simulation-based inference pipeline, that not only benefits from the efficiency of machine learned summaries through optimization, but also holds on to the NPCF program. We employ the heavily constrained Cosmological Correlator Convolutional Neural Network (C3NN) which extracts summary statistics that can be directly linked to a given order NPCF. We present an application of our framework to simulated lensing convergence maps and study the information content of our learned summary at various orders in NPCFs for this idealized example. We view our approach as an exciting new avenue for physics-informed simulation-based inference.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16769" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Eccentric Protoplanetary Disks I – How Eccentric are Planet-Perturbed Disks?</a><span class="id">[2602.16769]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Protoplanetary disks can become eccentric when planets open deep gaps within, but how eccentric are they? We answer this question by analyzing two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interaction. The steady state eccentricity of the outer disk (outside of the planet's orbit) is described as a balance between eccentricity excitation by the 1:3 eccentric Lindblad resonance and eccentricity damping by gas pressure. This eccentricity scales with $q(\frac{h_p}{r_p})^{(-1)}(\frac{r_{gap}}{r_p})^{(a-\frac{b}{2}-2)}$, where $q$ is the planet-to-star mass ratio, $\frac{h_p}{r_p}$ is the disk aspect ratio, $\frac{r_{gap}}{r_p}$ is the radial position of the outer gap edge divided by the planet's position, and $a$ and $b$ are the negative exponents in the disk's surface density and temperature power law profiles, respectively. We derive a semi-analytic eccentricity profile that agrees with numerical simulations to within 30%. Our result is a first step to quantitatively interpret observations of eccentric protoplanetary disks, such as MWC 758, HD 142527, IRS 48, and CI Tau.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A positive period derivative in the quasi-periodic eruptions of ZTF19acnskyy</a><span class="id">[2602.16776]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the first direct measurement of the period derivative in a quasi-periodic eruption (QPE), finding a smoothly increasing period with $\dot{P}\approx (1.7\pm 0.02)\times10^{-2}$ d d$^{-1}$ in the source ZTF19acnskyy/&quot;Ansky&quot;. Most models for QPEs invoke repeated interactions of a stellar-mass orbiting companion around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In these scenarios, a positive $\dot{P}$ is surprising, but not impossible to produce. We explore several possible explanations for the observed $\dot{P}$, including stable mass-transfer driven by impulsive mass loss events in an EMRI, velocity kicks at pericenter due to tidal interactions with the SMBH, apparent period changes due either to general relativistic precession effects in an EMRI or light travel-time delays in a hierarchical SMBH binary, and mass-transfer variations in a thermal/viscous disk instability model. We find that none of the considered models provides a complete explanation for the data, motivating further work on physical explanations for positive period derivatives in QPEs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bridging Solar and Stellar Physics: Role of SDO in Understanding Stellar Active Regions and Atmospheric Heating</a><span class="id">[2602.16779]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The solar-stellar connection provides a unique framework for understanding magnetic activity and atmospheric heating across a broad spectrum of stars. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) of NASA, equipped with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, and Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment, has enabled detailed Sun-as-a-star studies that bridge solar and stellar physics. Integrating spatially resolved solar observations into disk-integrated datasets, these studies provide insights into magnetic activity occurring in distant stars. This review highlights key results from recent analyses that employed all three SDO instruments to characterize active regions, quantify universal heating relationships, and reconstruct stellar X-ray and ultraviolet spectra. We discuss how these findings advance our understanding of stellar magnetic activity, provide predictive tools for exoplanetary environments, and outline future directions for applying solar-based frameworks to diverse stellar populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaia24ccy: An outburst followed the footsteps of its predecessor</a><span class="id">[2602.16791]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accretion-driven outbursts in young stellar objects remain poorly understood, largely limited by a statistically small sample of closely followed-up events. This underscores the importance of a thorough exploration of each outbursting object. We studied a peculiar outbursting system, Gaia24ccy, which exhibited two $\Delta g \sim$ 3.8 mag outbursts in 2019 and 2024. The system consists of two unresolved, nearly identical, and rapidly rotating young stars: Gaia24ccy A (1.1419 days) and Gaia24ccy B (1.7898 days). Periodogram analyses just before the onset of the outbursts suggest Gaia24ccy B to be the outbursting component. Unlike any previously known EXor sources, the two outburst profiles show a very similar evolution: both rose at the same rate for the first 15 days, followed by many 'sub-bursts' on the timescale of 10-20 days. The 2019 outburst lasted 145-255 days, while the 2024 outburst persisted for 367 days. We infer the unstable region to lie at $r_{\rm trigger} \simeq 0.019-0.047$ au ($\sim5-12.3 R_\star$). The accreted mass per event $M_{\rm acc}\sim10^{-5} M_\odot$ can be provided by a compact inner-disk reservoir. The photometric rise/decay timescales and the mid-infrared color evolution favor a thermal-viscous trigger in a hot inner disk, while the appearance of rich emission-line spectra indicates concurrent magnetospheric compression - together best described by a hybrid picture. Finally, we explain the reddening of the mid-infrared color observed during the outburst as a consequence of the competing emission from the viscous disk and the photosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sign-Switching of the Cosmological Constant</a><span class="id">[2602.16795]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose and investigate a class of dynamical dark energy models in which the cosmological constant evolves from negative values in the early Universe to a positive value at low redshifts. This framework includes a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as smooth-transition scenarios, providing a unified description of sign-changing cosmological constants. We analyse the theoretical construction and background dynamics of these models using cosmographic diagnostics. Extending this study to the linear perturbation regime, we solve the perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era with adiabatic initial conditions. We examine the evolution of the matter density contrast, gravitational potential, and the $f\sigma_8$ observable. Our results are compared against the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and confronted with current observational data, illustrating the phenomenological viability of sign-changing dark energy models and revealing distinctive imprints on cosmic structure formation arising from the transition of the cosmological constant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using EUV driven external photoevaporation to test viscous evolution of protoplanetary discs</a><span class="id">[2602.16801]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Protoplanetary discs are thought to evolve either through angular momentum transport driven by viscous processes or through angular momentum removal induced by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds. One proposed method to distinguish between these two evolutionary pathways is by comparing mass accretion rates and disc sizes, but observational constraints complicate this distinction. In this study, we investigate how extreme ultraviolet (EUV) external photoevaporation affects the evolution of protoplanetary discs, particularly in environments such as the Orion Nebula Cluster. Using a combination of analytical derivations and 1D numerical simulations, we explore the impact of externally induced mass-loss on disc structure and accretion dynamics. We demonstrate that, in the viscous scenario, there exists a clear, near one-to-one correlation between the mass-loss rate due to external photoevaporative outflows and the mass accretion rate onto the central star. In contrast, MHD wind-driven discs do not exhibit such trend, leading to a distinct evolutionary path. External photoevaporative mass-loss rates and mass accretion rates can both be accurately measured for a population of discs, without a strong model dependence. Thus, our findings provide a robust observational test to distinguish between viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution, offering a new approach to constraining angular momentum transport mechanisms in protoplanetary discs. Applying this diagnostic observationally requires joint measurements of $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ and $\dot{M}_{\rm pe}$ for the same objects, which are currently scarce in bright HII regions due to contamination and sensitivity limitations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational Signatures of Circumstellar Gas Tori Formed by Planetary Mass-Loss from Close-In Exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2602.16816]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Close-in exoplanets with H/He atmospheres often undergo hydrodynamic escape. In extreme cases, it is hypothesized that the mass loss can be high enough for the escaping planetary material to wrap around the star, forming a long-lasting circumstellar torus. In this work, we develop a physical model of such circumstellar tori and use a ray tracing scheme to calculate the attenuation of stellar light passing through them. We show that the presence of a circumstellar torus significantly increases the equivalent width of the observed stellar He I 10830 Å line. When combined with observations of the star's Ca II H &amp; K lines, these systems can typically be distinguished from field stars. Based on these results, we propose a survey of stars hosting close-in planets, combining observations of the He I 10830 Å and Ca II H &amp; K lines to search for circumstellar tori generated from planetary mass-loss in these systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating IceCube Neutrino Alerts with the HAWC $γ$-Ray Observatory</a><span class="id">[2602.16818]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutrino emission from astrophysical sources has long been considered a signature of cosmic-ray acceleration. The IceCube neutrino observatory has observed a diffuse flux of TeV-PeV neutrinos, but very few confirmed sources have emerged. With the recent publication of IceCube Event Catalog (IceCat-1), IceCube has released a list of the most promising astrophysical neutrino events since May 2011. Using the archival data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) $\gamma$-ray observatory, we perform a coincidence search for gamma rays and neutrinos using a Bayesian Block algorithm with the public IceCube alerts from IceCat-1, along with additional alerts issued later. In this work, we consider 368 alerts, up to July 8, 2025, that are within HAWC's field of view. We observe approximately a 5\% coincident detection rate, which is consistent with expectations from background. Two of these detections contain the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) Markarian 421 and Markarian 501. We discuss the likelihood that the neutrino/$\gamma$-ray coincidences are false positives and a brief overview of the results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16845" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asteroidal activity amongst meteor datasets: Confirmed new &quot;rock-comet&quot; stream and search for a tidal disruption signature</a><span class="id">[2602.16845]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Asteroid activity (e.g., thermo-mechanical breakdown, impacts, rotational shedding, tidal disruption, etc.) can inject meteoroids into near-Earth space and leave detectable signatures in orbit catalogs. We searched for such recent signatures using orbit-similarity statistics and explicit null-hypothesis testing applied to shower-removed, asteroidal video-meteor datasets. Our sample comprises 235{,}271 meteors and fireballs from four all-sky video networks (GMN, CAMS, EDMOND, and SonotaCo). For meteors we use the geocentric dissimilarity criterion $D_N$ and construct KDE-based sporadic null realizations to evaluate (i) global cumulative similarity distributions and (ii) localized $D_N$-conditioned ($D_N&lt;0.015$) pair-excess maps in the $(U,\lambda_\odot)$ plane; we additionally apply DBSCAN ($\epsilon=0.03$, $\mathrm{min\_samples}=2$) to isolate the coherent, statistically significant structures. We find no survey-consistent, stream-like signature in the Earth-like, low-inclination region expected for a distinct \emph{recent} tidal-disruption family; instead, significant-bin membership implies, under our adopted detection thresholds and binning, a conservative combined upper limit of $\leq 53/235{,}271$ ($\leq 2.3\times10^{-4}$) for sporadic asteroidal meteors plausibly attributable to a detectable recent tidal-disruption-like contribution. In contrast, we confirm the detection of a new diffuse southern Virginid-region stream: GMN exhibits a local z-score of 6.32 relative to the KDE-null mean in the $U-\lambda_\odot$ phase space (global significance of 5.3 $\sigma$), with weaker supporting excess in SonotaCo and EDMOND. DBSCAN isolates $N=282$ members (243 GMN plus additional SonotaCo, CAMS, and EDMOND) on a low-perihelion, asteroidal orbit ($q=0.22\pm0.01$ au, $i=12.3^{\circ}\pm1.8^{\circ}$, $T_J=4.6\pm0.3$) consistent with near-Sun thermo-mechanical “rock-comet” activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the cosmic distance-duality relation with localized fast radio bursts: a cosmological model-independent study</a><span class="id">[2602.16869]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We test the Etherington cosmic distance-duality relation (CDDR), by comparing Type Ia supernova (SNIa) luminosity-distance information from the Pantheon+ compilation with an angular-diameter-distance reconstructed from localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The core of our methodology is a data-driven reconstruction from FRBs using artificial neural networks (ANNs): we infer a smooth mean extragalactic dispersion-measure relation and use its redshift derivative to recover $H(z)$ and hence $D_\mathrm{A}^{\rm FRB}(z)$ without assuming a parametric form for the expansion history. Possible deviations from CDDR are parameterized through three one-parameter models of $\eta(z)\equiv D_\mathrm{L}/[(1+z)^2D_\mathrm{A}]$. We implement two complementary likelihoods: (i) a direct approach using individual SNIa with the full Pantheon+ covariance, and (ii) a machine-learning approach in which we reconstruct the SN Hubble diagram on the FRB redshift grid, propagating SN and FRB uncertainties into non-diagonal covariance matrices via Monte Carlo and bootstrap realizations. Within the FRB reconstruction, we anchor the mean extragalactic dispersion measure at $z=0$, which yields a data-driven constraint on the average host/near-source contribution $\mathrm{DM}_{\rm host}=128.8\pm 34.1\,\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$ ($3\sigma$ of statistical confidence). We find that both likelihood implementations give consistent posteriors and no statistically significant evidence for departures from CDDR at the current precision.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Theory of striped dynamic spectra of the Crab pulsar high-frequency interpulse</a><span class="id">[2602.16955]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A theory of the spectral &quot;zebra&quot; pattern of the Crab pulsar's high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) radio emission is developed. The observed emission bands are interference maxima caused by multiple ray propagation through the pulsar magnetosphere. The high-contrast interference pattern is the combined effect of gravitational lensing and plasma de-lensing of light rays. The model enables space-resolved tomography of the pulsar magnetosphere, yielding a radial plasma density profile of $n_{e}\propto r^{-3}$, which agrees with theoretical insights. We predict the zebra pattern trend to change at a higher frequency when the ray separation becomes smaller than the pulsar size. This frequency is predicted to be in the range between 42 GHz and 650 GHz, which is within the reach of existing facilities like ALMA and SMA. These observations hold significant importance and would contribute to our understanding of the magnetosphere. Furthermore, they offer the potential to investigate gravity in the strong field regime near the star's surface.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflationary Reheating to Preheating - A Personal Account</a><span class="id">[2602.16963]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This is a personal account of the early work that led to what is now known as the “preheating stage&quot; of inflationary cosmology.

The CME was tracked using a combination of white light and extreme ultraviolet observations of the solar corona taken by three instruments: GOES-SUVI, two coronagraphs of the SOHO-LASCO, together with ground-based radio observations between 10-240 MHz from I-LOFAR. The radial distances of the radio sources were examined using a series of density models, with both PFSS and MHD models used to examine the coronal plasma conditions. Four type II bursts were identified in the I$-$LOFAR radio dynamic spectrum over $\sim$15 minutes, exhibiting features such as band splitting, herringbones, and fragmentation. The shocks were found to have speeds ranging between $\sim$443$-$2075 km s$^{-1}$, with drift rates of $\sim-$361 to -78 kHz s$^{-1}$. The shocks were found to have a $M_A \approx$ 3.21$-$3.57. indicating that they were super-Alfvénic. The first type II burst was triggered $\sim$18 minutes after the CME launch, with each burst appearing to have been generated at a different height in the corona. Analysis of the derived kinematics and modelling results suggests that the type II bursts were likely produced at the shoulders of the CME near the flanks, where open magnetic field lines and relatively low Alfvén speeds facilitated shock formation. This multi-instrument study shows that multiple type II bursts from a single CME originated at different coronal heights, with modelling indicating their generation near the CME flanks, where low Alfvén speeds and open magnetic field lines facilitated shock formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kuiper Belt Formation via Grainy Planetary Migration</a><span class="id">[2602.16999]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We used N-body simulations to model the 4.5 Gyr orbital evolution of the early Kuiper Belt, incorporating a massive protoplanetary disk, the four giant planets, and 1500 primordial Pluto-class bodies (&quot;Plutos&quot;) that drove Neptune's grainy migration. The analysis of 67 simulated systems revealed key insights: (1) All systems featured the primary trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations: cold/hot classical, resonant, scattered, and detached; (2) Captures into stable resonant orbits favored close Neptunian mean motion resonances (MMRs; e.g., 3:2, 2:1), while distant ones beyond 50 au (e.g., 5:2 MMR) were underpopulated; (3) Optimal matches to observed resonant fractions and the classical region (including the kernel) arose from models considering a jumping Neptune, self-gravitating Plutos, and an initial disk edge at 45-47 au; (4) Models including primordial scattered disks boosted distant MMR captures but overproduced scattered objects; (5) All models were inefficient at producing the detached (q &gt; 40 au) and high-i (i &gt; 45 deg) populations and failed to populate observed niches, such as distant detached (a &gt; 245 au), low-i detached (i &lt; 20 deg), low-i scattered with q = 37-40 au (i &lt; 20 deg), and extreme (q &gt; 50 au or i &gt; 50 deg) TNOs; (6) Grainy migration effects peaked early, fading as the Plutos were removed; (7) With a few primordial Plutos surviving inside 50 au, the initial population was estimated at  150-500 to explain Pluto's solitary status. Although our four-giant-planet models reasonably replicate the trans-Neptunian structure within 50 au, they fail to account for detached, high-i, and extreme TNOs. Additional processes (e.g., a distant undiscovered planet) are required for a comprehensive outer solar system framework.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illuminating the Mass Gap Through Deep Optical Constraint on a Neutron Star Merger Candidate S250206dm</a><span class="id">[2602.17267]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The gravitational wave (GW) event S250206dm, as the first well-localized neutron star merger candidate potentially located in the mass gap, presented a unique opportunity to probe the electromagnetic signatures from such a system. Here we report a deep, multiband search with the new 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), covering about 64% of the localization region up to a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of 23 mag. In total, 12 potential candidates have been identified while none of them are likely related to S250206dm. This non-detection provides the most stringent constraint to date on any associated kilonova. Crucially, an AT 2017gfo-like event at 269 Mpc can be excluded by WFST observations alone. Based on ejecta mass limits, a neutron star-black hole with a large mass ratio (Q &gt;= 3.2) is disfavored. This optical-derived constraint on the mass ratio reaches, for the first time, a precision comparable to that inferred from the GW signal. This work presents the best observation of this type of events until now, and demonstrates the power of rapid, deep follow-up observations to constrain the properties of compact binary progenitors, offering key insights into the constituents of the mass gap.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WFST Supernovae in the First Year: I.

The discovery magnitude of the 16 WFST-PS early-phase SNe is at least 3 mag fainter than their peak brightness. A large scatter of color indices is found in approximately the first 10 days of supernova explosions, indicating diverse photometric behaviors in the early phase. Three EExSNe Ia show relatively brighter peak luminosities and longer rise time compared to those of non-EExSNe Ia. The results indicate that current theoretical models require further refinement to fully capture the early photometric evolution of SNe Ia.

SN 2024aedt: Systematical Study of a Transitional Type Ia Supernova</a><span class="id">[2602.17269]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of a transitional type Ia SN 2024aedt, discovered by the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) within one day of the explosion. Its light curve is characterized by a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -18.49 \pm 0.03$ mag and a decline rate of $\Delta m_{15}(B) = 1.53 \pm 0.36$ mag, placing the object on the $\Delta m_{15}(B)$–$M_B$ diagram in the transition region between normal and subluminous SNe Ia. Furthermore, the early-color evolution and host galaxy environment of SN 2024aedt underscore its transitional nature, sharing properties with both normal and 91bg-like SNe Ia. Light-curve modeling with MOSFiT yields a synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mass of $0.414 \pm 0.042\,M_{\odot}$ and a total ejecta mass of $0.548 \pm 0.108\,M_{\odot}$. A comparison with theoretical models suggests that the evolutionary trend can be broadly explained by both delayed-detonation (DDT) and double-detonation (DDet) scenarios while possible early-excess emissions predicted by DDet cannot be identified given the limited detections soon after the SN explosion. Although the overall spectral evolution of SN 2024aedt is similar to that of other transitional SNe Ia, the spectroscopic comparison reveals diversity in the early-phase blue-end features, which becomes more homogeneous at later phases. The result indicates the importance of early-time observations in understanding the origin of SN Ia diversity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WFST Supernovae in the First Year: III.

By jointly employing an analytic early shock-cooling model and the Arnett radioactive-diffusion model, we fit the bolometric light curves and infer ejecta masses in the range $1.1$-$2.6 M_\odot$, consistent with a transitional population between ultra-stripped supernovae (USSNe) and normal stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe). The envelope masses are estimated to be $M_{\rm env}=0.1$-$0.4 M_\odot$, while the progenitors are constrained to be yellow or blue supergiants (YSGs/BSGs) with radii of $R=120$-$300 R_\odot$. Using empirical relations, we estimate progenitor luminosities of $L=10^{4.6}$-$10^{4.9} L_\odot$, corresponding to zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses of $8$-$20 M_\odot$. Theoretical models suggest that such progenitors are more naturally produced through binary evolution channels, as single-star evolutionary pathways are unable to yield ejecta masses this low.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17367" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Collective Trigger for Widespread Planetesimal Formation Revealed by Accretion Ages</a><span class="id">[2602.17367]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formation of planetesimals was an integral part of the cascading series of processes that built the terrestrial planets. To illuminate planetesimal formation, here we develop a refined thermal evolution model to calculate the formation ages of meteorite parent planetesimals. This model includes chemical reactions and phase changes during heating, as well as natural variations in the proportions of the constituent phases of these planetesimals. We find that the parent bodies of non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) iron meteorites start forming at very similar times ( 0.95 Myr after calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion [CAI] formation) and occupy overlapping time windows. NC and CC chondrite parent bodies formed later during non-overlapping periods. We combine these ages with proportions of isotopic end-members we recover from mixing models to construct records of motion throughout the protoplanetary disk. These records argue that NC and CC material traversed the barrier in the disk after  0.95 Myr after CAI formation. The onset of this motion coincided with planetesimal formation, indicating that the phenomenon that drove motion also triggered planetesimal formation. We argue that this feature also served as the semi-permeable barrier in the disk. Although its identity is uncertain, the effects this phenomenon had on the timing of planetesimal formation and motion through the disk can now serve as constraints on models of disk evolution. Models that reproduce these effects would elucidate the nature and implications of this phenomenon, which is key to unlocking a holistic model of terrestrial planet building.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytical modeling of helium absorption signals of isothermal atmospheric escape</a><span class="id">[2602.17408]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Atmospheric escape driven by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation is a critical process shaping the evolution of close-in exoplanets. Recent observations have detected helium triplet absorption in numerous (&gt;20) close-in exoplanets, highlighting the importance of understanding upper atmospheric thermo-chemical structure. While super-solar metallicity has been observed in the atmospheres of some close-in exoplanets, the impact of metal species on both atmospheric escape dynamics and observed absorption features remains poorly understood. In this study, we derive a simplified yet accurate formula for the equivalent width of helium absorption in the limit of an isothermal temperature for the upper atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that planets with lower temperature (metal-rich atmosphere) exhibit lower mass-loss rate although the equivalent width of helium triplet absorption remains largely independent of atmospheric temperature (metallicity) because the low temperatures in these atmospheres enhance the fraction of helium in its triplet state. Additionally, we present a hydrodynamic model based on radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that incorporates the effects of metal cooling. Our analytical model can predict the helium triplet equivalent width of the atmosphere of simulations. The analytical model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how metal cooling in the upper atmosphere influences the thermo-chemical structure and observable helium features of close-in exoplanetary atmospheres, offering valuable insights for interpreting current and future observational data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delivery of complex organic molecules to the system of Jupiter</a><span class="id">[2602.17441]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Complex organic molecules are key markers of molecular diversity, and their formation conditions in protoplanetary disks remain an active area of research. These molecules have been detected on a variety of celestial bodies, including icy moons, and may play a crucial role in shaping the current composition of the Galilean moons. Experimental studies suggest that their formation could result from UV irradiation or thermal processing of NH3:CO2 ices. In this context, we investigate the formation of complex organic molecules in the protosolar nebula and their subsequent transport to the Jupiter system region. Lagrangian transport and irradiation simulations of 500 individual particles are performed using a two-dimensional disk evolution model. Based on experiments with UV irradiation and thermal processing of CO2:NH3 ice, this model allows us to estimate the estimate the potential for the formation of complex organic molecules through these processes. Almost none of the particles released at a local temperature of 20 K (corresponding to  12 AU from the Sun) reach the location of the system of Jupiter. However, when released at a local temperature of 80 K ( 7 AU), approximately 45% of the centimetric particles and 30% of the micrometric particles can form complex organic molecules via thermal processing, subsequently reaching the location of the system of Jupiter within 300 kyr. Assuming that the Galilean moons formed in a cold circumplanetary disk around Jupiter, the nitrogen-bearing species potentially present in their interiors could have originated from the formation of complex organic molecules in the protosolar nebula.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17464" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrestrial Analogs to Titan for Geophysical Research</a><span class="id">[2602.17464]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Saturn's moon Titan exhibits remarkable parallels to the Earth in many geophysical and geological processes not found elsewhere in the solar system at the present day. These include a nitrogen atmosphere with a condensible gas - methane - replacing the Earth's water, leading to an active meteorology with rainfall and surface manifestations including rivers, lakes and seas, and the dissolution of karstic terrain. Other phenomena such as craters, dunes, and tectonic features are found elsewhere - e.g. on Mars and Venus - but their continuing alteration by pluvial, fluvial and lacustrine processes can be studied only on Earth and Titan. Meanwhile Titan also hosts an interior liquid water ocean with similarities to the Earth as well as to ocean worlds such as Europa and Enceladus. Our focus in this review paper is twofold: to describe the geophysical and geological parallels between Earth and Titan, and to evaluate the yet-underexploited possibilities for field analog research to gain new knowledge about these processes. To date, Titan's much colder temperature and different atmospheric and crustal materials have led to a skepticism that useful analogs can be found on Earth. Our conclusion, however, is that a much larger range of useful analog field work is possible and this work will substantially enhance our knowledge of both worlds. Such investigation will supplement the existing sparse data for Titan returned by space missions, will greatly enhance our understanding of such datasets, and will help to provide science impetus and goals for future missions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17487" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling of Relativistic Plasmas with a Conservative Discontinuous Galerkin Method</a><span class="id">[2602.17487]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new method for solving the relativistic Vlasov–Maxwell system of equations, applicable to a wide range of extreme high-energy-density astrophysical and laboratory environments.

The highly unusual trait of the comet that has so far been ascertained is its extraordinarily long orbital period. The most recent orbital computations make it increasingly likely that the object is a fragment of one of the comets observed by Ammianus Marcellinus in AD 363, thereby strengthening evidence in support of the contact-binary hypothesis of the Kreutz system. In this context, the comet is the only second-generation fragment of Aristotle's comet that we are aware of to appear after the 12th century. It does not look like a major fragment, but rather like an outlying fragment of a much larger sungrazer. In 363 it apparently separated from a parent different from the lineage of comet Pereyra. The light curve of comet MAPS has so far been fairly smooth, without outbursts. To reach the brightness of comet Ikeya-Seki, the comet would have to follow an r^(-17) law in the coming weeks, which is unlikely.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic voids evolution in modified gravity via hydrodynamics</a><span class="id">[2602.17644]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a hydrodynamical description of spherical void evolution in modified gravity (MG), extending the standard General Relativity (GR) and dynamical dark energy treatment by encoding gravity modifications into effective couplings that enter the Euler and Poisson equations. This yields a compact non-linear evolution equation for the Eulerian density contrast, controlled by a time- and density-dependent effective gravitational strength, and provides a direct map between model functions and void observables. We apply the framework to the luminal Galileon class of models, where derivative self-interactions generate Vainshtein screening and might lead to a breakdown of the physical branch in sufficiently underdense regions. Exploiting this feature, we apply the void-informed viability requirement that translates into bounds on the theory parameter space and, equivalently, on the minimum attainable void depth as a function of redshift. For viable parameters of a concrete model, we quantify the impact of MG on isolated void evolution, the Lagrangian to Eulerian mapping, and the shell-crossing threshold. Relative to GR, we find a clear hierarchy of MG effects, with ${\cal O}(10\%)$ modifications in the gravitational couplings, percent-level shifts in the void density evolution, and sub-percent deviations in both the mapping and the shell-crossing thresholds. Moreover, within the adopted parametrization, we show analytically that voids always lie in an unscreened regime on the physical branch. Overall, the formalism provides a self-consistent route to predict void dynamics and consistency constraints in a broad class of MG models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From $χ$EFT to Multi-Region Modeling: Neutron star structure with a polytropic extension of $χ$EFT and MUSES Calculation Engine multi-layer modeling</a><span class="id">[2602.16786]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutron stars provide a unique environment to probe the properties of dense nuclear matter.

In such models, the DM annihilation cross section is typically suppressed by the small kinetic mixing and or a heavy mediator, often leading to an overabundant relic density. We show that the observed DM abundance can be achieved if the dark Higgs undergoes a strong first order phase transition after DM freeze-out. In this scenario, the relic abundance is set by thermal freeze-out in the symmetric phase and subsequently reduced by entropy injection from the phase transition, rather than by annihilation in the broken phase. We find that to reproduce the observed relic abundance, the required phase transition is generically supercooled. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave signal lies within the sensitivity of future experiments, providing a complementary probe of this framework. Moreover, a strongly supercooled phase transition can potentially account for the NANOGrav signal for DM masses below $O(10)$ GeV.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17154" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme-mass ratio inspirals in Schwarzschild - de Sitter spacetime I: Weak-field orbits</a><span class="id">[2602.17154]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The inspiral of a compact object into a black hole is a key source of low-frequency gravitational waves for future space-based detectors like LISA. While models of this process have advanced, they typically focus on asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this paper, we explore how the absence of asymptotic flatness affects the slow, adiabatic orbital evolution due to radiation reaction. This lack of asymptotic flatness can arise from external environments or an expanding universe. Using the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where the deviation from flatness is governed by the cosmological constant, we study bound orbits characterized by their semi-latus rectum $p$ and eccentricity $e$. We calculate how the cosmological constant shifts the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits and alters the relationship between the binary's binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital parameters. Assuming the orbital timescale is much shorter than the inspiral timescale, we apply a modified quadrupole formula to examine the impact of a small positive cosmological constant on the orbital evolution in the weak-field limit. We find that the cosmological constant accelerates the decrease in eccentricity, reducing inspiral plunge times, which could influence event rate estimates for space-based detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">g4chargeit: Geant4-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of charging in dielectric materials</a><span class="id">[2602.17332]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present g4chargeit, a kinetic Monte Carlo framework built on Geant4 for self-consistent simulation of time-dependent electrostatic charging in dielectric materials.

As a representative application, we simulate the charging of regolith grains under average dayside conditions on the Moon. The surface of the Moon, in addition to other airless planetary bodies, are regularly exposed to solar ultraviolet photons and solar-wind plasma, creating a radiation environment in which electrostatic interactions among regolith grains become significant. Until now, simulations of regolith charging have often relied on analytical approximations that oversimplify grain geometry and interaction mechanisms. Our Geant4-based simulations reveal charge accumulation within intergrain micro-cavities, leading to repulsive electrostatic forces consistent with experimental observations. The framework establishes a multiscale approach that links microscopic scattering events to the continuity equation of surface charge density and to the formation of macroscopic surface charge patches in complex grain geometries. Although demonstrated here for planetary regolith, the method is general and applicable to a broad range of dielectric charging problems.

Motivated by this behavior, we propose a source-compensated, history-dependent helicity density that satisfies an exact local balance identity by construction, enabling Saffman-type two-point correlation integrals which, under standard flux-decorrelation assumptions, can exhibit intermediate-scale plateaus that are roughly time-independent. In our simulations we demonstrate such plateaus to remain approximately invariant even as the usual Saffman helicity integral plateau value $I_H$ evolves during the early kinetic stage. Under approximate single-scale self-similarity, the plateau behavior of the magnetic integral is consistent with the 2D decay constraint $BL \sim \text{const}$. For initially net-helical configurations, we observe rapid development of mixed-signed magnetic helicity patches and a decrease of the global fractional helicity, such that the decay over the kinetic interval is again most consistent with the cancellation-dominated scaling constraint.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stochastic galactic supernova flux of semi-relativistic particles</a><span class="id">[2602.17597]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>New exotic particles with MeV masses, such as axion-like particles or light dark matter, can be emitted from core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with semi-relativistic velocities. Due to their speed dispersion, they would arrive at Earth as an extended packet with a time spread that can be as large as tens of millennia for typical detectors. It has been argued in the literature that the superposition of packets from all galactic SNe would give rise to a smooth and stationary diffuse flux that could be observable on terrestrial experiments. In this article, we critically examine this hypothesis by carrying out a numerical simulation of the galactic history of SN explosions. We show that, although the particle packets do overlap, due to the short observational time window, each of them only contributes with a very narrow range of energies and with an intensity that depends on the SN distance. As a consequence, the energy dependence of the resulting flux is extremely sensitive to the stochastic nature of the SN population and far from smooth. This has profound implications for the expected signature in terrestrial experiments, which displays a spectral shape that is not properly described by the smooth approximation. We develop a numerical tool to compute this stochastic galactic flux for generic semi-relativistic particles, which also allows us to explore sub-MeV particles, where the smooth diffuse flux approach does not hold. To test this framework, we revisit existing bounds on axion-like particles and fermionic dark matter, finding weaker constraints than previously reported.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterization of compressible fluctuations in solar wind streams dominated by balanced and imbalanced turbulence: Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter and Wind observations</a><span class="id">[2602.17606]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Characterizing compressible fluctuations in the solar wind is essential for understanding their role in solar wind acceleration and heating, yet their origin and evolution across different turbulence regimes remain poorly understood. In this study, we carry out a statistical analysis of the properties of compressible fluctuations in solar wind dominated by balanced and imbalanced turbulence. Using in-situ measurements from Wind, Solar Orbiter, and Parker Solar Probe, we investigate the scale dependence of density and magnetic field fluctuations and their correlations with plasma beta and radial distance. Our results indicate that solar wind compressibility is likely affected by both expansion effects and compressible dynamics governed by local plasma conditions. The non-Alfvenic wind is dominated by anti-correlated fluctuations, whereas the Alfvenic wind contains a mixture of correlated and anti-correlated fluctuations, though the latter remain prevalent. While the anti-correlated component is consistent with MHD slow magnetosonic modes, the correlated (fast mode-like) component is not reproduced by predictions from either linear MHD theory or nonlinear models of forced compressible fluctuations. Nevertheless, the dominant slow mode component explains the observed dependence on beta and the enhanced density fluctuations measured by Parker Solar Probe. This further suggests that slow mode waves contribute significantly to the compressible energy budget near the Sun and may play an important role in solar wind heating and acceleration close to the Sun.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for Multimodal Superfluidity of Neutrons</a><span class="id">[2602.17611]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present theoretical and experimental evidence for a new phase of matter in neutron-rich systems that we call multimodal superfluidity.

Since 2020, ATOMKI has observed this resonance in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states in ${}^{8}\mathrm{Be}$, ${}^{4}\mathrm{He}$, and ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}$. More recently, in 2025, PADME, operating at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, has also hinted a similar excess, in this case in the $e^{+}e^{-}$ final-state events originating from positron annihilation on fixed-target atomic electrons of Carbonium. This concordance strengthens the case for a common underlying origin, potentially involving a new boson, conventionally referred to as $X_{17}$. Despite these intriguing developments, the global experimental landscape remains highly dynamic, particularly in light of recent MEG II constraints, and a definitive confirmation or exclusion of the $X_{17}$ hypothesis is still lacking. Within this evolving and exciting context, this thesis investigates whether a hypothetical $17\,\text{MeV}$ particle, coupled to electrons as suggested by the PADME observations, could function as a mediator between the Standard Model and previously unexplored hidden sectors. Such a mediator could, in principle, offer a novel pathway toward addressing one of the principal outstanding inconsistencies of the Standard Model: the nature and origin of dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of the four terrestrial planets in the Jupiter-Saturn chaotic excitation scenario: fundamental properties and water delivery</a><span class="id">[2404.13826]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Jupiter-Saturn chaotic excitation (JSCE) scenario proposes that the protoplanetary disk was dynamically excited and depleted beyond  1-1.5 au in a few Myr, offering a new and plausible explanation for several observed properties of the inner solar system. Here, we expanded our previous work by conducting a comprehensive analysis of 37 optimal terrestrial planet systems obtained in the context of the JSCE scenario. Each optimal system harbored exactly four terrestrial planets analogs to Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. We further investigated water delivery, feeding zones, and accretion history for the planet analogs, which allowed us to better constrain the water distribution in the disk. The main findings of this work are as follows: 1) the formation of four terrestrial planets with orbits and masses similar to those observed in our solar system in most of our sample, as evidenced by the dynamically colder and hotter orbits of Venus-Earth and Mercury-Mars analogs, and the high success rates of similar mutual orbital separations ( 40-85%) and mass ratios of the planets ( 70-90%) among the 37 systems; and 2) water was delivered to all terrestrial planets during their formation through the accretion of water-bearing disk objects from beyond  1-1.5 au. The achievement of Earth's estimated bulk water content required the disk to contain sufficient water mass distributed within those objects initially. This requirement implies that Mercury, Venus, and Mars acquired water similar to the amount on Earth during their formation. Several of our planet analogs also matched additional constraints, such as the timing of Moon formation by a giant impact, Earth's late accretion mass and composition, and Mars's formation timescale.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Precision Inflationary Predictions: Impact of Accurate End-of-Inflation Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2407.01713]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The precision era of cosmology demands accurate theoretical predictions from inflationary models. In quantitative reheating analyses, inflationary observables depend sensitively on the number of e-folds between horizon exit and the end of inflation, $N_k$, whose determination relies on slow-roll approximations near the end of inflation. Since inflation ends when the first slow-roll parameter reaches unity, even modest inaccuracies in this approximation can shift the end of inflation and thereby alter $N_k$, leading to modifications in predicted observables – including those evaluated at leading order. While such effects are implicit in standard treatments, their quantitative impact on observable constraints has not been systematically assessed. In this work, we first re-evaluate leading-order slow-roll predictions using an improved determination of $N_k$ within a simple quantitative reheating framework, and then incorporate higher-order slow-roll corrections consistently with the revised background evolution. Applying this framework to the Starobinsky model, we find that improved end-of-inflation dynamics alone can induce shifts of order $\Delta n_s \sim 10^{-3}$, while higher-order slow-roll corrections provide additional refinements at the $\sim 4 \times 10^{-4}$ level. The cumulative effect results in a maximum shift of $\Delta n_s \sim 1.2 \times 10^{-3}$ within the allowed reheating range. These results demonstrate that an accurate determination of the end of inflation is essential for precision tests of inflationary models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05373" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Late-blooming magnetars: awakening as long period transients after a dormant cooling epoch</a><span class="id">[2505.05373]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long-period transients are an elusive class of compact objects uncovered by radio surveys. While magnetars are a leading candidate for those sources that appear isolated, several observational properties challenge the established evolutionary framework: (i) low quiescent X-ray luminosities, (ii) $\sim$hour-long rotational periods, and (iii) highly-variable radio flux. It is shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the fluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband silent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively. Once the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the magnetic evolution, triggering crustal failures that inject magnetospheric twist that initiates radio pulsing while depleting rotational kinetic energy from an already-slow star. Depending on where electric currents circulate, such 'late-blooming' magnetars manifesting as long-period transients may thus form a distinct branch from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Particle injection in three-dimensional relativistic magnetic reconnection</a><span class="id">[2508.14886]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Relativistic magnetic reconnection has been proposed as an important nonthermal particle acceleration (NTPA) mechanism that generates power-law spectra and high-energy emissions.

Open questions on particle injection that are important for both physical understanding and astronomical observations include how the upstream magnetization $\sigma$ influences the injection energy and the contributions of the known injection mechanisms (i.e., direct acceleration by the reconnection electric field, Fermi kicks, and pickup acceleration) to the injected particle population. Using fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we uncover these relationships by systematically measuring the injection energy and calculating the contributions of each acceleration mechanism to the total injected particle population. We also present a theoretical model to explain these results. Additionally, we compare two- and three-dimensional simulations to assess the impact of the flux-rope kink and drift-kink instability on particle injection. We conclude with comparisons with previous work and outlook for future work.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20179" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Constraint on Dark Matter Self-Interaction from Combined Strong Lensing and Stellar Kinematics in MACS J0138-2155</a><span class="id">[2508.20179]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) represents a compelling alternative to collisionless dark matter, with diverse phenomenological signals from dwarf galaxy to galaxy cluster scales. We present new constraints on the SIDM cross section from the galaxy cluster MACS J0138-2155, host to the strongly lensed supernovae Requiem and Encore. Our analysis combines strong gravitational lensing with spatially resolved stellar kinematics of the central galaxy, employing several methodological advances over previous cluster-scale SIDM studies. The result is a self-consistent measurement of the density profile of MACS J0138-2155 across two orders of magnitude in radius. Our lensing and kinematics analyses individually yield highly consistent results, and from their combination we report a 95% confidence upper limit on the SIDM cross section of $\sigma/m &lt; 0.613$ cm$^2$/g, at an interaction velocity of $\langle v_\text{pair}\rangle &lt; 2090$ km/s. This constraint, derived from the most detailed single-system analysis to date, is competitive with previous cluster-scale limits while demonstrating the power of combining complementary gravitational probes. The methodology developed here advances precision cluster lens modeling and will inform future studies of dark matter physics, as well as time-delay cosmography in this unique strong lensing system. Additionally, our results imply SN Requiem will reappear sooner than previously reported, with a 1$\sigma$ CL between January 2027 and November 2028 at H$_0 = 67.7$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compression, Impact and Hot Rebound Flows from Coronal Rain Downflows</a><span class="id">[2509.11627]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Studying coronal rain formation through thermal non-equilibrium (TNE) and thermal instability (TI) provides insights into coronal heating mechanisms. We analysed a quiescent coronal rain event using space-based observations from the High-Resolution Imager in Extreme Ultraviolet (\hrieuv) of Solar Orbiter (SolO), the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and the Slit-Jaw Imager (SJI) from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) from November 1st, 2023. During the coronal rain shower, the coronal loop exhibits substantial EUV variability and structural changes. Rain clumps fell at $72-87$ km s$^{-1}$ with cool EUV absorbing core sizes of $\approx$600 km and densities of $\approx6\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ preceded by strong compressions. These mostly isothermal compressions suggest energy transfer into the rain, decelerating it and possibly reducing cooling rates – consistent with accretion braking timescales. The shower carried microflare-level energy ($4.64\times10^{26}$ erg), with clumps producing impacts that reach the lower transition region and are visible across all EUV channels and in SJI 1400 Å. The impacts generated hot rebound flows ($10^{6.2}-10^{6.3} $K, $85-87$ km s$^{-1}$) that refilled and reheated the loop but carried less than $15\%$ of the clumps' kinetic energy. We detected steady footpoint heating signatures consistent with the TNE-TI scenario, with an estimated amplitude of $10^{-2\pm0.3}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ and heating scale heights of $2-10$ Mm, matching active region values. Coronal rain may thus serve as both a template for accretion braking and a proxy for integrated heating driving TNE-TI cycles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-long Gamma-ray Bursts from Micro-Tidal Disruption Events: The Case of GRB 250702B</a><span class="id">[2509.22779]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs), a rare class of high-energy transients with durations $&gt;10^3$s, remain poorly understood. GRB 250702B is notable for its multi-hour prompt emission, an X-ray pre-peak emission starting $\sim$1 day earlier, off-nuclear host position, and hard, rapidly variable gamma-rays. This combination is difficult to explain with standard ULGRB progenitors such as blue-supergiant collapsars, magnetar engines, or white-dwarf tidal disruptions by intermediate-mass black holes. We interpret the event as a micro-tidal disruption event ($\mu$TDE), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star partially or fully disrupts a main-sequence star. Three $\mu$TDE pathways can reproduce the observed pre-peak emission to main flare delay: (i) a dynamical (partial/repeating) disruption, in which a grazing passage yields a faint precursor and the core returns after $\sim$day for a deeper encounter; (ii) a natal-kick disruption, where the delay reflects the ballistic motion of a newborn compact object relative to its companion, leading to full disruption; and (iii) a hybrid natal-kick + partial case, in which the kick seeds the close encounter but the first passage is only partial, with the core returning on the day-scale period. Cross-section scalings imply comparable rates for partial and full outcomes in both dynamical and natal-kick scenarios. The highly variable, hard $\gamma$-ray emission supports association with a stellar-mass compact object. Fallback and viscous accretion naturally explain the ultra-long duration, energetics, and ks-scale X-ray variability. We outline observational discriminants between the three channels and argue that $\mu$TDEs offer a compelling framework for ULGRBs such as GRB 250702B.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inconsistencies of Tsallis Cosmology within Horizon Thermodynamics and Holographic Scenarios</a><span class="id">[2510.00234]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the cosmological implications of Tsallis entropy in two widely discussed frameworks: the Cai-Kim thermodynamic derivation of the Friedman equations and the Tsallis holographic dark energy (HDE) scenario, considering both the Hubble scale and the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff as infrared regulators. In both cases, the dynamics introduce a nonextensivity parameter $\delta$, with the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area relation recovered for $\delta = 1$. While previous studies have suggested that only small deviations from extensivity are observationally allowed, typically requiring $|1 - \delta| \lesssim 10^{-3}$, here we go further and perform a systematic consistency analysis across the entire expansion history. We show that even mild departures from $\delta = 1$ lead to pathological behavior in the effective dark energy sector: its density can become negative or complex, its equation of state may diverge, or it can contribute an unacceptably large early-time fraction that spoils radiation domination and violates BBN and CMB constraints. Our results sharpen and unify earlier hints of tension, providing a clear physical interpretation in terms of corrections that grow uncontrollably with the expansion rate toward the past. We conclude that within both the Cai-Kim and HDE formulations, a viable cosmology emerges only in the extensive limit, effectively reducing the models to $\Lambda$CDM. More broadly, our findings emphasize the importance of dynamical consistency and cosmological viability tests, when assessing nonextensive entropy formalisms as potential frameworks for describing the Universe's dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14266" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quarkyonic Neutron Stars as Candidates for the GW230529 Mass-Gap Object</a><span class="id">[2511.14266]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine whether quarkyonic equations of state (EOS) can account for compact objects in the $2.5$-$4.5\,M_\odot$ mass range reported for the GW230529 gravitational-wave event.

The predicted M-R sequences extend into the GW230529 mass window while maintaining radii in the range of $\approx 13$-$15$ km, suggesting that quarkyonic stars can naturally populate the so-called compact object mass gap.

However, synchronisation can be achieved also via tidal approach, provided the Roche limit is not crossed. For each of the two scenarios, we derive the condition under which the evolving synchronicity radius catches up with the tidally evolving orbit. We consider the two scenarios for the Pluto Charon system and examine the impact origin hypothesis of Charons formation against capture. Based on geophysical evidence, we propose that capture appears more likely. Motivated by this conclusion, we investigate the capture scenario, wherein the orbital evolution of Charon starts at a higher altitude than present and undergoes tidal descent, both analytically and numerically. We also consider the possibility that Plutos initial prograde spin underwent a reversal by a tidally approaching retrograde Charon. Depending on the initial conditions, we observe temporary locking of Charon into higher spin orbit resonances 3:2 to 7:2 during the first 0.5 Myr of the systems evolution. Owing to a greater initial separation between the partners, the power dissipated in each of them turns out to be much lower than in the case of tidal recession of bodies of the same internal structure. The greater initial separation also results in lower tidal stress, which may explain the absence of tidally generated fracture patterns.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Resolution of a Main Sequence G-Star Astrosphere Using Chandra</a><span class="id">[2512.09613]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report resolution of a halo of X-ray line emission surrounding the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) G8.5V star HD 61005 by Chandra ACIS-S. Located only 36.4 pc distant, HD 61005 is young (approx. 100 Myr), x-ray bright (300 times Solar), observed with nearly edge-on geometry, and surrounded by Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) material denser than in the environ of the Sun. HD 61005 is known to harbor large amounts of circumstellar dust in a dense ecliptic plane full of mm-sized particles plus attached, extended wing like structures full of micron sized particles, which are evidence for a strong LISM-dust disk interaction. These properties aided our ability to resolve the 220 au wide astrosphere of HD61005, the first ever observed for a main sequence G-star. The observed x-ray emission morphology is roughly spherical, as expected for an astrospheric structure dominated by the host star. The Chandra spectrum of HD 61005 is a combination of a hard stellar coronal emission (T=8 MK) at Lx = 6 x10e29 erg per sec, plus an extended halo contribution at Lx = 1x10e29 erg per sec dominated by charge exchange (CXE) lines, such as those of OVIII and NeIX. The Chandra CXE x-ray morphology does not track the planar dust morphology but does extend out roughly to where the base of the dust wings begins. We present a toy model of x-ray emission produced by stellar wind (SW)-LISM CXE interactions, similar to the state of the young Sun when it was approximately 100 Myrs old (Guinan and Engle 2007), and transiting through an approximately 1000 times denser part of the interstellar medium (ISM) such as a Giant Molecular Cloud (Stern 2003, Opher and Loeb 2024).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The magnetic origin of the outer boundaries of sunspots</a><span class="id">[2512.11160]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Sunspot boundaries are commonly outlined by contours of the continuum intensity. However, their magnetic nature has not yet been fully characterised. Aims. We investigate the properties of the outer boundary of a long-lived sunspot to identify the magnetic property that defines it. Methods. We analysed the magnetic properties of AR NOAA11591 spot during its two passages across the solar disc, using SDO/HMI continuum intensity and magnetic field, and determined their contours to outline the outer boundary. Results. During the 1st disc passage, in which the sunspot is in its stable phase, the intensity contours at 0.9 of the mean quiet Sun intensity and isocontours of the magnetic field strength of 625G provide an almost perfect match between the two contours. With these thresholds, the time-averaged area of mismatch is minimised, yielding an average distance between the contours of 0.58 pixel, corresponding to less than 0.26 arcsec. During the 2nd disc passage, the spot shows clear signs of decay, and we find that the 0.9 intensity and 625G magnetic isocontours detach from each other, coupled to the disappearance of penumbra. In this super-equipartition area, granulation still operates. Conclusions. Based on a comparison with simulation data from our previous work, and in agreement with findings of other authors, we conclude that the outer boundary of stable sunspots is defined by an invariant magnetic field: the equipartition field. From the discrepancy between intensity and magnetic contours during the decaying phase of the sunspot, we surmise that alongside the well-established (magneto-)convective regimes of the photosphere - granular, penumbral, and umbral - a super-equipartition granular regime can be identified. In this regime, bright, but smaller granules occur where the magnetic field exceeds equipartition but remains sub-critical for convection suppression.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultralight Dark Matter Constraints from NanoHertz Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2512.15292]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) on the mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background.

Excursions beyond these thresholds result in the emission of energy, transferred from particles to coherent electromagnetic waves, acting to adjust the system toward a more stable configuration. In this work, we use linear Vlasov–Maxwell theory to define parametric limits for a low-$\beta$ plasma that contains a drifting proton beam or helium ($\alpha$-particle) population. A sufficiently fast and dense drifting population triggers an Oblique Drift Instability (ODI). This instability decreases the velocity drift between the thermal core proton and secondary populations and prevents the ratio of core thermal to magnetic pressure $\beta_c$ from decreasing below a minimum value by increasing the temperatures - i.e. heating - of both the core and drifting populations. Our theoretical results are of interest for Parker Solar Probe observations, as they provide an additional mechanism for perpendicular heating of ions active in the sub-\Alfvenic solar wind. The ODI may explain the discrepancy between long-standing expectations of measurements of very low-$\beta$ plasmas with very large ion temperature anisotropies in the near-Sun environment and in situ observations, where $\beta$ is consistently measured above a few percent and the secondary ion populations drift faster than the bulk of proton population by no more than approximately the local Alfven speed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$\mathbf{Ω_1Ω_2}$-$\mathbfΛ$CDM: A promising phenomenological extension of the standard model of cosmology</a><span class="id">[2512.19000]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a phenomenological extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the $\Omega_1\Omega_2$-$\Lambda$CDM model, in which the total energy density of the universe is expanded in powers of $1+z$.

Using Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, we find that the model allows additional freedom in the late-time expansion history while preserving standard early-universe physics. When DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data are included, the inferred Hubble constant is $H_0 = 69.74 \pm 0.77~\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL), consistent with Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) measurements from the Carnegie–Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP).

Most PCEBs studied to date have typical orbital periods of hours to a few days and can be well explained by assuming inefficient CEE to expel the envelope. However, there are currently several systems with relatively wide orbital periods ($&gt;$18 days). To explain these wide PCEBs, additional sources of energy have been suggested to be taken into account. Here, we present the discovery and observational characterization of a compact object ($M\,\geq\,0.58\,\rm M_{\odot}$) with a K-type star companion in the solar neighborhood ($d\sim 112$ pc) and an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb}\sim 14$ days. The compact object binary is likely to be a system consisting of a WD and a barium dwarf, making it the shortest-period barium star binary candidate. Such a system with an orbital period within the gap between tight and wide binaries provides a test of whether additional energy sources are required to explain its formation. Using binary evolution models, we investigate the evolutionary history of this wide PCEB system and find that the observed properties of this source can be explained without invoking any extra energy source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15765" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redshift-binned constraints on the Hubble constant under $Λ$CDM, CPL, and Padé cosmography</a><span class="id">[2601.15765]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Motivated by recent claims of a possible redshift dependence in late-Universe determinations of the Hubble constant (H_0), we test the robustness of this behavior using multiple cosmological probes. We perform a joint redshift-binned analysis of H_0 across eight bins using late-Universe probes including Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, and water megamasers under three cosmological frameworks: flat Lambda cold dark matter, Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, and Pade cosmography. Under a common baseline scheme, all three models show a qualitatively similar low-amplitude variation in the per-bin H_0 estimates. A simple Fourier-like parametrization captures this behavior, but the amplitude differs from zero only at a marginal significance of about 1.71-1.94 sigma, with similar behavior observed across all three cosmological frameworks. We then investigate the robustness and possible origin of this feature. Alternative binning schemes preserve its qualitative form, whereas single-probe per-bin fits (supernova-only, cosmic chronometer-only, BAO-only) yield ratios H_0,i / H_0,global mostly consistent with unity and do not reproduce the pronounced drift seen in the joint baseline constraints. Finally, by comparing different global versus piecewise-constant configurations for {H_0, Omega_m, M, r_d}, we find that a baselinelike oscillatory pattern reemerges only when multiple degenerate parameter combinations are allowed to vary across bins, while it is strongly suppressed when only H_0 is bin dependent. Taken together, these results indicate that the apparent oscillatory behavior of H_0(z) in late time arises from known parameter degeneracies and does not constitute robust evidence for a genuine redshift evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar Wind Heating Near the Sun: A Radial Evolution Approach</a><span class="id">[2602.10275]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Characterizing the plasma state in the near-Sun environment is essential to constrain the mechanisms that heat and accelerate the solar wind.

Using intervals with high field-of-view ($&gt;85\%$) coverage, we derive the radial profiles of magnetic field strength ($|B|$), proton density ($N$), bulk speed ($V$), total proton temperature ($T$), parallel ($T_\parallel$) and perpendicular ($T_\perp$) temperatures, temperature anisotropy ($T_\perp/T_\parallel$), plasma beta ($\beta$), Alfvén Mach number ($M_A$), and magnetic field fluctuations ($\delta B/B$) for sub and super-Alfvénic regions. In super-Alfvénic regions, power-law of $|B|$, $N$, $V$, and $T$ as a function of heliocentric distance are broadly consistent with previous \textit{Helios} results at $&gt;0.3$ AU. The radial evolution of the components of the temperature tensor reveals distinct behavior: $T_\perp$ decreases monotonically with distance, whereas $T_\parallel$ exhibits a non-monotonic trend – decreasing in the sub-Alfvénic region, increasing just beyond the Alfvén surface. We interpret the increase in $T_\parallel$ as a proxy for proton beam occurrence. We further examine the evolution of magnetic field fluctuations, finding decreasing radial/parallel fluctuations but enhanced tangential/normal/perpendicular fluctuations in sunward direction. These fluctuations may provide free energy for beam generation and particle heating via wave-particle interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOTO identification and broadband modelling of the counterpart to the SVOM GRB 250818B</a><span class="id">[2602.16559]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rapid localisation and follow-up of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) increasingly rely on low-latency triggers from new missions coupled to wide-field robotic optical facilities.

One possibility is that because of the high densities reached in their cores, matter could be deconfined into quark matter. We investigate the existence of hybrid stars, using microscopic models to describe different phases of matter. Within the adopted microscopic models we calculate properties of NS and properties of matter. We want to probe the pQCD calculations influence and analyze properties that identify a transition to deconfined matter. Bayesian approach is applied to generate 8 sets of equations of state (EOS). A Maxwell construction is adopted to describe the deconfinement transition. For the hadron phase, we consider a stiff and a soft EOS obtained from the Relativistic Mean Field model with nonlinear meson terms. For the quark phase, we use 2 different models: the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with multiquark interactions and the Mean Field Theory of QCD, a model similar to the vector MIT bag model. Bayesian inference was applied to determine the model parameters that satisfy the X-ray observations from NICER and have phase transition at densities between 0.15 - 0.40 fm$^{-3}$. We also applied restrictions from the pQCD calculations to half of the sets. Hybrid stars are compatible with current observational data. The pQCD restrictions reduce the value of the $M_{max}$. However, even applying this restriction, the models were able to reach values of $2.1 - 2.3 M_\odot$. The conformal limit was still not attained at the center of the most massive stars. The vector interactions are essential to describe hybrid stars with a mass above $2 M_\odot$. The multiquark interactions introduced may affect the limits of some quantities considered as indicators of the presence of a deconfined phase. It is possible to find a set of EOS, that predict that inside NS the renormalized matter trace anomaly is always positive.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GollumFit: An IceCube Open-Source Framework for Binned-Likelihood Neutrino Telescope Analyses</a><span class="id">[2506.04491]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present GollumFit, a framework designed for performing binned-likelihood analyses on neutrino telescope data.

This framework uniquely incorporates the particular model parameters necessary for neutrino telescopes, and solves an associated likelihood problem in a time-efficient manner.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Compact Story of Positivity in de Sitter</a><span class="id">[2508.08359]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent developments have yielded significant progress towards systematically understanding loop corrections to de Sitter (dS) correlators. In close analogy with physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops that can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In contrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that the theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent, particularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these issues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral representation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We review the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS correlators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex operators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel complications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between different techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal series fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer new proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why renormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET is the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GWTC-4.0: Methods for Identifying and Characterizing Gravitational-wave Transients</a><span class="id">[2508.18081]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) is a collection of candidate gravitational-wave transient signals identified and characterized by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Producing the contents of the GWTC from detector data requires complex analysis methods. These comprise techniques to model the signal; identify the transients in the data; evaluate the quality of the data and mitigate possible instrumental issues; infer the parameters of each transient; compare the data with the waveform models for compact binary coalescences; and handle the large amount of results associated with all these different analyses. In this paper, we describe the methods employed to produce the catalog's fourth release, GWTC-4.0, focusing on the analysis of the first part of the fourth observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self-regularized entropy: What does black hole entropy predict for tests of Kerr no-hair theorem?</a><span class="id">[2508.20421]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We compute the canonical (brick-wall) entropy of Hawking radiation in a in a quantum black hole model whose strong-field exterior is modeled phenomenologically, to first order in a small quadrupole parameter, by the static q-metric, which is an exact vacuum solution of the Einstein equations. WKB counting of trapped near-horizon cavity modes shows that, within the perturbative small-deformation regime studied here, a modest quadrupolar deformation self-regularizes the ultraviolet divergence: the entropy becomes finite without an ad hoc cutoff. Adopting the Hawking temperature and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass as external thermodynamic inputs, matching this canonical entropy to that benchmark yields an entropy-motivated deformation scale which, when interpreted phenomenologically in a stationary extension, corresponds to percent-to-tens-of-percent violations of the Kerr multipole relations, and provides concrete observational targets for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT), the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and planned third-generation (3G) ground-based gravitational wave observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Wave Signatures from Lepton Number Breaking Phase Transitions with Flat Potentials</a><span class="id">[2510.11913]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extensions of the Standard Model typically contain “flaton fields&quot; defined as fields with large vacuum expectation values and almost flat potentials where scalar self-coupling is small or vanishes at tree level. Such potentials have been used to drive a secondary inflationary epoch after a primary phase of inflation, in what are called thermal inflation models. Although the primordial, high-scale inflationary epoch can solve the horizon and flatness problems, it does not always resolve difficulties associated with late-time relics produced in extensions of the Standard Model. These relics typically decay too late, injecting entropy and energetic particles that spoil successful predictions like Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. It is here that thermal inflation plays a crucial role: diluting unwanted relics by many orders of magnitude without erasing the baryon asymmetry or the large-scale structure set up by the earlier phase of inflation. The preferred scale for this phenomenon is in the range $10^6-10^8$ GeV if one considers supergravity, but without it, any scale above the EW scale is valid. We investigate a typical form of these potentials and determine what are the conditions for the potentials to develop a barrier such that when the flatons settle to the true minimum, the associated Gravitational Waves can be observed, focusing on first-order phase transitions from spontaneous lepton number breaking.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Stars with Large Quark Cores</a><span class="id">[2511.02653]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutron stars (NSs) are interesting objects capable of reaching densities unattainable on Earth. The properties of matter under these conditions remain a mystery. Exotic matter, including quark matter, may be present in the NS core. In this work, we explore the possible compositions of NS cores, in particular, the possible existence of large quark cores. We use the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with nonlinear terms for the hadron phase and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and Mean Field Theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (MFTQCD) for the quark phase. Through Bayesian inference, we obtain different sets of equations: four sets with hybrid equations and one set with only the hadron phase. We impose constraints regarding the properties of nuclear matter, X-ray observational data from NICER, gravitational wave data from the binary neutron star merger GW170817, perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, and causality. The MFTQCD allows for a phase transition to quark matter at low densities, just above saturation density, while for the NJL sets, the phase transition occurs above twice the saturation density. As a result, the MFTQCD model predicts the presence of quark matter in the inner core of 1.4 M$_\odot$ NSs, while NJL models suggest a low probability of quark matter in the interior of a 1.4 M$_\odot$ NS. Both models predict the existence of quark matter in 2 M$_\odot$ NSs. The slope of the mass-radius curve has been shown to carry information about the presence of quark matter. In particular, a positive slope at 1.8 M$_\odot$ indicates the presence of non-nucleonic matter. A hybrid star with a stiff quark equation of state could explain a larger radius in more massive stars, such as two solar mass stars, compared to canonical NSs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20387" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anisotropic flows in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\,\text{GeV}$ with a Skyrme pseudopotential</a><span class="id">[2511.20387]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, we present a systematic study of proton anisotropic flow observables measured by the HADES collaboration, by utilizing the recently developed density-, momentum- and isospin-dependent N$5$LO Skyrme pseudopotential. In particular, we investigate the impacts of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials, the stiffness of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) EOS, the high-density behaviors of the symmetry energy and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections on proton $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, and $v_{4}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\,\text{GeV}$. Our results show that the proton anisotropic flows are strongly sensitive to the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potential as well as the incompressibility coefficient $K_0$ of SNM. In addition, the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_2$ exhibits a modest sensitivity to the higher-order skewness coefficient $J_0$ and kurtosis coefficient $I_0$ of SNM as well as the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential, while the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_1$ is shown to modestly depend on the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections. Moreover, the high-density symmetry energy seems to have limited effects on the proton anisotropic flows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials including the symmetry potential, the higher-order characteristic parameters of SNM EOS beyond $K_0$, and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections, in future Bayesian transport model analyses on proton anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES energies, thereby to extract information on nuclear matter EOS as well as the associated underlying nuclear effective interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04206" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nucleon Short-Range Correlations and High-Momentum Dynamics: Implications on the Equation of State of Dense Matter</a><span class="id">[2512.04206]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and their high-momentum tails (HMTs) encode key short-range dynamics in nuclei and dense matter. This review provides a concise overview of SRC features relevant to the Equation of State (EOS) of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. We summarize empirical and theoretical properties of the single-nucleon momentum distribution $n(k)$, emphasizing the role of the neutron–proton tensor force, the dominance of correlated np pairs, and the enhancement of minority-species HMTs. Links to nucleon effective E-masses, quasi-deuteron components, and orbital entanglement are briefly noted. We examine how SRC-induced HMTs modify kinetic and potential contributions to the EOS in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks, including the softening of the kinetic symmetry energy and departures from the isospin parabolic approximation of asymmetric nuclear EOS. Sensitivity to high-momentum components and generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are also highlighted. Implications for heavy-ion reactions are summarized, including effects on particle yields, collective flows, deeply sub-threshold particle production and hard photon emission, driven by modified initial nucleon momentum distributions and abundant high relative-momentum np pairs during the reaction. Finally, we outline SRC-HMT consequences for neutron-star matter, covering proton fractions, tidal deformabilities, $Z$-factors, cooling, and the core–crust transition, as well as possible connections to dark-matter interactions in dense environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reinforcement Learning to Discover a North-East Monsoon Index for Rainfall Prediction in Thailand</a><span class="id">[2601.10181]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurately predicting long-term rainfall is challenging. Global climate indices, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for machine learning. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel North-East monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.</p></div></details></article></body>
