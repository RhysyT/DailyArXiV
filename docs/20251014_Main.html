As this magnetar remnant spins down, it can deposit its rotational energy into the surrounding kilonova ejecta, producing synchrotron emission that peaks in the radio bands $\sim$months-years after the merger (&quot;boosted kilonova&quot;). The nearby ($z=0.0763$) long-duration GRB 211211A, which has an apparent kilonova counterpart and likely neutron star merger progenitor, may have produced such a remnant. We observed the location of GRB 211211A at 6 GHz with the NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) spanning $\approx 0.54$-$1.7~$years after the burst. We do not detect any radio emission, placing strong limits on the energy deposited into the ejecta by any remnant to $\lesssim 4.4 \times 10^{52}~{\rm erg}$. Due to the proximity of the event, we are also able to place limits on a kilonova afterglow that did not receive any additional energy deposition, though it is possible such emission will be suppressed until $\sim 4~{\rm years}$ after the burst, when the kilonova is expected to overtake the forward shock of the GRB. Future observations with the VLA and next-generation radio facilities will be able to further constrain the magnetar-boosted kilonova and kilonova afterglow scenarios, as well as directly constrain models in the scenario that GRB 211211A was instead produced by a collapsar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09745" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients as &quot;Failed&quot; Gravitational Wave Sources: Helium Core$-$Black Hole Mergers Following Delayed Dynamical Instability</a><span class="id">[2510.09745]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binaries in which a massive donor star undergoes an extended ($\gtrsim$ kyr) phase of stable mass transfer onto a black hole (BH) accretor offer a promising channel for creating LIGO gravitational wave sources. However, in many systems the mass transfer terminates prematurely in a dynamical instability at orbital periods of a few days, culminating in the BH plunging into the donor and potentially disrupting and accreting its helium core at highly super-Eddington rates. Combining a suite of binary evolution models with analytic estimates and population synthesis, we predict the population of luminous transients from delayed dynamical instability (DDI) and attribute them to the &quot;luminous&quot; class of fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs). The initial plunge of the BH into the partially stripped envelope typically ejects $\sim 10M_{\odot}$ of H/He-enriched material at speeds $\sim 10^{2}-10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, generating a compact circumstellar medium (CSM) of radius $\lesssim 1000R_{\odot}$ by the time the BH meets and tidally disrupts the HeC. Rapid BH accretion generates a highly aspherical wind-driven explosion into the environment, powering UV/optical emission via CSM interaction and X-ray reprocessing that rises over a few days to a luminosity $\sim 10^{44}-10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ before fading as the disk spreads outwards and accretion rate drops. Luminous radio/sub-mm emission is generated over several months as the jet collides with the slow quasi-spherical binary outflow, generated by the stable mass transfer preceding DDI, extending to radii $\sim 10^{17}$ cm, in agreement with the inferred CSM environments of LFBOTs. We estimate local rates of DDI merger transients $5-300$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, with a preference for low-metallicities, in agreement with LFBOT demographics. Taken together, our results support LFBOTs as being luminous signposts of &quot;failed&quot; gravitational wave sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterizing Power Spectra of Density Fluctuations in GRMHD Simulations of Black Hole Accretion Using Taylor's Frozen-in Hypothesis</a><span class="id">[2510.09746]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We characterize the spatial power spectrum of density fluctuations in magnetohydrodynamic flows in a suite of high-resolution, long-time-span general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. Extracting the local spatial power spectrum in curved spacetime directly from GRMHD simulations can be challenging for several conceptual and mechanical reasons, including choices of the reference frame, the non-uniform co-ordinate grid of the outputs and limited resolution. Taylor's frozen-in hypothesis describes a mapping between the temporal and spatial power spectrum of turbulence, which we apply to density fluctuations. We explore the validity of the assumptions underlying Taylor's hypothesis and evaluate its applicability in extracting spatial power spectra of density fluctuations of black hole accretion flows. Using outputs from the GRMHD code KORAL, we explore models with strong and ordered magnetic fields (MAD, Magnetically Arrested Disks) as well as weak and disordered magnetic fields (SANE, Standard and Normal Evolution). We explore the effects of black hole spin on the power spectra and characterize their spectral properties as a function of distance from the black hole. The observed power spectra follow a broken power law with two slopes separated by a break frequency. Our analysis shows a decrease in break frequency with increasing radius, with distinct trends between SANE and MAD flows. We also observe the first slope to be steeper for SANE flows and some notable distinctions between prograde and retrograde spins.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Spectroscopy of SN Ia 2022aaiq and 2024gy: Evidence for Enhanced Central Stable Ni Abundance and a Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition</a><span class="id">[2510.09760]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present optical + near-infrared (NIR) + mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the normal Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) 2022aaiq and 2024gy in the nebular phase, continuously spanning 0.35–28 microns. Medium-resolution JWST spectroscopy reveals novel narrow ($v_{\mathrm{FWHM}}&lt;1500$ km s$^{-1}$) [Ni II] 1.94 and 6.64 micron cores in both events. The MIR [Ni II] 6.64 micron line exhibits a distinct narrow core atop a broader base, indicating a central enhancement of stable Ni. This structure points to high central densities consistent with a near-Chandrasekhar-mass ($M_{Ch}$) progenitor or a high-metallicity sub-$M_{Ch}$ progenitor. From detailed line-profile inversions of SN 2024gy, we derive emissivity profiles for stable iron-group elements (IGEs), radioactive material, and intermediate-mass elements (IMEs), revealing spatially distinct ejecta zones. The [Ni III] 7.35 micron line shows a shallow-to-steep slope transition - a &quot;broken-slope&quot; morphology - that matches predictions for delayed detonation explosions with separated deflagration and detonation ashes. We also reanalyze and compare to archival JWST spectra of SN 2021aefx and the subluminous SN 2022xkq. We estimate a stable $^{58}$Ni mass of $\sim0.1$ M$_\odot$ for SN 2024gy, consistent with delayed detonation models, and $\sim0.01$ M$_\odot$ for SN 2022xkq, favoring sub-$M_{Ch}$ scenarios. These results demonstrate that resolved line profiles, now accessible with JWST, provide powerful diagnostics of explosion geometry, central density, and progenitor mass in SN Ia.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FLAMINGO: Baryonic effects on the weak lensing scattering transform</a><span class="id">[2510.09761]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The scattering transform is a wavelet-based statistic capable of capturing non-Gaussian features in weak lensing (WL) convergence maps and has been proven to tighten cosmological parameter constraints by accessing information beyond two-point functions. However, its application in cosmological inference requires a clear understanding of its sensitivity to astrophysical systematics, the most significant of which are baryonic effects. These processes substantially modify the matter distribution on small to intermediate scales ($k\gtrsim 0.1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), leaving scale-dependent imprints on the WL convergence field. We systematically examine the impact of baryonic feedback on scattering coefficients using full-sky WL convergence maps with Stage IV survey characteristics, generated from the FLAMINGO simulation suite. These simulations include a broad range of feedback models, calibrated to match the observed cluster gas fraction and galaxy stellar mass function, including systematically shifted variations, and incorporating either thermal or jet-mode AGN feedback. We characterise baryonic effects using a baryonic transfer function defined as the ratio of hydrodynamical to dark-matter-only scattering coefficients. While the coefficients themselves are sensitive to both cosmology and feedback, the transfer function remains largely insensitive to cosmology and shows a strong response to feedback, with suppression reaching up to $10\%$ on scales of $k\gtrsim 0.1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also demonstrate that shape noise significantly diminishes the sensitivity of the scattering coefficients to baryonic effects, reducing the suppression from $\sim 2 - 10 \;\%$ to $\sim 1\;\%$, even with 1.5 arcmin Gaussian smoothing. This highlights the need for noise mitigation strategies and high-resolution data in future WL surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09766" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Dark Energy Changing? Probing the Universe's Expansion with present and future astronomical probes</a><span class="id">[2510.09766]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study explores the possibility of a time-varying dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) deviating from -1. We employ a comprehensive dataset of usual astronomical probes (Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, Hubble data, and Planck 2018 CMB) alongside future mock gravitational wave (GW) distance measurements from the Einstein Telescope. We utilize the Pad'e approximation, a versatile framework encompassing well-known DE models like constant EoS, Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization and other time-evolving DE parametrizations. Within Pad'e parametrization, we examine three specific forms (Pad'e-I, SPad'e-I, Pad'e-II) applied to both spatially flat and non-flat universes. Pad'e-II exhibits particularly interesting features in terms of the evidence of dynamical DE at many standard deviations. Our results can be summarized as follows. Flat Universe: When analyzing the combined dataset of standard probes (including CMB) with Pad'e-II in a flat universe, we find a strong preference (6.4{\sigma}) for a dynamical (time-varying) DE EoS. This preference remains significant (4.7{\sigma}) even when incorporating future GW data. Non-Flat Universe: In a non-flat universe, the combined standard datasets (without or with CMB) also indicate dynamical DE EoS at a high confidence level (6.2{\sigma} and 6.4{\sigma}, respectively). The addition of GW data slightly reduces the evidence (3.8{\sigma} and 5.1{\sigma}, respectively), but the preference persists. These results collectively suggest a robust case for dynamical DE in the dark sector. While a non-flat universe is not strongly favored, Pad'e-II hints at a possible closed universe when CMB data is included (with or without GW data).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09772" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radial Velocity Monitoring and Analysis of Gaia Astrometry of Selected Intermediate Mass Stars to Constrain Their Multiplicity Status</a><span class="id">[2510.09772]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new radial velocity measurements of 13 selected intermediate mass stars (2 - 6 M$_\odot$). The measurements were performed between 29 April and 6 September 2024 at the University Observatory Jena using the échelle spectrograph FLECHAS. The radial velocity of eight stars was found to be constant during our spectroscopic monitoring, namely: 17 Dra A, HD 148374, HD 169487 A, 57 Cnc, $\gamma$ And, HD 11031, $\kappa$ And, and $\lambda$ Cas. In contrast, the radial velocity of five stars showed significant variability throughout or spectroscopic observation, namely: 7 CrB A, 7 CrB B, HD 214007, $\iota$ Her, and HD 201433 A. In all these cases, Keplerian orbital solutions were fitted to the observational data and the orbital elements of these spectroscopic binary systems were determined. In addition, we searched for wide companions of our targets using the third data release from ESA's Gaia mission, in order to determine the multiplicity status of these stars and contribute to the census of bright, nearby multiple stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09802" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ZZ Ceti Instability Strip for The Most Massive White Dwarf Pulsators</a><span class="id">[2510.09802]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present time-series photometry of 31 massive DA white dwarfs with $M\gtrsim 0.9~M_\odot$ within the ZZ Ceti instability strip from the Montreal White Dwarf Database 100 pc sample. The majority of the targets had no previous time-series photometry available, though several were classified as non-variable or potential pulsators in the literature. Out of the 31 candidates, we confirm 16 as pulsating. Our observations at three observatories have led us to discover the most massive pulsating white dwarf currently known, J0959$-$1828 ($M=1.32$ or $1.27~M_\odot$ for a CO versus ONe core), which is slightly more massive than the previous record holder J0049$-$2525. We study the sample properties of massive ZZ Ceti white dwarfs, and find several trends with their weighted mean periods. As predicted by theory, we see an increase in the weighted mean periods with decreasing effective temperature, and a decrease in pulsation amplitudes at the red edge of the instability strip. Furthermore, the weighted mean periods decrease with increasing stellar mass. Our observations show that the ZZ Ceti instability strip may not be pure at high masses. This is likely because the non-variable white dwarfs in the middle of the strip may be weakly magnetic, which could escape detection in the available low-resolution spectroscopy data, but may be sufficient to suppress pulsations. Extensive follow-up observations of the most massive white dwarfs in our sample have the potential to probe the interior structures and core-compositions of these white dwarfs with significantly crystallized cores.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A complex structure of escaping helium spanning more than half the orbit of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121 b</a><span class="id">[2510.09809]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Atmospheric escape of planets on short orbital periods, driven by the host star's irradiation, influences their evolution, composition, and atmospheric dynamics. Our main avenue to probe atmospheric escape is through the near-infrared metastable helium triplet, which has enabled mass loss rate measurements for tens of exoplanets. Among them, only a few studies show evidence for out-of-transit absorption, supporting the presence of a hydrodynamic outflow. However, none of these observations precisely identified the physical extent of the outflow, either due to non-continuous or short-duration observations. This limits our measurements of accurate mass loss rates. Here we present the first continuous, full-orbit helium phase curve monitoring of an exoplanet, the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b, obtained with JWST/NIRISS. It reveals helium absorption for nearly 60% of the orbit at &gt;3sigma significance. Our results show that WASP-121b sustains a strong outflow, separating into two tails trailing and leading the planet. The persistent absorption from these tails, together with their measured radial velocity shifts, suggests that they remain in a collisional fluid regime at large distances from the planet and display very different dynamics. The leading trail has a higher density and moves toward the star, whereas the trailing trail is being pushed away from the star, with the latter being blue-shifted due to stellar irradiation pressure. While qualitatively agreeing with theoretical expectations, the observed structure of helium is not self-consistently reproducible by current models, limiting constraints on the mass loss rate. Furthermore, we show that while ground-based observations of the helium triplet are essential to measure the outflow dynamics precisely, they ideally should be combined with continuous JWST phase curves to constrain the absolute level of helium absorption.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The influence of tight binaries on proto-planetary disk masses</a><span class="id">[2510.09823]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binary systems are a common site of planet formation, despite the destructive effects of the binary on the disk. While surveys of planet forming material have found diminished disk masses around medium separation ($\sim$10–100 au) binaries, less is known about tight ($&lt;$10 au) binaries, where a significant circumbinary disk may escape the disruptive dynamical effects of the binary. We survey over 100 spectroscopic binaries in the Orion A region with ALMA, detecting significant continuum emission among 21 of them with disk masses ranging from 1–100 M$_{\oplus}$. We find evidence of systematically lower disk masses among the binary sample when compared to single star surveys, which may reflect a diminished planet forming potential around tight binaries. The infrared excess fraction among the binary sample is comparable to single stars, although the tight binaries without significant ALMA emission display tentative evidence of weaker 3-5$\mu$m excesses. The depletion of cold dust is difficult to explain by clearing alone, and the role of additional mechanisms needs to be explored. It may be the result of the formation pathway for these objects, systematic differences in intrinsic properties (e.g., opacity) or a bias in how the sample was constructed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09876" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Systematic Literature Review of Machine Learning Techniques for Observational Constraints in Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2510.09876]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents a systematic literature review focusing on the application of machine learning techniques for deriving observational constraints in cosmology. The goal is to evaluate and synthesize existing research to identify effective methodologies, highlight gaps, and propose future research directions. Our review identifies several key findings: (1) various machine learning techniques, including Bayesian neural networks, Gaussian processes, and deep learning models, have been applied to cosmological data analysis, improving parameter estimation and handling large datasets. However, models achieving significant computational speedups often exhibit worse confidence regions compared to traditional methods, emphasizing the need for future research to enhance both efficiency and measurement precision. (2) Traditional cosmological methods, such as those using Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic microwave background data, remain fundamental, but most studies focus narrowly on specific datasets. We recommend broader dataset usage to fully validate alternative cosmological models. (3) The reviewed studies mainly address the $H_0$ tension, leaving other cosmological challenges-such as the cosmological constant problem, warm dark matter, phantom dark energy, and others-unexplored. (4) Hybrid methodologies combining machine learning with Markov chain Monte Carlo offer promising results, particularly when machine learning techniques are used to solve differential equations, such as Einstein Boltzmann solvers, as prior to Markov chain Monte Carlo models, accelerating computations while maintaining precision. (5) There is a significant need for standardized evaluation criteria and methodologies, as variability in training processes and experimental setups complicates result comparability and reproducibility (abridged).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TESS Discovers a Second System of Transiting Exocomets in the Extreme Debris Disk of RZ Psc</a><span class="id">[2510.09920]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the TESS discovery of only the second system of transiting exocomets with a sufficient number of events to measure the size distribution in the RZ Psc system, enabling comparisons with the $\beta$ Pictoris and Solar System size distributions. Twenty-four transits with absorption depths (AD) of 1–20\% were observed across three TESS sectors of the 20-50 Myr K0V star, detected as part of our TESS survey of extreme debris disks identified by their IR excess. We discover that the ADs (and hence exocomet radii) follow a broken power-law cumulative frequency distribution not previously seen in extrasolar contexts but similar to that observed in Solar System Kuiper Belt Object sizes, with power-law slopes above and below the break of $\gamma_\mathrm{AD&gt;break}$=2.32$\pm$0.12 and $\gamma_\mathrm{AD&lt;break}$=0.11$\pm$0.04, respectively. We derive size distributions of 1–7 km from two independent lines of evidence. We use the RZ Psc exocomet rate to predict exocomet yields for the Early eVolution Explorer (EVE) NASA astrophysics Small Explorer (SMEX) mission concept to obtain simultaneous photometry of 10$^4$ young stars in NUV, optical, and NIR bands. Assuming occurrence rates scaled from RZ Psc, EVE would detect 590 exocomets from $\approx$70 young systems in the optical band, with $\approx$120 simultaneous 5$\sigma$ detections in all three bands. These data would enable grain sizes of 200–700 nm and graphite–olivine compositions of dozens of events to be distinguished at 2.5–3$\sigma$, as well as a 4$\sigma$ determination of the accuracy of the Herschel-derived M-debris disk fraction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectropolarimetric Inversion in Four Dimensions with Deep Learning (SPIn4D): II. A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Method for 3D Solar Photosphere Reconstruction</a><span class="id">[2510.09967]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inferring the three-dimensional (3D) solar atmospheric structures from observations is a critical task for advancing our understanding of the magnetic fields and electric currents that drive solar activity. In this work, we introduce a novel, Physics-Informed Machine Learning method to reconstruct the 3D structure of the lower solar atmosphere based on the output of optical depth sampled spectropolarimetric inversions, wherein both the fully disambiguated vector magnetic fields and the geometric height associated with each optical depth are returned simultaneously. Traditional techniques typically resolve the 180-degree azimuthal ambiguity assuming a single layer, either ignoring the intrinsic non-planar physical geometry of constant optical-depth surfaces (e.g., the Wilson depression in sunspots), or correcting the effect as a post-processing step. In contrast, our approach simultaneously maps the optical depths to physical heights, and enforces the divergence-free condition for magnetic fields fully in 3D. Tests on magnetohydrodynamic simulations of quiet Sun, plage, and a sunspot demonstrate that our method reliably recovers the horizontal magnetic field orientation in locations with appreciable magnetic field strength. By coupling the resolutions of the azimuthal ambiguity and the geometric heights problems, we achieve a self-consistent reconstruction of the 3D vector magnetic fields and, by extension, the electric current density and Lorentz force. This physics-constrained, label-free training paradigm is a generalizable, physics-anchored framework that extends across solar magnetic environments while improving the understanding of various solar puzzles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09978" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studying the properties of reconnection-driven turbulence</a><span class="id">[2510.09978]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic reconnection, often accompanied by turbulence interaction, is a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysical environments. However, the current understanding of the nature of turbulent magnetic reconnection remains insufficient. We investigate the statistical properties of reconnection turbulence in the framework of the self-driven reconnection. Using the open-source software package AMUN, we first perform numerical simulations of turbulent magnetic reconnection. We then obtain the statistical results of reconnection turbulence by traditional statistical methods such as the power spectrum and structure function. Our numerical results demonstrate: (1) the velocity spectrum of reconnection turbulence follows the classical Kolmogorov type of $E\propto k^{-5/3}$, while the magnetic field spectrum is steeper than the Kolmogorov spectrum, which are independent of limited resistivity, guide field, and isothermal or adiabatic fluid states; (2) most of the simulations show the anisotropy cascade, except that the presence of a guide field leads to an isotropic cascade; (3) reconnection turbulence is incompressible in the adiabatic state, with energy distribution dominated by the velocity solenoidal component; (4) different from pure magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, the intermittency of the velocity field is stronger than that of the magnetic field in reconnection turbulence. The steep magnetic field spectrum, together with the velocity spectrum of Kolmogorov type, can characterize the feature of the reconnection turbulence. In the case of the presence of the guide field, the isotropy of the reconnection turbulence cascade is also different from the cascade mode of pure MHD turbulence. Our experimental results provide new insights into the properties of reconnection turbulence, which will contribute to advancing the self-driven reconnection theory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09986" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QPOs in a highly magnetized ultra-compact X-ray binary 4U 1626-67</a><span class="id">[2510.09986]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the detection of mHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in four NuSTAR observations of 4U 1626-67 during its recent spin-down episode. By using a novel method based on the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), we present the first QPO-phase-resolved timing and spectral analysis of accreting X-ray pulsars in low mass X-ray binaries. Broadband QPO waveforms have been reconstructed and exhibit approximately sinusoidal shapes, with fractional amplitudes that vary with energy. In addition, we find that spin pulse profiles exhibit stable shapes between different QPO phases with different instantaneous fluxes, while the fractional root-mean-square (rms) is distinct for different observations. In this source, both QPO-phase-resolved and averaged spectra can be modeled with a negative and positive powerlaws exponential (NPEX) model, and their spectral evolutions show a similar trend, suggesting that the QPO modulation is caused by accretion rate variability instead of a geometric obscuration. These results provide new constraints on accretion physics in strongly magnetized neutron stars and the underlying mechanisms of QPOs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chandra/HETG and NuSTAR Observations of V750 Ara, a $γ\,$Cas-type Star</a><span class="id">[2510.10007]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present 197 ks HETG and 95 ks NuSTAR spectra of the $\gamma\,$Cas-type object V750 Ara. The high-resolution X-ray spectra show that the target is similar to other objects of this class. Data are interpreted under the assumption that the X-rays come from an accreting white dwarf, and our analysis implies an accretion rate of about $3\times10^{-11}M_\odot\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Emission lines are weak, and predominantly from hydrogen-like ions: Mg XII, Si XIV, and S XVI. H-like and He-like Fe are both present, but Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence is weak, being significantly detected only in the NuSTAR spectrum, but was not obviously detected in the HETG dispersed or zeroth-order spectra. The flux was variable above a level expected by Poisson statistics. There were no significant changes in the spectral hardness, though we are limited by lack of soft signal below 1 keV. Emission lines of Mg and Si were strong enough to measure velocity offsets and widths which were found to be marginally inconsistent. The H-like Mg line is consistent with instrumental broadening only, but shows a 300 km/s blueshift. He-like Mg and H-like Si lines have no significant shift in velocity but are broadened by about 1000 km/s. This suggests either different physical origins or velocity structure differing with plasma temperature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comprehensive X-ray Spectral-timing Analysis of GRS 1915+105 Based on Insight-HXMT Observations</a><span class="id">[2510.10017]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRS 1915+105 has been well studied since its discovery, and is well-known for its complex light curve variability. Using the full currently available Insight-HXMT dataset from July 2017 to June 2023, we make a comprehensive spectral-timing analysis of this source and report four main findings. First, we uncover a QPO frequency rising branch between MJD 58206 and 58230, where the centroid frequency increases from $\sim$2 Hz to $\sim$6 Hz, consistent with a spectral state transition from the hard to intermediate state. This rising branch completes the full QPO frequency evolution cycle when combined with the subsequent frequency decay phase, and had been missed in prior NICER and Insight-HXMT studies. Second, we identify a previously unreported Flare 3 during the obscured state, which shows distinct spectral and timing properties compared to the earlier flares. Third, we detect sub-Hz QPOs (&lt;1 Hz) in all three flares, specifically at $\sim$0.01 Hz in Flare 1 and $\sim$0.2 Hz in both Flares 2 and 3. In particular, the weak $\sim$0.2 Hz signals observed in Flare 3 indicate ongoing coronal activity despite strong obscuration. Finally, a comparison between QPOs above and below 1 Hz suggests distinct origins, with the former likely arising from Lense-Thirring precession of the inner hot flow and the latter from magnetic perturbations driving a failed disk wind. These findings offer new insights into the unique accretion geometry and variability behaviors of GRS 1915+105.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation. Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid (CLOE). 6: Impact of systematic uncertainties on the cosmological analysis</a><span class="id">[2510.10021]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extracting cosmological information from the Euclid galaxy survey will require modelling numerous systematic effects during the inference process. This implies varying a large number of nuisance parameters, which have to be marginalised over before reporting the constraints on the cosmological parameters. This is a delicate process, especially with such a large parameter space, which could result in biased cosmological results. In this work, we study the impact of different choices for modelling systematic effects and prior distribution of nuisance parameters for the final Euclid Data Release, focusing on the 3$\times$2pt analysis for photometric probes and the galaxy power spectrum multipoles for the spectroscopic probes. We explore the effect of intrinsic alignments, linear galaxy bias, magnification bias, multiplicative cosmic shear bias and shifts in the redshift distribution for the photometric probes, as well as the purity of the spectroscopic sample. We find that intrinsic alignment modelling has the most severe impact with a bias up to $6\,\sigma$ on the Hubble constant $H_0$ if neglected, followed by mis-modelling of the redshift evolution of galaxy bias, yielding up to $1.5\,\sigma$ on the parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m} /0.3}$. Choosing a too optimistic prior for multiplicative bias can also result in biases of the order of $0.7\,\sigma$ on $S_8$. We also find that the precision on the estimate of the purity of the spectroscopic sample will be an important driver for the constraining power of the galaxy clustering full-shape analysis. These results will help prioritise efforts to improve the modelling and calibration of systematic effects in Euclid.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion onto Reissner-Nordström naked singularities</a><span class="id">[2510.10043]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nearly every galactic core contains a supermassive compact object, hypothesized to be a Kerr black hole. It was only with the advent of Event Horizon Telescope observations that the predictions of this hypothesis could be observationally tested for our own Galaxy, and the nearby elliptical M87, on spatial scales comparable to the gravitational radius. At the same time it became possible to test whether alternatives such as naked singularities in general relativity, or similar objects in alternative theories of gravity, are excluded by the data. These and other observational developments renewed interest in non-Kerr spacetime metrics, also in the context of active galactic nuclei at cosmological distances. Recently, we have shown that accreting naked singularities in the Reissner-Nordström metric of general relativity tend to produce strong outflows. The geometry and origin of these winds is studied here, and their parameter dependence is investigated. To this end we performed numerical GR hydrodynamical simulations of accretion of electrically neutral matter in the Reissner-Nordström metric and discussed the results in the context of analytic predictions of fluid motion in this spacetime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10092" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights into Planet Formation from the Ages, Masses, and Elemental Abundances of Host Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.10092]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>How planetary systems form and evolve is a key question in astronomy. Revealing how host star properties, such as elemental abundances, age, and mass, differ from those of non-host stars, and how they correlate with planetary characteristics such as radius, provides new insights into the formation and evolutionary pathways of planetary systems. We determine precise ages for 18890 dwarfs and subgiants from the LAMOST-Kepler-Gaia sample with a mean age uncertainty of about 15 percent (median about 10 percent). Within the framework of Galactic chemical evolution, we find that about 86 percent of planet-hosting stars younger than 8 Gyr occupy the upper branch ([Fe/H] &gt; -0.2) of the characteristic V-shaped age-metallicity relation of the Galactic disk. Based on guiding radii (Rg), we further infer that about 19 percent of these young hosts likely originated in the inner disk and subsequently migrated to the solar neighborhood. Among stars older than 10 Gyr, host stars tend to be more metal-rich, with nearly 59 percent having [Fe/H] &gt; -0.2. This suggests that both young and old planet-hosting stars preferentially form in relatively metal-rich environments. However, for host stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -0.2, we find that their metallicities are on average lower by about 0.16 dex compared to non-host stars of similar age and mass, indicating that [Fe/H] is unlikely to be the dominant factor governing planet formation in metal-poor environments. We also identify a systematic depletion of volatile elements, especially carbon, in planet hosts. Moreover, host star [Fe/H] exhibits a weak correlation with planet radius, while [alpha/Fe] primarily support the formation of small planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Propagation and Damping of Alfvenic Fluctuations in the Outer Solar Corona and Solar Wind</a><span class="id">[2510.10106]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze \textit{Parker Solar Probe} and \textit{Solar Orbiter} observations to investigate the propagation and dissipation of Alfvénic fluctuations from the outer corona to 1 AU. Conservation of wave-action flux provides the theoretical baseline for how fluctuation amplitudes scale with the Alfvén Mach number $M_a$, once solar-wind acceleration is accounted for. Departures from this scaling quantify the net balance between energy injection and dissipation. Fluctuation amplitudes follow wave-action conservation for $M_a &lt; M_a^{b}$ but steepen beyond this break point, which typically lies near the Alfvén surface ($M_a \approx 1$) yet varies systematically with normalized cross helicity $\sigma_c$ and fluctuation scale. In slow, quasi-balanced streams, the transition occurs at $M_a \lesssim 1$; in fast, imbalanced wind, WKB-like scaling persists to $M_a \gtrsim 1$. Outer-scale fluctuations maintain wave-action conservation to larger $M_a$ than inertial-range modes. The turbulent heating rate $Q$ is largest below $M_a^{b}$, indicating a preferential heating zone shaped by the degree of imbalance. Despite this, the Alfvénic energy flux $F_a$ remains elevated, and the corresponding damping length $\Lambda_d = F_a/Q$ remains sufficiently large to permit long-range propagation before appreciable damping occurs. Normalized damping lengths $\Lambda_d/H_A$, where $H_A$ is the inverse Alfvén-speed scale height, are near unity for $M_a \lesssim M_a^{b}$ but decline with increasing $M_a$ and decreasing $U$, implying that incompressible reflection-driven turbulence alone cannot account for the observed dissipation. Additional damping mechanisms – such as compressible effects – are likely required to account for the observed heating rates across much of the parameter space.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possible Quasi-Period Oscillation Signals in the Unique Event of GRB 250702DBE/EP250702a?</a><span class="id">[2510.10139]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRB 250702DBE was time-consequently triggered by GBM onboard the Fermi satellite. It is uncertain which celestial catalog is suitable for this special ultra-long event to belong to. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the lightcurves obtained by Fermi-GBM detectors. In the energy band of 8-1000 keV, no Quasi-Period Oscillation (QPO) signals are found in the lightcurve of the first burst 250702D, a possible QPO signal of 0.046 Hz corresponding to a period of 21.7 s is found in the lightcurve of the second burst 250702B, and a possible QPO signal of 0.024 Hz corresponding to a period of 41.7 s is found in the lightcurve of last burst 250702E. The significance level of the possible QPO signals is comprehensively examined. In addition, we examine the spectral properties of the sources. In general, a broken power law is suitable for modeling the spectral data from 8 keV to 40 MeV.

Multi-wavelength, multi-method research is playing an increasingly crucial role. Binaries account for a substantial fraction of all stellar systems and research into binaries is of fundamental importance. LAMOST J064137.77+045743.8 has not yet been recorded in the SIMBAD astronomical database. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of LAMOST J064137.77+045743.8 using multi-band spectroscopic, astrometric, and photometric data. The low-resolution spectra from Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) suggest that LAMOST J064137.77+045743.8 is a binary consisting of an A7-type subgiant star ($T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 7500 K and log $g$ $\sim$ 3.9) and a cool red dwarf star. Astrometric data from Globe Astrometric Interferometers for Astrophysics support the binary speculation with a Renormalized Unit Weight Error metric value of 1.9. Additional flux observations in the infrared bands further corroborate the presence of a red dwarf companion. The i-band flare detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) photometric observations bolsters the interpretation of an M-type red dwarf companion. The radial velocity variations in the H$\alpha$ lines from LAMOST medium-resolution spectra and the light curves from ZTF both support the classification of the A7 subgiant as a pulsating star. The binary either has a long orbital period, a non-eclipsing binary orbit, or extremely shallow eclipses. Future asteroseismology studies will further probe the internal physics of the A7 subgiants. Research on binaries is incredibly fascinating.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Signals of the First Molecules from the Dark Ages in the Presence of Primordial Magnetic Fields</a><span class="id">[2510.10212]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate how primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) affect the formation kinetics of the first molecules, H$_2$, HD, and HeH$^+$, as well as the populations of rovibrational levels and the global signals in the rovibrational transitions of H$_2$ and HD. We show that PMFs can significantly speed up the formation and destruction of the first molecules, leading to an increase in the number density of H$_2$ and HD molecules and a decrease in the number density of HeH$^+$ ion-molecules compared to the case without PMFs. We demonstrate that more frequent collisions of the gas particles in such models alter the ortho-to-para ratio of hydrogen molecules, making it a potential probe of the thermal history of gas in the early Universe. In contrast to the standard cosmological model, where the global signal from the first molecules appears as an absorption feature in the cosmic microwave background spectrum, cosmological models with PMFs can produce an emission signal. Specifically, for non-helical PMFs with $n_B = -2.9$ and a strength of $\sim 1$ nG, the signal transforms into emission with an amplitude of about $\sim 0.5$ Jy/sr. This signal is comparable in magnitude to other known CMB spectral distortions and falls within the detection capabilities of several proposed missions, including Super-PIXIE, Multi-SIMBAD (4 units), and Voyage2050. We show that both the amplitude and the spectral range of the global signals from the first molecules are highly sensitive to the spectral index $n_B$, the strength $B_0$, and the helicity of the PMFs. Therefore, the global signals from the first molecules can serve as a potential probe of PMFs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Evidence for Extragalactic Einstein Probe Transients associated with Long Gamma-ray Bursts</a><span class="id">[2510.10267]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of extragalactic fast X-ray transients (EFXTs) remains a fundamental open question in high-energy astrophysics.

Here, we present a comparative analysis of their cosmic formation histories, revealing that EP-EFXTs and lGRBs share a similar evolutionary trend-showing a marked decline at $z&lt;1.0$ and a plateau beyond $1.0&lt;z&lt;5$-which clearly distinguishes them from short GRBs. This result is derived from a rigorously selected sample of EP-EFXTs, using Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ method to reconstruct, for the first time, the luminosity function and formation rate of EP-EFXTs without any assumptions.

Decades later, Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (HRIEUV), operating halfway between Earth and the Sun, revealed thousands of even smaller brightenings in the quiet corona - tiny &quot;campfires&quot; that are smaller and far more frequent than the fundamental nanoflares observed from 1 AU. We analyze over 12,000 of these events, deriving their thermal energies using multiple geometric models to account for volume uncertainties. Although absolute values vary, all models yield consistent power-law energy distributions and ranges, confirming their flare-like behavior. These picoflares, spanning 10^20-10^24 erg, were detected exactly between the Sun and Earth. They occur up to sixty times more often than nanoflares seen from Earth orbit and supply about 1% of the quiet-Sun coronal heating power. This previously unseen energy source may be a missing component in the solar energy balance. Their discovery extends the flare energy spectrum to smaller scales, and future Solar Orbiter observations at 0.28 AU may reveal the most fundamental flare events that sustain the million-degree solar corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A revision of the lifetime of submoons: tidal dynamics with the Euler-Lagrange equation</a><span class="id">[2510.10344]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Submoons, moons orbiting other moons, may be exotic environments capable of hosting extraterrestrial life. We extend previous studies to revise the maximum lifetime of these objects due to planetary, lunar and sublunar tidal migration. Using the Euler-Lagrange equation with a tidal dissipation process as specified by the Constant Geometric Lag model, we derive and solve the governing equations numerically to map the semi-major axis parameter space for star-planet-moon-submoon systems in which the submoon could be massive enough to host life. We find that Earth could have hosted asteroid-sized submoons ($\sim10^{15}\mathrm{kg}$), whereas a submoon near the previously proposed upper limit ($\sim4.6\cdot10^{17}\mathrm{kg}$) would have driven the Moon $\sim30\%$ farther from Earth than its current orbit. A Warm Jupiter system like Kepler1625 has greater potential of hosting a massive submoon. We found that a submoon of around $10\%M_{\text{Luna}}$ could survive if Kepler1625b's hypothesized moon were $68\%$ farther away then what the best-fit model suggests ($67R_{\mathrm{p}}$ instead of $40R_{\mathrm{p}}$). Giant submoons of mass $1.8M_{\oplus}$ are stable in a Kepler1625-like system. In these cases, the moon orbit is wide ($&gt; 100R_{\mathrm{p}}$). Decreasing the submoon mass to a habitability prerequisite of $0.5M_{\oplus}$, likely needed for a stable atmosphere and plate tectonics, leads to a smaller total number of stable iterations relative to the $m_{sm}=1.8M_{\oplus}$ case. In fact, we identified a minimum number of stable iterations on intermediate submoon mass-scales of around $0.1M_{\oplus}$. This is likely due to an interplay between small tidal forces at small submoon masses and small Roche-Limits at very high submoon masses. If submoon formation pathways in Warm Jupiter systems prefer such intermediate mass-scales, habitable submoons could be a rare phenomenon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 shows Type-B quasi-periodic oscillations across the hard-intermediate and soft-intermediate states</a><span class="id">[2510.10353]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a timing analysis of \textit{Insight}-HXMT observations of the black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 across a bright soft X-ray flare on 2023 September 19 (MJD 60206). At the peak of the flare, the source undergoes a brief transition from the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) into the soft-intermediate state (SIMS), marked by the simultaneous appearance of three discrete radio jet ejections, a drop in broadband noise in the 2$-$10 keV band, and the presence of a narrow quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a characteristic “U”-shaped phase-lag spectrum and a quality factor of $Q \geq 6$, features that robustly identify it as a Type-B QPO. The Type-C QPO, which was clearly detected in the HIMS prior to the flare, is not observed at the flare's peak and only reappears afterward. Most notably, we find that the Type-B QPO is not restricted to the SIMS: it is present throughout all our observations, including those taken in the HIMS, where it appears as a broad shoulder of the Type-C QPO. During the flare, the Type-B and Type-C QPOs exhibit distinct evolutionary trends in frequency, fractional rms amplitude, and phase lag. These results challenge the traditional view that Type-B QPOs are exclusive to the SIMS, a state that is, in fact, defined by their appearance in the power spectrum, and directly linked to discrete jet ejections. Instead, our findings suggest that the physical conditions giving rise to Type-B QPOs occur more broadly within the inner accretion flow.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constranits of dynamical dark energy models from different observational datasets</a><span class="id">[2510.10439]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 indicate that dark energy may be a dynamical quantity with a time-varying equation of state. This challenges the core assumptions of the $\Lambda$CDM model and has generated significant interest in dynamical dark energy models. Therefore, studying the parameterization of the equation of state for dynamical dark energy is crucial. Existing work has achieved fruitful results in the dark energy models, exploring various parameterization forms, but it is relatively scattered and lacks systematic parameter constraints based on the latest dataset combinations. We use the $\Lambda$CDM as a baseline model and carry out rigorous statistical constraints on key cosmological parameters for seven representative parameterization models. Planck PR4 and DESI DR2 observations are incorporated into our study. We use three dataset combinations: CMB+BAO+PantheonPlus, CMB+BAO+DES-Y5, and CMB+BAO+Union3. The ${H}_{0}$ and ${\sigma }_{8}$ values of all dynamical dark energy models are lower than the $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating that our results may not effectively alleviate ${H}_{0}$ tension, but can significantly reduce ${\sigma }_{8}$ tension. By comparing the $\chi^2$ and the Akaike Information Criterion obtained for each model, we demonstrate that the linear Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization model is not the optimal choice in all cases. Specifically, when combined with the CMB+BAO+DES-Y5 dataset, the Barboza-Alcaniz, Logarithmic, and Exponential models demonstrate superior statistical fitting performance compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The Barboza-Alcaniz model shows a great advantage in fitting performance, leading to the most significant improvement.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermal Deformations in Super-Eddington Magnetized Neutron Stars: Implications for Continuous Gravitational-Wave Detectability</a><span class="id">[2510.10443]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rapidly rotating neutron stars (NSs) are promising targets for continuous gravitational-wave (CGW) searches with current and next-generation ground-based GW detectors.

To accurately compute the resulting polarization of the stellar wind, we develop a method for the Thomson scattering that accounts for the finite size of the companion star. By fitting the optical polarization data, we constrain the system parameters, such as eccentricity, the momentum ratio of the two winds, and mass-loss rate from the companion star. We find that (i) the predicted eccentricity $e\sim 0.1$ is smaller than the values derived from the radial velocity curve and (ii) the orbital phase of the periastron is $\nu_{\rm p}=0.5-0.6$, which is consistent with the previous polarization study of Kravtsov et al. Additionally, we estimate the mass-loss rate from the companion star and the momentum ratio of two winds as $\dot{M}\sim 2\times 10^{-6}\rm M_{\odot}~{\rm year^{-1}}$ and $\eta&gt;0.1$, respectively. Assuming that the pulsar wind carries the spin-down energy, the spin-down magnetic field of the putative pulsar inferred from these parameters is of the order of $B\sim 10^{14}\mathrm{G}$, which may support the highly-B pulsar or magnetar scenario for the compact object of $\rm{LS\ I} +61^{\circ}303$.

Our analysis reveals fundamental insights into the physics governing state transitions in stellar-mass black holes. We discover distinct bimodal flux distributions in the 8-79 keV band with well-separated peaks, contrasting with overlapping distributions in the 3-8 keV band. This energy-dependent bimodality establishes hard X-rays as the optimal diagnostic for state classification, directly tracing the geometric transformation between corona-dominated and disk-dominated configurations. Power spectral analysis uncovers state-dependent characteristic frequencies shifting from 0.050 Hz (hard) to 0.074 Hz (intermediate), with featureless red noise in soft states. These frequencies correspond to disk truncation radii evolving from $\sim$5.5 $R_g$ to $\sim$2 $R_g$, providing direct observational evidence for the inward progression of the accretion disk during state transitions. Frequency-dependent time lags evolve systematically from $\sim$50 ms hard lags at 0.1 Hz in hard states to near-zero in soft states, quantifying the collapse of the Comptonizing corona. Linear rms-flux relations persist across all states with parameters that precisely track the relative contributions of thermal versus non-thermal emission components. Most remarkably, we identify a failed state transition (observation 30302019006) exhibiting anticorrelated band behavior, suppressed variability ($F_{var}$ &lt; 1.38\%), and apparent sub-ISCO truncation.

In this work, we search for evidence of DM-proton scattering with an interaction cross section $\sigma\!=\!\sigma_0 (\frac{v}{c})^n$ for $n=0,2$ and $4$, corresponding e.g. to velocity-independent contact interactions from heavy mediators, velocity-dependent pseudoscalar-mediated scattering, and higher-order dipole interactions, respectively, using high-redshift ($z \sim4-10$) ultraviolet galaxy luminosity functions (UVLFs) observed by Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We employ an adjusted implementation of GALLUMI combined with the modified Boltzmann solver CLASS DMeff that accounts for interacting DM, and incorporate UVLF data from both blank and lensed HST fields, alongside Planck CMB data and the Pantheon supernova catalog in a Bayesian analysis framework to set constraints on $\sigma_0$. Our results show that including lensed UVLF data, which probe fainter galaxies than the blank HST fields and thus smaller scales, leads to a substantial improvement in the constraints on $\sigma_0$ for $n&gt;0$, surpassing existing bounds from Milky-Way (MW) satellite abundance and CMB anisotropies. For $m_{\chi} = 1\,\rm MeV $, for example, we set the upper bounds at $8.3\times 10^{-26} \, \rm cm^2$ for $n=2$ and $1.2\times 10^{-22} \, \rm cm^2$ for $n=4$. For $n=0$, our bound is within an order of magnitude of those from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and MW satellites.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10817" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the discovery of meteoritic mineral Zolenskyite; The artificial origin should not be overlooked</a><span class="id">[2510.10817]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently a new meteoritic mineral, Zolenskyite (Fe0.99Mn0.04Ca0.01Cr1.99S3.98), was discovered from the Indarch meteorite. Zolenskyite was structurally indexed as the monoclinic C2/m CrNb2Se4 - Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 12.84(1) Å, b = 3.44(1) Å, c = 5.94(1) Å and \b{eta} = 117(1)°. Zolenskyite was reported as high-pressure phase formed from Daubréelite at high pressures and temperatures in highly shocked regions of the EH parent asteroid. Although this discovery provides valuable information about the origin of meteoritic mineral assemblages, the results and conclusions raise controversies with those reported in previous articles where the synthetic FeCr2S4 was described. In this review, an alternative analysis of the supplementary X-ray data from Zolenskyite was made and yields to the monoclinic I2/m Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 5.940 Å, b = 3.440 Å, c = 11.441 Å and \b{eta} = 90.55°, in agreement with previous results in the literature and differ from those reported above. Regarding the genesis of Zolenskyite and according to solid-state laboratory synthesis, the transformation of cubic FeCr2S4 phase (ideal composition of Daubréelite) to monoclinic FeCr2S4 (ideal composition of Zolenskyite) requires a process whose replication in Shock metamorphism stages is not well established and remains an open issue to address, together with another open issue related to the real composition of meteoritic minerals, with minor and trace metals, which is often overlooked when compared with synthetic ideal compositions. Whatever the results to be obtained by addressing the above open issues, they will shed more light on the genesis of Zolenskyite. In this context, it is worth to promote an open debate about the hypothesis of artificial origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Survival of satellites during the migration of a Hot Jupiter</a><span class="id">[2510.10826]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the origin and stability of extrasolar satellites orbiting close-in gas giants, focusing on whether these satellites can survive planetary migration within a protoplanetary disk. To address this question, we used Posidonius, an N-Body code with an integrated tidal model, which we expanded to account for the migration of a gas giant within a disk. Our simulations include tidal interactions between a $1M_\odot$ star and a $1M_{Jup}$ planet, as well as between the planet and its satellite, while neglecting tides raised by the star on the satellite. We adopt a standard equilibrium tide model for the satellite, planet, and star, and additionally explore the impact of dynamical tides in the convective regions of both the star and planet on satellite survival. We examine key parameters, including the initial satellite-planet distance, disk lifetime (proxy for the planet's final orbital distance), satellite mass, and satellite tidal dissipation. For simulations incorporating dynamical tides, we explore three different initial stellar rotation periods. We find that satellite survival is rare if the satellite has nonzero tidal dissipation. Survival is only possible for initial orbital distances of at least 0.6 times the Jupiter-Io separation and for planets orbiting beyond about 0.1 AU. Satellites that fail to survive are either 1) tidally disrupted, as they experience orbital decay and cross the Roche limit, or 2) dynamically disrupted, where eccentricity excitation drives their periastron within the Roche limit. Satellite survival is more likely for low tidal dissipation and higher satellite mass. Given that satellites around close-in planets appear unlikely to survive planetary migration, our findings suggest that if such satellites do exist, another process should be invoked. In that context, we also discuss the claim of the existence of a putative satellite around WASP-49 A b.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On The Orbital Evolution of Multiple Wide Super-Jupiters: How Disk Migration and Dispersal Shape the Stability of The PDS 70 System</a><span class="id">[2510.11021]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Direct imaging has revealed exoplanet systems hosting multiple wide-orbit Super-Jupiters, where planet-planet interactions can shape their long-term dynamical evolution. These strong perturbations may lead to orbital instability, raising questions about the long-term survival of such systems. Shortly after formation, planet-disk interactions can shepherd planets into mean-motion resonances, which may promote long-term stability as seen in HR 8799. However, early-stage processes such as disk photoevaporation and viscosity can influence these outcomes. The $\sim$5 Myr-old PDS 70 system offers a unique laboratory to investigate these processes: its two massive ($&gt;$4 $M_{Jup}$), wide-orbit ($&gt;$20 AU) giants are still embedded in their natal disk. We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations of the system, allowing the disk to disperse via photoevaporation. Once the disk dissipates, we continue to track the planets' orbital evolution over Gyr timescales using N-body simulations. We find that the system is likely to remain stable for $&gt;$ 1 Gyr. To assess the importance of disk-driven evolution, we compare these results with disk-free N-body simulations using orbital parameters constrained by orbit fits that include recent relative astrometry and radial velocities from the literature. In this case, we find that only $\lesssim 4\%$ of posterior is stable for 100 Myr, highlighting the importance of considering disk-driven evolution for long-term dynamics stability of exoplanetary systems. We also simulate two three-planet configurations including the proposed inner candidate &quot;PDS 70 d&quot;, finding that a higher photoevaporation leads the system to become unstable in $&lt;$ 10 Myr.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast radio bursts shed light on direct gravity test on cosmological scales</a><span class="id">[2510.11022]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A key measure of gravity is the relation between the Weyl potential $\Psi+\Phi$ and the matter overdensity $\delta_m$, capsulized as an effective gravitational constant $G_{\rm light}$ for light motion. Its value, together with the possible spatial and temporal variation, is essential in probing physics beyond Einstein gravity. However, the lack of an unbiased proxy of $\delta_m$ prohibits direct measurement of $G_{\rm light}$. We point out that the equivalence principle ensures the dispersion measure (DM) of localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) as a good proxy of $\delta_m$. We further propose a FRB-based method $F_G$ to directly measure $G_{\rm light}$, combining galaxy-DM of localized FRBs and galaxy-weak lensing cross-correlations. The measurement, with a conservative cut $k\leq 0.1h$/Mpc, can achieve a precision of $\lesssim 10\% \sqrt{10^5/N_{\rm FRB}}$ over 10 equal-width redshift bins at $z\lesssim 1$. The major systematic error, arising from the clustering bias of electrons traced by the FRB DM, is subdominant ($\sim 5\%$). It can be further mitigated to the $\lesssim 1\%$ level, based on the gastrophysics-agnostic behavior that the bias of total baryonic matter (ionized diffuse gas, stars, neutral hydrogen, etc) approaches unity at sufficiently large scales. Therefore, FRBs shed light on gravitational physics across spatial and temporal scales spanning over 20 orders of magnitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resonant W and Z Boson Production in FSRQ Jets: Implications for Diffuse Neutrino Fluxes</a><span class="id">[2510.11030]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Blazars, particularly Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), are well-known for their ability to accelerate a substantial population of electrons and positrons, as inferred from multiwavelength radiation observations. Therefore, these astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy electron–positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron–positron annihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the resonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of the FSRQ 3C 279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the cosmological population of this http URL incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function and its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across cosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a pronounced peak at redshift $z \sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well below the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as IceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the expected flux from the $Z$ boson production could account for approximately $10^{-3}$ of the total diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of Standard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments and emphasize the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, illustrating that even rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle but quantifiable imprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrinos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of Axion Stars in Galactic Magnetic Fields</a><span class="id">[2510.11032]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform a linear mode analysis of a uniformly distributed cloud of axion-like particles (ALPs) embedded in a magnetized intergalactic medium, in order to investigate the stability of axion stars under realistic astrophysical conditions. We find that when the frequency $\omega$ of transverse waves is much smaller than the collision frequency $\nu_c$ of the intergalactic plasma, the conversion of ALPs into photons occurs on timescales far longer than the age of the Universe, ensuring stability of the star. In the opposite regime, $\omega \gg \nu_c$, significant axion-to-photon conversion may occur if the condition $\tfrac{\beta^2}{m_a^2-\omega_p^2} &lt; 1$ is satisfied, where $\beta$ depends on the ALP–photon coupling and the magnetic field, $m_a$ is the ALP mass, and $\omega_p$ is the plasma frequency. We have calculated up to second order in perturbations to compute the effect of an ALP star. Since the calculated value of parameter $\beta ^2$ is extremely small in comparison with $\omega^2_p$, we argue that the direct detection of an axion star is highly unlikely in experiments like NCLE. However, since the calculated $\beta$ is extremely small compared to $\omega_p$, this requires an unrealistically fine-tuned coincidence between $m_a$ and $\omega_p$.

In particular, the TeV peak is displaced from the cluster center by several tidal radii in the trailing direction of the proper motion of UKS 1.

The eruption was discovered on 2024 August 1.8 by \textit{Swift}, and subsequently monitored using \textit{AstroSat}'s UVIT and SXT, along with Swift/UVOT and XRT. The multi-wavelength light curves reveal a rapid UV-optical decline, followed by a plateau phase exhibiting 1.26-day modulations consistent with the orbital period. The Supersoft (SSS) X-ray emission, that emerged by day 5, exhibited a double peak, suggesting variable obscuration that could be due to an inhomogeneous nova ejecta or due to a nova super-remnant along the line of sight. Time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy shows a blackbody component with T $\approx 10^6$ K. The SEDs obtained concurrently in the UV, peaking at T $\approx$ 20,000 K and with a source radius $\sim$2-3 R$_\odot$, are inconsistent with emission from the secondary star or nova photosphere alone. Instead, the UV emission is attributed to an irradiated accretion disk that survived the eruption. The persistent UV plateau and its temperature suggest that the accretion disk was not completely disrupted and resumed activity within days, consistent with recent findings in other rapidly recurring novae such as U Sco and M31N 2008-12a.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11249" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rings around irregular bodies I. Structure of the resonance mesh, applications to Chariklo, Haumea and Quaoar</a><span class="id">[2510.11249]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Three ring systems have been discovered to date around small irregular objects of the solar system (Chariklo, Haumea and Quaoar). For the three bodies, material is observed near the second-order 1/3 Spin-Orbit Resonance (SOR) with the central object, and in the case of Quaoar, a ring is also observed near the second-order resonance 5/7 SOR. This suggests that second-order SORs may play a central role in ring confinement. This paper aims at better understanding this role from a theoretical point of view. It also provides a basis to better interpret the results obtained from N-body simulations and presented in a companion paper. A Hamiltonian approach yields the topological structure of phase portraits for SORs of orders from one to five. Two cases of non-axisymmetric potentials are examined: a triaxial ellipsoid characterized by an elongation parameter C22 and a body with mass anomaly mu, a dimensionless parameter that measures the dipole component of the body's gravitational field. The estimated triaxial shape of Chariklo shows that its corotation points are marginally unstable, those of Haumea are largely unstable, while those of Quaoar are safely stable. The topologies of the phase portraits show that only first- (aka Lindblad) and second-order SORs can significantly perturb a dissipative collisional ring. We calculate the widths, the maximum eccentricities and excitation time scales associated with first- and second-order SORs, as a function of C22 and mu. Applications to Chariklo, Haumea and Quaoar using mu   0.001 show that the first- and second-order SORs caused by their triaxial shapes excite large (&gt;  0.1) orbital eccentricities on the particles, making the regions inside the 1/2 SOR inhospitable for rings. Conversely, the 1/3 and 5/7 SORs caused by mass anomalies excite moderate eccentricities (&lt;  0.01), and are thus a more favorable place for the presence of a ring.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting FRB 20121102A: milliarcsecond localisation and a decreasing dispersion measure</a><span class="id">[2510.11352]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>FRB 20121102A is the original repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source and also the first to be localised to milliarcsecond precision using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI).

In this work, we use the European VLBI Network (EVN) to (re-)localise FRB 20121102A and its associated persistent radio source (PRS). We confirm that the two are co-located – improving on previous results by a factor of  4 and constraining the FRB and PRS co-location to  12 pc transverse offset.

Moreover, it is predicted that for an isothermal elliptical potential the source position both lies on Witt's Hyperbola and coincides with the center of Wynne's Ellipse (fitted through the four images). Thus, by fitting Witt's Hyperbolae to several quartets of images - ten are known in Abell 1689 - the points of intersection provide an estimate for the center for the assumed isothermal elliptical potential. We introduce a new figure of merit defined by the offset of the center of Wynne's Ellipse from Witt's Hyperbola. This offset quantifies deviations from an ideal elliptical isothermal potential and serves as a discriminant to exclude poorly fitted quadruples and assign greater weight to intersections of hyperbolae of better fitting systems. Applying the method to 10 quads (after excluding 7 poorly fitted quads) in Abell 1689, we find the potential is centered within 11&quot; of the BCG, X-ray center, flexion-based center and the center found from a total strong lensing analysis.

However, the saturation of ice bands in highly inclined disks hinders the measurement of ice abundances using classical spectroscopy. This is unfortunate as the presence and more importantly abundance of ices plays a key role in, e.g., the evolution of dust (because it modifies the sticking properties) and the composition of planetesimals and exoplanetary atmospheres. To overcome this issue and quantify the ice abundance within disks, we introduce a new method based on measuring the changes in the apparent disk thickness as a function of wavelength, which is directly and quantitatively related to the grain opacity. Specifically, we expect i) that the increased opacity within ice bands should result in a thicker disk than in the adjacent continuum, and ii) the thickness variations to be proportional to the abundance of ice. We extracted the disk thickness in model images of edge-on disks containing different abundances of water ice, as well as in James Webb Space Telescope spectral imaging of four edge-on disks. For both models and observations, the disk thickness decreases toward longer wavelengths except across the positions of ice absorption features where the thickness is enhanced across the band. In the model images, we demonstrate that this effect increases with ice abundance without any hint of saturation. This definitely demonstrates the presence of the ice species within each disk and confirms our expectation that this method can be applied to estimate ice abundances. Thanks to this method, it will thus be possible to constrain the ice abundance in highly inclined disks with disks model fitting. Unlike spectroscopic analysis, this method is not subject to saturation and should therefore be more robust and applicable to all disks for which the two surfaces can be resolved.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11363" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Updated constraints on interacting dark energy: A comprehensive analysis using multiple CMB probes, DESI DR2, and supernovae observations</a><span class="id">[2510.11363]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and DESY5 type Ia supernova (SN) data, indicate a significant deviation from $\Lambda$CDM, which seems to suggest that this deviation can be explained by an interaction between dark energy and dark matter. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis by utilizing the latest DESI DR2 BAO data in conjunction with CMB data from ACT, SPT, Planck, and WMAP, along with SN data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We consider four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$. Our analysis indicates that CMB experiments other than Planck enhance the evidence for an interaction in the IDE models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$. In particular, when using the SPT+DESI+DESY5 data, the IDE model with $Q = \beta H_0 \rho_{\rm de}$ gives $\beta = -0.4170 \pm 0.1220$, with a deviation from zero reaching $3.4\sigma$ level. When replacing DESY5 with PantheonPlus, this deviation weakens to $2.1\sigma$ level, but remains relatively significant. Furthermore, the Bayes factors of the IDE model with $Q = \beta H_0 \rho_{\rm de}$ are positive in all cases, providing a moderate-to-strong preference over $\Lambda$CDM. Overall, our comprehensive analysis clearly suggests that the IDE models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$ (especially, $Q = \beta H_0 \rho_{\rm de}$) provide strong evidence supporting the existence of interaction and are more preferred by the current cosmological data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electromagnetic Observables of Weakly Collisional Black Hole Accretion</a><span class="id">[2510.11365]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The black holes in the Event Horizon Telescope sources Messier 87* and Sagittarius A* (SgrA*) are embedded in a hot, collisionless plasma that is fully described in kinetic theory yet is usually modeled as an ideal, magnetized fluid.

Previous work studied the temporal behavior of some magnetar bursts and employed the Fast Rise Exponential Decay (FRED) model to fit pulses of MXB. However, whether there is other kind of pulse shape has not been explored. In this study, we systematically examined light curve of MXBs from SGR J1935+2154 detected by GECAM between 2021 and 2022. We find that there are different light curve morphologies. Especially, we discover a peculiar and new pattern, Exponential Rise and Cut-Off Decay (ERCOD), which is significantly different from FRED and could be well described by a mathematical function we proposed. We find that MXBs with ERCOD shape are generally longer in duration, brighter in the peak flux, and harder in spectrum. We note that the ERCOD shape is not unique to SGR J1935+2154 but also present in other magnetars. This new light curve pattern may imply a special burst and radiation mechanism of magnetar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reanalysis of the eclipses of LHS 1140 c: No evidence of an atmosphere and implications for the internal structure of the planet</a><span class="id">[2510.11397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the reanalysis of three 15 micron JWST/MIRI secondary eclipses of LHS 1140 c, a warm super-Earth (R$_{\rm{p}}$ = 1.272 R$_{\oplus}$) in a 3.78-day orbit around an M4.5 dwarf. We present a novel method for data reduction that leverages spatial derivatives of the point-spread function and compare it to widely used aperture photometry. Both methods yield eclipse depth consistent within 1 sigma of the values reported in the literature. We measure an eclipse depth of 271$^{+31}_{-30}$ ppm corresponding to a brightness temperature of $T_B=595^{+33}_{-34}$ K, consistent with a bare rock. The secondary eclipse occurs 4.1$\pm$0.8 minutes before the circular-orbit predicted time. We explore the implications of our results on the internal structure of LHS 1140 c, the orbital architecture of the system and the possibility of future observations with JWST. We find a core-mass fraction (CMF) informed by the stellar abundances of refractory elements of 0.34$\pm$0.11, inflated compared to the CMF from radius and mass measurements, suggesting the possible presence of bulk volatiles in the interior.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational study of chromospheric jets in and around a sunspot observed by NVST and SDO</a><span class="id">[2510.11404]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To better understand the characteristics, driving mechanisms, and potential heating contributions of chromospheric jets, we analyze two contrasting types: one originating from within the sunspot penumbra (inside jets), and the other originating from outside the penumbra (outside jets). Statistical analysis of 100 jets (50 inside jets and 50 outside jets) reveals that inside jets have a projected velocity range of 4–14 km s$^{-1}$, a length range of 1–4 Mm, a width range of 0.2–0.6 Mm, and a lifetime range of 135–450 s, with mean values of 7.90 km s$^{-1}$, 2.61 Mm, 0.41 Mm, and 260 s, respectively. About 52\% of inside jets are associated with brightenings in H$\alpha$ blue wing images, and some show high-temperature signatures, suggesting a connection with localized energy release. In contrast, outside jets have higher velocities (8–50 km s$^{-1}$, average 19.04 km s$^{-1}$), greater lengths (average 6.26 Mm, up to 27.27 Mm), slightly larger widths (average 0.46 Mm), and longer lifetimes (135–630 s, average 327 s). They typically originate from regions of opposite magnetic polarities and are associated with magnetic flux emergence and EUV brightenings. Some outside jets correspond to coronal jets with inverted Y-shaped structures and temperatures exceeding one million Kelvin. Our results suggest that both jet types are driven by magnetic reconnection occurring in distinct magnetic field configurations and contribute to chromospheric and coronal heating.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing spectral variability in NGC 4490 ULX-8 over 24 years of XMM-Newton, Chandra and Swift-XRT observations</a><span class="id">[2510.11415]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present comprehensive spectral and timing results of 14 Chandra, 6 XMM-Newton and 19 Swift-XRT observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 4490 ULX-8, spanning from 2000 to 2024. We model the source spectra using absorbed power-law and absorbed multicolour disc blackbody models. The best-fit photon indices span 0.92-2.68, with typical uncertainties ranging from $\pm$0.1 to $\pm$1 depending on data quality. The inner disk temperature range from 0.97 to 1.69 keV, consistent with blackbody emission from an accretion disk. Our results reveal significant long-term variability in intrinsic X-ray source fluxes while the source remains relatively stable within individual observations. A Hardness-Intensity Diagram of the source shows no clear transition between hard and soft states, but an increase in brightness during two recent observations taken on 2022 December 1 and 2024 May 4. We find a positive correlation of X-ray luminosity and photon index that persists even when the hydrogen column density is tied across observations, suggesting a physical origin. The X-ray luminosity-inner disk temperature relation yields a weakly constrained slope owing to large temperature uncertainties, but a simpler fixed-slope test indicates consistency with a standard thin-disk. Using the derived disk parameters, we estimate the black hole mass to lie in the range of 16-75 $M_{\odot}$, under the assumption of a geometrically thin accretion flow, where the lower and upper bounds correspond to a Schwarzchild and a Kerr black hole respectively. Alternatively, we consider the scenario of ULX-8 hosting an accreting neutron star and estimate the corresponding magnetic field strength required to explain the observed properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyα Intensity Mapping in HETDEX: Galaxy-Lyα Intensity Cross-Power Spectrum</a><span class="id">[2510.11427]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a measurement of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) intensity mapping power spectrum from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX). We measure the cross-power spectrum of the Ly$\alpha$ intensity and Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) in a redshift range of $1.9 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$. We calculate the intensity from HETDEX spectra that do not contain any detected LAEs above a signal-to-noise ratio of $5.5$. To produce a power spectrum model and its covariance matrix, we simulate the data using lognormal mocks for the LAE catalog and Ly$\alpha$ intensity in redshift space. The simulations include the HETDEX sensitivity, selection function, and mask. The measurements yield the product of the LAE bias, the intensity bias, the mean intensity of undetected sources, and the ratio of the actual and fiducial redshift-space distortion parameters, $b_\mathrm{g} b_I \langle I \rangle \bar{F}_{\rm RSD} / \bar{F}^{\rm fid}_{\rm RSD}= (6.7 \pm 3.1)$, $(11.7 \pm 1.4)$, and $(8.3 \pm 1.5) \times 10^{-22} \, \text{erg}\, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{arcsec}^{-2} \, \text{Å}^{-1}$ in three redshift bins centered at $\bar z=2.1$, 2.6, and 3.2, respectively. The results are reasonably consistent with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer. They are, however, significantly smaller than previous results from cross-correlations of quasars with Ly$\alpha$ intensity. These results demonstrate the statistical power of HETDEX for Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping and pave the way for a more comprehensive analysis. They will also be useful for constraining models of Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies used in modern cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11467" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proton-rich production of lanthanides: the νi process</a><span class="id">[2510.11467]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The astrophysical origin of the lanthanides is an open question in nuclear astrophysics. Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\textit{proton-rich}$ matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions – in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A 200. This scenario, christened the $\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites.

Owing to their very high temperatures and inflated atmospheres, UHJs are among the most favorable targets for both transmission and emission spectroscopy, enabling detailed characterization of their atmospheric properties. Here, we present a reanalysis of the JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectra of the extreme ultra-hot Jupiter (EUHJ) WASP-178b, aimed at precisely characterizing its atmospheric composition. Our approach combines data reduction using two independent pipelines, lightcurve modeling with robust detrending techniques, and rigorous atmospheric retrievals. We report statistically significant detections of CO (7.24 $\sigma$) and CO$_2$ (7.22 $\sigma$), along with marginal evidence for C$_2$H$_2$ (1.34 $\sigma$), but no clear evidence for H$_2$O, suggesting depletion. From these retrieved abundances, we constrain the C/O ratio to a precise super-solar value of 0.954$\pm$0.033, consistent with an emerging trend in other UHJs.

It is still unclear, however, what their most likely composition is, that is whether they are predominantly gas dwarfs or water worlds. The sub-Neptunes orbiting bright host stars are very valuable because they are suitable for atmospheric characterization, which can break the well-known degeneracy in planet composition from the planet bulk density, when combined with a precise and accurate mass measurement. Here we report on the characterization of the sub-Neptune TOI-5789 c, which transits in front of the bright ($V=7.3$ mag and $K_{s}=5.35$ mag) and magnetically inactive K1V dwarf HIP 99452 every 12.93 days, thanks to TESS photometry and 141 high-precision radial velocities obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph. We find that its radius, mass, and bulk density are $R_{c}=2.86^{+0.18}_{-0.15} R_\oplus$, $M_{c}=5.00 \pm 0.50 M_\oplus$, and $\rho_{c}=1.16 \pm 0.23$ g cm$^{-3}$, and we show that TOI-5789 c is a promising target for atmospheric characterization with both JWST and, in the future, Ariel. By analyzing the HARPS-N radial velocities with different tools, we also detect three additional non-transiting planets, namely TOI-5789 b, d, and e, with orbital periods and minimum masses of $P_{b}=2.76$ d, $M_{b}\sin{i}=2.12 \pm 0.28 M_\oplus$, $P_{d}=29.6$ d, $M_{d}\sin{i}=4.29 \pm 0.68 M_\oplus$, and $P_{e}=63.0$ d, $M_{e}\sin{i}=11.61 \pm 0.97 M_\oplus$. The mutual orbital inclination between planets b and c must be higher than $\sim4$ deg, which points to a dynamically hot system. Nevertheless, from sensitivity studies based on both the HARPS-N and archival HIRES radial-velocity measurements, we can exclude that such high mutual inclinations are due to the perturbation by an outer gaseous giant planet.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterizing planetary systems with SPIRou: questions about the magnetic cycle of 55 Cnc A and two new planets around B</a><span class="id">[2510.11523]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the first exoplanet hosts discovered thirty years ago, the star 55 Cnc has been constantly observed ever since. It is now known to host at least five planets with orbital periods ranging from 17 hours to 15 years. It is also one of the most extreme metal rich stars in the neighbourhood and it has a low-mass secondary star. In this article, we present data obtained at the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope with the SPIRou spectropolarimeter on both components of the 55 Cnc stellar system. We revisit the long-period radial-velocity signals of 55 Cnc A, with a focus on the role of the magnetic cycle, and propose the existence of a sixth planet candidate, whose period falls close to that of the magnetic cycle, or half of it. The other massive outer planet has a revised period of 13.15 years and a minimum mass of 3.8 MJup. Although some uncertainty remains on these outer planets, the characterization of the four inner planets is very robust through the combination of many different data sets, and all signals are consistent in the nIR and optical domains. In addition, the magnetic topology of the solar-type primary component of the system is observed by SPIRou at the minimum of its activity cycle, characterized by an amplitude ten times smaller than observed during its maximum in 2017. For the low-mass component 55 Cnc B, we report the discovery of two exoplanets in the system, with a period of 6.799+-0.0014 and 33.75+-0.04 days and a minimum mass of 3.5+-0.8 and 5.3+-1.4 MEarth, respectively. The secondary magnetic field is very weak and the current data set does not allow its precise characterization, setting an upper limit of 10 G. The system 55 Cnc stands out as the sixth binary system with planetary systems around both components, and the first one with non equal-mass stellar components.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11528" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MANGOS II: Five new giant planets orbiting low-mass stars</a><span class="id">[2510.11528]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Giant planets orbiting low-mass stars on short orbits present a conundrum, as in the most extreme cases their existence cannot be reconciled with current models of core accretion. Therefore, surveys dedicated to finding these rare planets have a key role to play by growing the sample to overcome small number statistics. In this work we present MANGOS, a programme dedicated to the search for giant objects (planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stars) orbiting M dwarfs. We report on the discovery of five new giant planets (TOI-3288 Ab, TOI-4666 b, TOI-5007 b, TOI-5292 Ab, TOI-5916 b) first detected by TESS, and confirmed using ground-based photometry and spectroscopy. The five planets have radii in the range 0.99-1.12 $\mathrm{R_{Jup}}$, masses between 0.49–1.69 $\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$, and orbital periods between 1.43 and 2.91 days. We reveal that TOI-3288 and TOI-5292 are wide binaries, and in the case of TOI-5292 we are able to characterise both stellar components. We demonstrate that the planets presented are suitable for further characterisation of their obliquities and atmospheres. We detect a small but significant eccentricity for TOI-5007 b, although for this to be more robust, more observations are needed to fully sample the orbit. Finally, we reveal a correlation between stellar metallicity and planet bulk density for giant planets orbiting low-mass stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asteroseismic investigation of HD 140283: The Methuselah star</a><span class="id">[2510.11532]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>HD 140283 is a well-studied metal-poor subgiant and a Gaia benchmark star, often used for testing stellar models due to its proximity, brightness, and low metallicity ([Fe/H] = -2.3 dex). Here we present the first asteroseismic analysis of HD 140283, providing improved constraints on its fundamental properties. The star was observed by TESS in 20-second cadence during Sector 51. We extracted a custom light curve and performed a frequency analysis, revealing a rich spectrum of solar-like oscillations including mixed modes. These were combined with parameters from the literature to provide constraints on our model inference performed with BASTA. Using a dense grid of models, we find a mass of $0.75 \pm 0.01 \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$, a radius of $2.078 \substack{+0.012\\-0.011} \ \mathrm{R}_\odot$, and an age of $14.2 \pm 0.4$ Gyr, in agreement with the upper limit set by the age of the Universe within $1\sigma$. The observed frequency of maximum power, $\left(\nu_\mathrm{max}\right)_\mathrm{obs} = 611.3 \pm 7.4 \ \mu\mathrm{Hz}$, is significantly higher than predicted from standard scaling relations ($\left(\nu_\mathrm{max}\right)_\mathrm{mod} = 537.2 \substack{+2.9\\-1.8} \ \mu\mathrm{Hz}$), extending known deviations into the metal-poor regime. To our knowledge, the oscillations in HD 140283 have the highest $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ of any metal-poor star to date, which will help to advance our understanding of oscillations in metal-poor stars in general. The results demonstrate the value of asteroseismology for precise age determination in old halo stars and taking custom abundances and opacities into account during the modelling is probably important for further improving models of such stars. In addition, a detailed characterisation of metal-poor stars, such as HD 140283, will also help advance our understanding of Population III stars and their impact on future stellar generations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11555" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing cosmic curvature with Alcock-Paczynski data</a><span class="id">[2510.11555]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Alcock-Paczynski (AP) parameter $F_{AP}$ is independent of the sound horizon $r_d$, making the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) AP measurements particularly well suited for cosmological applications.

High-resolution spectroscopic observations reveal the system to be a double-lined binary. By modeling the photometric and radial velocity observations, we determine an orbital period of 4.2 days and the masses and radii of both stars to be $M_A=0.250^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$ M$_{\odot}$, $M_B=0.208^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$ M$_{\odot}$, $R_A=0.255^{+0.004}_{-0.005}$ R$_{\odot}$, $R_B=0.233^{+0.006}_{-0.005}$ R$_{\odot}$.

Only traces of Be or B would have been produced in the Big Bang, but there could be a contribution from the $\nu$-process in type II supernovae. Their abundances at very low metallicities have been debated in the literature, with the aim of understanding their origin. Our aim is to derive the boron abundance in a sample of metal-poor stars based for the first time on observations with the STIS spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope, using clean B lines measured in space ultraviolet. We identified a measurable line of B I at 2089.6 A. In our sample of metal-poor warm stars, this line is practically free from blending lines, and for this reason the precision of the presently derived boron abundances is unprecedented. We find that in the interval -2.6&lt;[Fe/H]&lt;-1.0, the slope of the relation A(B) versus [Fe/H] is significantly larger than 1, and thus steeper than that obtained with Be abundances. As a consequence, we find in this interval of metallicity a B/Be ratio that slightly increases with [Fe/H]. Since at [Fe/H]=-1 the abundance of B is already close to the solar abundance, there should be a break in the B enrichment at a metallicity of about [Fe/H]=-1.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Holes from Primordial Voids</a><span class="id">[2510.11611]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a compelling dark matter candidate and a unique probe of small-scale cosmological fluctuations.

Using numerical relativity simulations, we show that sufficiently deep PV can undergo a nonlinear rebounce at the center, generating an effective overdensity that eventually collapses into a PBH. We determine the critical threshold for this process for a variety of equations of state, and demonstrate that the resulting black holes obey a scaling relation analogous to the standard overdensity case.

Their flux is known to vary along the orbit, from radio to X-rays. During the past decade, gamma-ray orbital modulation (GOM) has been discovered in a handful of spiders, but its origin remains largely unknown. We present the results of a systematic search for GOM among 43 systems, selecting pulsed 0.1-1 GeV photons and using spin and orbital ephemeris from Fermi's Third Pulsar Catalog. We discover GOM from three spiders - PSR J1124-3653, PSR J1946-5403 and PSR J2215+5135 - and confirm four previous detections. In all seven cases so far, the GOM peaks near the pulsar's superior conjunction. The X-ray orbital light curves are usually in anti-phase, peaking when the pulsar is at inferior conjunction, but we find one case where both gamma-rays and X-rays peak around superior conjunction: PSR J1946-5403. We measure the modulated fractions of the GOM and find consistent values for all seven spiders, with an average $22.0\pm2.6\%$. Including eclipsing systems seen edge-on, we find no clear dependence of the modulated fraction on the orbital inclination (within $\simeq$45-90$^\circ$). Our results challenge previous models proposed to explain GOM in spiders, based on inverse Compton and synchrotron emission close to the companion, since these predict a clear dependence with orbital inclination (stronger modulation at high inclinations). We nearly double the number of GOM detections in spiders, showing that it is more common than previously thought.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOI-3288 b and TOI-4666 b: two gas giants transiting low-mass stars characterised by NIRPS</a><span class="id">[2510.11703]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gas giant planets orbiting low-mass stars are uncommon outcomes of planet formation. Increasing the sample of well-characterised giants around early M dwarfs will enable population-level studies of their properties, offering valuable insights into their formation and evolutionary histories. We aim to characterise giant exoplanets transiting M dwarfs identified by TESS. High-resolution spectroscopic data are obtained in the optical and nIR, combining HARPS and NIRPS. We derive RVs via the cross-correlation function and implement a novel post-processing procedure to further mitigate telluric contamination in the nIR. The resulting RVs are jointly fit with TESS and ground-based photometry to derive the orbital and physical parameters of the systems. We confirm two gas giants transiting the low-mass stars TOI-3288 A (K9V) and TOI-4666 (M2.5V). TOI-3288 A hosts a Hot Jupiter with a mass of $2.11\pm0.08~M_{\rm Jup}$ and a radius of $1.00 \pm 0.03~R_{\rm Jup}$, with an orbital period of 1.43 days ($T_{\rm eq} = 1059 \pm 20~{\rm K}$). TOI-4666 hosts a $0.70_{-0.06}^{+0.05}~M_{\rm Jup}$ warm Jupiter ($T_{\rm eq} = 713 \pm 14~{\rm K}$) with a radius of $1.11 \pm 0.04~R_{\rm Jup}$, and an orbital period of 2.91 days. We identify a decrease in planetary mass with spectral type, where late M dwarfs host less massive giant planets than early M dwarfs. More massive gas giants that deviate from this trend are preferentially hosted by more metal-rich stars. Furthermore, we find an increased binarity fraction among low-mass stars hosting gas giants, which may play a role in enhancing giant planet formation around low-mass stars. The observed population trends agree with theoretical expectations, where higher metallicity can compensate for lower disk masses, and wide binary systems may influence planet formation and migration through Kozai-Lidov cycles or disk instabilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11719" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BayeSN-TD: Time Delay and $H_0$ Estimation for Lensed SN H0pe</a><span class="id">[2510.11719]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present BayeSN-TD, an enhanced implementation of the probabilistic type Ia supernova (SN Ia) BayeSN SED model, designed for fitting multiply-imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia). BayeSN-TD fits for magnifications and time-delays across multiple images while marginalising over an achromatic, Gaussian process-based treatment of microlensing, to allow for time-dependent deviations from a typical SN Ia SED caused by gravitational lensing by stars in the lensing system. BayeSN-TD is able to robustly infer time delays and produce well-calibrated uncertainties, even when applied to simulations based on a different SED model and incorporating chromatic microlensing, strongly validating its suitability for time-delay cosmography. We then apply BayeSN-TD to publicly available photometry of the glSN Ia SN H0pe, inferring time delays between images BA and BC of $\Delta T_{BA}=121.9^{+9.5}_{-7.5}$ days and $\Delta T_{BC}=63.2^{+3.2}_{-3.3}$ days along with absolute magnifications $\beta$ for each image, $\beta_A = 2.38^{+0.72}_{-0.54}$, $\beta_B=5.27^{+1.25}_{-1.02}$ and $\beta_C=3.93^{+1.00}_{-0.75}$. Combining our constraints on time-delays and magnifications with existing lens models of this system, we infer $H_0=69.3^{+12.6}_{-7.8}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with previous analysis of this system; incorporating additional constraints based on spectroscopy yields $H_0=66.8^{+13.4}_{-5.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. While this is not yet precise enough to draw a meaningful conclusion with regard to the `Hubble tension', upcoming analysis of SN H0pe with more accurate photometry enabled by template images, and other glSNe, will provide stronger constraints on $H_0$; BayeSN-TD will be a valuable tool for these analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Implications of Thermodynamic Split Conjecture</a><span class="id">[2510.10441]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Building on initial work on the Thermodynamic Split Conjecture (TSC), which posits that black hole and cosmological horizon thermodynamics are generically inequivalent, we examine the consequences of that split for the Gibbons Hawking temperature and its role across cosmology.

We find that the finite size of the target nucleus may introduce non-perturbative effects that differ from the scenario of point-like dark matter. For large-size dark matter particles, this non-perturbative regime in the dark matter nucleus scattering cross section effectively disappears; while for small values of the size-to-range ratio in the scattering process, a significant non-perturbative regime can maintain. Finally, for the direct detection of nugget-type puffy dark matter with a small number of constituent particles, we find that the stability conditions for the formation of bound-state dark matter can provide constraints on the dark matter nucleus scattering cross section.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10685" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints on space-time noncommutativity</a><span class="id">[2510.10685]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider the implications of the modified dispersion relations, due to the noncommutativity of the spacetime, for a photon gas filling the early Universe in the framework of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) processes, during the period of light elements formation. We consider three types of deformations present in the dispersion relations for the radiation gas, from which we obtain the low temperature corrections to the energy density and pressure. The cosmological implications of the modified equations of state in the BBN era are explored in detail for all radiation models. The effects induced on the nucleosynthesis process by spacetime noncommutativity are investigated by evaluating the abundances of relic nuclei (Hydrogen, Deuterium, Helium-3, Helium-4, and Lithium-7). The primordial mass fraction estimates and their deviations due to changes in the freezing temperature impose an upper limit on the energy density of the deformed photon gas, which follows from the modified Friedmann equations. The deviations from the standard energy density of the radiative plasma are therefore constrained by the abundances of the Helium-4 nuclei. Upper limits on the free parameters of the spacetime noncommutativity are obtained via a numerical analysis performed using the \texttt{PRyMordial} software package. The primordial abundances of the light elements are obtained by evaluating the thermonuclear reaction rates for the considered noncommutative spacetime models. An MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) analysis allows to obtain restrictions on the free parameters of the modified dispersion relations. The numerical and statistical approach is implemented in the python code \texttt{PRyNCe}, available on GitHub.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10708" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multimodal axion emissions from Abelian-Higgs cosmic strings</a><span class="id">[2510.10708]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that axions can be produced from Abelian-Higgs cosmic strings due to the axion-gauge coupling.

This instability triggers phase separation, where new thermal phases are generated to produce solitons. These solitons can be regarded as a coexistence state composed of a matter phase and a vacuum phase, with an interface proving surface tension to maintain dynamical equilibrium. The phase separation mechanism naturally allows the existence of vacuum bubbles, characterized by a vacuum phase surrounded by a matter phase with negative pressure. Furthermore, we show that the soliton interface resemble a fluid membrane, whose interface pressure satisfies a Young-Laplace-type relation, resulting in the emergence of the membrane instability induced by surface tension. In the thin-wall limit, the dispersion relation is analytically derived.

The black hole (BH) has a high probability of falling within the &quot;mass gap&quot; (mg) between the neutron star (NS) and the BH mass distributions. Because of the relatively low primary mass, this system has a higher likelihood of producing an electromagnetic counterpart than previously detected NSBH mergers. We analyze the potential kilonova (KN) emission from GW230529 and find that, if the source was an NSBH merger, there is a $\sim $2-$28\%$ probability (depending on the assumed equation of state) that it produced a KN peaking at $\sim 1$ day post-merger with $g \lesssim 23.5$ and $i &lt; 23$. Hence, it could have been detected by ground-based telescopes. If instead the event was a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, the probability of KN production drops to $\sim $0-$10\%$. Motivated by these results, we simulate a broader population of mgNSBH mergers expected during the fifth LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run (O5) and find a $2$-$3\%$ chance of KN production per event. Such KNe would typically be fainter than GW230529, with $g \lesssim 26$ and $i \lesssim 25$. Based on these findings, DECam-like instruments may be able to detect up to $\sim 70\%$ of future mgNSBH KNe, corresponding to $1-2$ multimessenger mgNSBH per year in O5.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational wave events with DECam: Neutron Star Mergers</a><span class="id">[2411.13673]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With GW170817 being the only multimessenger gravitational wave (GW) event with an associated kilonova detected so far, there exists a pressing need for realistic estimation of the GW localization uncertainties and rates, as well as optimization of available telescope time to enable the detection of new kilonovae.

Assuming that no BNS was detected during O4 until the end of 2024, we present updated GW BNS (NSBH) merger detection rates. We expect to detect BNS (NSBH) kilonovae with DECam at a per-year rate of: $0$-$2.0$ ($0$) in O4, and $2.0$-$19$ ($0$-$1.0$) in O5. We expect the majority of BNS detections and also those accompanied by a detectable kilonova to produce a hypermassive NS remnant, with a significant fraction of the remaining BNSs promptly collapsing to a BH.

We identify the optimal estimator for extracting SGWB information from astrometric observations and examine how sensitivity to SGWB properties varies with the sky positions of stars and pulsars. Using representative examples of current PTA capabilities and near-future astrometric sensitivity, we demonstrate that cross-correlating astrometric and PTA data can improve constraints on SGWB properties, compared to PTA data alone. The improvement is quantified through Fisher forecasts for the SGWB amplitude, spectral tilt, and dipolar anisotropy amplitude.

In particular, filaments contribute grandly by accreting gas from cosmic matter sheets and underdense regions and feeding it to the galaxy clusters. Along the way, the gas in filaments is shocked and heated, which, together with the velocity structure within the filament, induces swirling and, thus, turbulence. In this work, we study a constrained hydrodynamical simulation replica of the Virgo cluster to characterise the velocity field in the two cosmic filaments connected to the cluster with unprecedented high resolution. First, we conduct a qualitative examination of slices extracted from the simulation. We study the temperature, the velocity field, and derived quantities in longitudinal cuts to study the general structure of the filaments and in transverse cuts to study their inner organisation and connection to cosmic matter sheets and underdense regions. Then, we conduct a quantitative study of velocities in Virgo's filaments by computing the 2D energy spectrum from 1 and 5 Mpc square maps extracted from the slices and centred on the core of the filaments. We show that the velocity field goes from mostly compressive far in the filaments to mostly solenoidal in Virgo's core. Moreover, we observe that the total energy spectrum in the filaments gains in amplitude and steepens towards Virgo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20962" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Calibration and Position Errors on Astrophysical Parameters of the HI 21cm Signal</a><span class="id">[2502.20962]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD) are pivotal stages during the first billion years of the universe, exerting a significant influence on the development of cosmic structure. The detection of the redshifted 21-cm signal from these epochs is challenging due to the dominance of significantly stronger astrophysical foregrounds and the presence of systematics. This work used the 21cm E2E (end to end) pipeline, followed by simulation methodology described \cite{2022Mazumder} to conduct synthetic observations of a simulated sky model that includes both the redshifted 21-cm signal and foregrounds. A framework was constructed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Bayesian techniques to directly deduce astrophysical parameters from the measured power spectrum. This approach eliminates the need for explicit telescope layout effects correction in interferometric arrays such as SKA-Low. The present work investigates the impact of gain calibration errors and sky model position errors on the recovery of the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum for the SKA-Low AA$^{\ast}$ array configuration. We assessed the effects of these inaccuracies on the deduced astrophysical parameters and established acceptable tolerance levels. Based on our results, the gain calibration error tolerance for ideal signal detection is 0.001 \%. However, if the sky model position errors exceed 0.048 arcseconds, the remaining foregrounds would obscure the target signal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncertainties in the Estimation of Air Shower Observables from Monte Carlo Simulation of Radio Emission</a><span class="id">[2505.08920]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of extensive air showers (EAS) induced by cosmic rays via radio signals has undergone significant advancements in the last two decades.

The Monte Carlo simulation of these radio pulses is crucial to enable an accurate reconstruction of the primary cosmic ray energy and to infer the composition of the primary particles. In this work, a comprehensive comparison of the predicted electric field in EAS simulated with CoREAS and ZHAireS was conducted to estimate the systematic uncertainties arising from the use of different simulation packages in the determination of two key shower observables namely, the electromagnetic energy of the EAS and the depth of maximum development ($X_{\rm max}$). For this comparison, input parameters and settings as similar as possible were used in both simulations, along with the same realistic atmospheric refractive index depending on altitude, which is crucial for the prediction of radio emission properties of EAS. In addition, simulated EAS with very similar values of depth of maximum development were selected. Good agreement was found between CoREAS and ZHAireS, with discrepancies in the dominant electric field components generally remaining below 10\% across the frequency range of a few MHz to hundreds of MHz, relevant for most radio detection experiments, translating into uncertainties in the determination of energy below $5\%$ and $\simeq 10\,\mathrm{g/cm^2}$ in $X_{\rm max}$.

We present a direct and systematic evaluation of these assumptions using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations including the Coriolis force. We simulate streams overflowing from both the inner and outer Lagrangian points, quantify mass transfer rates, and compare them with analytic solutions. We introduce scaling factors, including the overfilling factor, to render the problem dimensionless. The donor-star models are simplified, with either an isentropic initial stratification and adiabatic evolution or an isothermal structure and evolution, but the scalability of this formulation allows us to extend the results for a mass-transferring system to arbitrarily small overfilling factors for the adiabatic case. We find that the Coriolis force – often neglected in analytic models – strongly impacts the stream morphology: breaking axial symmetry, reducing the stream cross section, and shifting its origin toward the donor's trailing side. Contrary to common assumptions, the sonic surface is not flat and does not always intersect the Lagrangian point: instead, it is concave and shifted, particularly toward the accretor's trailing side. Despite these structural asymmetries, mass transfer rates are only mildly suppressed relative to analytic predictions and the deviation is remarkably small – within a factor of two (ten) for the inner (outer) Lagrangian point over seven orders of magnitude in mass ratio. We use our results to extend the widely-used mass-transfer rate prescriptions by Ritter(1988) and Kolb&amp;Ritter(1990), for both the inner and outer Lagrangian points. These extensions can be readily adopted in stellar evolution codes like MESA, with minimal changes where the original models are already in use.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22739" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Phase Space of Low-Mass Binary Compact Objects from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Catalog: Hints on the Chances of Different Formation Scenarios</a><span class="id">[2505.22739]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave (GW) observations have significantly advanced our understanding of binary compact object (BCO) formation, yet directly linking these observations to specific formation scenarios remains challenging.

We present a new technique to model the nHz SGWB by incorporating eccentricity into a multi-scale adaptive simulation framework. Using the time-domain eccentric waveform model ESIGMAHM, we generate realistic GW signals from astrophysical populations of SMBHBs. Unlike circular binaries, eccentric systems emit across multiple frequencies, introducing spectral correlations between frequency bins. These correlations provide a novel observational signature of the eccentricity distribution of the SMBHB population. In this work, we adopt simplified power-law models for the eccentricity distribution. While this does not capture the full complexity of galactic environments, it effectively highlights the key features of GW emission from eccentric binaries and their imprint on the SGWB.

For the hard state, we examine compact and extended corona models. We find that compact corona models are energetically favored, but extended models cannot be fully excluded. We discuss the high linear polarization of the Cyg X-1 X-rays in the soft and hard states, parallel to the direction of the radio jet. We propose the presence of a pair layer enveloping the accretion disk moving at approximately half the speed of light away from the disk for both the soft and the hard state. In the soft state, the pairs cool to the Compton temperature of the disk emission. In the hard state, the pairs acquire thermal and bulk motion allowing them to Comptonize the emission to produce the observed power law emission. In both emission states, the bulk motion away from the disk leads to a net polarization parallel to the radio jet. We emphasize that the geometry of the accretion flow in the hard state is still not well constrained, and that observed spectral (including the relativistically broadened Fe K-$\alpha$ line) and spectro-polarimetric signatures depend strongly on the plasma processes responsible for energy dissipation in the plasma.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Far-Ultraviolet Emission Line Investigation of Flares on AU Mic</a><span class="id">[2506.10201]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The role of non-thermal proton energy transportation during solar and stellar flares is largely unknown; a better understanding of this physical process will allow us to rectify longstanding deficiencies in flare models. One way to detect the presence of non-thermal protons during flares is through the Orrall-Zirker (OZ) effect, proposed by Orrall &amp; Zirker (1976), whereby an enhanced red wing appears in hydrogen emission lines (e.g., Lyman-$\alpha$ at 1215.67 angstroms). We analyze archival Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph G130M (1060 - 1360 angstroms) observations of the young M dwarf, AU Mic to search for evidence of OZ effect during the impulsive phase of six stellar flares with $E_\textrm{flare} \approx 10^{30 - 31}$ erg. While we found non-detections of the OZ effect, we note there is a pronounced blue enhancement in several C II and C III emission lines during one of the high-energy flares. We propose that either filament eruptions or chromospheric evaporation could be the mechanism driving this observed blue enhancement. We compare the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra to 1D radiative-hydrodynamic stellar flare models, which are unable to reproduce the blue enhancement and broadening in these cool flare lines. By completing a line-by-line analysis of the FUV spectrum of AU Mic, we provide further constraints on the physical mechanisms producing stellar flares on M dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">89.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$α$-attractor inflation modified by GUP in light of ACT observations</a><span class="id">[2506.10547]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Here, the $\alpha$-attractor inflation is investigated within a framework incorporating a minimal measurable length, as implemented by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). The GUP modifications to the Friedmann equations and cosmological perturbation parameters are employed to assess the model observational viability against the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. Our results indicate that in the $r-n_s$ plane, the predictions of the standard $\alpha$-attractor model ($\beta=0$) lies near the $2\sigma$ boundary of joint observations. More interestingly enough is that in the presence of GUP effect, the predictions of the model for the GUP parameter $\beta \gtrsim O(10^{13})$ shifts into the $68\%$ CL interval. This value for $\beta$ is in well agreement with upper bounds on the GUP parameter deduced from cosmological analysis as well as quantum and gravitational experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">90.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scrutinizing the impact of the solar modulation on AMS-02 antiproton excess</a><span class="id">[2506.13352]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study examines the impact of solar modulation on the antiproton excess observed by AMS-02, which may indicate dark matter (DM) annihilation. We analyze three solar modulation models: the force-field approximation (FFA), a time-, charge-, and rigidity-dependent FFA, and a three-dimensional numerical simulation based on the Parker transport equation. Based on AMS-02 latest antiproton data (2025), our results show that the significance of the DM signal is sensitive to the chosen modulation model, with a 2$\sigma$ signal for the FFA (4$\sigma$ if including data from H, He, C, O, B/C, and B/O) and a reduced significance for more complex models. We also address systematic uncertainties using two methods: the add-in-quadrature method, which assumes uncorrelated uncertainties between energy bins, and the nuisance parameter method, which treats systematic uncertainties as nuisance parameters during the fitting process. Fitted to AMS-02 antiproton data, DM annihilation to the $b\bar{b}$ scenario with three different solar modulation models shows that the add-in-quadrature method causes overfitting, whereas the nuisance parameters approach leads to underfitting. Statistically, the signal region of the FFA model using the add-in-quadrature method is the most reliable. This work highlights the need for refined solar modulation models and a better treatment of uncertainties for a conclusive interpretation of the AMS-02 data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sagittarius A* near-infrared flares polarization as a probe of space-time I: Non-rotating exotic compact objects</a><span class="id">[2506.23931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The center of our galaxy hosts Sagittarius A*, a supermassive compact object of $\sim 4.3\times 10^6$ solar masses, usually associated with a black hole. Nevertheless, black holes possess a central singularity, considered unphysical, and an event horizon, which leads to loss of unitarity in a quantum description of the system. To address these theoretical inconsistencies, alternative models, collectively known as exotic compact objects, have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the potential detectability of signatures associated with non-rotating exotic compact objects within the Sgr A* polarized flares dataset, as observed through GRAVITY and future instruments. We examine a total of eight distinct metrics, originating from four different categories of static and spherically symmetric compact objects: Black Holes, Boson stars, Fluid spheres, and Gravastars. Our approach involves utilizing a toy model that orbits the compact object in the equatorial plane, at the Schwarzschild-Keplerian velocity. Using simulated astrometric and polarimetric data with present GRAVITY and future GRAVITY+ uncertainties, we fit the datasets across all metrics examined. We evaluated the detectability of the metric for each dataset based on the resulting $\chi^2_\mathrm{red}$ and BIC-based Bayes factors. Plunge-through images of ECOs affect polarization and astrometry. With GRAVITY's present uncertainties, only a compact boson-star model is discernible. GRAVITY+'s improved sensitivity allows detection of most exotic compact object models. However, enhancing the astrophysical complexity of the hot spot model diminishes these outcomes. Presently, GRAVITY's uncertainties limit us to detecting just one exotic compact object metric. With GRAVITY+'s enhanced sensitivity, we can expect to uncover additional exotic compact object models and use Sgr A* as a laboratory for fundamental physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">92.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03749" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shot noise in clustering power spectra</a><span class="id">[2507.03749]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that the `shot noise' bias in angular clustering power spectra observed from discrete samples of points is not noise, but rather a known additive contribution that naturally arises due to degenerate pairs of points. In particular, we show that the true shot noise contribution cannot have a `non-Poissonian' value, even though all point processes with non-trivial two-point statistics are non-Poissonian. Apparent deviations from the `Poissonian' value can arise when significant correlations or anti-correlations are localised on small spatial scales. However, such deviations always correspond to a physical difference in two-point statistics, not a difference in noise. In the context of simulations, if clustering is treated as the tracer of a discretised underlying density field, any sub- or super-Poissonian sampling of the tracer induces such small-scale modifications and vice versa; we show this explicitly using recent innovations in angular power spectrum estimation from discrete catalogues. Finally, we show that the full covariance of clustering power spectra can also be computed explicitly: it depends only on the two-, three- and four-point statistics of the point process. The usual Gaussian covariance approximation appears as one term in the shot noise contribution, which is non-diagonal even for Gaussian random fields and Poisson sampling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">93.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A binary model of long period radio transients and white dwarf pulsars</a><span class="id">[2507.15352]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long-period radio transients (LPTs) represent a recently uncovered class of Galactic radio sources exhibiting minute-to-hour periodicities and highly polarised pulses of second-to-minute duration. Their phenomenology does not fit exactly in any other class, although it might resemble that of radio magnetars or white dwarf (WD) radio emitting binary systems. Notably, two LPTs with confirmed multi-wavelength counterparts have been identified as WD – M dwarf binaries. Meanwhile, systems such as AR Scorpii and J1912-44 exhibit short-period pulsations in hrs-tight orbits, with polarised radio emission proposed to be generated by the interaction of the WD magnetosphere with the low-mass companion wind. Here, we investigate the longest-lived LPT known, GPM J1839-10, demonstrating that it has a  8.75 hr orbital period. We show that its radio pulses can be modelled in the same geometric framework as WD binary pulsars, in which radio emission is triggered when the magnetic axis of a rotating WD intersects its companion's wind in the binary orbital plane. We use a 36-year timing baseline to infer the orbital period and binary geometry from radio data alone. The model naturally predicts its intermittent emission and double-pulse structure. Crucially, we show that the beat period between the spin and the orbit matches the observed pulse substructure and polarisation signatures, providing strong support for the model. Applying it to the WD pulsar J1912-44, it successfully reproduces the emission profile and geometry as well. Our results suggest analogous emission-site geometries in these related classes of binary system – a possibility we extend to the broader LPT / WD pulsar population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">94.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15928" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Late-time Radio Search for Highly Off-axis Jets from PTF Broad-lined Ic Supernovae in GRB-like Host Galaxy Environments</a><span class="id">[2507.15928]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hydrogen/Helium-poor stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae with broad lines (SNe Ic-bl) almost always accompany the nearby ($z &lt; 0.3$) jetted relativistic explosions known as long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the majority of SNe Ic-bl have no detected GRB counterpart. At least some of these SNe should harbor off-axis jets, whose afterglow may become detectable at late times, particularly at radio wavelengths. Here, we present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array radio observations (rest frame times of $\sim 3$-$4\times10^{3}$ days post SN discovery) of a sample of 14 SNe Ic-bl discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) that have been demonstrated to originate from the same host environments as the SNe Ic-bl associated with nearby GRBs. Of the 14 SNe, we identify three that are radio detected, one of which (PTF10tqv, $z = 0.0795$) is consistent with an off-axis jet with energy similar to classical GRBs (${\sim 10^{51}}$-${10^{51.7}~}$erg). Using recently developed synchrotron radiation code, we find that for our 11 non-detections, which are among the deepest limits obtained for Ic-bl, we rule out an off-axis jet with an energy of $\gtrsim 10^{51}~{\rm erg}$ in circumburst densities of $\gtrsim 10^{-1}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$. We predict that well-spaced monitoring of newly discovered SNe Ic-bl from $\sim 10~$days to $\sim 10~$years (rest frame) to luminosities of $\sim 10^{27}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}~{\rm Hz}^{-1}$ will constrain the existence of highly off-axis jets ($\gtrsim60^\circ$) with classical GRB energies. The VLA Sky Survey will probe jets that are $\lesssim 60^\circ$ off-axis, whereas the Deep Synpotic Array 2000 will probe jets out to $\sim 90^\circ$ off-axis, demonstrating the importance of utilizing radio surveys to supplement targeted observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">95.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The possibility of a giant impact on Venus</a><span class="id">[2508.03239]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Giant impacts were common in the early evolution of the Solar System, and it is possible that Venus also experienced an impact. A giant impact on Venus could have affected its rotation rate and possibly its thermal evolution. In this work, we explore a range of possible impacts using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We consider the final major collision, assuming that differentiation already occurred and that Venus consists of an iron core (30% of Venus' mass) and a forsterite mantle (70% of Venus' mass). We use differentiated impactors with masses ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 Earth masses, impact velocities between 10 and 15 km/s, various impact geometries (head-on and oblique), different primordial thermal profiles, and a range of pre-impact rotation rates of Venus. We analyse the post-impact rotation periods and debris disc masses to identify scenarios that can reproduce Venus' present-day characteristics. Our findings show that a wide range of impact scenarios are consistent with Venus' current rotation. These include head-on collisions on a non-rotating Venus and oblique, hit-and-run impacts by Mars-sized bodies on a rotating Venus. Importantly, collisions that match Venus' present-day rotation rate typically produce minimal debris discs residing within Venus' synchronous orbit. This suggests that the material would likely reaccrete onto the planet, preventing the formation of long-lasting satellites - consistent with Venus' lack of a moon. We conclude that a giant impact can be consistent with both Venus' unusual rotation and lack of a moon, potentially setting the stage for its subsequent thermal evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">96.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Utilizing Maximum Variability to Discern TDE Emission from AGN Flares</a><span class="id">[2508.03889]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray emission arising from active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity may potentially mimic the expected emission of tidal disruption events (TDEs). Ongoing and upcoming wide-field X-ray surveys will detect thousands of TDE-like sources, and classifying them securely as TDEs or AGNs is a challenging task. To this aim, we measure the average X-ray variability of AGNs and derive a threshold of maximum variation as a function of time separating the TDEs from AGN flares. For the comparison between TDE and AGN X-ray variability, we cross-match the publicly available XMM-Newton and Swift-XRT point source catalogs with the Million Quasars Catalog and optically selected TDEs. Then we compute the X-ray structure function (SF) and maximum variability of the AGN and TDE samples. The X-ray SF of AGNs has a power-law index $\gamma\sim0.11-0.14$ when fitted with a simple power-law model. However, the SF of AGNs is best described by a broken power-law or a power exponential model with a damping time scale $\tau=950\pm300$ days. The maximum variability comparison between TDE and simulated AGN light curves indicates they have a similar order of variation on a time scale of less than 20 days. However, at a longer time scale of $\sim20$ days or more, the large-scale variations expected from power-law-like decay in TDEs become less frequent in AGNs. Furthermore, we compare the maximum variability of eROSITA TDE candidates with AGN, finding that many of the eROSITA-DE TDE candidates are consistent with flares from AGNs, and may not be TDEs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">97.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entering the Wind Roche Lobe Overflow realm in Symbiotic Systems</a><span class="id">[2508.06727]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a suite of dynamical simulations designed to explore the orbital and accretion properties of compact (2$-$7 AU) symbiotic systems, focusing on wind accretion, drag forces, and tidal interactions. Using three levels of physical complexity, we model systems of accreting white dwarfs (WDs) with masses of 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M$_\odot$ orbiting evolving Solar-like stars with 1, 2, and 3 M$_\odot$. We show that systems alternate between standard wind accretion and Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLO) regimes during periods of high mass-loss rate experienced by the donor star (the peak of red giant phase and/or thermal pulses). For some configurations, the standard wind accretion has mass accretion efficiencies similar to those obtained by WRLO regime. Tidal forces play a key role in compact systems, leading to orbital shrinkage and enhanced accretion efficiency. We find that systems with high-mass WDs ($\geq 1$ M$_\odot$) and massive donors (2$-$3 M$_\odot$) are the only ones to reach the Chandrasekhar limit. Interestingly, the majority of our simulations reach the Roche lobe overflow condition that is not further simulated given the need of more complex hydrodynamical simulations. Our analysis shows that increasing physical realism, by including drag and tides, systematically leads to more compact final orbital configurations. Comparison with compact known symbiotic systems seems to suggest that they are very likely experiencing orbital decay produced by tidal forces.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">98.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20178" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The orbital period and inclination of the neutron star X-ray transient MAXI J1807+132</a><span class="id">[2508.20178]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The neutron star X-ray transient MAXI J1807+132 has undergone outbursts in 2017, 2019, and 2023.

While most recent work has focused on adding more complex physics, the saturation properties of the instability in radially extended discs and its convergence as a function of resolution are still largely unknown. We tackle the question of VSI saturation and associated turbulence using radially extended fully 3D global disc models at very high resolution so as to capture both the largest VSI scales and the small-scale turbulent cascade. We use the GPU-accelerated code Idefix to achieve resolutions of up to 200 points per scale height in the 3 spatial directions, with a full 2pi azimuthal extent and disc aspect ratio H/R=0.1. Results: We demonstrate that large-scale transport properties are converged with 100 points per scale height, leading to a Shakura-Sunyaev alpha=1.3e-3. Inner boundary condition artifacts propagate deep inside the computational domain, leading to reduced alpha in these regions. The large-scale corrugation wave zones identified in 2D models survive in 3D, albeit with less coherence. Our models show no sign of long-lived zonal flows, pressure bumps or vortices, in contrast to lower-resolution simulations. Finally, we show that the turbulent cascade resulting from VSI saturation can be interpreted in the framework of critically balanced rotating turbulence. Conclusion: The VSI leads to vigorous turbulence in protoplanetary discs, associated with outward angular momentum transport but without any significant long-lived features that could enhance planet formation. The innermost regions of VSI simulations are always polluted by boundary-condition artifacts affecting the first VSI wave train, so radially extended domains should be used in a more systematic manner.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">100.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating aerosols as a way to reconcile K2-18 b JWST MIRI and NIRISS/NIRSpec observations</a><span class="id">[2509.13932]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent JWST observations of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b with NIRISS SOSS/NIRSpec G395H and MIRI LRS have yielded apparently inconsistent results: the MIRI spectra exhibit spectral features nearly twice as large as those seen at shorter wavelengths, challenging the high-metallicity, CH4-rich non-equilibrium model that fits the NIRISS/NIRSpec data. We perform a suite of atmospheric retrievals on both datasets, including free-chemistry, non-equilibrium, and aerosol models, using laboratory-derived complex refractive indices for a variety of photochemical haze analogues. Free retrievals systematically return lower metallicities than inferred by self-consistent chemical disequilibrium models, and the inclusion of absorbing aerosols, especially CH4-dominated, nitrogen-poor tholins, can further reduce the inferred metallicity by over an order of magnitude. These hazes reproduce the observed NIRISS slope through scattering and match MIRI features via C-H bending absorption near 7 um, while yielding particle properties consistent with photochemical production in H2-rich atmospheres. Although their inclusion improves the joint fit and reduces tension between datasets, it also significantly lowers the retrieved CH4 abundance, highlighting degeneracies between metallicity, composition, and aerosol properties. Our results underscore the importance of aerosol absorption in interpreting temperate sub-Neptune spectra, and motivate future JWST observations and laboratory work to break these degeneracies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">101.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possible First Detection of Gyroresonance Emission from a Coronal Mass Ejection in the Middle Corona</a><span class="id">[2509.16453]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Routine measurements of the magnetic field of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have been a key challenge in solar physics.

This study investigates the potential impacts of PBH Hawking radiation on the intergalactic medium from $z\sim 800-25$, namely studying the ionization history, kinetic gas temperature, and ultimately the 21 cm signature. We find that for masses on the low edge of the asteroid mass window, there are up two orders of magnitude increases in the ionization fraction and kinetic gas temperature by redshift 25, and the 21 cm spin temperature can differ from non-PBH cosmology by factors of a few. This analysis results in maximum differential brightness temperatures of +17 mK for our lightest PBH masses of $2.12\times 10^{16}$g. We also show maximal $53$ mK discrepancies in differential brightness temperatures between our PBH and non-PBH cosmologies for our lightest PBH mass, while our heaviest PBH mass of $1.65 \times 10^{17}$g shows only $0.5$ mK variations.

We show that allowing spectral parameters to vary across subsets of the sky pixels is essential to achieve competitive S/N on the reconstructed CMB after component separation while keeping residual foreground bias under control. Although several strategies exist to define pixel subsets for the spectral parameters, each with its advantages and limitations, we show using current foreground simulations in the context of next-generation space-borne missions that there are satisfactory configurations in which both statistical and systematic residuals become negligible. The exact magnitude of these residuals, however, depends on the mission's specific characteristics, especially its frequency coverage and sensitivity. We also show that the post-component separation statistical uncertainty is only weakly dependent on the properties of the foregrounds and propose a semi-analytical framework to estimate it.

Given the existing observational and theoretical constraints, we identify viable parameter regions capable of generating visibly large GWs for future observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">109.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights in $f(Q)$ cosmology: the relevance of the connection</a><span class="id">[2506.03506]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the role of the affine connection in $f(Q)$ gravity, a modified theory where gravity is governed by non-metricity within the symmetric teleparallel framework. Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">110.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Gravitational Wave Background as a Probe of the Primordial Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2507.10033]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from the collapse of density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). The PGWs' interpretation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) corresponds to PBHs formation in the mass range $[10^{-12}-10^{-3}] M_{\odot}$. Importantly, our analysis shows that PGWs' interpretation of recent PTA data remains viable, as it does not lead to PBH overproduction. We derive the amplitude of PGWs by leveraging existing constraints on the PBH abundance across a wide mass range. Notably, these constrained amplitudes predict SGWB signals that would be detectable by future gravitational wave observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">111.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmology with a Non-minimally Coupled Dark Matter Fluid I. Background Evolution</a><span class="id">[2507.16614]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore a cosmological model in which dark matter is non-minimally coupled to gravity at the fluid level. While typically subdominant compared to Standard Model forces, such couplings may dominate dark matter dynamics. We show that this interaction modifies the early-time Friedmann equations, driving a phase of accelerated expansion that can resolve the horizon and flatness problems without introducing additional fields. At even earlier times, the coupling to spatial curvature may give rise to a cosmological bounce, replacing the initial singularity of standard cosmology. These results suggest that non-minimally coupled dark matter could offer a unified framework for addressing both the singularity and fine-tuning problems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">112.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neural Posterior Estimation of Neutron Star Equations of State</a><span class="id">[2507.23506]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) from astrophysical observations of masses, radii and tidal deformabilities, using Neural posterior estimation (NPE) with Conditional Normalising Flows (CNF). To ensure that the model conforms with reality, physics-informed constraints are embedded directly into the training loss. This enables efficient, likelihood-free inference of full posterior distributions for key thermodynamic quantities-including pressure, squared speed of sound, and the trace anomaly-conditioned on observational data. Our models are trained on synthetic datasets generated from two agnostic EoS priors: polytropic parametrizations (PT) and gaussian process (GP) reconstructions. These datasets span various scenarios, including the presence or absence of tidal deformability information and observational noise. Across all settings, the method produces accurate and well-calibrated posteriors, with uncertainties reduced when tidal deformability constraints are included. Furthermore, we find that the behavior of normalized predictive dispersions is strongly correlated with the maximum central density inside NSs, suggesting that the model can indirectly infer this physically meaningful quantity. The approach generalizes well across EoS families and accurately reconstructs derivative quantities such as the polytropic index, demonstrating its robustness and potential for probing dense matter in NS cores.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">113.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imprints of screened dark energy on nonlocal quantum correlations</a><span class="id">[2508.18448]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">114.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boomerang mechanism explaining the excess radio background</a><span class="id">[2509.03441]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a {\em boomerang mechanism} for the explanation of the excess radio background detected by ARCADE. In an early stage, at a temperature $T \sim 100\,{\rm keV}$, a fraction of relic neutrinos is resonantly converted into dark neutrinos by mixing induced by a pre-existing lepton asymmetry. Dark neutrinos decay much later into a dark photon, mixed with photon, and a dark fermion, with a lifetime longer than the age of the Universe, as required by a solution to the excess radio background. This scenario circumvents the upper bound on the neutrino magnetic moment but still implies a testable lower bound.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">115.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03552" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawking tunneling radiation with thermodynamic pressure</a><span class="id">[2509.03552]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hawking radiation elucidates black holes as quantum thermodynamic systems, thereby establishing a conceptual bridge between general relativity and quantum mechanics through particle emission phenomena. While conventional theoretical frameworks predominantly focus on classical spacetime configurations, recent advancements in Extended Phase Space thermodynamics have redefined cosmological parameters (such as the $\Lambda$-term) as dynamic variables. Notably, the thermodynamics of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes has been successfully extended to incorporate thermodynamic pressure $P$. Within this extended phase space framework, although numerous intriguing physical phenomena have been identified, the tunneling mechanism of particles incorporating pressure and volume remains unexplored. This study investigates Hawking radiation through particle tunneling in Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black holes within the extended phase space, where the thermodynamic pressure $P$ is introduced via a dynamic cosmological constant $\Lambda$. By employing semi-classical tunneling calculations with self-gravitation corrections, we demonstrate that emission probabilities exhibit a direct correlation with variations in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Significantly, the radiation spectrum deviates from pure thermality, aligning with unitary quantum evolution while maintaining consistency with standard phase space results. Moreover, through thermodynamic analysis, we have verified that the emission rate of particles is related to the difference in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the emitted particles before and after they tunnel through the potential barrier. These findings establish particle tunneling as a unified probe of quantum gravitational effects in black hole thermodynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">116.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22178" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">When backgrounds become signals: neutrino interactions in xenon-based dark matter detectors</a><span class="id">[2509.22178]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Direct detection dark matter experiments have proven to be compelling probes for studying low-energy neutrino interactions with both nuclei and atomic electrons, offering complementary information to accelerator and reactor-based neutrino experiments. Recently, the XENONnT and PandaX-4T collaborations reported the first evidence of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from $^8\mathrm{B}$ solar neutrinos. Thanks to their excellent background rejection capabilities and distinctive signal signatures, dual-phase time projection chambers are also sensitive to $pp$ solar neutrinos via their elastic scattering off atomic electrons in the target material. Although this signal is subdominant within the Standard Model, it becomes significantly enhanced in many beyond the Standard Model scenarios, offering a unique opportunity to probe new physics in the low-energy regime. While the precision of current neutrino measurements from dark matter detectors remains lower than that achieved by dedicated neutrino experiments, their sensitivity to the tau neutrino component of solar neutrinos helps complete the overall picture, especially when investigating flavor-dependent new physics effects.</p></div></details></article></body>
