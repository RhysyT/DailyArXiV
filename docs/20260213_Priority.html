We find differences in the spin and the concentrations of the LSBGs haloes and the host haloes of high-surface-brightness galaxies (HSBGs), consistent with previous studies. By analysing their spatial and kinematical distribution of satellites, we find that LSBGs tend to have a larger number of satellites than HSBGs and with a larger velocity dispersion. Moreover, we obtain a continuous relation between the number of satellites and surface brightness, particularly for massive central galaxies. We also find a relation between surface brightness and the relative tangential velocity of the satellites. For a given stellar mass, the existence of LSBGs is strongly correlated with their satellite system dominated by rotation. Furthermore, the satellite system is systematically in counter-rotation with respect to the primary disc in LSBGs. We propose that this fact reflects that these galaxies have not experienced a significantly high rate of mergers, which are more likely associated with radial orbits expected in systems of galaxies with a high surface brightness.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlastBerries: How Supernovae Affect Lyman Continuum Escape Fractions and Ionizing Photon Production in Local Analogs of High-Redshift Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2602.11261]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While compact, star-forming galaxies are believed to play a key role in cosmic reionization, the physical mechanisms enabling the escape of ionizing photons through the galactic interstellar medium remain unclear. Supernova (SN) feedback is one possible mechanism for clearing neutral gas channels to allow the escape of Lyman continuum photons. Here, we use SN discoveries in low-redshift analogs of high-redshift star-forming galaxies – Green Pea galaxies and their even lower-redshift counterparts, Blueberry (BB) galaxies – to understand how SNe shape the properties of their host galaxies at high redshifts. We cross-match 1242 BB galaxies with transient discovery reports and identify 11 SNe, ten of which are likely core-collapse SNe, and compare their hosts to the larger BB population. We find that SN-hosting BBs exhibit elevated star formation rates, burstier star formation histories within the last $\sim$50 Myr, and higher stellar masses. We estimate the occurrence rates of SNe in BB galaxies, finding that the SN rate may be slightly suppressed in BBs compared to field galaxies of similar mass, but we are unable to fully control for observational uncertainties. Finally, SN hosts show bluer UV slopes than non-host BB galaxies at 2.1$\sigma$ significance and lower ionizing photon production efficiency at 7.9$\sigma$ significance; the former result offers modest support for the hypothesis that SN-driven feedback plays a role in facilitating the escape of ionizing photons, while the latter may imply that SN-driven quenching decreases the rate of ionizing photon production in compact star-forming galaxies during the epoch of reionization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tango of Titans: Centaurus A and M83 as a Local Group Analog</a><span class="id">[2602.11268]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Centaurus A (CenA) and M83 form one of the most massive galaxy pairs in the nearby Universe. Although their observed heliocentric velocities suggest motion that is not obviously indicative of mutual attraction, this work presents evidence that CenA and M83 are in fact infalling toward each other, exhibiting a dynamical interaction analogous to the binary-like motion of the Milky Way and Andromeda in the Local Group (LG). Using the Timing Argument (TA), calibrated with analog galaxy pairs from the AbacusSummit simulation, we estimate the total mass of the CenA/M83 system under the assumption that the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity is dominated by motion toward the system's barycenter. This yields a total mass of $(6.36 \pm 1.30) \cdot 10^{12}\, M_\odot$. The inferred mass agrees well with independent estimates based on virial mass measurements and $K$-band luminosity–to-mass ratios. Together, the consistent bound signature and robust mass determination highlight the CenA/M83 system as a compelling nearby analog to the LG. Further discussion of NGC 4945 as a main perturber (as the Large Magellanic Could) for the CenA is also discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11269" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Quasar Proximity Effect as an Alternative Probe of Quasar Pair Distances</a><span class="id">[2602.11269]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently discovered quasar pairs at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim$5) are likely precursors to supermassive black hole mergers, providing a promising window to high redshift quasar growth mechanisms. However, the large uncertainties on their relative distances along the line-of-sight ($d_{\rm l.o.s.}$) limits our ability to characterize quasar pairs. In this study, we explore synthetic quasar proximity zone spectra as an alternative method to constrain the line-of-sight distance of quasar pairs. We find that for small sky-plane separations ($d_{\rm sky}\approx 10-100$ pkpc), a simple peak finding algorithm can easily distinguish between scenarios of $d_{\rm l.o.s.} \lesssim1$ pMpc and $\gtrsim1$ pMpc. For cases where the true $d_{\rm l.o.s.} \geq 3$ pMpc, the accuracy of $d_{\rm l.o.s.}$ estimation is $\approx 0.2$ pMpc. Large sky-plane separations of $d_{\rm sky}=1$ pMpc have larger absolute uncertainties in $d_{\rm l.o.s.}$ estimates, but the method can still easily distinguish between scenarios where $d_{\rm l.o.s.}\lesssim4$ pMpc and $\gtrsim4$ pMpc. $d_{\rm l.o.s.}$ estimates have an uncertainty of $\approx$0.5 pMpc when true $d_{\rm l.o.s.} \gtrsim4$ pMpc. Our proof-of-concept study illustrates the potential use of quasar proximity zones to constrain the 3-dimensional quasar pair configuration, providing an avenue to characterize quasar pairs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Curious Case of Centaurus A II: On the Subject of the Quenched satellites</a><span class="id">[2602.11270]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The satellite system of Centaurus A presents a curious cosmological puzzle: while the global population is consistent with theoretical expectations, its inner regions (d&lt;150 kpc) exhibit a deficit of luminous satellite galaxies. Using the Galacticus semi-analytic model applied to high-resolution N-body merger trees, we investigate potential quenching mechanisms to explain this trend. Our fiducial models, calibrated to the Milky Way, reproduce the overall Cen A population but overpredict the number of bright inner-halo satellites by a factor of 4 +- 1 at Mv &lt; -15.8. We find that this is not due to statistical variance. Instead, the spatial coincidence of this deficiency with Cen A's massive, kiloparsec-scale radio lobes suggests a powerful environmental driver. We explore a range of physical scenarios, including enhanced tidal disruption, reionization quenching, and suppressed accretion into halos from the surrounding intergalactic medium. Our results indicate that AGN-driven thermal feedback at z &lt; 5 can significantly suppress star formation in satellites, effectively truncating the bright end of the inner luminosity function. Our work suggests that the &quot;Curious Case of Centaurus A&quot; may provide evidence of AGN feedback within the host galaxy that regulates the survival and evolution of its dwarf galaxy satellites.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tailored mass estimators for Milky Way dwarf Spheroidals</a><span class="id">[2602.11273]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Assuming spherical symmetry and dynamical equilibrium within a given gravitational potential, a dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy's globally averaged stellar velocity dispersion depends entirely on the shape of its stellar density profile. Thus, the dynamical inference of a dSph's gravitational potential is necessarily sensitive to assumptions about that shape. Relaxing standard assumptions, we fit flexible stellar density models to observations of the Milky Way's known dSph satellites. Considering various choices for the density profile shape and spatial extent of a host dark matter halo, we use the virial theorem to propagate observational uncertainties about the shapes of the inferred dSph stellar density profiles to uncertainties in the inferred dynamical masses. We find that the observed structural diversity of the Milky Way dSph population implies a large range of potential systematic errors (up to factors of 10) associated with standard dynamical mass estimators. We show that accounting for these observational and systematic uncertainties can significantly alter the appearance and behavior of dSph dynamical scaling relations, including enclosed dynamical mass vs. stellar mass and the Radial Acceleration Relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPT-3G D1: Compton-$y$ maps using data from the SPT-3G and Planck surveys</a><span class="id">[2602.11279]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) Compton-$y$ parameter maps constructed from two years (2019-2020) of observations with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) third-generation camera, SPT-3G, combined with data from the Planck satellite. Using a linear combination (LC) pipeline, we obtain a suite of reconstructions that explore different trade-offs between statistical sensitivity and suppression of astrophysical contaminants, including minimum-variance, CMB-deprojected, and CIB-deprojected $y$-maps. We validate these maps through different statistical techniques such as auto- and cross-power spectra with large-scale structure tracers as well as stacking on cluster locations. These tests are used to understand the balance between noise and astrophysical foreground residuals (such as the CIB) in combination with the recovery of the tSZ signal for different maps. For example, results from stacking at the location of clusters confirm the robustness of the recovered tSZ signal over the $\sim 1500\: {\rm deg}^2$ SPT-3G survey field used in this analysis. The high-resolution and low-noise maps produced here provide an important cosmological tool for future studies, including measurements of the Compton-$y$ map power spectrum, cross-correlations with other tracers of the large-scale structure, detailed modeling of cluster pressure profiles, and study of the thermodynamic state of the baryons in the Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First statistical constraints on galactic scale outflows properties traced by their extended Mg II emission with MUSE</a><span class="id">[2602.11280]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxies evolve within vast gaseous halos that fuel star formation and carry signatures of feedback-driven outflows. Deep integral field data have enabled the study of MgII halos, which trace galaxy-scale outflows in emission, but their faintness has limited studies to single-object analyses. Here, we present the first statistical study of MgII-emitting halos using deep MUSE observations of 47 star-forming galaxies at $0.7&lt;z&lt;2.0$. Building on our previous work, where we developed and applied an outflow modeling framework for a single MgII halo, we now extend this approach to a larger sample, enabling robust population-level insights on the properties of circumgalactic outflows traced by their extended MgII emission. We detect extended emission out to tens of kiloparsecs and model the outflows as an ensemble of radially accelerating shells. Galaxies with MgII outflows tend to have higher SFRs, sSFRs, and younger stellar populations, consistent with star-formation-driven winds. The observations are consistent with winds that accelerate linearly with radius, from launching velocities of  60 km/s up to maximum velocities that correlate with stellar mass and reach  490 km/s. Their inner regions are highly opaque, and we find a tentative trend between stellar mass and central optical depth. The opening angle of the outflow shows some dependency on the host-galaxy stellar mass, with less massive galaxies showing primarily wide opening angles, and more massive galaxies showing a broader range of values, with both wide and narrow opening angles. The distribution of the spatial extent of MgII halos exhibits a clear peak at half-light radius (HLR) of  5 kpc, with an extended tail of larger HLR values, up to  20 kpc. Compact halo sizes (HLR $&lt; 8$ kpc) correlate with stellar mass, but extended halos do not, which could suggest a difference in the powering mechanism between compact and extended halos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using astrochemical models to simulate reactivity experiments on cold surfaces</a><span class="id">[2602.11347]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The development of molecular complexity during stellar and planetary formation owes much to the interaction of gas and dust. When the first astrochemical models including solid-state chemistry were developed more than forty years ago, data from dedicated laboratory experiments were limited. Since then, many groups have developed specific experimental setups to address this issue, but astrochemical models have rarely been directly confronted with these new results. We want to demonstrate whether it is possible to use rate-equation-type astrochemical models developed in the context of the Interstellar Medium to compare them with laboratory astrophysics experiments. In this work, we use the case of low-temperature hydrogenation of CO, which is known to lead to methanol, among other molecules. We carried out 9 experiments, varying the experimental parameters such as temperature and dose. We give quantitative results and take care of detailing the vocabulary used in the experiments. We use astrochemical codes, NAUTILUS, pyRate and MONACO, to reproduce our experimental conditions, which requires good control of the change of vocabulary and scales, especially for fluxes and time scales. This work demonstrates that it is possible to use different astrochemical codes to compare modelling results directly with the output of experiments. There are discrepancies between models and experiments, as well as between models, but a fair agreement is achieved. We discuss the possible origin of the differences, which could originate from the chemical network or the difference in the description of physical processes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMA Band1 observations of the rhoOphW filament I. Enhanced power from excess microwave emission at high spatial frequencies</a><span class="id">[2602.11356]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rhoOphW photo-dissociation region (PDR) is an example source of bright excess microwave emission (EME), over synchrotron, free-free, and the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the sub-millimetre (sub-mm) dust continuum. Its filamentary morphology follows roughly that of the IR poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) bands. The EME signal in rhoOphW drops abruptly above  30GHz and its spectrum can be interpreted in terms of electric-dipole radiation from spinning dust grains, or “spinning dust”. Deep and high-fidelity imaging and spectroscopy of rhoOphW may reveal the detailed morphology of the EME signal, free from imaging priors, while also enabling a search for fine structure in its spectrum. The same observations may constrain the spectral index of the high-frequency drop. An ALMA Band1 mosaic yields a deep deconvolved image of the filament at 36-44GHz, which we use as template for the extraction of a spectrum via cross-correlation in the uv-plane. Simulations and cross-correlations on near-infrared ancillary data yield estimates of flux-loss and biases. The spectrum is a power law, with no detectable fine structure. It follows a spectral index alpha=-0.78+-0.05, in frequency, with some variations along the filament. Interestingly, the Band1 power at high spatial frequencies increases relative to that of the IR signal, with a factor of two more power in Band1 at  20” than at  100” (relative to IRAC3.6um). An extreme of such radio-only structures is a compact EME source, without IR counterpart. It is embedded in strong and filamentary Band1 signal, while the IRAC maps are smooth in the same region. We provide multi-frequency intensity estimates for spectral modelling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11418" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for Shallow Nebular Attenuation Curves and Patchy Dust Geometry at z 2 with Pa-beta/H-alpha Measurements from JWST-MegaScience Medium Band Photometry</a><span class="id">[2602.11418]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We constrain the nebular attenuation curve and investigate dust geometry in star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon using photometric medium-band emission line measurements. We measure H-alpha emission line fluxes for a sample of 209 star-forming galaxies at 1.2&lt;z&lt;2.4 in MegaScience/UNCOVER with stellar masses spanning $7.85&lt;\log_{10}(M_*/M_\odot)&lt;11.0$. For 66 of these galaxies, we also measure a Pa-beta flux. We find that the Pa-beta/H-alpha line ratio increases strongly with stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) across our full mass range, indicating that more massive galaxies are dustier. We compare our results with a mass-, SFR-, and redshift-matched sample of galaxies from the MOSDEF survey with spectroscopic measurements of H-alpha/H-beta, finding that a shallow Reddy et al. (2025) nebular attenuation curve is more consistent with our observations than the typically assumed Cardelli et al. (1989) attenuation curve, especially for massive galaxies. This shallow attenuation curve could be explained by low dust covering fractions in star-forming regions. Through comparison to other studies, we show that assuming this shallower attenuation curve can increase the inferred A_Halpha,neb by up to 1 magnitude at high masses. We observe no trend between A_Halpha,neb and axis ratio, indicating that nebular attenuation is likely localized to small clumps. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that dust geometry is patchy and non-uniform, especially in massive galaxies. Our results highlight the ability of JWST medium bands to probe emission lines for large samples of galaxies, and statistically constrain dust properties in upcoming large programs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11450" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The &quot;bubbly&quot; interstellar medium as origin for the inhomogeneous internal metallicity distributions in large disk galaxies</a><span class="id">[2602.11450]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Resolved metallicity studies of local disk galaxies have revealed that their interstellar media (ISMs) are far from chemically homogeneous, displaying significant ($\sim 0.05$ dex) variations in the metallicity on characteristic scales of a few hundred parsecs. Such data is at odds with most analytical models, where the ISM is predicted to be more well-mixed. Here, we suggest that the observed small-scale features seen in galaxies may be superbubbles of metal-enriched gas created by a collection of core collapse supernovae with tight spatial (and temporal) correlation. In this scenario, the size of the metallicity fluctuations (superbubble radius, $\phi$) is set by the disk scale height of the galaxy in question (after which point shock breakout favours preferential expansion along directions perpendicular to the dense disc), and the amount of additional metals contained within a fluctuation is proportional to the star formation efficiency in superbubble regions ($\epsilon$). To test this theory, we analysed metallicity maps from the PHANGS-MUSE sample of galaxies using a geostatistical forward-modelling approach. We find $\phi \simeq 300$ pc and $\epsilon = 0.1-0.2$, in good agreement with our theoretical model. Further, these small-scale parameters are found to be related to the global galaxy properties, suggesting that the local structure of the interstellar medium of galaxies is not universal. Such a model of star formation paints a new picture of galaxy evolution in the modern universe: in large local galaxies, star formation appears steady and regular when averaged over large scales. However, on small scales, these large galaxies remain intrinsically bursty like their smaller, high-redshift counterparts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unification Model of Active Galactic Nuclei by Photoionization Equilibrium Calculation Based on Radiative Hydrodynamic Simulations</a><span class="id">[2602.11474]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To investigate the origin of the dependence of the covering factor on the Eddington ratio suggested by X-ray observations, we examined the angular distribution of HI and HII based on two-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulations. To calculate the Compton-thin covering factor $C_{22}$ and Compton-thick covering factor $C_{24}$ of HI alone, we performed one-dimensional photoionization equilibrium calculations with the XSTAR code based on radiative hydrodynamic simulations. The results obtained are as follows. (1) The Compton-thin covering factor $C_{22}$ of HI and HII is independent of the Eddington ratio and is approximately $70\%$, while $C_{22}$ of HI alone is also independent of the Eddington ratio and is approximately $30\%$. (2) The Compton-thick covering factor $C_{24}$ of HI has the same value as $C_{22}$ of HI. (3) Our $C_{24}$ is consistent with that obtained from X-ray observations. (4) Our $C_{22}$ agrees with that obtained from X-ray observations in a high Eddington ratio, while our $C_{22}$ is smaller than that from X-ray observations in a low Eddington ratio. (5) To explain the difference between $C_{22}$ obtained from theoretical calculations and that inferred from X-ray observations, a Compton-thin gas is required in regions extending at least $10~\mathrm{pc}$ beyond the current computational regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stone Skipping Black Holes in Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons</a><span class="id">[2602.11512]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The orbit of a black hole moving within an ultralight dark matter (ULDM) soliton is naively expected to decay due to dynamical friction. However, single black holes can undergo “stone skipping”, with their orbital radius varying quasi-periodically. We show that stone skipping is induced by the dipole excitation of the soliton. We model it as resonance in a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, demonstrating that the coherent response of the soliton can significantly modify the dynamics of objects orbiting within it. This suggests that a dipole perturbation of a soliton can modify inspiral timescales if the black holes masses are significantly less than the soliton mass, with implications for supermassive black hole dynamics, the final parsec problem and gravitational wave observations in a ULDM cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALMA-QUARKS Survey: Discovery of Dusty Fibrils inside Massive Star-forming Clumps</a><span class="id">[2602.11617]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of more than 323 superfine dusty filamentary structures (fibrils) inside 121 massive star forming clumps that are located in widely different Galactic environments (Galactocentric distances of $\sim$0.5-12.7 kpc). These fibrils are identified from the 1.3 mm continuum emission in the ALMA-QUARKS survey, which has a linear resolution of $\sim900$ AU for a source at $\sim$3 kpc, using the \textit{FilFinder} software. Using \textit{RadFil} software, we find that the typical width of these fibrils is $\sim$0.01 pc, which is about ten times narrower than that of dusty filaments in nearby clouds identified by the \textit{Herschel} Space Observatory. The mass ($M$) versus length ($L$) relation for these fibrils follows $M\propto L^{2}$, similar to that of Galactic filaments identified in space (e.g., \textit{Herschel}) and ground-based single-dish (e.g., \textit{APEX}) surveys. However, these fibrils are significantly denser ($\mathrm{N_{H_2} = 10^{23}-10^{24}\ cm^{-2}}$) than the filaments found in previous \textit{Herschel} surveys ($\mathrm{N_{H_2} = 10^{20}-10^{23}\ cm^{-2}}$). This work contributes a large sample of superfine fibrils in massive clumps, following the identification of large 0.1-pc wide filaments and associated internal velocity coherent fibers in nearby molecular clouds, further emphasizing the crucial role played by filamentary structures in star formation at various physical scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Multiwavelength Evaluation of AGN in the Post-Starburst Phase</a><span class="id">[2602.11644]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The quenching of star formation is a crucial phase in galaxy evolution. Although active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback has been proposed as a key driver of this transition, the lack of strong AGN in nearby quenching galaxies raises questions about its effectiveness. In this study, we investigate AGN activity in post-starburst galaxies (PSBs), star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z&lt;$ 0.2, using multiwavelength data from eROSITA/eFEDS (X-ray), WISE (mid-infrared), and FIRST (radio). We assess AGN incidence and strength across different stages and apply stacking techniques to undetected galaxies to recover average AGN properties. Comparisons between observed luminosity and that expected from star formation (L$_{\rm obs}$/L$_{\rm SF}$) show that PSBs are consistent with star formation dominating their radio and X-ray emission. Although PSBs exhibit a MIR AGN incidence rate twice that of SFGs, their estimated AGN luminosities are small compared to those of MIR AGN in the literature. PSBs overall do not display significantly enhanced AGN emission relative to mass- and redshift-matched SFGs and QGs. While the presence of obscured, low-luminosity AGN in PSBs cannot be excluded, such AGN, if present, could be fueled by residual gas from the preceding starburst and may not play a dominant role in quenching. Our findings suggest that AGN's role in quenching at low redshift is more subtle than violently removing the gas – the feedback is likely more &quot;preventive&quot; than &quot;ejective&quot;.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The faint end of the UV luminosity function at $0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7$ from the Hubble Frontier Fields</a><span class="id">[2602.11681]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>By extending the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) observations to the F225W band using HST WFC3/UVIS, we measure the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF) of galaxies at $0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7$, pushing into the low-luminosity galaxy regime. In this first paper of a series, we describe the HST Cycle-27 GO-15940 F225W observations and data reduction, and present a corresponding catalog for the Abell 2744 field, which is the most data-rich HFF cluster field. Combining deep Near-UV imaging and the high magnification from strong gravitational lensing of the foreground cluster, we identify 152 faint galaxies with $-19.5 &lt; M_{UV} &lt; -12.1$ at $0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7$ through hybrid photometric-spectroscopic redshift selection from the Abell 2744 F225W catalog.

We incorporate a curvature parameter $\delta$ in parameter estimation to account for a possible turn-over at the faint end of the UV LF, leveraging the exceedingly low luminosities probed by our sample. Our results rule out a turn-over brighter than $M_{UV} = -15.5$ at the $3\sigma$ confidence level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11736" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subaru High-$z$ Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs).

However, previous observations have shown a range of environments around them. The previous targets are limited to bright quasars ($M_{1450}\lesssim-25$), for which photoevaporation may hinder galaxy formation in their vicinity. Here, we present Subaru/Hyper-Suprime Cam observations of the environments of four low-luminosity quasars ($-24&lt;M_{1450}&lt;-22$) at $z\sim6.18$, which are expected to have a smaller photoevaporation effect. We detect Lyman $\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) around them with narrowband NB872 imaging, and measure the local LAE overdensity. One quasar (J0844$-$0132) resides in an overdense region ($\delta_\mathrm{LAE}=3.77\pm0.97$), whereas the other three fields are consistent with normal fields. The result is confirmed over the proximity zone of each quasar, suggesting that the diverse environment around quasars is independent of photoevaporation. We find no significant correlation between the LAE overdensities and the properties of host galaxies and supermassive black holes. Our quasars have host stellar mass measurements from JWST, allowing us to compare them with the LAE overdensity around galaxies without quasar activity with comparable stellar masses. We find that the LAE overdensity in the J0844$-$0132 field is stronger than that of galaxies with similar stellar mass at $z\sim6$, while the other quasar fields show a comparable LAE overdensity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of submillimeter galaxies across cosmic-web environments</a><span class="id">[2602.11751]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) provide valuable insights into galaxy formation and evolution and are likely influenced by their cosmic environment. However, their rarity makes environmental trends difficult to establish. We use the FLAMINGO simulation, which simultaneously reproduces the redshift distribution and number counts of SMGs. We use the DisPerSE to identify filamentary structures at $z=4$, 3, 2, 1.5, and 1. We define inner cluster-halo, outer cluster-halo, inner filament, outer filament, and void/wall environments at each redshift considering mass evolution of cluster-halos and density evolution of filaments. For a fixed stellar-mass cut of $M_* \geq 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, the fraction of SMGs in the inner cluster-halo environment declines from $\sim30\%$ at $z=4$ to $\sim3\%$ by $z=1$, and similar trends are observed in other environments. The abundance of SMGs within a cluster-halo increases with halo mass, mirroring the increase in the total galaxy population. Consequently, the ratio of SMG halo occupation to that of all galaxies is largely insensitive to halo mass, but varies with redshift. In contrast, the ratio of the halo occupation of non-SMGs to that of all galaxies declines with halo mass and shows little redshift evolution. We show that the central and satellite SMGs form two distinct populations in inner cluster-halos. SMGs occupy the metal-rich side of the metallicity distribution, but rarely attain the highest metallicities because ongoing enrichment is limited by gas depletion. The brightest SMGs (S$_{850} &gt; 10$ mJy) are found exclusively in inner cluster-halos, highlighting a strong connection between SMG luminosity and environmental density. Our results show that SMGs dominate star formation in dense environments, contributing up to $80\%$ of the SFR in inner cluster-halos at $z=4$, but less than $50\%$ in low-density regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterising Ly$α$ damping wings at the onset of reionisation: Evidence for highly efficient star formation driven by dense, neutral gas in UV-bright galaxies at $z&gt;9$</a><span class="id">[2602.11783]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the major conundrums in contemporary extragalactic astrophysics is the apparent overabundance of a remarkable population of UV-bright galaxies at redshifts $z\gtrsim 9$. We analyse galaxies spectroscopically observed by JWST/NIRSpec Prism and confirmed to lie at $z&gt;9$, with sufficient signal-to-noise to carefully model their rest-frame UV to optical continua and line emission. In particular, we model the damped Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) absorption (DLA) features of each galaxy to place observational constraints on the gas assembly of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) onto the galaxy halos at the onset of cosmic reionisation. Based on the derived HI column densities and star-formation rate (SFR) surface densities, we show that all galaxies are highly efficient at forming stars on rapid $\sim 10-100\,$Myr depletion timescales, greatly in excess compared to the canonical local universe Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and predictions from state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations. The dense HI gas appears to also drive the offset from the fundamental-metallicity relation of these galaxies though its dust-to-gas ratio is seemingly consistent with values derived for local galaxies except for the lowest metallicity sight-lines. Our results provide the first robust observational constraints on the impact of pristine HI gas on early galaxy assembly, and imply that a combination of highly efficient star formation and low dust obscuration can likely explain the UV-brightness of galaxies at cosmic dawn.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NE2025: An Updated Electron Density Model for the Galactic Interstellar Medium</a><span class="id">[2602.11838]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Free electrons in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) disperse and scatter coherent radio waves, by amounts that depend on the distance to the radio source. Models of the Galactic electron density are thus widely used to predict distances and scattering of compact radio sources (including pulsars, fast radio bursts (FRBs), and long-period transients), in addition to mitigating ISM foregrounds in Galactic and extragalactic studies. We use a sample of 171 precise pulsar distances, based entirely on parallaxes and globular cluster associations, as well as scattering measurements of 568 pulsars, active galactic nuclei, and masers, to update the NE2001 Galactic electron density model. We refit the thick and thin disks and three of the spiral arms. The new parameters for these large-scale components significantly repartition free electrons between the thick disk and spiral arms, thereby correcting NE2001's systematic underestimation of pulsar distance and scattering. Sightlines with excessive dispersion and scattering are used to identify new clumps that are added to the model, in addition to refining clumps that were already included (e.g., Cygnus, Vela, and Gum). The Galactic Center component is revised, yielding scattering time predictions that are $10^3$ times smaller than the Galactic Center in NE2001. The updated model, NE2025, provides a factor of $20\times$ improvement in median distance prediction accuracy and $100\%$ median improvement in scattering predictions based on DM, relative to NE2001. There is a $15\times$ improvement in median distance prediction accuracy relative to YMW16.

While the timescale to reach this equilibrium is prohibitively long, we find that slow floaters ($v \lesssim \sigma$) undergo mass-independent acceleration, doubling their velocities within a few relaxation times. Consequently, free floaters initially following the Maxwellian distribution of their parent stars develop distinctly non-Maxwellian velocity distributions on a relaxation timescale. Since the relaxation time of the Galactic disk is longer than the age, our results suggest that the kinematics of low-mass free floaters in the disk may preserve signatures of their parent stars and ejection history.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Outflow of the B335 Protostar II: After the Outburst</a><span class="id">[2602.12060]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The B335 protostar has undergone a major outburst detected in the scattered light of its outflow cavity that has not yet ended. B335 therefore offers the rare opportunity to study its effect on the jet of a protostellar object. Photometry of background stars behind B335 is used to map visual continuum extinction and H$_2$O ice absorption and demonstrates that the outflow has carved out a cavity. Precise proper motions of the shock fronts emerging from the B335 protostar were obtained. The kinematic age of the most prominent shock front (3E) corresponds to the early phases of the ongoing outburst of the B335 protostar. Shock 3E shows strong CO gas emission, as well as H$_2$ and [\ion{Fe}{2}] emission. Older shock fronts show diminished CO emission and are dominated by H$_2$ and [\ion{Fe}{2}]. The emission feature 0E, closest to the protostar, is distinct in proper motion and radial velocity from the other shock fronts in the jet. In the span of 4\arcsec\ closest to the protostar, the continuum extinction in front of the outflow cavity increases by A$_V$ $\approx$ 200 mag. The CO-line-removed spectra close to the protostar show the unsaturated absorption features of $^{13}$CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, and OCS have strongly increasing column densities toward the protostar. The ice characteristics are overall similar to those found in lines of sight with less extinction. The central regions of the bipolar nebula show CO gas emission, but at distances of a few arcsec from the protostar, absorption by CO gas is also detected.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12277" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reionization Bubbles from Real-Space Cross Correlations of Line Intensity Maps</a><span class="id">[2602.12277]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a new way to reconstruct the ionized-bubble size distribution during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) through the real-space cross-correlation of 21-cm and star-forming line-intensity maps. Understanding the evolution and timing of the EoR is crucial for both astrophysics and cosmology, and a wealth of information on the first sources can be extracted from the study of ionized bubbles. Nevertheless, directly mapping bubbles is challenging due to the high redshifts involved, possible selection biases, and foregrounds in 21-cm maps. Here, we exploit the real-space cross-correlation $\xi_{21,\nu}$ between 21-cm and line-intensity mapping (LIM) signals to reconstruct the evolution of bubble sizes during reionization. For the first time, we show that $\xi_{21,\nu}(r)$ departs from a saturation level for each separation $r$ when bubbles of size $r$ begin to form, providing a handle for the onset of bubbles of each radius. Moreover, we demonstrate that $\xi_{21,\nu}$ evolves from positive to negative as the EoR progresses, reaching a minimum (i.e. maximum anti-correlation) when bubbles of radius $r$ reach peak abundance. We show that these results are robust to changes in the astrophysical model as well as the timing/topology of reionization. This real-space observable complements usual Fourier-space estimators by capturing the localized nature of bubbles, offering new insights into the sources driving cosmic reionization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What does a regular star look like?</a><span class="id">[2602.12200]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, astronomers discovered unusual Einstein cross images of the galaxy HerS-3, which feature a bright central spot.

However, the vast majority of them feature massive luminous red galaxies as the main deflectors, with late-type galaxies being vastly under-represented. This work presents a dedicated search for lensing by edge-on late-type galaxies in the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS). The search covers $3600$ deg$^2$ of $r$-band observations taken from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We considered all sources with magnitudes in the range $17 &lt; r &lt; 20.5$, without any colour pre-selection, yielding a parent sample of seven million sources. We characterised our parent sample via the visual inspection of $120\,000$ sources selected at random. From it, we estimate, with a 68% confidence interval, that 1 in every $30\,000$ sources is an edge-on lens candidate, with at least eight high-quality candidates in the parent sample. Our search relied on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to select a reduced sample of candidates, which we followed with a visual inspection to curate the final sample. The CNN was trained from scratch using simulated $r$-band observations of edge-on lenses, and real observations of non-lenses. We found 61 good edge-on lens candidates using the CNN. Moreover, combining the CNN candidates with those found serendipitously and those identified while characterising the parent sample, we discovered 4 grade A, 20 grade B, and 58 grade C edge-on lens candidates, effectively doubling the known sample of these systems. We also discovered 16 grade A, 16 grade B, and 18 grade C lens candidates of other types. Finally, based on the characterisation of the parent sample, we estimate that our search found around 60% of the bright grade A and B edge-on lens candidates within the parent sample.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How the cosmic voids contribute to stalling and quenching the giant galaxies on their surfaces</a><span class="id">[2508.12283]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report a numerical hint that the formations of cosmic voids may be closely linked with the mechanism through which the giant galaxies on void surfaces establish elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower specific star formation rates (sSFR). Identifying the voids from the TNG300-1 simulations via the Void-Finder algorithm \cite{HV02} at $z=0$, $0.5$ and $1$, we explore if and how the shapes of the TNG galaxies located on void surfaces are aligned with the directions toward the void centers. Noting that only the giant void-surface galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\star}\ge 10^{10.5}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ exhibit significant tendency of perpendicular alignments, we dichotomize them into two $M_{\star}$-controlled samples according to their morphologies (elliptical or spiral), colors (redder or bluer), sSFR (lower or higher) and stellar ages (older or younger). It is found at all of the three redshifts that the perpendicular alignments of void-surface galaxies become stronger for the cases that they have elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR, but showing weak dependence on the stellar ages. It is also shown that the numerical results are well described by the analytical one-parameter model developed by Lee \cite{lee19} under the assumption of the existence of a linear scaling between the covariance matrices of galaxy shape axes and local tidal tensors. We test the robustness of alignment signals against the variation of void-finder algorithms and its feasibility against the redshift-space and projection effects. Our results lead us to speculate that the formation and expansion of voids may have an effect of stalling and quenching the giant void-surface galaxies by compressing adjacent matter and then preventing them from radial infall/accretion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06922" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ly$α$ and Continuum Origins Survey.

The Ly$\alpha$ and Continuum Origins Survey (LaCOS) is the first program to obtain uniform, multi-wavelength subkiloparsec imaging for a large sample (42) of galaxies observed in LyC and enable statistically robust studies between LyC and resolved galaxy properties. Here, we characterize the morphology and galaxy merger properties of LaCOS galaxies and investigate their connection with the escape fraction of LyC emission $f_{esc}^{LyC}$. We find strong anticorrelations between $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ and size ($r_{20}$, $r_{50}$, and $r_{80}$) measured in filters containing emission from star-forming regions, and with the asymmetry and clumpiness in F150LP, the bluest filter in our dataset, tracing UV continuum and Ly$\alpha$. We find that $\geq48\%$ of LaCOS galaxies, and $\geq41\%$ of LaCOS LyC-emitters are visually classified as galaxy mergers. Galaxies robustly identified as mergers in LaCOS are at advanced stages of interaction, close to coalescence. The $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ properties of robust mergers and low-probability mergers cannot be differentiated statistically, and we only find significant difference between the two populations in terms of their of their sizes and LyC luminosity: robust mergers having larger values. We conclude that (i) $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ tends to be larger in galaxies with a small number of compact, centrally-located, UV-emitting star-forming regions, (ii) at advanced stages of interaction represent a sizable fraction of LyC-emitting samples at $z\sim0.3$, $z\sim0$, and (iii) mergers can facilitate the escape of LyC photons from galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07354" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supernovae drive large-scale, incompressible turbulence through small-scale instabilities</a><span class="id">[2509.07354]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade at the observed velocity dispersion. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SN-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. 2025, I show that isolated SNRs source incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation localized at the unstable contact discontinuity. Through the spherical harmonic power spectrum of the corrugations, I provide evidence that this process is seeded by surface instabilities and 2D turbulence on the shell, which corrugates and folds the interface, becoming the strongest source of baroclinicity in the simulations. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode (co)spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs, and reveals a $\propto k^{3/4}$ spectrum that drives the turbulence. I show that vortex stretching allows for modes to be shed from the contact discontinuity into the surrounding medium and derive a timescale criterion for this process, revealing that young SNRs with radii close to the cooling radius are efficient at radiating turbulence. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism revealed in Beattie et al. 2025, this opens the possibility that the $k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable layer, imprints itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale structure in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Timescales of Embedded Star Formation as Observed in STARFORGE</a><span class="id">[2509.18322]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Star formation occurs within dusty molecular clouds that are then disrupted by stellar feedback. However, the timing and physical mechanisms that govern the transition from deeply embedded to exposed stars remain uncertain. Using the STARFORGE simulations, we analyze the evolution of “embeddedness”, identifying what drives emergence. We find the transition from embedded to exposed is fast for individual stars, within 1.3 Myr after the star reaches its maximum mass. This rapid transition is dominated by massive stars, which accrete while remaining highly obscured until their feedback eventually balances, then overcomes, the local accretion. For these massive stars, their maximum mass is reached simultaneously with their emergence. Once these stars are revealed, their localized, pre-supernova feedback then impacts the cloud, driving gas clearance. Because massive stars dominate the luminosity, their fast, local evolution dominates the light emergence from the dust. We calculate the dependence of these processes on the mass of the cloud and find that emergence always depends on when massive stars form, which scales with the cloud's free-fall time. We also measure the evolution of dust and H$\alpha$ luminosities, where for $\sim$2 Myr, these tracers outshine the emerging stellar continuum, reaching their peak when gas and dust remain tightly coupled to the massive stars. These results closely resemble observationally observed lifetimes, tying the observable dust and line emission directly to the same localized processes that drive stellar emergence, evidence that our simulated de-embedding physics is representative of real star-forming regions. Thus, because the initial embedding of the most luminous stars is highly local, the emergence of stars is a faster, earlier, more local event than the overall disruption of the cloud by gas expulsion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy assembly bias in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: a comparison between SIMBA and IllustrisTNG</a><span class="id">[2511.01441]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modelling of large-scale structure is increasingly concerned with galaxy assembly bias (GAB), the dependence of galaxy clustering on quantities other than halo mass. We investigate how baryonic physics affects the strength and redshift evolution of GAB using the largest runs of two state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. We quantify GAB by comparing the clustering of stellar-mass-selected galaxies to that of shuffled samples, where galaxies are randomly reassigned to haloes of similar mass. We find that GAB in both simulations increases from approximately zero at $z=5$ to a $\sim\,5\%$ change in clustering amplitude at $z=2$. After this epoch, the trends diverge: GAB in TNG continues to increase, reaching $\sim\,10\%$ at $z=0$, while in SIMBA it decreases to nearly zero. By further shuffling galaxies within bins of halo mass and cosmic environment – characterised by smoothed matter overdensity ($\delta_5$) and tidal anisotropy ($\alpha_5$) – we show that most of the GAB in both simulations can be attributed to the overdensity, while tidal anisotropy contributes negligibly in both simulations. Exploring this effect from the point of view of the halo occupation distribution (HOD), we find that numbers of central and satellite galaxies vary with overdensity – but only near the respective turn-on masses for these two constituents: the galaxy contents of high-mass haloes are very nearly independent of environment. We present a simple parameterisation that allows the HOD modelling to be modified to reflect this form of density-dependent GAB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamics in the Cores of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos: Reduced Stalling and Accelerated Core Collapse</a><span class="id">[2511.14912]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is an intriguing alternative to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, which predicts that dark matter halos typically have large, isothermal cores. Numerical simulations have shown that dynamical friction ceases to operate in cores of (roughly) constant density, a phenomenon known as core stalling. In addition, such cores often are unstable to a dipole instability that gives rise to dynamical buoyancy, causing massive central objects to move outward. Thus far, these manifestations of core dynamics have only been demonstrated in collisionless systems. In this paper, we use idealized N-body simulations to study whether core stalling and dynamical buoyancy operate in SIDM halos. We find that if the self-interactions are sufficiently strong, neither core stalling nor buoyancy are present, and a massive perturber will quickly sink all the way to the center of its host. In doing so, it gravitationally contracts the core, catalyzing a strongly accelerated core collapse. The reason why core dynamics are so different in SIDM halos is that self-interactions drive the halo's distribution function to a featureless exponential, removing any inflections or plateaus that are responsible for the dipole instability and core stalling in the case of CDM. We discuss implications of our finding for constraining the nature of dark matter by using observations of massive objects such as supermassive black holes (SMBHs), globular clusters, and nuclear star clusters in the central regions of galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16549" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">N-emitters as possible sign-posts of GC formation</a><span class="id">[2512.16549]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Based on the finding of unusual chemical abundance ratios of N-emitters, which resemble those of globular cluster (GC) stars, their compactness, high ISM densities and other properties, it has been suggested that N-emitters could indicate the formation sites of globulars. A recent statistical study of the N-emitter population has quantified the frequency $f_N$ of these rare objects and their redshift evolution (Morel et al. 2025). Using these results we here test if N-emitters trace the formation of GCs and use the observed cosmic star-formation rate density evolution to predict the cosmological evolution of the GC population with time, their age distribution, and the total present-day stellar mass density formed in globulars. The predicted age distribution of GCs strongly resembles the typical asymmetric observed distributions in the Galaxy and ellipiticals, with a peak at $\sim 11.5-12$ Gyr and a longer tail extending to younger ages. We derive a total stellar mass density formed in N-emitters down to redshift zero of $(2-7) \times 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, which matches within a factor $\sim 2$ the observed fraction of stellar mass found in the GC population at $z=0$.

Using Gaia DR3 proper motions to probe the association's internal kinematics, we find aligned stellar velocities on length scales &lt;2 pc, two-point statistics that show increasing velocity differences and predominantly divergent motions at larger separations, and distinct velocities for star clusters within the association. Finally, the association exhibits gradual but statistically significant global expansion perpendicular to the Galactic plane, with a spatial gradient of 0.10 +/- 0.02 km/s/pc. The clumpy stellar distribution, correlated velocities on small scales, and increasingly divergent motions on larger scales are consistent with an initial velocity field inherited from a turbulent molecular cloud modified by stellar feedback. The global vertical expansion may arise from large-scale turbulence or feedback-driven shell expansion, with the H II region Sh 2-54 preferentially pushing the molecular gas away from the Galactic plane. Ser OB2 demonstrates that the multi-scale expansion of an OB association can begin even while star formation is still ongoing throughout the complex.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Submillimeter and Radio Observations in the SSA22 Field.

The median mass-weighted age is 567 Myr. Most galaxies in our sample began forming $\sim$ 1.68 Gyr after the Big Bang, entered the `SMG phase' after $\sim$ 1 Gyr of evolution – when they are predominantly observed – and largely transitioned out of the `SMG phase' to become quiescent within an additional $\sim$ 0.2 Gyr. A subset of massive galaxies shows rapid early assembly with high star formation efficiencies ($\sim$0.2-0.8). The majority of SMGs reside at the high-mass end of the star-forming main sequence, with a characteristic stellar mass of $M_{star} \sim 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, above which galaxies are predominantly either on the main sequence or already quenched. We observe a downsizing trend: more massive galaxies tend to “mature&quot; earlier, completing their major episodes of star formation at higher redshifts compared to lower-mass systems. Our sample contributes $\sim$ 21% (28%) to the cosmic star formation rate density (stellar mass density), including the overdensity, with its relative contribution peaking at 50-60% in the redshift range $z=2.5-3.5$. The median infrared-radio correlation parameter $q_{IR}$ is 2.37, evolving as $(1+z)^{-0.11}$, likely due to AGN contributions at high redshift and intrinsic differences between low- and high-redshift populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Submillimeter and Radio Observations in the SSA22 Field.

Using multiple identification methods, we have identified 248 deblended SMG candidates for 192 SCUBA-2 sources. The average multiplicity of SCUBA-2 sources is $\sim$26%, with brighter sources exhibiting higher multiplicity. After applying quality cuts based on SED fitting reliability, our final sample comprises 221 SMGs associated with 186 SCUBA-2 sources. The SSA22 SMGs have a median infrared luminosity of (2.25$\pm$0.25) $\times$10$^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$, with $\sim$ 63% ($\sim$ 8%) of the sample classified as ULIRGs (HLIRGs). The median redshift of the sample is $z = 2.00 \pm 0.08$, while optically faint galaxies exhibit higher median redshift ($\sim 2.20 \pm 0.17$). The comoving volume density of SMGs increases by a factor of $\sim 6$ at $z \lesssim 4$, plateauing at $\sim$ 1.78-3.16 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cMpc$^{-3}$ over $z \sim$ 1-3 (including the overdensity). The significant overdensity of SMGs within large-scale structures demonstrates their reliability as tracers of cosmic structure formation at high redshift. The median stellar mass and SFR of our SMG sample are $(1.55 \pm 0.22) \times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ and $166 \pm 25$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. We observe a clear “downsizing&quot; signature: after cosmic noon ($z \lesssim 2$), massive SMGs exhaust their gas reservoirs and transition to quiescence, while lower-mass SMGs continue forming stars and dominate the cosmic SFR density. The sample has a median dust mass of (1.95 $\pm$ 0.14) $\times$ 10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$. The dust fraction ($ M_{\text{dust}}/M_{\text{star}}$) has a median value of (1.4 $\pm$ 0.2) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$.

The JWST nuclear spectra reveal 134 emission lines, including H \textsc{i}, He, numerous fine-structure lines, H$_2$ rotational/ro-vibrational transitions, and several PAH bands. Modelling of the H$_2$ rotational lines reveals three warm/hot molecular components ($T\!\approx\!580$, 1480, and 2900 K), along with a cold ($&lt;50$ K) phase traced by ALMA CO(2–1). Outflow signatures are detected in cold and warm/hot molecular gas, in H \textsc{i}, and in 36 fine-structure lines spanning ionisation potentials of 7.6–300 eV. Ionised outflow velocities range from 127 to 716 km s$^{-1}$, with blueshifted and redshifted components consistent with a stratified biconical geometry. The cold molecular gas shows a mass outflow rate nearly 1–2 orders of magnitude larger than that of the warm/hot molecular and ionised phases. The kinetic coupling efficiency is 0.003–0.12\% for the coronal-line gas and 0.4–1.4\% for the H \textsc{i} outflow, indicating that only the low-ionisation gas significantly impacts the surrounding ISM. Outflow velocity and the fraction of flux in the outflowing component increase with ionisation potential, implying that the most highly ionised gas originates closest to the AGN and is most efficiently accelerated.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effect of ultralight dark matter on compact binary mergers</a><span class="id">[2503.19660]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The growing catalogue of gravitational wave events enables a statistical analysis of compact binary mergers, typically quantified by the merger rate density.

In addition, current image-based methods are often validated on homogeneous datasets. The development and comparison of networks able generalize across different morphologies, ranging from galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients, and observational conditions, remain an open challenge. This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ). SHAP shows that the models correctly focus on the objects of interest with over 95% localization accuracy on high-quality images, validating the reliability of the predictions. These findings suggest that deep learning is a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for redshift estimation in large-scale surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measurement prospects for the pair-instability mass cutoff with gravitational waves</a><span class="id">[2602.11282]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pair-instability supernovae leave behind no compact remnants, resulting in a predicted gap in the distribution of stellar black-hole masses. Gravitational waves from binary black-hole mergers probe the relevant mass range and analyses of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog (GWTC-4) indicate a possible mass cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$. However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\gtrsim20\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\,\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\gtrsim125\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{b}$ at $90\%$ credibility by the end of O4. Relative uncertainties on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from gravitational-wave data alone can still be up to $100\%$. We also analyze GWTC-4 with the nonparametric PixelPop population model, finding that some mass features are more prominent than in parametric models but a sharp cutoff is not required. However, the parametric model passes a likelihood-based predictive test in GWTC-4 and the PixelPop results are consistent with those from our simulated catalogs where a cutoff is present. We use the simple focus of this study to emphasize that such tests are necessary to make astrophysical claims from gravitational-wave catalogs going forward.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An optical transient candidate of $\lesssim$ 2-second duration captured by wide-field video observations</a><span class="id">[2602.11600]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent time-domain surveys have revealed rapid transients that evolve on timescales of $\lesssim 10$ days, expanding the transient population into the short-duration regime. The transient search on even shorter timescales, particularly those lasting only seconds or less, remains a largely unexplored frontier. Very short-duration optical transients could serve as potential counterparts to millisecond-duration fast radio bursts (FRBs), providing clues to their origins. However, the optical search for transients on such short timescales has been limited primarily by instrumental constraints. Here we report the discovery of an optical transient candidate (TMG20200322) with a duration of $\lesssim 2$ s by wide-field video observations in the direction of the Earth's shadow. TMG20200322 was detected in just two consecutive images of 1-second exposure time, with its shape becoming elongated in the second frame. PSF shape variability analysis of field stars reveals that such an elongated PSF cannot be explained by atmospheric fluctuations. We investigate the potential origins of TMG20200322 in two scenarios: meteoroid impact flashes on near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and head-on meteors in the Earth's atmosphere. None of the scenarios provides a satisfactory explanation for this transient. We derive a sky-projected rate of the TMG20200322 event of $R_{\mathrm{trans}} = (3.4 \times 10^{-2})^{+0.13}_{-0.028}$ deg$^{-2}$ day$^{-1}$ and an upper limit on second-timescale transients with durations of $1~\mathrm{s} \leq \tau \lesssim 15~\mathrm{s}$ of $R_{\mathrm{trans}} \lesssim 0.10$ deg$^{-2}$ day$^{-1}$ for the non-detection case. We highlight that continuous monitoring observations in the direction of the Earth's shadow could be a key strategy to unveil a new population of optical transients on timescales of seconds or less.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design and characterization of W-band and D-band calibration sources for the AliCPT-1 experiment</a><span class="id">[2602.11620]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ali Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization Telescope (AliCPT-1) is the first Chinese cosmic microwave background experiment aiming to make sensitive polarization maps of the potential B-mode signal from inflationary gravitational waves.

We implement and compare three strategies for handling the infinite exterior in the finite-element method: (i) naive domain truncation; (ii) Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map on a truncated boundary; (iii) multipole expansion on a truncated boundary. While all these methods are known within the geophysical literature, we discuss their parallel implementations within modern open-source finite-element codes, focusing specifically on the widely-used MFEM package. We consider both calculating the gravitational potential for a static density structure and computing the linearised perturbation to the potential caused by a displacement field - a necessary step for coupling self-gravitation into planetary dynamics. In contrast to some earlier studies, we find that the domain truncation method can provide accurate solutions at an acceptable cost, with suitable coarsening of the mesh within the exterior domain. Nevertheless, the DtN and multipole methods provide superior accuracy at a lower cost within large-scale parallel geophysical simulations despite their need for non-local communication associated with spherical harmonic expansions. The DtN method, in particular, admits an efficient parallel implementation based on an MPI-communicator limited to processors that contain part of the mesh's outer boundary. A series of further illustrative calculations are provided to show the potential of the DtN and multipole methods within realistic geophysical modelling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing and Validation of the Updated Pixel-Based Non-Linearity Calibration File for WFC3/IR</a><span class="id">[2602.12110]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The WFC3\IR channel has an innate non-linear response to incident photons, which is corrected for in the calwf3 pipeline with the NLINFILE reference file.

Using a variety of image types, sources, and sample sequences, we test a new pixel-based linearity correction developed by Shenoy et al. (2025). In nearly all cases, the new correction improves the linearity at fluence levels higher than 50,000 e-, with improvements up to 7% for pixels with fluences approaching the saturation limit (80,000 e-) in the last ima reads. The pixel-based solution also significantly decreases the number of cosmic rays erroneously flagged (due to non-linearity correction errors) during ramp fitting in calwf3, leading to improved photometric accuracy in the calibrated flt data and higher signal-to-noise ratios, particularly in Quad 1 (upper-left detector quadrant).

Fractionation during atmospheric loss can preferentially remove lighter elements such as hydrogen, while retaining heavier species like oxygen. In this study, we investigate how and under what conditions hydrodynamic escape and chemical fractionation jointly shape the mass and composition of exoplanet atmospheres, especially for mixed H2 + H2O atmospheres. We develop BOREAS, a self-consistent mass loss model coupling a 1D Parker wind formulation with a mass-dependent fractionation scheme, which we apply across a range of planet masses, radii, equilibrium temperatures, and incident XUV fluxes, allowing us to track hydrogen and oxygen escape rates at different snapshots in time. We find that oxygen is efficiently retained over most of the parameter space. Significant oxygen loss occurs under high incident XUV fluxes, while at intermediate fluxes oxygen loss is largely confined to low-gravity planets. Where oxygen is retained, irradiation is too weak to drive significant escape of hydrogen and thus limiting atmospheric enrichment. By contrast, our model predicts that sub-Neptunes undergo substantial atmospheric enrichment over approx. 200 Myr when hydrogen escape is efficient and accompanied by partial oxygen entrainment. Notably, our results imply that sub-Neptunes near the radius valley can evolve into water-rich planets, in agreement with GJ 9827 d. Present-day water-rich atmospheres may have originated from water-poor envelopes under some conditions, highlighting the need to include chemical fractionation in evolution models.

The core computations are implemented using the high-performance parallel programming framework \texttt{taichi-lang} which enables automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration across different architectures. We also reimplement the waveform models \texttt{PhenomXAS} and \texttt{PhenomXHM} in the separate package \texttt{tiwave} to integrate waveform generation within the \texttt{taichi-lang} scope, making the entire computation accelerated and differentiable. To demonstrate the functionality of the tool, we use a typical signal from a massive black hole binary to perform the full Bayesian parameter estimation with the complete likelihood function for three scenarios: including a single detector using the waveform with only the dominant mode; a single detector using the waveform including higher modes; and a detector network with higher modes included. The results demonstrate that higher modes are essential in breaking degeneracies, and coincident observations by the detector network can significantly improve the measurement of source properties. Additionally, automatic differentiation provides an accurate way to obtain the Fisher matrix without manual fine-tuning of the finite difference step size. Using a subset of extrinsic parameters, we show that the approximated posteriors obtained by the Fisher matrix agree well with those derived from Bayesian parameter estimation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09753" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The democratic detrender: Ensemble-Based Removal of the Nuisance Signal in Stellar Time-Series Photometry</a><span class="id">[2411.09753]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurate, precise, and computationally efficient removal of unwanted activity that exists as a combination of periodic, quasi-periodic, and non-periodic systematic trends in time-series photometric data is a critical step in exoplanet transit analysis. Throughout the years, many different modeling methods have been used for this process, often called &quot;detrending.&quot; However, there is no community-wide consensus regarding the favored approach. In order to mitigate model dependency, we present an ensemble-based approach to detrending via community-of-models and the democratic detrender: a modular and scalable open-source coding package that implements ensemble detrending. The democratic detrender allows users to select from a number of packaged detrending methods (including cosine filtering, Gaussian processes, and polynomial fits) or provide their own set of detrended light curves via methods of their choosing. It then combines the individually detrended light curves into a single method marginalized light curve. Additionally, the democratic detrender inflates each data point's uncertainty based on the scatter between detrenders, thereby propagating model-selection uncertainty into the final light curve. This ensemble strategy does not guarantee improvement over the single best-performing detrending method, but it substantially reduces the risk of selecting a detrending solution that is poorly calibrated or overfit to noise.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22092" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Charge Transfer Inefficiency on transit light-curves: A correction strategy for PLATO</a><span class="id">[2510.22092]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>PLATO is designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets around solar-type stars and to measure their radii with accuracy better than \(2\%\) via the transit method. Charge transfer inefficiency (CTI), a by-product of radiation damage to CCDs, can jeopardise this accuracy and therefore must be corrected. We assessed and quantified the impact of CTI on transit-depth measurements and developed a correction strategy that restores CTI-biased depths within the accuracy budget. Using a calibration dataset generated with PLATOSim to simulate a realistic stellar field, we modelled the parallel overscan signal as a sum of exponential decays and used least-squares fitting to infer the number of trap species and initial estimates for the release times (\(\tau_{r,k}\)). Smearing was modelled with an exponential-plus-constant function and removed on a column-wise basis. We modelled the spatial variation in trap density with a quadratic polynomial in radial distance from the focal-plane center. The polynomial coefficients (\(a_{p,k}\)), the well-fill power index (\(\beta\)), and the release times (\(\tau_{r,k}\)) were adjusted via an iterative application of the extended pixel edge response (EPER) method combined with a CTI correction algorithm, yielding the final calibration model. In the worst-case scenario (8-year mission, high-CTI zone), CTI induced a bias of about \(4\%\) in measured transit depth, reduced to a residual of \(0.06\%\) after correction - well within PLATO's accuracy requirements. From the calibrated parameters, we derived a correction scheme that brought the photometric measurements within PLATO's noise budget, ensuring that the mission's precision requirements are met.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09716" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulated Operational Testing of the Prototype Implementation of the SOFIE Model: The 2025 Space Weather Prediction Testbed Exercise</a><span class="id">[2511.09716]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The CLEAR Space Weather Center of Excellence's solar energetic particle (SEP) model, SOlar wind with FIeld lines and Energetic particles (SOFIE), was run and evaluated on-site during the Space Weather Prediction Testbed (SWPT) exercise at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center (NOAA/SWPC) in May 2025. As a physics-based SEP model, SOFIE simulates the acceleration and transport of energetic particles by the coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock in the solar corona and inner heliosphere, and has been validated against historical events. However, questions remain regarding whether a physics-based model, traditionally considered computationally expensive, could meet operational needs. The SWPT exercise offered a valuable opportunity to evaluate SOFIE under simulated operational conditions. On-site interactive feedback from SWPC forecasters, Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG) console operators, Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) personnel, and Moon-to-Mars Space Weather Analysis Office (M2M SWAO) analysts led to significant strategic improvements in the model configuration. The simulation grid was optimized by combining a coarser background grid with higher-resolution regions along the CME path and toward Earth, reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy. In this work, we present the simulated operational performance of SOFIE and its capability to predict SEP fluxes significantly faster than real time. During the SWPT exercise, SOFIE completed a 4-day SEP simulation within 5 hours using 1,000 central processing unit cores, although the earliest SEP forecast was obtained a few hours after CME onset. This marks a milestone in demonstrating SOFIE's operational usefulness and robustness to support future human space exploration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Astrometric Resoeccentric Degeneracy: Eccentric Single Planets Mimic 2:1 Resonant Planet Pairs in Astrometry</a><span class="id">[2512.02007]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detections of long-period giant exoplanets will expand dramatically with Gaia Data Release 4 (DR4), but interpreting these signals will require care. We derive the astrometric resoeccentric degeneracy: an astrometric analogue of the well-known radial velocity degeneracy in which a single eccentric planet can mimic two circular planets near a 2:1 period ratio. To first order in eccentricity, the sky-projected motion of a single eccentric orbit decomposes into a fundamental mode and first harmonic with an amplitude proportional to that eccentricity. A pair of coplanar, circular planets in a 2:1 orbital resonance produces the same harmonic structure: the outer planet sets the fundamental mode, while the inner planet supplies an apparent first harmonic. We present a mapping between the harmonic amplitudes and effective eccentricity ($e_\mathrm{eff}$) of a single planet that mimics a 2:1 configuration, demonstrating that $e_\mathrm{eff} = \, 2^{1/3}(M_{p,2}/M_{p,1})$, the masses of the inner and outer planets, respectively. Using simulated Gaia data we show that (1) coplanar 2:1 systems are statistically indistinguishable from a single eccentric planet and (2) mutual inclination can break this degeneracy. This bias favors detecting mutually inclined systems, often fingerprints of a dynamically hot history – traces for processes such as planet-planet scattering or secular chaos. Determining the planetary architectures in which this degeneracy holds will be essential for measuring cool-giant occurrence rates with Gaia and for inferring their dynamical evolution histories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16204" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fastest or Significant: A Systematic Framework for Validating Global Minimum Variability Timescale Measurements of Gamma-ray Bursts</a><span class="id">[2512.16204]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The minimum variability timescale (MVT) is a key observable used to probe the central engines of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) by constraining the emission region size and the outflow Lorentz factor. However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi–component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved. We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Efficient reduction of stellar contamination and noise in planetary transmission spectra using neural networks</a><span class="id">[2602.10330]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: JWST has enabled transmission spectroscopy at unprecedented precision, but stellar heterogeneities (spots and faculae) remain a dominant contamination source that can bias atmospheric retrievals if uncorrected. Aims: We present a fast, unsupervised methodology to reduce stellar contamination and instrument-specific noise in exoplanet transmission spectra using denoising autoencoders, improving the reliability of retrieved atmospheric parameters. Methods: We design and train denoising autoencoder architectures on large synthetic datasets of terrestrial (TRAPPIST-1e analogues) and sub-Neptune (K2-18b analogues) planets. Reconstruction quality is evaluated with the $\chi^2$ statistic over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, and atmospheric retrieval experiments on contaminated spectra are used to compare against standard correction approaches in accuracy and computational cost. Results: The autoencoders reconstruct uncontaminated spectra while preserving key molecular features, even at low S/N. In retrieval tests, pre-processing with denoising autoencoders reduces bias in inferred abundances relative to uncorrected baselines and matches the accuracy of simultaneous stellar-contamination fitting while reducing computational time by a factor of three to six. Conclusions: Denoising autoencoders provide an efficient alternative to conventional correction strategies and are promising components of future atmospheric characterization pipelines for both rocky and gaseous exoplanets.</p></div></details></article></body>
