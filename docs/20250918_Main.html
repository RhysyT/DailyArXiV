We quantify their impact on the recovery of mass density profile parameters using 967 clusters from the highest-resolution FLAMINGO simulation. We construct mock weak lensing maps, including both single source plane mocks and Euclid-like mocks with a realistic source redshift distribution. Applying Bayesian inference with Nautilus, we fit spherical and elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White models to recover the cluster mass, concentration, axis ratio, and centre, which we use to measure the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) offset from the potential centre, or `BCG wobble'. We find that the spherical model fits clusters along under-dense sight-lines better than those along over-dense ones. This introduces a positive skew in the relative error distributions for mass and concentration, which increases with source redshift. In Euclid-like mocks, this results in a mean mass bias of $+5.3\pm1.4$% (significant at $3.5\sigma$) when assuming a spherical NFW model. We also detect a mean axis ratio bias of $-2.0\pm0.7$% ($2.9\sigma$), with no significant bias in concentration. We measure a BCG wobble of  14 kpc in our Euclid-like mocks, with negligible contribution from line-of-sight structure. Furthermore, we predict the scatter in mass estimates from future weak lensing surveys that have mean source redshifts $z_\text s \gtrsim 1.2$ (such as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope), will be dominated by line-of-sight structure and hence assuming a diagonal covariance matrix will lead to overestimating the precision. We conclude that cluster weak lensing pipelines should be calibrated on simulations with lightcone data in order to properly account for the significant impact of line-of-sight structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial black holes in Randall-Sundrum: Cosmological signatures</a><span class="id">[2509.13409]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We reconsider primordial black hole physics in Randall-Sundrum Type-II universes, focusing on constraints from cosmological and astrophysical observables. We pay particular attention to scenarios that allow the entirety of dark matter to be in the form of higher-dimensional primordial black holes. This is possible for a range of AdS radii and black hole masses. Observable constraints are generally modified due to the changes in the higher-dimensional gravitational sector, and come from low-energy $e^{\pm}$ emission, microlensing, and possibly from contributions to unresolved radiation backgrounds. We discuss constraints from the cosmic microwave background due to injection of Hawking quanta into the intergalactic medium. Finally, we comment on recent discussions on the compatibility of higher-dimensional black holes and the KM3-230213A event.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red giant asteroseismic binaries in the Kepler field</a><span class="id">[2509.13412]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Systems in which two oscillating stars are observed in the same light curve, so-called asteroseismic binaries (ABs), arise from either chance alignments or gravitationally bound stars. In the latter case, ABs offer a novel way to find binary systems and combine asteroseismology and orbital dynamics to determine precise stellar parameters for both stars. Such systems provide valuable tests to stellar models and scaling relations. While population synthesis studies predict approximately 200 ABs in the Kepler long-cadence data, only a few have been detected to date. In this work, we aim to (1) expand the sample of ABs in Kepler data, (2) estimate global asteroseismic parameters for both stars in each AB, and (3) assess whether these pairs are gravitationally bound. We analysed 40 well-resolved ABs identified in Kepler long-cadence data, and matched these solar-like oscillators with Gaia DR3 sources using spectroscopic estimates of $\nu_{\rm max}$. To assess whether each pair is gravitationally bound, we checked their projected separation and parallax consistency, and compared observed total orbital velocity differences from astrometry with theoretical predictions from Keplerian orbits. We find that most ABs appear to be chance alignments. However, two systems, KIC 6501237 and KIC 10094545, show orbital velocities, seismic masses, and evolutionary stages consistent with a wide binary configuration, with probabilities of  50% and  25%, respectively. Furthermore, eleven ABs are likely spatially unresolved binaries based on Gaia multiplicity indicators. Our findings suggest that most seismically resolved ABs in the Kepler field are not gravitationally bound, in contrast to earlier population synthesis predictions. Remarkably, the two wide binary candidates identified here are promising benchmarks for asteroseismic calibration. Spectroscopic follow-up is necessary to confirm their binary nature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13413" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaia Barium Dwarfs and Their Ostensibly Ordinary Counterparts</a><span class="id">[2509.13413]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recently identified Gaia population of main-sequence–white dwarf (MS+WD) binaries at separations of ${\sim}\,1~{\rm AU}$, often with moderate eccentricities, is not readily reproduced by binary population synthesis models. Barium stars represent a closely related population whose enrichment in $s$-process elements both confirms the presence of a WD companion and attests to past binary interaction. It also indicates that mass transfer occurred at least during the late- and post-AGB phases of the WD progenitor, when $s$-process elements are dredged up. In this work, we further explore the connection between the astrometrically identified Gaia MS+WD binaries and the classical barium star population. To achieve this, we used high-resolution FEROS spectroscopy to measure abundances for 30 Gaia DR3 non-single-star binaries, identifying 10 as Ba-enriched. Together with our recent analysis of archival GALAH data, this yields a sample of 38 barium dwarfs with dynamically measured WD masses, compared to only 6 previously known systems with known WD masses at these separations. We find that, in cases where metallicity is sufficiently low to facilitate efficient $s$-process production, barium and yttrium enrichment is often detected. This enrichment is also identified in eccentric systems, suggesting that post-AGB mass transfer mechanisms are capable of pumping eccentricity into the orbit or occur without erasing it. Our results indicate that the Gaia MS+WD binaries trace the population from which barium stars emerge. Treating the large Gaia-discovered population as an extension of known $s$-process enriched dwarfs opens an avenue to empirically constrain their formation and evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13419" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin of Pulsed Radio Emission from Magnetars</a><span class="id">[2509.13419]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extended periods of radio pulsations have been observed for six magnetars, displaying characteristics different from those of ordinary pulsars. In this Letter, we argue that radio emission is generated in a closed, twisted magnetic flux bundle originating near the magnetic pole and extending beyond 100 km from the magnetar. The electron-positron flow in the twisted bundle has to carry electric current and, at the same time, experiences a strong drag by the radiation field of the magnetar. This combination forces the plasma into a “radiatively locked” state with a sustained two-stream instability, generating radio emission. We demonstrate this mechanism using novel first-principles simulations that follow the plasma behavior by solving the relativistic Vlasov equation with the discontinuous Galerkin method. First, using one-dimensional simulations, we demonstrate how radiative drag induces the two-stream instability, sustaining turbulent electric fields. When extended to two dimensions, the system produces electromagnetic waves, including superluminal modes capable of escaping the magnetosphere. We measure their frequency and emitted power, and incorporate the local simulation results into a global magnetospheric model. The model explains key features of observed radio emission from magnetars: its appearance after an X-ray outburst, wide pulse profiles, luminosities $\sim 10^{30}{\rm{erg/s}}$, and a broad range of frequencies extending up to $\sim 100\, \mathrm{GHz}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of an icy and nitrogen-rich extrasolar planetesimal</a><span class="id">[2509.13422]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>White dwarfs accreting planetary debris provide detailed insight into the bulk composition of rocky exo-planetesimals. However, only one Kuiper-Belt analogue has been identified in that way so far. Here, we report the accretion of an icy extra-solar planetesimal onto white dwarf WD 1647+375 using ultraviolet spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope. The accreted material is rich in the volatiles carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur, with a chemical composition analogous to Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs) in our solar system. It has a high nitrogen mass fraction ($5.1\pm1.6$ per cent) and large oxygen excess ($84\pm7$ per cent), indicating that the accreted planetesimal is water-rich (a water-to-rock ratio of $\simeq2.45$), corroborating a cometary- or dwarf planet-like composition. The white dwarf has been accreting at a rate of $\approx 2\times10^{8}$ g s$^{-1}$ for the past 13 years, implying a minimum mass of $\sim10^{17}$ g for the icy parent body. The actual mass could be several orders of magnitude larger if the accretion phase lasts $\sim10^5$ yr as estimated in the literature from debris disc studies. We argue that the accreted body is most likely a fragment of a KBO dwarf planet based on its nitrogen-rich composition. However, based on the chemical composition alone, it is difficult to discern whether this icy body is intrinsic to this planetary system, or may have an interstellar origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13461" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First High-Resolution Observations of Chromospheric Swirls with the Dunn Solar Telescope</a><span class="id">[2509.13461]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first observations of chromospheric swirls using the Hydrogen-alpha Rapid Dynamics camera and Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere imaging instruments at the Dunn Solar Telescope. These vortices contribute to heating and dynamics across the solar atmosphere. We analyze the morphology and evolution of 34 swirls and their cospatial bright points (BPs) from the photosphere to the mid-chromosphere. To examine swirl-BP interactions and temporal behavior, we use image segmentation, Fourier and spectral analysis, and local correlation tracking. The observed swirls have an average lifetime of 7.9$\pm$5 min and diameter of 3.6$\pm$1 Mm, with a positive correlation indicating smaller swirls tend to be short-lived. 76$\%$ are associated with a compact BP appearing 12 s to 9 min after swirl formation. Swirl motion is also closely linked to their BP(s) global motions. The swirls exhibit a mean angular speed of 0.04 rad s$^{-1}$, radial speed of 17.7 km s$^{-1}$, and period of 180 s. We observe the formation of a spiral-shaped swirl driven by a BP interacting with a large photospheric vortex. The BP is dragged toward the vortex centre, after which the swirl forms. The BP undergoes changes in orientation and elongation that mirror the swirl's chromospheric development. A time lag of -42.5 s between the sudden change in the BP's orientation and the peak of the swirl's intensity variation suggests torsional Alfven waves may contribute to swirl evolution. Our results support a magnetic origin for swirls rooted in motions of photospheric BPs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using Neural Emulators and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to constrain the Epoch of Reionization's History with the Ly$α$ Forest Power Spectrum</a><span class="id">[2509.13498]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) forest at $z \sim 5$ offers a primary probe to constrain the history of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), retaining thermal and ionization signatures imprinted by the reionization process. In this work, we present a new inference framework based on JAX that combines forward-modeled Ly$\alpha$ forest observables with differentiable neural emulators and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). We construct a dataset of 501 low-resolution simulations generated with user-defined reionization histories and compute a set of 1D Ly$\alpha$ power spectra and model-dependent covariance matrices. We then train two independent neural emulators that achieve sub-percent errors across relevant scales and combine them with HMC to efficiently perform parameter estimation. We validate this framework by applying it to a suite of mock observations, demonstrating that the true parameters are reliably recovered. While this work is limited by the low resolution of the simulations used, our results highlight the potential of this method for inferring the reionization history from high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forest measurements. Future improvements in our reionization models will further enhance its ability to extract constraints from observational datasets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterizing the Time Variability of 2M1207 A+b with JWST NIRSpec/PRISM</a><span class="id">[2509.13544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present JWST NIRSpec/PRISM IFU time-resolved observations of 2M1207 A and b (TWA 27), a $\sim 10$ Myr binary system consisting of a $\sim 2500$ K sub-stellar primary hosting a $\sim 1300$ K companion. Our data provide 20 time-resolved spectra over an observation spanning 12.56 hours. We provide an empirical characterization for the spectra of both objects across time. For 2M1207 A, non-linear trend models are statistically favored within the ranges 0.6-2.3 $\mu$m and 3.8-5.3 $\mu$m. However, most of the periods constrained from sinusoidal models exceed the observing window, setting a lower limit of 12.56 hours. We find the data at H$\alpha$ and beyond 4.35 $\mu$m show a moderate time correlation, as well as a pair of light curves at 0.73-0.80 $\mu$m and 3.36-3.38 $\mu$m. For 2M1207 b, light curves integrated across 0.86-1.77 $\mu$m and 3.29-4.34 $\mu$m support linear trend models. Following the interpretation of Zhang et. al. (2025), we model the 2M1207 b data with two 1D atmospheric components, both with silicate and iron condensates. The model of time variability as changes to the cloud filling factor shows broad consistency with the variability amplitudes derived from our data. Our amplitudes, however, disagree with the models at $\approx$0.86-1 $\mu$m. While an additional model component such as rainout chemistry may be considered here, our analysis is limited by a low signal-to-noise ratio. Our results demonstrate the capability of JWST to simultaneously monitor the spectral variability of a planetary-mass companion and host at low contrast.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13549" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanishing Refractories: Tracing Dust Evolution in the BP Tau Protoplanetary Disk</a><span class="id">[2509.13549]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the dust of BP Tau's protoplanetary disk. We use new optical spectra of BP Tau, taken with the Magellan/MIKE spectrograph in tandem with archival UV and mid-infrared observations. We use the magnetospheric accretion model to analyze the Ca II K and Mg II 2796.4 Å emission lines and derive the abundance of Ca and Mg in the accretion flows as a proxy for the refractory abundance in the innermost gas disk. Furthermore, we used irradiated accretion disk models to compare the spectral energy distribution (SED) to observations and model in detail the 10$\mu$m and 20$\mu$m silicate features to obtain the spatial distribution and stoichiometry of the dust in which the refractories are locked in the disk. We find a significant degree of depletion of refractory material in the innermost gas disk with median abundances of $\rm [Ca/H] = -2.0^{+0.1}_{-0.0}$ and $\rm [Mg/H] = -1.30^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ and attribute this to both radial drift and dust trapping due to a pressure bump/gap. Our SED modeling recovers the inner cavity that extends up to 8 AU, consistent with sub-mm observations. We found a significant decrease of the Mg-to-Fe ratio with decreasing radius, with Mg-rich silicates in the outer wall and Fayalite in the inner wall, consistent with the Mg depletion inferred from the emission lines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13571" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SuNeRF-CME: Physics-Informed Neural Radiance Fields for Tomographic Reconstruction of Coronal Mass Ejections</a><span class="id">[2509.13571]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronagraphic observations enable direct monitoring of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) through scattered light from free electrons, but determining the 3D plasma distribution from 2D imaging data is challenging due to the optically-thin plasma and the complex image formation processes. We introduce SuNeRF-CME, a framework for 3D tomographic reconstructions of the heliosphere using multi-viewpoint coronagraphic observations. The method leverages Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to estimate the electron density in the heliosphere through a ray-tracing approach, while accounting for the underlying Thomson scattering of image formation. The model is optimized by iteratively fitting the time-dependent observational data. In addition, we apply physical constraints in terms of continuity, propagation direction, and speed of the heliospheric plasma to overcome limitations imposed by the sparse number of viewpoints. We utilize synthetic observations of a CME simulation to fully quantify the model's performance for different viewpoint configurations. The results demonstrate that our method can reliably estimate the CME parameters from only two viewpoints, with a mean velocity error of $3.01\pm1.94\%$ and propagation direction errors of $3.39\pm1.94^\circ$ in latitude and $1.76\pm0.79^\circ$ in longitude. We further show that our approach can achieve a full 3D reconstruction of the simulated CME from two viewpoints, where we correctly model the three-part structure, deformed CME front, and internal plasma variations. Additional viewpoints can be seamlessly integrated, directly enhancing the reconstruction of the plasma distribution in the heliosphere. This study underscores the value of physics-informed methods for reconstructing the heliospheric plasma distribution, paving the way for unraveling the dynamic 3D structure of CMEs and enabling advanced space weather monitoring.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direct Imaging Explorations for Companions from the Subaru/IRD Strategic Program II; Discovery of a Brown-dwarf Companion around a Nearby mid-M dwarf LSPM J1446+4633</a><span class="id">[2509.13587]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of a new directly-imaged brown dwarf companion with Keck/NIRC2+pyWFS around a nearby mid-type M dwarf LSPM J1446+4633 (hereafter J1446). The $L'$-band contrast ($4.5\times10^{-3}$) is consistent with a $\sim20-60\ M_{\rm Jup}$ object at 1–10 Gyr and our two-epoch NIRC2 data suggest a $\sim30\%$ ($\sim3.1\sigma)$ variability in its $L'$-band flux. We incorporated Gaia DR3 non-single-star catalog into the orbital fitting by combining the Subaru/IRD RV monitoring results, NIRC2 direct imaging results, and Gaia proper motion acceleration. As a result, we derive ${59.8}_{-1.4}^{+1.5}\ M_{\rm Jup}$ and $\approx4.3~{\rm au}$ for the dynamical mass and the semi-major axis of the companion J1446B, respectively. J1446B is one of the intriguing late-T dwarfs showing variability at $L'$-band for future atmospheric studies with the constrained dynamical mass. Because the J1446 system is accessible with various observation techniques such as astrometry, direct imaging, and high-resolution spectroscopy including radial velocity measurement, it has a potential as a great benchmark system to improve our understanding for cool dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESI DR1 Ly$α$ 1D power spectrum: Validation of estimators</a><span class="id">[2509.13593]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is the largest sample to date for small-scale Ly$\alpha$ forest cosmology, accessed through its one-dimensional power spectrum ($P_{\mathrm{1D}}$). The Ly$\alpha$ forest $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ is extracted from quasar spectra that are highly inhomogeneous (both in wavelength and between quasars) in noise properties due to intrinsic properties of the quasar, atmospheric and astrophysical contamination, and also sensitive to low-level details of the spectral extraction pipeline. We employ two estimators in DR1 analysis to measure $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$: the optimal estimator and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) estimator. To ensure robustness of our DR1 measurements, we validate these two power spectrum and covariance matrix estimation methodologies against the challenging aspects of the data. First, using a set of 20 synthetic 1D realizations of DR1, we derive the masking bias corrections needed for the FFT estimator and the continuum fitting bias needed for both estimators. We demonstrate that both estimators, including their covariances, are unbiased with these corrections using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Second, we substantially extend our previous suite of CCD image simulations to include 675,000 quasars, allowing us to accurately quantify the pipeline's performance. This set of simulations reveals biases at the highest $k$ values, corresponding to a resolution error of a few percent. We base the resolution systematics error budget of DR1 $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ on these values, but do not derive corrections from them since the simulation fidelity is insufficient for precise corrections.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of rotational mixing in intermediate-age star clusters with extended main-sequence turn-offs and extended red clumps</a><span class="id">[2509.13601]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The extended main-sequence turn-offs (eMSTOs) and extended red clumps (eRCs) observed in intermediate-age star clusters challenge the traditional understanding of clusters as simple stellar populations. Recently, eMSTOs have been interpreted as signatures of stellar rotation. In this work, we test the effectiveness of rotational mixing in shaping the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of star clusters. We computed a set of separate single-age synthetic stellar populations, referred to as &quot;Base Stellar Populations&quot; (BSPs), including stellar rotation. These BSPs were generated from two grids of stellar models that share the same input physics but differ in the efficiency of rotational mixing. We used an optimization algorithm to determine the best combination of BSPs to fit the CMDs of two star clusters: the Small Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 419 and the Milky Way cluster NGC 1817. The synthetic clusters with weak rotational mixing provide the best fit to both the eMSTO and eRC features for both clusters, and are consistent with the luminosities and asteroseismic masses we derived for eRC stars in NGC 1817. In contrast, synthetic clusters with strong rotational mixing result in overly bright post-main-sequence stars, inconsistent with observations. This suggests that, for intermediate-mass stars, the influence of rotational mixing of chemical elements on stellar evolution cannot be so strong as to significantly increase the post-main-sequence luminosity. A simple test suggests that accounting for self-extinction by decretion discs in equator-on fast rotators could influence inferred rotation distributions and help reconcile the projected rotational velocity discrepancy across the eMSTO between models and observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Volatile-bearing mineral atmospheres of hot rocky exoplanets as probes of interior state and composition</a><span class="id">[2509.13610]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The atmospheres of hot rocky exoplanets (HREs), should they persist, are products of interactions with underlying magma oceans. Spectra collected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) hint at a CO/CO$_2$-rich atmosphere on the HRE 55 Cancri e, indicative of such a process. Here, we aim to identify diagnostic features that can be used to infer the composition and geochemical state of HREs. We construct a coupled atmosphere-interior model that computes the equilibrium gas speciation in the atmosphere in the system Si-Mg-Fe-O-C-H-S-N-He. The model accounts for both the equilibrium vaporisation of mineral gases and the partitioning of volatile species between the magma ocean and atmosphere. Using a fiducial planet with the properties of 55 Cancri e, we explore a parameter space that spans volatile mass fractions from 0.1 to 10 times that of the Earth, solar- to Earth-like metallicities, and 12 orders of magnitude in oxygen fugacity fO$_2$. We find fO$_2$ to be the major control of the shape of emission and transmission features. The presence of species such as SO$_2$ and the relative intensities of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ features allow to distinguish the origin of the gas, accreted or outgassed, while the atmospheric mass is more challenging to constrain. Inflated HREs, whose densities are compatible with a nebular atmosphere are rare, but a viable explanation for the planet TOI-1408 c. The majority of HREs, including 55 Cancri e, are too dense to be dominated by H$_2$-rich nebular gas yet too puffy for an Earth-like volatile budget, implying modest atmospheres of mixed heritage that are degenerate in fO$_2$, volatile mass and composition. The MIRI observation of 55 Cancri e disfavours oxidised Earth-like and reduced primoridal atmospheres alike, while the NIRCam data remain inconclusive. Future observations at wavelengths beyond 8 $\mu$m are key to discerning between potential scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Birefringence from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6</a><span class="id">[2509.13654]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The polarized light of the cosmic microwave background is sensitive to new physics that violates parity symmetry. For example, the interaction of photons with the fields of elusive dark matter and dark energy could cause a uniform rotation of the plane of linear polarization across the sky, an effect known as cosmic birefringence. We extract the cosmological rotation angle, $\beta$, using Bayesian analysis of parity-violating correlations, $EB$ and $TB$, of polarization data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6. We use prior probabilities for instrumental miscalibration angles derived from the optics model for the ACT telescope and instruments, and marginalize over a residual intensity-to-polarization leakage.

Semi-numerical models of reionization are often coupled with the collapse fraction field $f_{\text{coll}}(\mathbf{x})$, which determines the fraction of dark matter within halos. In this work, we improve upon earlier prescriptions that compute $f_{\text{coll}}$ based on the dark matter overdensity $\delta(\mathbf{x})$ alone, to include more information about the environment in the form of eigenvalues of the tidal tensor. We compute the mean of the $f_{\text{coll}}$ conditioned on these eigenvalues from a set of high-resolution, small-volume simulations and use them to sample the $f_{\text{coll}}$ field of a low-resolution, large-volume simulation. We subsequently use a semi-numerical code for reionization to compute the HI density field and its power spectrum, and benchmark our results against a reference high-resolution, large-volume simulation. Across variations in redshift, ionized fraction, grid resolution, and minimum halo mass, our method recovers the large-scale HI power spectrum with errors at the $\lesssim 2\%-5\%$ level for $k \lesssim 0.5~ h~ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, providing a substantial improvement over the $\sim 10\%$ results previously obtained using density-only conditioning. Overall, this makes our method a simple yet efficient tool for forward modeling HI maps during reionization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polar Mounds on Strangeon Stars: the Neutrino Emission from Ultraluminous X-ray Pulsars</a><span class="id">[2509.13732]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) serve as unique astrophysical laboratories, offering critical insights into accretion physics under extreme conditions, such as strong magnetic fields and super-Eddington accretion rates. Additionally, the nature of pulsars, i.e., the equation of state of supranuclear matter, is still a matter of intense debate, basing on either conventional neutron stars or strange stars in the litterateurs. In this work, we investigate accretion columns of ULXPs based on the strangeon-star model, focusing on the thermal mound at the column base. Accounting for Coulomb and strangeness barriers of the strangeon stars, we find that the mound can reach $0.7-0.95\,\rm km$ in height with temperatures above $10^9\, \rm K$, enabling substantial neutrino emission via electron-positron annihilation. Heat transport along the strangeon star surface contributes a luminosity of $10^{36} \, \rm erg\, s^{-1} $, independent of the accretion rate. At low accretion rates ($&lt; 10^{20}\, \rm g\,s^{-1}$), photons dominate the luminosity, while at higher rates ($&gt; 10^{21}\, \rm g\, s^{-1}$), photon trapping makes neutrino emission the main cooling channel, with total luminosity exceeding photon emission, which saturates near $10^{41}\, \rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Estimating neutrino fluxes at Earth, we find that only the nearest ULXP, Swift J0243.6$+$6124, could produce a marginally detectable signal, while most extragalactic sources remain well below background levels. These results emphasize the key role of the thermal mound and strangeon star properties in determining accretion luminosities and neutrino emission, offering insights for future modeling and observations of ULXPs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13749" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The SPAr process: proton captures powering carbon-oxygen shell mergers in massive stars</a><span class="id">[2509.13749]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Carbon-oxygen (C-O) shell mergers in massive stars play a crucial role in both nucleosynthesis and the final stages of stellar evolution. These convective-reactive events significantly alter the internal structure of the star shortly before core collapse. We investigate how the enhanced production of light particles (especially protons) during a C-O shell merger, relative to classical oxygen shell burning, affects the energy balance and evolution of the convective shell. We derive the budget for direct and reverse nucleosynthesis flows across all relevant nuclear reactions from stellar evolution models, and we assess the relative energy produced. We find that proton capture reactions on 32,34S, 31P, and 38Ar (SPAr) dominate the nuclear energy production in typical C-O shell mergers as predicted by 1D stellar models. Their combined energy output is approximately 400 times greater than that of C and O fusion under the same conditions. Our results highlight the critical importance of including these proton-capture reactions in simulations of convective-reactive burning. Excluding their contribution can lead to inaccurate modeling of the dynamics and nucleosynthesis in advanced stellar evolutionary phases. Such results will need to be confirmed by 3D hydrodynamics models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13804" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An updated constraint on the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy</a><span class="id">[2509.13804]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE) provides a systematic and model-independent framework to study dark energy (DE) and modified gravity (MG) with one additional scalar degree of freedom.

In this work, we present a fully-implicit viscous-relaxation nonlinear force-free field (FIVR-NLFFF) extrapolation code based on a viscous magnetohydrodynamic relaxation model. The method solves the magnetic induction equation alongside a simplified momentum equation, which assumes a balance between the Lorentz force and the viscous force. Under this assumption, the velocity field driving the magnetic field evolution is determined instantaneously by the Lorentz force distribution. Through viscous dissipation, the system relaxes toward a minimum-energy state, consistent with the vector magnetogram prescribed at the lower boundary. To enhance numerical stability, we adopt a fully implicit time integration scheme and employ central finite differences for spatial discretization. The resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved using the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method, as implemented in the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc). We validate the code using three benchmark models: the Low and Lou force-free solution, the Titov-Démoulin magnetic flux rope model, and a strongly sheared arcade configuration containing a current sheet. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate good agreement with the reference solutions. Notably, the code's ability to handle discontinuities and reconstruct coronal current sheets makes it a promising tool for studying magnetic fields that may directly trigger solar eruptions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fermi-LAT Detected Gamma-ray Emission Likely Associated with SNR Kes 78</a><span class="id">[2509.13812]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have analyzed the GeV gamma-ray emission in the region of the supernova remnant (SNR) Kes 78 using $\sim$16.7 years of Fermi-LAT observations and found that the catalog sources 4FGL J1852.4+0037e and 4FGL J1851.8$-$0007c are better represented as two extended sources modeled as `2Ext'. One of them, designated as E2, is located at R.A.$=282.86^\circ$, Dec.$=-0.11^\circ$ with the 68\% containment radius $R_{68} = 0.31^\circ$, and is detected with a significance of 15.2$\sigma$ in the 0.2–500 GeV energy range. The gamma-ray emission of source E2 is well described by a log-parabola (LogP) spectral model with spectral index $\Gamma$ = 1.2 and curvature $\beta$ = 0.3. The fitting with electron-proton number ratio $K_{\rm ep}=0.01$ indicates that the GeV emission of source E2 is dominated by hadronic emission. Given the dense molecular environment surrounding the middle-aged SNR Kes 78, the hadronic scenario provides a natural explanation for the observed GeV emission. The extended source E2 can also be replaced with two point sources. One of them, designated as PTS1, is coincident with the newly discovered PSR J1852$-$0002g within the 68\% positional uncertainty circle, indicating a possible gamma-ray contribution from this PSR. The gamma-ray spectrum of source PTS1 can be well described by a LogP spectral shape. The synchro-curvature radiation model provides a satisfactory spectral fit for source PTS1, suggesting that some of the GeV emission from the Kes 78 region might possibly originate from the magnetosphere of PSR J1852$-$0002g.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The effect of matter discreteness on gravitational wave propagation in post-geometrical optics</a><span class="id">[2509.13884]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The gravitational wave equation of motion includes direct coupling to the Riemann tensor.

However, it is common practice to simulate coeval brightness temperature boxes, and then apply post-processing algorithms that treat the lightcone effect and redshift-space distortions separately, assuming they can be added in sequence. We instead model them together, allowing for partial coeval cell contributions, and ensuring that velocity-induced frequency shifts are computed at the correct cosmic time for every position along the line of sight. We show that considering these effects simultaneously creates a difference in the shape of the power spectrum over all Fourier scales, and remains recoverable after semi-blind foreground removal. We show that our lightcones consist of an average of 8% and maximum of 120% of a coeval cell length. These contributions to a 21cm brightness temperature lightcone voxel are shifted from within a +/- 0.5 MHz range of the emitted frequency. The boost in the power spectrum seen over small scales (k&gt;1.5 Mpc) of our robust 21 cm lightcone method compared to basic methods is recoverable after the addition and removal of diffuse radio foregrounds. The largest differences during the Epoch of Reionisation lie in the k-space, where the noise sensitivity for a 1000-hour SKAO-low observation is greater than the signal. However, in the cosmic dawn, we have shown that the major differences lie outside of this noise-dominated region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating aerosols as a reconciliation mechanism for K2-18 b JWST MIRI and NIRISS/NIRSpec observations</a><span class="id">[2509.13932]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent JWST observations of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b with NIRISS SOSS/NIRSpec G395H and MIRI LRS have yielded apparently inconsistent results: the MIRI spectra exhibit spectral features nearly twice as large as those seen at shorter wavelengths, challenging the high-metallicity, CH4-rich non-equilibrium model that fits the NIRISS/NIRSpec data. We perform a suite of atmospheric retrievals on both datasets, including free-chemistry, non-equilibrium, and aerosol models, using laboratory-derived complex refractive indices for a variety of photochemical haze analogues. Free retrievals systematically return lower metallicities than inferred by self-consistent chemical disequilibrium models, and the inclusion of absorbing aerosols, especially CH4-dominated, nitrogen-poor tholins, can further reduce the inferred metallicity by over an order of magnitude. These hazes reproduce the observed NIRISS slope through scattering and match MIRI features via C-H bending absorption near 7 um, while yielding particle properties consistent with photochemical production in H2-rich atmospheres. Although their inclusion improves the joint fit and reduces tension between datasets, it also significantly lowers the retrieved CH4 abundance, highlighting degeneracies between metallicity, composition, and aerosol properties. Our results underscore the importance of aerosol absorption in interpreting temperate sub-Neptune spectra, and motivate future JWST observations and laboratory work to break these degeneracies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extensive Analysis of gamma-Ray Periodicity in Jetted AGN from the 4FGL Catalog Using Fermi-LAT Observations</a><span class="id">[2509.14013]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The quest to uncover periodic patterns within the $\gamma$-ray emissions of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) has recently emerged as a focal point in astrophysics.

Only a low fraction of the magnetars (six in total) has been detected in the radio regime and most magnetars are radio quiet. We conducted regular observations of 13 radio quiet magnetars to probe the long term radio quietness using MeerKAT. These provide deep constraints on the radio emission of magnetars, relevant for the progenitor models of FRBs Given that MeerKAT is an interferometer, we probe the magnetars for radio emission in both imaging and time domain. We search in the time domain in a DM range of 20 pc/cm^3 to 10000 pc/cm^3 for single pulses using a TransientX based search pipeline (FRB perspective) as well as from a pulsar perspective by folding the data using the X-ray ephemeris. We use the imaging domain to search for radio emission in Stokes I and V as well as to create light curves using snapshot imaging having the long transient perspective as well. We find no radio emission in the time domain for any of the observed magnetars but provide deep limits of the mean flux density 60 uJy and the single pulse fluence of 39 mJy. From the image domain, we provide upper limits on the persistent radio radio emission and the light curve for the 13 magnetars. Additionally, an ULPT and an additional magnetar were observed in the images. We provide an extensive series of deep upper limits in the time domain but also as a novelty limits from the imaging domain for the magnetars.

In cases where both TTVs and radial velocity (RV) measurements are available, combined analysis can break degeneracies and provide robust planetary and system characterization, even detecting non-transiting planets. In this context, HIP 41378 hosts five confirmed transiting planets with periods ranging from 15 to over 542 days, providing a unique dynamical laboratory for investigating wide multi-planet systems analogous to the Solar System. In this study, we present an intensive space-based photometric follow-up of HIP 41378, combining 15 new CHEOPS observations with eight TESS sectors, alongside data from K2, Spitzer, HST, and HARPS. We dynamically modeled the TTVs and RV signals of the two inner sub-Neptunes via N-body integration. These planets, HIP 41378 b ($P_{b}$ = 15.57 days) and HIP 41378 c ($P_{c}$ = 31.71 days), are close to ($\Delta\sim1.8$ %) a 2:1 period commensurability.

Our simulation suite spans magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and standard and normal evolution (SANE) states across a range of black hole spins. By tracking tracer trajectories, we directly measure both advective inflow and stochastic spreading of fluid elements. The tracer distributions are well described by a combination of coherent inward drift and Gaussian-like broadening, consistent with an advection-diffusion picture. MADs exhibit systematically faster inflow than SANEs, with retrograde flows showing the most rapid infall; the innermost stable circular orbit leaves little imprint in MADs but remains more visible in SANEs. Turbulent fluctuations drive strong radial dispersion in all cases, with a superdiffusive scaling of sigma   t^0.95 in MADs and sigma   t^0.75 in SANEs for high-spin prograde disks. Mixing times decrease toward the event horizon and are consistently shorter in MADs and retrograde configurations. Tracers also reveal how accretion sources shift over time: turbulence draws inflow from a broad range of initial radii, with rapid torus depletion in MADs driving the mean source radius outward as r   t^(2/3), while SANEs evolve more gradually with r   t^(1/2). We show that the finite mass of the initial torus has a strong influence on late-time behavior, especially in MADs, where imprints of differently sized initial conditions may be accessible as early as t   10000 GM/c^3.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possible Evidence for the Presence of Volatiles on the Warm Super-Earth TOI-270 b</a><span class="id">[2509.14224]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The search for atmospheres on rocky exoplanets is a crucial step in understanding the processes driving atmosphere formation, retention, and loss. Past studies have revealed the existence of planets interior to the radius valley with densities lower than would be expected for pure-rock compositions, indicative of the presence of large volatile inventories which could facilitate atmosphere retention. Here we present an analysis of the JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the warm ($T_\mathrm{eq,{A_B}=0}$ = 569 K) super-Earth TOI-270 b ($R_\mathrm{p}$ = 1.306 $R_\oplus$), captured alongside the transit of TOI-270 d. The JWST white light-curve transit depth updates TOI-270 b's density to $\rho_\mathrm{p}$ = 3.7 $\pm$ 0.5 g/cm$^3$, inconsistent at 4.4$\sigma$ with an Earth-like composition. Instead, the planet is best explained by a non-zero, percent-level water mass fraction, possibly residing on the surface or stored within the interior. The JWST transmission spectrum shows possible spectroscopic evidence for the presence of this water as part of an atmosphere on TOI-270 b, favoring a H$_2$O-rich steam atmosphere model over a flat spectrum ($\ln\mathcal{B}$ = $0.3-3.2$, inconclusive to moderate), with the exact significance depending on whether an offset parameter between the NIRSpec detectors is included. We leverage the transit of the twice-larger TOI-270 d crossing the stellar disk almost simultaneously to rule out the alternative hypothesis that the transit-light-source effect could have caused the water feature in TOI-270 b's observed transmission spectrum. Planetary evolution modeling furthermore shows that TOI-270 b could sustain a significant atmosphere on Gyr timescales, despite its high stellar irradiation, if it formed with a large initial volatile inventory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximal GW amplitude from bubble collisions in supercooled phase transitions</a><span class="id">[2509.13402]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extend analytic formulas for the gravitational-wave (GW) spectrum from first-order phase transitions to include cosmic expansion under the thin-wall and envelope approximations.

On the other hand, cosmic-ray arrival directions at energies &gt;10^{18.9} eV exhibit a dipole anisotropy, which disfavors heavy composition, since higher-Z nuclei are strongly deflected by the Galactic magnetic field, suppressing anisotropy. This is the composition problem of UHECR. One solution could be the existence of yet-unknown effects in proton interactions at center-of-mass (CM) energies 50 TeV, which would alter the interaction cross section and the multiplicity of interaction products, mimicking heavy primaries. We study the impact of such changes on cosmic-ray observables using simulations of Extensive Air-Shower (EAS), in order to place constrains on the phenomenology of any new effects for high energy proton interactions that could be probed by \sqrt{s}&gt;50 TeV collisions. We simulate showers of primaries with energies in the range 10^{17} - 10^{20} eV using the CORSIKA code, modified to implement a possible increase in cross-section and multiplicity in hadronic collisions exceeding a CM energy threshold of 50 TeV. We study the composition-sensitive shower observables (shower depth, muons) as a function of cross-section, multiplicity, and primary energy. We find that in order to match the Auger shower depth measurements by means of new hadronic collision effects alone (if extragalactic UHECR are all protons even at the highest energies), the cross-section of proton-air interactions has to be 800 mb at 140 TeV CM energy, accompanied by an increase of a factor of 2-3 in secondary particles. We also study the muon production of the showers in the same scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signatures of anti-social mass-loss in the ordinary Type II SN 2024bch – A non-interacting supernova with early high-ionisation features</a><span class="id">[2409.15431]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper we analyse the spectro-photometric properties of the Type II supernova 2024bch, exploded in NGC 3206 at a distance of $19.9\,\rm{Mpc}$. Its early spectra are characterised by narrow high-ionisation emission lines, often interpreted as signatures of ongoing interaction between rapidly expanding ejecta and a confined dense circumstellar medium. However, we provide a model for the bolometric light curve of the transient that does not require sources of energy different than radioactive decays and H recombination. Our model can reproduce the bolometric light curve of SN 2024bch adopting an ejected mass of $M_{bulk}\simeq5\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ surrounded by an extended envelope of only $0.2\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ with an outer radius $R_{env}=7.0\times10^{13}\,\rm{cm}$. An accurate modelling focused on the radioactive part of the light curve, which accounts for incomplete $\gamma-$ray trapping, gives a $^{56}\rm{Ni}$ mass of $0.048\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$. We propose narrow lines to be powered by Bowen fluorescence induced by scattering of He II Ly$\alpha$ photons, resulting in the emission of high-ionisation resonance lines. Simple light travel time calculations based on the maximum phase of the narrow emission lines place the inner radius of the H-rich, un-shocked shell at a radius $\simeq4.4\times10^{15}\,\rm{cm}$, compatible with an absence of ejecta-CSM interaction during the first weeks of evolution. Possible signatures of interaction appear only $\sim69\,\rm{days}$ after explosion, although the resulting conversion of kinetic energy into radiation does not seem to contribute significantly to the total luminosity of the transient.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11753" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identification and modelling of optically thin inverse Compton scattering in the prompt emission of GRB131014A</a><span class="id">[2410.11753]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The mechanism responsible for the prompt gamma-ray emission of a gamma-ray burst continues to remain an enigma. The detailed analysis of the spectrum of GRB 131014A observed by the $Fermi$ gamma ray burst monitor and Large Area Telescope has revealed an unconventional spectral shape that significantly deviates from the typical Band function. The spectrum exhibits three distinctive breaks and an extended power law at higher energies. Furthermore, the lower end of the spectrum aligns with power-law indices greater than -0.5, and in the brightest region of the burst, these values approach +1. The lowest spectral break is thereby found to be consistent with a blackbody. These observed spectral characteristics strongly suggest the radiation process to be inverse Compton scattering in an optically thin region. Applying the empirical fit parameters for physical modeling, we find that the kinetic energy of the GRB jet of bulk Lorentz factor, $\Gamma \sim 400$, gets dissipated just above the photosphere, approximately at a radius of $\sim 10^{14}$ cm. The electrons involved in this process are accelerated to a power-law index of $\delta = -1.5$, and the minimum electron Lorentz factor, $\gamma_{min}$, is approximately $3$. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive identification and detailed modeling of optically thin inverse Compton scattering in the prompt emission of GRB 131014A.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07549" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond first light: Global monitoring for high-energy neutrino astronomy</a><span class="id">[2503.07549]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Decades of progress have culminated in first light for high-energy neutrino astronomy: the identification of the first astrophysical sources of TeV-PeV neutrinos by the IceCube neutrino telescope, the active galactic nuclei NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056. Today, the prospect of going beyond first light to build high-energy neutrino astronomy in earnest by discovering many more neutrino sources is hampered by the relatively low rate of neutrino detection and the limited view of the sky afforded by IceCube, the single cubic-kilometer-scale neutrino telescope in operation. Yet, this will not stand for much longer. Already today, and over the next 10-20 years, the combined observations of new neutrino telescopes, larger and distributed around the world, will have the potential for transformative progress. Together, they will increase the global rate of neutrino detection by up to 30 times and continuously monitor the entire sky. Within a new joint analysis network - the Planetary Neutrino Monitoring network (PLEnuM) - we make detailed forecasts for the discovery of steady-state astrophysical sources of high-energy neutrinos.

In this work, we constrain the reionisation history of the Universe using data from the cosmic microwave background, more specifically the latest Planck Public Release 4 (PR4) dataset. We investigate a wide range of reionisation models, from simple parametric descriptions to more flexible non-parametric approaches, systematically evaluating their impact on the inferred constraints. Special attention is given to implicit priors introduced by each model and their influence on the derived reionisation optical depth, $\tau$. To achieve this, we employ both Bayesian and frequentist methods to derive robust constraints. We obtain consistent estimates of $\tau$ across models, highlighting the robustness of the constraints on the integrated optical depth derived from the Planck PR4 data. Averaging across models, the posterior means and best-fit values, respectively, yield $\tau = 0.0576 \pm 0.0060$ and $\tau = 0.0581$, highlighting the presence of small volume effects. Based on our analysis, we estimate that an additional uncertainty, associated with the modelling of reionisation, contributes an error of approximately $\sigma_\tau\!\sim\!0.0006$. Beyond the integrated optical depth, our analysis reveals that the inferred ionisation fraction as a function of redshift is highly model-dependent. While current CMB data do not favour significant early ionisation, they are consistent with a modest contribution from ionised gas at very early times ($z&gt;15$). Although indicative upper bounds can be placed on such contributions, these limits remain strongly dependent on the assumed model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01298" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spinning masters: on the impact of tidal forces and protohalo size on early spin evolution</a><span class="id">[2505.01298]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we explore how the size and surrounding tidal fields of dark matter protohalos at high redshift influence their angular momentum (AM) evolution.

Moreover, although the assumptions of the TTT are assumed to hold during the linear and quasi-linear regime, cosmological simulations reveal that discrepancies between its predictions and the true AM of halos emerge earlier than expected. To address this, we analyze cosmological simulations to study tidal fields at z=80 using different smoothing lengths, and determine which best predicts AM under TTT. We then investigate discrepancies between predicted and actual AM across redshifts, considering the effect of evolving tidal and inertia tensors. Our results show that the early tidal field couples with the inertia tensor of protohalos on scales about half of their characteristic size and confirm that disagreements between theory and simulation emerge already at relatively early cosmic times (z 10-5), suggesting a systematic effect from protohalo shape interacting with the forming cosmic web.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19029" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Analysis Dependence of DESI Dynamical Dark Energy</a><span class="id">[2505.19029]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We continue scientific scrutiny of the DESI dynamical dark energy (DE) claim by explicitly demonstrating that the result depends on the analysis pipeline.

The models are constrained using a joint dataset comprising Pantheon+, Hubble parameter measurements, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), including the latest DESI DR2 release. To ensure efficient and accurate likelihood evaluations, we employ Bayesian inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) in \texttt{NumPyro}, supplemented with a machine learning (ML) emulator. Model selection is performed using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The results demonstrate excellent consistency between the MCMC and ML emulator approaches. Compared to the reference models, $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM, Model I yields the lowest $\chi^2$ and a negative $\Delta$AIC relative to $\Lambda$CDM, indicating a mild statistical preference for its richer late-time dynamics, though the BIC penalizes its additional parameter and prevents a decisive advantage. Conversely, Model II has a lower accuracy compared to both $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM according to AIC and BIC, leading to its disfavor. Notably, Model I also delivers $H_0=73.67\pm0.15$ (without the nuisance parameter $\mu_0$) in agreement with SH0ES, and $H_0=69.65\pm0.83$ (with $\mu_0$) as an intermediate value, thereby reconciling with local measurements while simultaneously providing a compromise between early and late universe determinations. This dual feature offers a promising pathway toward alleviating the Hubble tension. Overall, our analysis highlights the significance of non-canonical scalar field models as viable alternatives to $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM, which often provide improved fits to current observational data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10469" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the lensing dispersion from the angular clustering of binary black hole mergers</a><span class="id">[2506.10469]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries provide direct measurements of luminosity distances and serve as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe. In addition to their role as standard sirens, they offer an opportunity to constrain small-scale density fluctuations through the dispersion in the distance-redshift relation induced by gravitational lensing. We propose a method to constrain this lensing dispersion without requiring the redshift information by analyzing the angular clustering of gravitational wave sources. Our formalism incorporating second-order lensing effects in the luminosity distance shows that the amplitude of the auto-correlation angular clustering decreases with increasing lensing dispersion. While we show that the auto-correlation signal is detected with sufficient signal-to-noise ratios in future gravitational wave experiments, there exists a strong degeneracy between the lensing dispersion and the linear bias of gravitational wave sources. We demonstrate that this degeneracy is partially broken by a joint analysis of the auto-correlation of gravitational wave sources and the cross-correlation with galaxies whose redshifts are known. This approach enhances the use of gravitational waves as a cosmological probe at high redshifts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mid-Infrared Dust Evolution and Late-time Circumstellar Medium Interaction in SN 2017eaw</a><span class="id">[2507.00125]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present JWST/MIRI and complementary ground-based near-infrared observations of the Type II SN 2017eaw taken 6 years post-explosion.

As opposed to the $\sim10^5$ s$^{-1}$ values given by the monochromatic approximation, the actual growth rates of non-resonance multi-group hCFI are at most $\sim$200 s$^{-1}$ in all our models and they are too slow to affect CCSN outcomes. We adopt a BGK flavor conversion scheme in the simulations to include the effects of resonance-like hCFI. We find that the CCSN dynamics and neutrino emission properties are only weakly influenced, and the intrinsic stochasticity due to convection and neutrino-driven turbulence can naturally lead to comparable effects.

These pulsations provide a powerful means of inferring stellar properties, particularly ages, for pre-main-sequence and early main-sequence delta Scuti stars, for which traditional age-dating methods are poorly constrained. Realising this potential requires robust theoretical models that capture the complexities of stellar structure and evolution. We present a comprehensive grid of 25 million stellar pulsation models, computed using the MESA stellar evolution code and the GYRE oscillation code, tailored specifically to delta Scuti stars. The grid spans a wide range of masses, metallicities, and surface rotation velocities, and covers evolutionary phases from the early pre-main-sequence through the main sequence and into the post-main-sequence contraction phase. For each model, we compute hundreds of adiabatic pulsation frequencies for degrees l = 0-3, capturing p-modes, g-modes, f-modes, and their interactions through avoided crossings. Our analysis maps the behaviour of asteroseismic observables, including the large frequency separation (Delta nu) and the phase offset parameter (epsilon), across age, mass, and rotation. We investigate how these parameters change with evolutionary stage and revisit the scaling relations applicable to delta Scuti stars. This new model grid, which is publicly available, is designed to support the asteroseismology community in interpreting delta Scuti pulsations and in probing the evolution and internal structure of these stars. These improvements over previous model grids will allow for reliable age estimates and stronger constraints on stellar evolution pathways and the timing of planet formation across A- and F-type stellar populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASKAP J144834-685644: a newly discovered long period radio transient detected from radio to X-rays</a><span class="id">[2507.13453]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are an emerging group of radio transients that show periodic polarized radio bursts with periods varying from a few minutes to a few hours. Fewer than a dozen LPTs have been detected so far, and their origin (source and emission mechanism) remains unclear. Here, we report the discovery of a 1.5 h LPT, ASKAP J144834-685644, adding to the current sample of sources. ASKAP J144834-685644 is one of the very few LPTs that has been detected from X-rays to radio. It shows a steep radio spectrum and polarized radio bursts, which resemble the radio emission in known LPTs. In addition, it also shows highly structured and periodic narrow-band radio emission. Multiwavelength properties suggest that the spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks at near ultraviolet wavelengths, indicating the presence of a hot magnetic source. Combining multiwavelength information, we infer that ASKAP J144834-685644 may be a near edge-on magnetic white dwarf binary (MWD), although we cannot fully rule out ASKAP J144834-685644 being an isolated white dwarf pulsar or even a transitional millisecond pulsar (despite the lack of radio pulsations). If ASKAP J144834-685644 is a MWD binary, the observed broad-band SED can be explained by emission from an accretion disc. This hints that some fraction of optically bright LPTs may be accreting binaries with the radio period being the orbital period. It might further suggest a connection between optically bright synchronized WD binaries, such as polars, and non-accreting asynchronous WD pulsars, such as AR Sco and J1912-4410.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carbon burning cannot explain puffy hypervelocity white dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2507.15952]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Several hypervelocity white dwarfs (HVWDs) with space velocities of $\gtrsim 1000\,\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ have recently been discovered. One possible origin of these stars is the dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) scenario, in which an accreting sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen (CO) WD detonates as a SN Ia. In this scenario, the less massive WD may survive its companion's detonation and be ejected as a HVWD. Most of the observed HVWDs are hotter and puffier than normal WDs, perhaps due to their recent proximity to a SN. In this work, we test whether these properties can be explained by long-lived stable carbon (C) burning in the interiors of CO WD donors triggered by a SN shock. We model the long-term evolution of CO WDs following rapid energy injection using 1D models. We find that stable C burning can be ignited in CO WDs with masses of $0.95 - 1.10\,M_{\odot}$ if SN energy penetrates sufficiently deeply. The resulting born-again stars settle on the C-burning main sequence while they convert their interiors from C and O to Ne and Mg, where they have temperatures and radii similar to some of the observed HVWDs. However, the timescale over which C-burning WDs remain inflated is $\lesssim 10^5\,$yr, which is at least an order of magnitude shorter than the kinematic ages of observed hot HVWDs. We conclude that observed HVWDs are unlikely to be inflated by C burning. The stellar evolution of observed HVWDs remains an open problem.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04387" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing chromospheric fine structures with a Hα proxy using MURaM-ChE</a><span class="id">[2508.04387]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>H$\alpha$ observations of the solar chromosphere reveal dynamic small-scale structures known as spicules at the limb and rapid blue and red shifted excursions (RBEs/RREs) on-disk. We want to understand what drives these dynamic features, their magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) properties and their role in energy and heat transport to the upper solar atmosphere. To do this, we aim to develop a proxy for synthetic H$\alpha$ observations in radiative-MHD simulations to help identify these features. We use the chromospheric extension to the MURaM code (MURaM-ChE) to simulate an enhanced network region. We develop a proxy for H$\alpha$ based on a photon escape probability. This is a Doppler-shifted proxy that we use to identify fine structures in the line wings. We study on-disk features in 3D, obtaining their 3D structure from the absorption coefficient. We validate the H$\alpha$ proxy by comparing it against features detected in the wings of H$\alpha$ synthesized using MULTI3D. We detect numerous small-scale structures rooted at the network patches, similar to observations in H$\alpha$. The dynamics of an example feature (RBE) at a Doppler shift of 37 km/s show that flux emergence and consequent reconnection drive the formation of this feature. Pressure gradient forces build up to drive a flow along the field line carrying the feature, making it a jet. There is strong viscous and resistive heating at the first appearance of the feature associated with the flux emergence. At the same time and location, a heating front appears and propagates along the field lines at speeds comparable to the Alfven velocity. We show that a synthetic observable based on an escape probability is able to reliably identify features observed with the H$\alpha$ spectral line. We demonstrate its applicability by studying the formation, dynamics and properties of an RBE.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Multi-Wavelength Survey of Transient Lensing Opportunities for Primordial Black Hole Searches</a><span class="id">[2508.06688]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational lensing of short astrophysical transients provides a uniquely direct avenue for searching for primordial black holes (PBHs) across a vast range of masses.

In binaries, the fate of these fields depends on the formation pathway: in systems formed through isolated evolution, magnetic fields may decay over long inspiral timescales. In contrast, binaries formed via dynamical capture can retain substantial eccentricity and strong fields until merger, potentially altering the gravitational waveform. We consider two magnetic effects: magnetic interaction between the neutron stars and electromagnetic radiation from the system's effective dipole, and identify regimes where each dominates. Using a perturbative framework, we compute the associated energy loss and gravitational wave phase evolution. We find that for binaries with strong and comparable magnetic fields, $10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields may be detectable up to $\sim 10 \, \mathrm{Mpc}$ with DECIGO and the Einstein Telescope, while $10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields extend the reach to several hundred Mpc. For extreme fields of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{G}$, third-generation detectors could be sensitive out to Gpc scales. In contrast, LIGO (O5) is limited to galactic distances: $10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields are detectable only within $\sim 1\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, and only ultrastrong fields ($\sim 10^{16}$-$10^{17}\,\mathrm{G}$) are potentially observable to 700 Mpc. In highly asymmetric systems, where dipole radiation dominates, the gravitational wave dephasing is significantly suppressed, reducing the detection horizon. These findings suggest that current and future gravitational wave observatories may be capable of identifying magnetic effects in binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $ΔN_{eff}$ Bounds</a><span class="id">[2508.15134]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $&gt;3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How stellar mass and disc size shape the formation and migration of super-Earths</a><span class="id">[2508.21627]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The occurrence rate of close-in super-Earths is higher around M-dwarfs compared to stars of higher masses. In this work we aim to understand how the super-Earth population is affected by both the stellar mass, the size of the protoplanetary disc, and viscous heating. We utilise a standard protoplanetary disc model with both irradiated and viscous heating together with a pebble accretion model to simulate the formation and migration of planets. We find that if the disc is heated purely through stellar irradiation, inwards migration of super-Earths is very efficient, resulting in the close-in super-Earth fraction increasing with increasing stellar mass. In contrast, when viscous heating is included, planets can undergo outwards migration, delaying migration to the inner edge of the protoplanetary disc, which causes a fraction of super-Earth planets to grow to become giant planets instead. This results in a significant reduction of inner super-Earths around high-mass stars and an increase in the number of giant planets, both of which mirror observed features of the planet population around high-mass stars. This effect is most pronounced when the protoplanetary disc is large, since such discs evolve over a longer time-scale. We also test a model when we inject protoplanets at a fixed time early on in the disc lifetime. In this case, the fraction of close-in super-Earths decreases with increasing stellar mass in both the irradiated case and viscous case, since longer disc lifetimes around high-mass stars allows for planets to grow into giants instead of super-Earths for most injection locations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydrocarbon Hazes on Temperate sub-Neptune K2-18b supported by data from the James Webb Space Telescope</a><span class="id">[2509.10947]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>K2-18b, a sub-Neptune orbiting in the habitable zone of an M dwarf, has attracted significant interest following observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and, more recently, with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveal detectable atmospheric features. Previous studies have examined a wide range of possible compositions, focusing primarily in the near-infrared (0.8-5.2 $\mu$m) or mid-infrared (5-12 $\mu$m) wavelengths. We present a new interpretation of K2-18b's JWST transit spectra, combining an independent reduction of MIRI LRS data with previously published NIRISS/NIRSpec observations. We assess the impact of stellar parameter uncertainties on the inferred planetary properties and, using revised stellar parameters, derive a planetary density of $\rho_P = 3.34 \pm 1.44$ g cm$^{-3}$. We consider scattering and absorption from laboratory-produced haze analogues and perform free-chemistry Bayesian retrievals informed by equilibrium chemistry. Our results are consistent with an H$_2$-dominated mini-Neptune atmosphere with a mean molecular weight of $\mu \sim$2.4 Daltons, and support the presence of hydrocarbon hazes across 0.85-12 $\mu$m without requiring instrumental offsets. Our retrieved CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ abundances are broadly consistent between models but systematically lower than in haze-free studies, suggesting that haze reduces the need for high-$\mu$ solutions. While our retrievals tend to favour atmospheric temperatures $\sim$100-200 K warmer than previously reported, cooler solutions ($\sim$250 K) remain viable if the planetary mass is reduced towards the lower end of its uncertainty. We emphasise the need for follow-up self-consistent photochemical and microphysical modelling, alongside further mid-infrared observations to constrain key hydrocarbon species.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermodynamics of oscillating neutrinos</a><span class="id">[2306.14982]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The title theory is formulated.

This work establishes two points related to instability, both in the spirit of developing a more fundamental understanding of collective flavor dynamics. First, a conservation law related to lepton number implies that spectral crossings are necessary for instability. Second, the most permissive application of the ergodic hypothesis to neutrino flavor evolution implies that spectral crossings are in fact sufficient for instability. We also discuss flavor thermalization and energy conservation in relation to ergodicity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10158" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Holes Formed during Magneto-Hydrodynamic Turbulence in The Early Universe as Dominant Part of Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2501.10158]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. The production of PBHs through well-tested and accepted physical processes is highly worthy of investigation. This work highlights the role of turbulences in the very early universe in sustaining intense and persistent fluctuations in energy or mass density, which could provide a natural mechanism for PBH formation in the primordial universe. We analyze the mass range and abundance of PBHs produced in the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by the electroweak phase transition. Remarkably, we find that the mass range of the produced PBHs falls within the most viable “asteroid mass” window from the present-day observations, and within natural parameter regions their abundance can be sufficiently large. These findings suggest that PBHs produced during magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the very early universe may comprise a dominant part of dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13635" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Production of Dark Photons through Higher Electromagnetic Moments at LDMX: Simulations and Model Discrimination</a><span class="id">[2502.13635]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extend the projected sensitivity of LDMX for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) to the case of dark photons produced through higher order electromagnetic moments. These moments arise from loop diagrams involving portal matter fields, along with the gauge fields of new symmetry groups. Due to the Lorentz structures, in particular the momentum dependence, of these additional interactions, the kinematic distributions expected at missing momentum/energy experiments vary with model in addition to dark photon mass. By considering four additional types of interactions – magnetic and electric dipole, charge radius, and anapole moment – we show that LDMX Phase-II is expected to probe the relic target of these additional dark photon models. We compare the analytic with the numerical methods for calculating the dark bremsstrahlung cross section, and compute the kinematic distributions for each model. The potential for model discrimination in the scenario of non-zero signal events at LDMX is discussed. We find that there is a degeneracy between the dark photon mass and model, which can be partially broken by considering both the energy and the transverse momentum of the recoil electron.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT results</a><span class="id">[2505.10305]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how the higher-order curvature terms $R^3$, $R^{4}$ and $R^{3/2}$ modify the inflationary predictions. Using the scalar-tensor formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, we derive the effective scalar potentials and compute the resulting scalar tilt $n_s$, its running index $\alpha_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that those curvature corrections can shift the predictions to align better with the ACT data, thus providing a possible resolution to a minor discrepancy between the standard Starobinsky model and ACT observations. Our findings suggest that the modified Starobinsky models with the higher-order curvature terms offer a viable pathway to reconciling inflationary predictions with precision cosmological measurements. At the same time, measuring or constraining primordial tensor modes can help to discriminate between these corrections.</p></div></details></article></body>
