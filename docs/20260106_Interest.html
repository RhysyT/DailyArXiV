<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tractatus de Conscientia: A Tractatus-Style Sketch Toward a Modern, Physically Operational Theory of Consciousness</a><span class="id">[2601.01070]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tractatus de Conscientia is a tractatus-style sketch toward a modern, physically operational account of consciousness. It is also a tractatus-style attempt to talk about consciousness in a way that stays close to what we can actually test and build. It pushes back against two common moves: treating consciousness as a mysterious extra &quot;stuff,&quot; and treating it as nothing more than outward behavior. The central idea is to keep three things separate: what appears for an agent (the lived &quot;given&quot;), what is accessible (what can shape report, control, memory, or other records), and what structure remains when we change descriptions (the invariants of organization). On this view, a conscious episode isn't a mathematical instant. It has a short duration during which many internal distinctions are pulled together into one perspective and held stable enough to guide action–and sometimes to be reported. Unity is captured as a kind of &quot;whole-over-parts&quot; surplus: the system, over a chosen timescale and partition, carries more integrated predictive power than its pieces considered separately, and that surplus must also be available to access channels (so we don't count integration that never makes a difference to anything the agent can do or say). The self, in turn, is treated less like a hidden entity and more like a dynamical role–a self-index that helps bind episodes over time by stabilizing prediction and control across changing contexts. The tractatus also stresses a hard limit: every piece of evidence about consciousness requires coupling to the system, and coupling changes what we observe. So there is no protocol-free, perfectly private &quot;identifier&quot; of what-it-is-like. Consciousness is something we infer and attribute under explicit measurement setups, conventions, and uncertainty bounds–and we should be willing to say &quot;we can't tell&quot; when identifiability runs out.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistical Contextual Explanation of Quantum Paradoxes</a><span class="id">[2502.16048]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We celebrate this year hundred years of quantum mechanics but there is still no consensus regarding its interpretation and limitations. In this article we advocate the statistical contextual interpretation which is free of paradoxes. State vectors and various operators are purely mathematical entities allowing making quantitative probabilistic predictions. State vector describes an ensemble of identically prepared physical systems and a specific operator represents a class of equivalent measurements of a physical observable. A collapse of wave function is not a mysterious and instantaneous physical process. A collapsed quantum state describes a new ensemble of physical systems prepared in a particular way. Probabilities are objective properties of random experiments in which empirical frequencies stabilize. Therefore, quantum probabilities do not provide a complete description of individual physical systems and their interactions. Whether these probabilities can be explained as emergent is an open question which cannot be settled by philosophical discussions and no-go theorems. It can be only answered by more detailed study of experimental data then it is usually done. Bell Tests allowed rejecting Bell local and Bell causal hidden variable models but we even don't know whether quantum probabilities provide a complete description of existing experimental data. Time series of experimental data may contain much more information than it is obtained using empirical frequencies and histograms. Therefore, predictable completeness of quantum mechanics has be tested and not taken for granted.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00849" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new kind of science</a><span class="id">[2601.00849]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We discuss whether science is in the process of being transformed from a quest for causality to a quest for correlation in light of the recent development in artificial intelligence. We observe that while a blind trust in the most seductive promises of AI is surely to be avoided, a judicious combination of computer simulation based on physical insight and the machine learning ability to explore ultra-dimensional spaces, holds potential for transformative progress in the way science is going to be pursued in the years to come.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01930" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPR Revisited: Context-Indexed Elements of Reality and Operational Completeness</a><span class="id">[2511.01930]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We reframe the EPR argument through an operational lens, replacing the notion of fixed &quot;elements of reality&quot; with context-indexed conditional states - what's often referred to as a measurement assemblage. This move deliberately sidesteps the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our updated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures observable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional state that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context. Crucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum mechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now, in any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided no-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed inferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed values across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction. To ground the argument, we offer examples: the qubit singlet scenario using Pauli settings and CJWR thresholds, a continuous-variable case based on the Reid criteria, and a counterexample in the spirit of the PR box, which highlights the boundaries of what quantum theory can actually reach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06034" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tractatus Quanticum</a><span class="id">[2512.06034]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This is a re-editing, which takes quantum mechanics into account, of Wittgenstein's famous Tractatus. The operation has a playful side in the form, but is a serious attempt to capture possible philosophical implications of the Relational Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, and formalize the naturalistic third-way between realism and instrumentalism explored by this interpretation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mathematics in the liturgical books of the Catholic Church: phases of the ecclesiastical moon</a><span class="id">[2601.00474]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use contemporary mathematical notation to describe the method for determining the age of the ecclesiastical moon as mandated by pope Gregory XIII and elaborated in the book of Christopher Clavius \emph{Romani calendarii explicatio}. The algorithm is first introduced by using the tabular method employed by liturgical books such as the Roman Missal, Breviary and Martyrology. Then we construct the recurrence equation for the epacts, derive its solution, and give a simple expression for the age of the moon on a given day of the year. We also consider the problems which can occur at the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year, when there could be a “jump” in moon's age (&quot;saltus lunae&quot;) in years when epact corrections are applied. We propose a simple solution which fixes these problems. A summary of the formulae and listing of the implementation of relevant functions in Python is provided in the last section.</p></div></details></article>

To build intuition, the first models the random walk of classical, non-interacting point-like particles, providing a clear analogy to the way disorder can limit transport. The second examines the propagation of an electromagnetic pulse through a one-dimensional, lossless transmission line with randomly varying propagation constant and characteristic impedance along its length, a system that captures the interference effects essential for true Anderson localization. We evaluate quantitative measures that reveal the transition from normal diffusion to localization of particles in one case, and the exponential confinement of wave energy in the other. Together, these simulations offer a pair of accessible tools for investigating localization phenomena in an instructional setting.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Quantum Technology Job Market: Data Driven Analysis of 3641 Job Posts</a><span class="id">[2503.19004]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying 3641 job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a &quot;human-in-the-loop&quot; validation process to ensure reliability. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms. However, there are signs that change may be forthcoming, indicated by a strong presence of Bachelor's and Master's graduates in the workforce.</p></div></details></article>

This study examined the biomechanics by analysing the entire body of the tori during execution. Methods:We analysed Tori s body motion using original biomechanical models, considering the balance of sacrificing to throw Uke and body mass to strike the opponent. General equations for Sutemi, Makikomi, and Tai atari were established, and their utilisation in high level male competition was statistically analysed. Results:The results show that effective Sutemi and Makikomi execution depends on the correct use of Tori's body this http URL biomechanical model revealed the relationships between angular falling speed, body angle, and athlete this http URL model allowed us to evaluate the falling velocity, showing that the angular velocity and acceleration were proportional to the gravitational acceleration and body-Tatami angle and inversely proportional to the athlete this http URL stopping and sliding forces are directly proportional to the sum of the Tori and Uke masses and the body Tatami angle but are independent of the athletes eight. Tai Atari s force was quantified to evaluate its situational applicability in competition. Conclusion:This study advanced the biomechanical understanding of Sutemi, Makikomi, and Tai Atari using two original theoretical models, highlighting the importance of Tori s body mass motion. The findings obtained can influence training and competition strategies, enhance technique effectiveness, and reduce injury risks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Random Walks to Thermal Rides: Universal Anomalous Transport in Soaring Flights</a><span class="id">[2601.01293]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cross-country soaring flights rely on intermittent atmospheric updrafts to cover long distances, producing trajectories that alternate between rapid relocation and local exploration. From a large dataset of paraglider, hang glider, and sailplane flights, we uncover a universal transport law: beyond short ballistic times, horizontal motion is persistently sub-ballistic, with a Hurst exponent $\approx 0.88$ largely independent of aircraft type. Phase-resolved analysis using a probabilistic segmentation method shows that this scaling arises from the fundamentally intermittent, two-dimensional, and directionally correlated nature of soaring transport, in which successive ballistic segments do not add coherently. We find that learning, in the sense of experience-driven improvements in exploration and decision-making, manifests primarily in the search phase, enhancing the ability to efficiently probe the air mass and locate the next thermal. Overall, our results suggest that atmospheric structure and the generic organization of the transition-search-climb cycle dominate transport properties, placing human soaring alongside biological and physical systems where anomalous transport emerges from intermittency and persistence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shuttlecock velocity decay after smash and slice shots in badminton</a><span class="id">[2601.01412]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper reports on the decay in shuttlecock velocity after smash and slice shots performed by elite and international players, based on the analysis of videos captured on a badminton court with high-speed cameras. The trajectories of feather shuttlecocks show an exponential decay in velocity and an exponential increase in time-of-flight with distance, in accordance with the equation of motion of a shuttlecock subjected to high drag. The initial speed, which can exceed 500 km/h, is reduced by half every 3.35 m, depending on the physical parameters of the shuttlecock characterized by a speed index. The videos show that plastic shuttlecocks, which are more resistant than feather shuttlecocks, deform at high speeds. The resulting decay of their drag coefficient with increasing speed makes them unsuitable for high-level play. The study also shows that the spin induced by the slice shots of left-handed players or the reverse slice shots of right-handed players slows the shuttlecock down.</p></div></details></article></body>
