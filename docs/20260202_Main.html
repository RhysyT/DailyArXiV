This degeneracy arises from the scale-dependent effective gravitational coupling $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which ensures identical background evolution, transfer functions, and linear growth. Consequently, all early-universe, low and intermediate scale cosmological observables are equally well described by STVG-MOG without invoking non-baryonic dark matter. We argue that the equivalence implies that isotropic cosmological data alone cannot establish the physical existence of dark matter. The degeneracy is broken only by observables sensitive to large-scale, anisotropic gravitational response. In particular, recent measurements of enhanced radio-galaxy and quasar number-count dipoles at gigaparsec scales probe a regime where $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$ departs from its $\Lambda$CDM limit, allowing STVG-MOG to generate anisotropic bulk flows, while preserving consistency with all isotropic constraints. These observations provide a concrete pathway for empirically distinguishing modified gravity from particle dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subsolar mass black holes from stellar collapse induced by primordial black holes</a><span class="id">[2601.22220]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While no gravitational-wave detection of subsolar mass black holes has been confirmed to date, a number of candidate detections invite us to speculate on the origin of such black holes should a detection be confirmed. It is generally assumed that the observation of a black hole with subsolar mass $M_{\rm obs}$ would provide strong evidence for primordial black holes (PBHs). The mass $M_{\rm PBH}$ of the PBH, however, does not necessarily have to be equal to $M_{\rm obs}$, as it would in what we term a “direct PBH scenario&quot;. Instead, a black hole of mass $M_{\rm obs}$ may form in a capture of a much smaller primordial black hole, $M_{\rm PBH} \ll M_{\rm obs}$, by a dwarf star of mass $M_* \simeq M_{\rm obs}$, followed by the total consumption of the star by the PBH. We provide some rough estimates and demonstrate that such an “indirect PBH scenario&quot; may also lead to significant populations of black holes with mass $M_{\rm obs}$, especially in dwarf galaxies, and may be able to explain rare subsolar mass events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22223" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warps survive beyond fly-by encounters in protoplanetary disks. RW Aur A as a case study</a><span class="id">[2601.22223]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar fly-bys can have multiple dynamical effects on protoplanetary disks, including warping and the excitation of spiral arms. Since observations indicate that warps are common, we aim to investigate these effects for different fly-by trajectories. We further link our models to observations by applying them to the RW Aur system, which is a fly-by candidate with a relatively well constrained trajectory. We investigate the disk dynamics in grid-based hydrodynamical simulations, which allow for a lower disk viscosity than commonly used SPH models. We post-process our simulations of the RW Aur system with radiative transfer models to create synthetic images of the dust continuum and gas kinematics. Fly-bys inclined with respect to the original disk plane can excite warps of a few degrees: the exact outcome depends on the specific geometry of the encounter. Specifically, we find that the position of the periastron with respect to the initial disk plane plays a role for the resulting warp strength. Within our parameter set, the strongest warp is excited for a retrograde fly-by with a periastron that is not in the same plane as the disk. Our models show that the warp can persist even after the perturber can no longer be clearly linked to the system, implying that past fly-bys are a possible origin of observed warps. Excited spirals arms, on the other hand, are much more short-lived than the warp. The RW Aur system presents a perfect opportunity to apply these results: we find that a warp of about 5° can be excited, and that the strong spiral arms have already disappeared at the current time of observation 300 years after periastron). This compares well with existing continuum observations, and our synthetic kinematic evaluations hint at remnant structures in the gas density that may be detectable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project I: An Improved Determination of the Primordial Helium Abundance – Project Description, Sample Selection, Observations, and Methodology</a><span class="id">[2601.22232]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extremely low metallicity HII regions have been observed with the goal of determining the primordial helium abundance ($Y_{\rm p}$). $Y_{\rm p}$, combined with standard big bang nucleosynthesis and the half-life of the neutron, provides a direct measurement of the number of neutrino families, but $Y_{\rm p}$ must be measured very precisely to provide meaningful constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model. Here we describe a program to combine new Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) observations with a new analysis methodology to significantly improve the determination of $Y_{\rm p}$. The LBT, with its MODS and LUCI instruments, produces spectra, which, when combined with our new analysis methodology, are capable of delivering He abundances in individual HII regions with uncertainties of approximately 2% or less. Archival LBT/MODS spectra of standard stars over a four-year period enable the determination of a wavelength-dependent uncertainty in the MODS spectral response, resulting in improved relative emission line uncertainties. An optimized sample of low-metallicity galaxies has been selected with the goal of producing a determination of $Y_{\rm p}$ with a precision of $\sim$ 0.5%, sufficient to provide an independent constraint on the effective number of neutrino families of $\sim$ 3%.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The LBT Y$_\mathrm{p}$ Project IV: A New Value of the Primordial Helium Abundance</a><span class="id">[2601.22238]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new determination of the primordial helium abundance based on new, high-quality Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) observations of 54 metal-poor H II regions. These regions have been observed and analyzed uniformly. We also describe a number of updates to our methodology, including updated helium emissivities. Enabled by the large, high-quality dataset, we examine our sample targets for potential systematic errors, which could bias their results. We perform a standard 95% confidence level $\chi^2$ cut and find that a significantly larger fraction (47/54 = 87%) of our sample qualifies than for previous datasets. We also screen for quality and reliability, flagging targets which may introduce significant systematic errors, producing a dataset of 41 targets. In a significant breakthrough for the field, that dataset includes 15 high SNR targets with low metallicity (O/H &lt; 4 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$). Due to this low-metallicity dataset, for the first time, a weighted average for determining the primordial helium abundance (Y$_\mathrm{p}$) is well-justified and produces a robust result. By weighted average of our 15 low-metallicity targets, we determine Y$_\mathrm{p}$ = 0.2458 $\pm$ 0.0013. This result achieves an unprecedented precision of 0.5%, and it is in good agreement with the BBN result, Y$_\mathrm{p}$ = 0.2467 $\pm$ 0.0002, based on the Planck determination of the baryon density.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project V: Cosmological Implications of a New Determination of Primordial $^4$He</a><span class="id">[2601.22239]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The primordial abundance of $^4$He plays a central role in big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project's new measurement of the primordial $^4$He mass fraction $Y_{\rm p} =0.2458 \pm 0.0013$ is the most precise determination to date. In this paper, we combine our new $Y_{\rm p}$ value with the latest primordial deuterium measurement, and assess the consequences for cosmology. For Standard BBN, where the number of light neutrino species is fixed at $N_\nu=3$, the single free parameter is the cosmic baryon density; the CMB measures this independently, with results consistent with each other. Combining $Y_{\rm p}$ , D/H, BBN, and the CMB, gives the cosmic baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta = (6.120 \pm 0.038) \times 10^{-10}$, corresponding to a baryon density parameter $\Omega_{\rm B} h^2 = 0.02236 \pm 0.00014$. We then allow $N_\nu$ to vary and thus measure relativistic species present during nucleosynthesis. We find $\eta = (6.101 \pm 0.044) \times 10^{-10}$ or $\Omega_{\rm B} h^2= 0.02229 \pm 0. 00016$, and $N_\nu = 2.925 \pm 0.082$, and for $N_\nu \ge 3$, $\Delta N_\nu= N_\nu-3 \le 0.125$ (95\% CL) during BBN and the CMB. Our results demonstrate consistency with the Standard Model of particle physics, and with the standard cosmology that links BBN at $\sim 1 \ \rm sec$ and the CMB at $\sim 400,000$ yr.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Ray Analysis of an Off-Axis Merger Stage Binary Galaxy Cluster: PSZ2 G279.79+39.09</a><span class="id">[2601.22251]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an X-ray analysis of the merging galaxy cluster system PSZ2 G279.79+39.09 ($z=0.29$) using archival XMM-Newton and Chandra observations. The surface brightness image is bimodal, elongated east-west with a projected core separation of $\sim 1.35$ Mpc. We measure gas temperatures of 5.36 keV for the eastern subcluster (PSZ-E) and 5.44 keV for the western component (PSZ-W). Assuming isothermal intracluster gas, the hydrostatic masses are $\log(M_{500}/M_\odot)=14.76$ for PSZ-E and 14.54 for PSZ-W, implying a mass ratio of $\sim 1:1.7$. PSZ-E shows X-ray concentration indices of $c_{40}/c_{400}=0.124$ and $c_{100}/c_{500}=0.278$, together with a centroid shift of $w=0.016$, indicating a disturbed halo that still hosts a compact cool core; PSZ-W is comparably disturbed even in its core. Both subclusters exhibit ICM asymmetries consistent with ram-pressure stripping, and PSZ-W displays an X-ray tail extending nearly to the outskirts of PSZ-E. The orientation and length of this tail support an off-axis merger geometry. Thermodynamic maps reveal a hot ($\sim 7.3$ keV), high-pressure, high-entropy bridge between the cores. From the Rankine-Hugoniot temperature jump, we infer a Mach number $M=1.41^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$, consistent with a weak merger shock propagating at $1620^{+500}_{-420}$ km s$^{-1}$. These results indicate a merger with a non-zero impact parameter, likely observed near core passage ($\lesssim 0.5$ Gyr before or after), with the pre-pericenter scenario slightly preferred based on the projected separation and thermodynamic structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22266" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High energy neutrinos from pulsar-powered optical transients: LFBOTs as potential origin of the KM3NeT event KM3-230213A</a><span class="id">[2601.22266]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration reported the detection of an ultra-high energy ($\sim 220$ PeV) neutrino event, KM3-230213A. In this work, we perform a detailed investigation into whether this event could originate from the diffuse neutrino flux produced by a class of pulsar-powered optical transients. In particular, we consider populations of ordinary supernovae (SNe), super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe), and luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) with a newly formed magnetar as the central engine. We discuss both the thermal electromagnetic and non-thermal neutrino emission from such sources. We scan the parameter space of the dipolar magnetic field strength and the initial spin period to determine characteristic optical emission properties and lightcurve timescales of these transients. Additionally, our scan identifies which classes of these transients can reproduce the required diffuse flux level and neutrino energies. Combining our results, we conclude that a diffuse neutrino flux from a population of LFBOTs can explain the KM3NeT event. Therefore, pulsar-powered optical transients may serve as promising sources for the current and upcoming high-energy and ultra-high energy neutrino telescopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tensions in Cosmology: Interpreting Them Through Inhomogeneous Models</a><span class="id">[2601.22278]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We review a subset of the current tensions affecting the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, emphasizing the role of chronic systematics and significance inflation in shaping their interpretation. As a unifying framework, we consider the spherically symmetric inhomogeneous $\Lambda$LTB model and use it as a set of &quot;glasses&quot; through which to reinterpret the Hubble, dipole, and dark-energy tensions. Large-scale spatial gradients in this model introduce anisotropic expansion and position-dependent observables, allowing local estimates of $H_{0}$ to shift, dipolar signatures to arise, and an apparently evolving dark-energy equation of state to be mimicked without invoking genuinely dynamical dark energy. We discuss how these effects are constrained once the full supernova, CMB, and large-scale-structure data sets are included, and argue that it remains unclear whether any single $\Lambda$LTB configuration can simultaneously account for all major anomalies. More broadly, we highlight that cosmology currently lacks a widely accepted baseline model that is both theoretically well founded and capable of accommodating the Hubble and dark-energy tensions, leaving us without a true concordance framework for forecasting future surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Editorial: Mass and Angular Momentum Transport of Rapidly Rotating Hot Stars</a><span class="id">[2601.22281]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This dedicated journal collection will present and discuss a variety of science cases that can be used to extend our knowledge of massive stars and the influence of their rapid rotation on their subsequent evolution.

While matter accretion onto supermassive black holes is long thought to accelerate particles to high energies, it has recently been suggested that tidal disruption events, and accretion flares in general, with prominent IR echoes can account for a fraction of the diffuse high-energy neutrino signal. Motivated by this result, we compile a sample of nearby accretion flares detected in the NEOWISE survey featuring strong IR echoes, and we cross-match it with the latest catalog of neutrino alerts, IceCat-1. We recover only a single spatial coincidence between the two catalogs, consistent with a chance coincidence. We find no temporal and spatial coincidences between the two samples, which, given the properties of our sample, appears to challenge previous conclusions. We discuss the physical implications of our results and potential future explorations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conversion Layer Controls the Evolution of Magnetic Deflections Near the Alfven Surface</a><span class="id">[2601.22321]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine the statistics of Alfvenic deflections in both sub-Alfvenic and super-Alfvenic solar wind with particular focus on a common parameter that underlies the definition of switchbacks: the magnetic deflection angle. Our findings are in general agreement with earlier studies that suggest magnetic deflection angles &gt; 90 degrees are very unlikely to occur in sub-Alfvenic regimes. We find that their upper limit exhibits an identifiable trend with the Alfven Mach number Ma, suggesting that gradual steepening of Alfvenic deflections with increasing Ma is a plausible mechanism controlling deflection angles in the young solar wind. Further analysis reveals that large velocity fluctuations tend to be important in the largest sub-Alfvenic magnetic deflections with increasing contributions from the parallel component very close to Ma = 1, while virtually no magnetic deflections in the super-Alfvenic regime exhibit such large velocity perturbations. We also determine the local ratio of radial Poynting flux SR to kinetic energy flux KR and find that large sub-Alfvenic deflection angles tend to be dominated by SR, while super-Alfvenic deflections are eventually dominated by the KR associated with the radial solar wind flow. Our results show that within the vicinity of the Alfven surface (where Ma = 1), there is a critical region of parameter space within which velocity deflections approach the Alfven velocity and KR/SR is close to unity. We refer to this region (where | log10(Ma)| &lt; 0.2) as the conversion layer. The conversion layer may play a significant role in the evolution of magnetic defections by providing the medium for converting magnetic energy to particle energy and likely driving the formation of magnetic switchbacks in super-Alfvenic solar wind.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How isotropic is dark energy?</a><span class="id">[2601.22351]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tensions in late-time expansion data have renewed interest in models beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We ask: \emph{how isotropic must dark energy be?} Working in Bianchi I, we allow time-dependent anisotropic stress and introduce a parameterisation that enforces a vanishing line-of-sight integral of the shear, thereby satisfying the CMB ISW quadrupole bound by construction. Using Pantheon+SH0ES SNe together with DESI BAO distances, single-bin (constant) and five-bin anisotropic models improve the fit over $w$CDM by $\Delta(-2\ln L_{\rm iso})=14.8$ and $26.6$ respectively, but both violate the quadrupole constraint. In contrast, a five-bin constrained model achieves $\Delta(-2\ln L_{\rm iso})=15.4$ while remaining compatible with the quadrupole limit. The fit improvement arises from two sources: capturing directional structure in the Pantheon+ SNe data, and partially alleviating the tension between the SH0ES $H_0$ value and DESI BAO distances.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22465" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Formation Crisis of Repeating Partial Tidal Disruption Events</a><span class="id">[2601.22465]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A number of candidate repeating partial tidal disruption events (rpTDEs) have been reported in recent years. If these events are confirmed, the high fraction of observed rpTDEs among all tidal disruption events (TDEs) is in tension with prediction of the loss cone channel. We further point out an inequality $M_\bullet \lesssim 4\times 10^6 M_\odot (T_{\rm obt}/10\ {\rm yr})^{4/9}$ that must be satisfied for rpTDEs of solar type stars in the loss cone channel, where $M_\bullet$ is the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and $T_{\rm obt}$ is the orbital period of the star. However the majority of reported rpTDE candidates potentially violate this inequality, indicating an alternative formation channel. In the commonly invoked Hills mechanism, the captured stars produced by tidal disruption of near-contact binaries can evade this inequality and may be the dominant source of rpTDEs. If the same process operates in the Galactic Center, there should exist a population of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) ejected with velocities as high as $3.6\times 10^3 (M_\bullet/10^6 M_\odot)^{1/6}\ {\rm km\ s}^{-1}$, which however have not been detected. A complete search for HVSs in the Milky Way will be critical for testing this prediction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The accretion-ejection connection in the asymmetric Th 28 jet revealed by MUSE-NFM</a><span class="id">[2601.22658]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mass loss through stellar jets is closely tied to the process of accretion through the disk. Understanding phenomena such as episodic ejections and outflow asymmetries can thus shed light on the mechanism of jet launching and its connection to both mass accretion and the evolution of the protoplanetary disk. We use new VLT/MUSE Narrow Field Mode observations of the Classical T Tauri Star Th 28 to map the jet structures within 6” of the source at an effective angular resolution of 0.”12, provided by the combination of the AO correction and image deconvolution. The emission line profiles and flux ratios are investigated and diagnostic analysis of the optical forbidden emission lines (FELs) is used to estimate the electron density, ionisation fraction, electron temperature and shock velocities in both jet lobes within 200 au of the star. The mass outflow rates in each lobe are obtained using the derived total densities and FEL luminosities and compared with the mass accretion rate. We identify several new knots in both jet lobes which have been ejected in the previous 10 years on a timescale of 3-6 years, which is significantly more frequent than previously estimated. In both lobes we find comparable mass outflow rates close to the jet base. Th 28 has undergone a significant rise in mass accretion rate between 2014 and 2023, which may be linked to the most recently ejected knot pair detected in each side of the jet. The red-shifted jet mass outflow rate shows a similar increase of a factor 2, indicating that the ratio of mass outflow to accretion remains constant. A moderately lower mass outflow rate is found in the faster blue-shifted lobe, supporting the possibility that momentum ejection is conserved on each side of the jet. The frequent knot ejections indicate that this source is a good target for further monitoring to study the accretion-ejection connection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22683" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the dynamics of magnetoviscous warped discs around compact objects</a><span class="id">[2601.22683]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accretion discs that are tilted with respect to their compact hosts can warp out-of-plane through general relativistic frame-dragging. Warp influences disc dynamics in ways that have been studied extensively, especially as regards instabilities that might lead to rapid angular-momentum cancellation between neighbouring rings of fluid and mass infall. We provide a review of warped-disc phenomena here, revisiting key hydrodynamical assumptions that impact calculations of the shear viscosity controlling instability thresholds. Relativistic effects at the level of gas-parcel orbits are included, as are external Lorentz forces applied by the compact primary's magnetic field. Semi-analytic analysis reveals that intense magnetic fields can bring about new branches of warp modes and avoided crossings that significantly reduce the perpendicular viscosity at sub-Eddington accretion rates. Critical strengths required for misaligned torques to tear a thin disc may thus relax for systems like neutron star X-ray binaries or radio-loud active galactic nuclei.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apsidal motion and TESS light curves of two southern eclipsing binaries with high eccentricity: V1647 Sgr and V2283 Sgr</a><span class="id">[2601.22715]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The study of apsidal motion rates in eccentric eclipsing binaries provides an important observational test of theoretical models of stellar structure and evolution. Precise physical parameters of the stellar components together with systematic measurements of the periastron advance are needed. We present new results of our long-term observational project to analyze the apsidal motion in early-type eccentric eclipsing binaries. New ground and space-based photometric data were obtained, and archival spectroscopic measurements were used in this study of two detached southern-hemisphere eclipsing binaries: V1647 Sgr (P=3.28 d, e=0.41), and V2283 Sgr (3.47, 0.49). Their TESS observations in four sectors have also been included and the corresponding light curves were solved using the Phoebe code. The newly completed O-C diagrams were analyzed using all reliable timings found in the literature and calculated using the TESS light curves. New or improved values were obtained for the elements of apsidal motion. Using archival spectroscopy for V1647 Sgr, the precise absolute parameters were improved: M1 = 2.184(0.035) M$_\odot$, M2 = 1.957(0.035) M$_\odot$, and R1 = 1.839(0.015) R$_\odot$, R2 = 1.716(0.015) R$_\odot$. For V2283 Sgr the absolute dimensions were newly estimated: M1 = 2.178(0.10) M$_\odot$, M2 = 1.547(0.10) M$_\odot$, and R1 = 1.796(0.01) R$_\odot$, R2 = 1.544(0.01) R$_\odot$. We improved relatively long periods of apsidal motion of about 580 and 530 years, together with the corresponding internal structure constants, log k2, -2.394, and -2.418, for V1647 Sgr and V2283 Sgr, respectively. The relativistic contribution to apsidal motion is not negligible, making about 12 resp. 14% of the total rate of apsidal motion. No signs of the presence of an additional body were revealed in the light curves or in the O-C diagrams of both eccentric systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A unified framework for hot accretion flows with finite angular momentum: from Bondi-like to disc-like regimes</a><span class="id">[2601.22726]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies suggest that the accretion rate onto the central supermassive black hole can reach a substantial fraction of the Bondi rate. However, classical accretion theory applicable to such hot accretion flows treats spherically symmetric Bondi accretion and disc-like advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) as two distinct limiting cases, lacking a unified framework for flows with finite angular momentum. In this work, we develop such a framework that continuously connects these two regimes. Our model naturally recovers the Bondi solution in the limit of vanishing angular momentum and approaches the properties of classical ADAFs at high angular momentum, while providing a physically well-defined description of the intermediate regime where neither limiting case is strictly applicable. We further demonstrate that the accretion rate is jointly regulated by the angular momentum of the ambient gas and the gas viscosity. For sufficiently large but physically reasonable viscosity, the accretion rate can remain at a significant fraction of the Bondi rate even in the presence of substantial gas rotation. These results offer a natural explanation for how such accretion rates can be sustained despite finite angular momentum in realistic galactic environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of an Extremely Luminous Radio Counterpart to the Be/X-ray Binary A0538-66</a><span class="id">[2601.22741]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the discovery of radio emission from the Be/X-ray binary A0538-66 with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), and results from a subsequent weekly monitoring campaign with the MeerKAT radio telescope.

Its rare episodes of super-Eddington accretion, rapid optical and X-ray flares, and other peculiar properties make it an interesting system among high-mass X-ray binaries.

To investigate the nature of GRB jets, here we focus on X-ray flares (XFs) and extended emissions (EEs), which are X-ray emissions that occur 100 to 1000 seconds after the main burst. They can be observed by recently developed multi-wavelength facilities. In this paper, we calculate emissions across multi-wavelengths associated with XFs and EEs under the hypothesis that XFs and EEs are optically-thin synchrotron emissions from nonthermal electrons in relativistic jets. Considering ranges of the dissipation radius $r_{\rm diss}$ and the Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ of the jet, we determine the parameter space in which a detectable emission can be produced at each wavelength. We found that simultaneous ultraviolet and very-high-energy gamma-ray emission associated with XFs or EEs can be detected by Swift/UVOT, SVOM/VT, and CTAO approximately every three years. The detection and non-detection rates for each detector are key to determining the uncertain yet essential values necessary for understanding the physics of GRB jets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ground Level Enhancement (GLE#77) in the gamma-ray component: First observation from Arctic and Antarctic stations</a><span class="id">[2601.22807]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This article presents the observations of the extreme ground-level enhancement (GLE #77) of Solar Cycle 25 that occurred on 11 November 2025, using ground-based NaI(Tl) gamma-ray detectors deployed at Arctic and Antarctic stations, together with neutron monitor data and particle measurements from the GOES-18 satellite. The event was associated with an intense X-class solar flare and a strong solar energetic proton event. This paper reports the first ground-based detection of a GLE using gamma-ray detectors operating simultaneously in both polar regions, which are concurrent with increases in neutron monitor counts. Thus highlights the capability of polar gamma-ray detectors to complement traditional neutron monitor observations during extreme solar proton events. A detailed analysis revealed distinct prompt and delayed responses during the event evolution. Interestingly, the signature of the prompt peak of GLE#77 (at 10:38 UT) was observed up to high-rigidity neutron monitors (low latitudes). However, the delayed peak (at 13:08 UT) was not seen at the stations with rigidity &gt; 6 GV. The timing of the prompt and delayed peaks coincided with the proton flux peaks observed by the GOES-18 satellite at energies &gt; 150 MeV and 12-99 MeV, respectively. It is observed that the GLE amplitude has a strong dependence on geomagnetic cutoff rigidity and has a weak solar zenith angle dependence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operational Solar Flare Forecasting System Using an Explainable Large Language Model</a><span class="id">[2601.22811]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study focuses on forecasting major (&gt;=M-class) solar flares that can severely impact the near-Earth environment.

We apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to explain the model predictions. We develop an operational forecasting system based on the LLMFlareNet model. We adopt a daily mode for performance comparison across various operational forecasting systems under identical active region (AR) number and prediction date, using daily operational observational data. The main results are as follows. (1) Through ablation experiments and comparison with baseline models, LLMFlareNet achieves the best TSS scores of 0.720 +/- 0.040 on the ten cross-validation (CV) dataset with mixed ARs. (2) By both global and local SHAP analyses, we identify that R_VALUE is the most influential physical feature for the prediction of LLMFlareNet, aligning with flare magnetic reconnection theory. (3) In daily mode, LLMFlareNet achieves TSS scores of 0.680/0.571 (0.689/0.661, respectively) on the dataset with single/mixed ARs, markedly outperforming NASA/CCMC (SolarFlareNet, respectively). This work introduces the first application of a large language model as a universal computation engine with explainability method in this domain, and presents the first comparison between operational flare forecasting systems in daily mode. The proposed LLMFlareNet-based system demonstrates substantial improvements over existing systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22836" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray Spectroscopy of Disk Winds in Black Hole X-ray Binaries</a><span class="id">[2601.22836]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Powerful outflows along the accretion disk, known as disk winds, are sometimes launched in black hole X-ray binaries. These winds often manifest themselves in X-ray spectra as blueshifted, highly ionized absorption lines. Previous observations suggest that the mass loss rate from the disk due to disk winds can be comparable to or even more than the mass accretion rate onto the black hole, indicating that disk winds likely play crucial roles in shaping the accretion disk structure and affecting the surrounding environment. However, the mechanisms driving these winds, as well as how their structure changes in response to variations in the mass accretion rate, remain poorly understood. The X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), launched in September 2023, is equipped with Resolve, a cutting-edge X-ray micro-calorimeter that delivers unprecedented spectral resolution. Resolve is expected to significantly advance our understanding of wind launching mechanisms and their impact on accretion processes and environments. In this article, we review the progress made in the pre-XRISM era, highlight key results obtained from XRISM observations to date, and outline future prospects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22894" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equatorially Asymmetric Magnetic Fields and Their Impact on Black Hole Accretion Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2601.22894]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of equatorial asymmetry in the magnetic field geometry on accretion dynamics around a spinning black hole using axisymmetric general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We consider a Fishbone–Moncrief torus orbiting a Kerr black hole with spin parameter $a = 0.9375$, threaded by large-scale magnetic fields that are asymmetric about the equatorial plane. The degree of equatorial asymmetry in the magnetic field is parametrized by an angle, with values of $30^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $60^\circ$. We examine how this equatorially asymmetric initial magnetic field configuration influences the magnetic field structure, accretion flow morphology, and angular momentum transport across a range of initial plasma beta values ($\beta = 0.007, 0.005, 0.001$). We find that such deformation in the magnetic field leads to noticeable changes in the inner disk structure, asymmetric outflow patterns in the poloidal plane, and time-dependent variations in accretion rates. These effects are generally more pronounced at lower beta values, where magnetic pressure dominates; in particular, the $30^\circ$ case at $\beta = 0.001$ exhibits strong and persistent asymmetric inflows and outflows. Our results demonstrate that equatorially asymmetric magnetic field configurations can significantly influence the structure and variability of relativistic accretion flows. These findings motivate future extensions to full three-dimensional studies, where black hole magnetosphere can be explored in a more general setting.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22910" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bondi universe: How negative mass drives the cosmological expansion</a><span class="id">[2601.22910]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We identify a new cosmological coincidence that parallels the well-known matter/dark-energy coincidence: the present-epoch transition of the universe from a weakly coupled (collisionless) to a strongly coupled (collisional) gravitational regime. Within a cosmological model containing equal amounts of positive and negative Bondi masses – consistent with the weak equivalence principle and momentum conservation – we show that this coupling transition naturally coincides with the shift from a coasting to an accelerating expansion. A linear response analysis of the corresponding Vlasov-Poisson system reveals that mixed positive-negative mass configurations are always unstable, with growth rates that increase at shorter wavelengths, thereby driving the system toward strong coupling. Using long-time, exact one-dimensional N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the universe undergoes three successive expansion phases: an initial ballistic regime, an intermediate random-walk acceleration driven by sporadic Bondi encounters, and finally a uniformly accelerating phase triggered by the formation of stable positive/negative mass pairs. The onset of this last phase occurs precisely when the coupling parameter crosses unity, linking the two cosmological coincidences through a single dynamical mechanism. These results suggest that cosmic acceleration may arise from the nonlinear dynamics of a gravitationally neutral mixed-mass universe, without invoking dark energy or a cosmological constant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22937" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linear perturbation theory and structure formation in a Brans-Dicke theory of gravity without dark matter</a><span class="id">[2601.22937]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the formation of the large-scale cosmic structure in a scalar-tensor theory of gravity belonging to the class of the Brans–Dicke theories. The universe contains baryonic matter alone and neither dark matter nor dark energy. The two arbitrary functions of the scalar field characterizing the kinetic term and the self-interaction potential are set to $W(\varphi)=-1$ and $V(\varphi) = -\Xi \varphi$, respectively, with $\Xi$ a positive constant. In the weak-field limit, the theory reduces to Refracted Gravity, a non-relativistic theory whose modified Poisson equation contains the scalar field $\varphi$ that provides the gravitational boost required to describe the dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters without dark matter. In a flat, matter-dominated, homogeneous and isotropic universe the same scalar field $\varphi$ drives the accelerated expansion of the universe and describes the observed redshift evolution of the Hubble-Lemaître parameter $H(z)$. However, in the equation of the growth factor of the linear perturbation theory, the form of $V(\varphi)$ makes the coefficient of the source of the gravitational field proportional to $H^{-1}(z)$; therefore the gravitational field is strongly suppressed at early times and structure formation is delayed to redshift $z&lt; 1$, in disagreement with the observation of formed galaxies at much larger redshifts. In addition, the form of $W(\varphi)$ and a linear $V(\varphi)$ imply that $\varphi$ generates twice the gravitational boost on massive particles than on photons, with possible observable consequences on the gravitational lensing phenomenon. It remains to be investigated whether different choices of $W(\varphi)$ and $V(\varphi)$, that can still make the theory reduce to Refracted Gravity in the weak-field limit, might alleviate these problems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22991" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seeds of supermassive black holes in general relativistic and alternative cosmologies: Implications of massive seeds</a><span class="id">[2601.22991]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with mass $(10^{6}-10^{9}) M_{\odot}$ at $z = 10$ has been recently revealed by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. In this study we generate seeds for the above range of SMBHs in various background cosmologies. We consider cosmic timescales required for black hole growth provided by three general relativistic cosmological models ($\Lambda$CDM, $\omega$CDM and Dynamical Dark Energy(DDE) and the braneworld cosmology. The growth of SMBHs is studied through Eddington limited and super-Eddington accretion, where the accretion starts at z=30. It is found that growth of SMBHs by z=10 within Eddington limited accretion is possible through massive seeds $(M\geq10^{4}M_{\odot})$ in all cosmologies. Super Eddington accretion onto spinning black holes with mass of few tens of solar masses can result in SMBHs by z=10 in all cosmologies. The viable cosmologies considered here are found to be unable to strongly distinguish between the seed black hole masses. The seeds generated in this work are assumed to be of primordial origin in order to satisfy the criteria of formation of high redshift massive galaxies. The fraction of primordial black holes (PBHs) contributing to dark matter ($f_{PBH}$) and their corresponding number densities for the mass range ($10^{5}-10^{8}$) $M_{\odot}$ are calculated in both seed effect and Poisson effect. In seed effect, PBHs of mass $\geq 10^{7} M_{\odot}$ contributes $\leq 10^{-2}$ to the dark matter fraction. The evolution of gas mass inside a PBH seeded dark matter halo is studied. The ratio of black hole to stellar mass is also evaluated for star formation efficiency in the range (0.1-1) and found to be ($10^{-3}-1$) for $M_{BH}=10^{8} M_{\odot}$ and ($10^{-2}-10$) for $M_{BH}=10^{9} M_{\odot}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stereoscopic Observations of Solar X-ray Sources Explained by a Data-Constrained Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation</a><span class="id">[2601.23046]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigated the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic structures and dynamics responsible for particle acceleration in an X7.1-class flare that occurred on October 1, 2024, in NOAA active region 13842.

During the two main peaks of the impulsive phase, HXR footpoints appeared at different locations, indicating a migration of the primary reconnection site in the corona. Our data-constrained MHD simulation successfully reproduced the reconnected field lines linking the observed conjugate HXR footpoints. Furthermore, the simulation shows that these primary reconnections occur along a single quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) system. Therefore, the two main peaks of HXR can be interpreted as episodic energy release within the single QSL system. This study demonstrates that the data-constrained MHD model provides a realistic 3D magnetic context for interpreting HXR emission. Notably, STIX observations revealed a vertically distributed thermal HXR source, extending from the footpoints to the looptop, with its centroid migrating between the two peaks. This marks a first step toward understanding the particle acceleration processes in solar flares.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries.

Here, we propose a novel method to determine the immiscibility boundary accurately without the need for free energy calculations, while providing consistent insights into structural and transport properties of mixtures. We show with direct large-scale ab initio simulations that the insulator-metal transition (IMT) of the hydrogen subsystem is strongly affected by an admixture with a small fraction of helium and occurs at temperatures significantly higher than those of pure hydrogen. At pressures below 150 GPa, the IMT boundary is not related anymore to the H2 subsystem dissociation, the system remains insulating even after the full dissociation of H2 molecules and its transition to an H-He mixture. The offset of the IMT in the H-He mixture relative to the dissociation region in the hydrogen subsystem and the significant reduction of static electrical and thermal conductivity by a factor between two and a few thousand relative to pure hydrogen found in mixtures have consequences for Jupiter and Saturn's thermal evolution, internal structure, and dynamo action, affecting a large fraction of the interior of both planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunspot simulations with MURaM – I.

Existing sunspot simulations fail to reproduce the observed magnetic field distribution due to an artificially increased $B_{hor}$ at the upper boundary. Aims. We explore alternative ways to better reproduce the magnetic and dynamic properties of observed sunspots. Methods. We use the radiative MHD code MURaM. As initial conditions, we placed a potential magnetic field into small-scale dynamo simulations and used potential-field extrapolation at the top. Results. We find that: (1) Simulations with increasing initial magnetic field strengths (20, 40, 80, and 160 kG) show larger spots, umbrae, and penumbrae. (2) The penumbral-to-spot sizes are smaller than those measured in observed sunspots. (3) In none of the runs are pure Evershed (radially outward) flows. Instead, bi-directional flows with inflows in the inner penumbra and outflows in the outer penumbra were measured, similar to early observations of penumbra formation for runs with $\ge80$ kG at 96/32 km resolution, whereas runs with 40 kG or less showed pure inflows. (4) Simulations with 160 kG at 32/16 km resolution contain filaments with bi-directional and Evershed flows. (5) Simulations with fluxes $&gt;10^{22}$ Mx show unrealistically strong fields in the umbra. (6) The best runs with 160 kG and $10^{22}$ Mx give realistic radial profiles of $B_z$ and $B_r$, although stronger fields than observed. (7) Increasing the width of the box and reducing the overall flux by subtracting a uniform opposing vertical field have little influence on internal spot dynamics and fields, but change the mean vertical field outside the spot. Conclusions. Simulations of small ($10^{22}$) sunspots with an initial potential field and intensified bottom magnetic field strength best reproduce observations of the initial stages of sunspot formation. Numerical resolution may be critical for achieving fully developed penumbrae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Human versus Artificial Inteligence; a significant example in astrophysics, alas</a><span class="id">[2601.23205]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There are two well documented models of gamma ray bursts (GRBs), the &quot;Standard' model and the &quot;Cannonball&quot; model.

JWST observations suggest a carbon-dominated atmosphere (CO$_2$/CO) over a global magma ocean ($&gt;$3000 K). We suggest that any CO$_2$-dominated atmosphere, with trace H$_2$O/O$_2$, likely arises from outgassing of its initial volatile reservoir. As solidification drives the magma ocean and atmosphere away from solution-equilibrium, tidal and greenhouse heating can prolong outgassing. Early atmosphere outgassing reflects rapid degassing of the volatile-saturated melt during post-formation cooling. Without tidal heating, an initial 5 wt% water mass fraction ($F_{\text{H}_2\text{O}}$) or 3 wt% $\text{CO}_2$ mass fraction ($F_{\text{CO}_2}$) can sustain outgassing for at least $\sim$10 Myr. With both at 10 wt%, greenhouse warming alone can prolong outgassing up to $\sim$30 Myr. Our model shows that tidal heating can reduce the volatile threshold required to maintain a high surface temperature ($\sim$3200 K at $e = 0.005$) and delay outgassing of additional volatiles to the present-day. However, higher tidal heating presents a tradeoff between prolonging tenuous outgassing and enlarging the overall size of the secondary atmosphere. Tidally-enhanced outgassing may produce minor pressure variations that could contribute to the observed phase-curve variability. Additionally, our model shows that tidal heating strongly controls outgassing in the planet's young-to-midlife stage, then shifts toward a volatile inventory dependence at mature ages. Using 55 Cnc e, we present a framework to prioritize atmosphere detections on rocky ultra short period (USP) magma ocean planets, linking age-dependent tidal heating and volatile inventory to the formation and size of secondary atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">When inflationary perturbations refuse to classicalise: the role of non-Gaussianity in Wigner negativity</a><span class="id">[2601.22219]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inflationary perturbations are quantum in origin. Yet, when computing cosmological observables, they are often treated as classical stochastic fields. Do they nevertheless retain quantum birthmarks? A hallmark of genuinely quantum behaviour is quantum interferences, arising from phase coherence between distinct branches of the wavefunction. Such interference is diagnosed by the non-positivity of the Wigner function, and according to Hudson's theorem, the only pure states with positive Wigner functions are Gaussian states. Consequently, any departure from Gaussianity necessarily implies a non-positive Wigner function, precluding a description in terms of a classical distribution. This motivates us to compute the Wigner function of curvature perturbations, accounting for primordial non-Gaussianities, using the EFT of inflation. We find that the Wigner function develops pronounced interference fringes on super-Hubble scales, and in particular, its negativity grows as $a^2$ in ultra-slow-roll backgrounds. These results demonstrate that quantum effects can remain significant at late times, and that squeezing alone does not ensure classicality, contrary to standard lore. This suggests that the prospects for detecting genuinely quantum signatures of the universe's origins in cosmological observables may be less bleak than previously thought.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22221" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axions on a Hyperbolic Ride: Geometric Suppression of CMB Isocurvature and a Blue-Tilted Spectrum</a><span class="id">[2601.22221]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>CMB limits on cold-dark-matter isocurvature are often interpreted as excluding the simultaneous realization of high-scale inflation and large QCD axion decay constants in pre-inflationary Peccei–Quinn (PQ) scenarios. We show that this conclusion can be evaded by exploiting \emph{field-space geometry}. For a minimal complex PQ scalar with a $U(1)$-symmetric potential and nonlinear sigma-model kinetic term $d\sigma^{2}=dR^{2}+f^{2}(R)\,d\theta^{2}$, a curved target-space metric endows the axion fluctuation with a time-dependent geometric mass during inflation, suppressing isocurvature without explicit PQ breaking and without extreme radial displacements. Specializing to a hyperbolic metric $f(R)=L\sinh(R/L)$ with curvature scale $L$, we find that for $R\gtrsim L$ the canonically normalized angular mode can be generically $\mathcal{O}(H_{\rm inf})$-heavy during radial slow-roll, dynamically damping CMB-scale fluctuations while producing a characteristic blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum. As a result, inflationary Hubble scales as large as $H_{\rm inf}\sim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ can be compatible with $f_a\sim 10^{14}$–$10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, reopening parameter space usually regarded as excluded.

Using post-Newtonian relations between the mass M (including the binding energy) and angular momentum J of quasi-circular, nonspinning binaries, we uncover a puzzling result: When the binary's instantaneous M and J are mapped to those of a hypothetical Kerr black hole, the corresponding entropy exhibits a maximum during the evolution. This maximum occurs at values of M and J strikingly close to those of the final remnant predicted by numerical relativity. Consistent behavior is observed when using the relation between M and J obtained from numerical relativity evolution. Although this procedure is somewhat ad hoc, the agreement between the masses and spins of the final state obtained from numerical relativity and the results of this maximum entropy procedure is remarkable, with agreement to within a few percent when using either post-Newtonian or numerical relativity results for M and J. These findings allow us to propose an entropy maximization conjecture for binary black hole mergers, hinting that thermodynamic principles may govern the selection of the final black hole state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpting of Martian brain terrain reveals the drying of ancient Mars</a><span class="id">[2601.22606]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Martian brain terrain (MBT), characterized by its unique brain-like morphology, is a potential geological archive for finding hints of paleoclimatic conditions during its formation period. The morphological similarity of MBT to self-organized patterned ground on Earth suggests a shared formation mechanism. However, the lack of quantitative descriptions and robust physical modeling of self-organized stone transport jointly limits the study of the thermal and aqueous conditions governing MBT's formation. Here we established a specialized quantitative system for extracting the morphological features of MBT, taking a typical region located in the northern Arabia Terra as an example, and then employed a numerical model to investigate its formation mechanisms. Our simulation results accurately replicate the observed morphology of MBT, matching its key geometric metrics with deviations $&lt;10\%$. Crucially, however, we find that the self-organized transport can solely produce relief $&lt;0.5$ m, insufficient to explain the formation of MBT with average relief of $3.29 \pm 0.65$ m. We attribute this discrepancy to sculpting driven by late-stage sublimation, constraining cumulative subsurface ice loss in this region to $\sim 3$ meters over the past $\sim 3$ Ma. These findings demonstrate that MBT's formation is a multi-stage process: initial patterning driven by freeze-thaw cycles (implying liquid water) followed by vertical sculpting via sublimation (requiring a dry environment). This evolution provides physical evidence for the transition of the ancient Martian climate from a wetter period to a colder hyper-arid state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonlocal Corrections to Scalar Field Effective Action in de Sitter spacetime</a><span class="id">[2601.22644]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the one-loop effective action for a test scalar field in a general Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background, specifically focusing on quantum corrections up to the second order in the interaction strength. By employing the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we derive the equation of motion for the field expectation value, which incorporates not only the standard local radiative corrections but also novel nonlocal features: a memory term and a stochastic noise term. We identify all ultraviolet divergent structures within these nonlocal terms and provide a consistent renormalization procedure. To analyze the physical impact of these terms, we apply a local approximation under the assumption of slowly-varying fields, by which the memory term acts as a negative contribution to the drift coefficient. As a concrete application, we consider a massive $\phi^4$ theory and show that these one-loop corrections lead to a suppression of the field variance in the infrared regime compared to the tree-level results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22914" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exact black holes and black branes with bumpy horizons supported by superfluid pions</a><span class="id">[2601.22914]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present exact solutions of the Einstein-$SU(2)$ non-linear sigma model in $3+1$ spacetime dimensions, describing bumpy black holes and black branes.

These solutions describe horizons of different constant curvatures, with nontrivial bumpy geometries protected by an integer topological invariant, namely the vorticity, which also controls the number of bumps and the black hole thermodynamics.

How density fluctuations explain the Mach number discrepancy, microgauss magnetic fields, and spectral index variations</a><span class="id">[2411.11947]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is generally accepted that radio relics are the result of synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated electrons. Current models, however, are still unable to explain several aspects of their formation. In this paper, we focus on three outstanding problems: i) Mach number estimates derived from radio data do not agree with those derived from X-ray data, ii) cooling length arguments imply a magnetic field that is at least an order of magnitude larger than the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM), and iii) spectral index variations do not agree with standard cooling models. To solve these problems, we first identify typical shock conditions in cosmological simulations, using the results to inform significantly higher resolution shock-tube simulations. We apply the cosmic ray electron spectra code CREST and the emission code CRAYON+ to these, thereby generating mock observables ab-initio. We identify that upon running into an accretion shock, merger shocks generate a shock-compressed sheet, which, in turn, runs into upstream density fluctuations in pressure equilibrium. This mechanism directly gives rise to solutions to the three problems: it creates a distribution of Mach numbers at the shock-front, which flattens cosmic ray electron spectra, thereby biasing radio-derived Mach number estimates to higher values. We show that this effect is particularly strong in weaker shocks. Secondly, the density sheet becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable at the contact discontinuity, causing turbulence and additional compression downstream. This amplifies the magnetic field from ICM-like conditions up to microgauss levels. We show that synchrotron-based measurements are strongly biased by the tail of the distribution here too. Finally, the same instability also breaks the common assumption that matter is advected at the post-shock velocity downstream, thus invalidating laminar-flow based cooling models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possible evidence for extended X-ray emission surrounding PSR B0656+14 with eROSITA</a><span class="id">[2501.17046]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extended very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from middle-aged pulsars as revealed recently by several groundbased $\gamma$-ray experiments has strong implication on the transport of high-energy particles in the interstellar medium surrounding those pulsars. The $\gamma$-ray emission is widely believed to be produced by high-energy electrons and positrons accelerated by the pulsar wind nebulae when scattering off the interstellar radiation field via the inverse Compton process. Consequently, multiwavelength counterparts of the $\gamma$-ray halos are expected to be present, which have not yet been detected. In this work we report the possible detection of extended X-ray emission from a $\sim 0.2\degr$ radius region around PSR B0656+14 with eROSITA. In spite that there are uncertainties of the on-orbit point spread function of the pointing mode, the radial profile of PSR B0656+14 is found to be broader than that of a star at similar observational conditions, indicating that emission is possibly from the expected extended halo around the pulsar. The spectrum of the emission can be described by a power-law function with an index of $\sim3.7$. Its surface brightness declines with radius faster than the prediction of the particle diffusion and synchrotron radiation in a uniform magnetic field, suggesting the existence of a radial gradient of the magnetic field strength as $\sim r^{-1}$. The magnetic field strength in the X-ray emitting region is constrained to be $4-10~\mu$G.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J-PAS and PFS surveys in the era of dark energy and neutrino mass measurements</a><span class="id">[2505.04275]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fisher-matrix forecasts are presented for the cosmological surveys of the Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) and the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS).

Adding the joint J-PAS+PFS data to next-generation CMB measurements from the Simons Observatory (SO) and \textsc{LiteBird} yields an expected precision of $\sigma(\sum m_\nu)=0.017\,$eV in the $\Lambda$CDM$+\sum m_\nu+N_{\rm eff}$ framework, sufficient to disfavour the inverted neutrino hierarchy at $2.34\,\sigma$ if the true mass sum equals the normal-ordering minimum. Motivated by recent DESI results, we also forecast within a $w_0w_a$CDM$+\sum m_\nu+N_{\rm eff}$ cosmology, adopting the DESI DR2 best-fit values ($w_0=-0.758$, $w_a=-0.82$) as fiducial. The combination CMB+J-PAS+PFS then delivers $\sigma(w_0)=0.044$ and $\sigma(w_a)=0.18$, corresponding to a $5.1\,\sigma$ preference for a time-varying dark-energy equation of state.

It is particularly challenging to reconstruct sub-100 GeV events with the IceCube detectors due to the relatively sparse detection units and detection medium. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are broadly used in physics experiments for both classification and regression purposes.

A key assumption within the halo bias approximation of the halo model is that, on sufficiently large scales, the halo bias between two halo populations is a separable function of the mass of each population. In this work, we test the validity of this approximation on quasi-linear scales using both simulations and observational data across a broad range of halo masses and redshifts. In particular, we define a separability function based on halo or galaxy cross-correlations to quantify deviations from halo bias separability, and measure it from N-body simulations. We find significant departures from separability on quasi-linear scales (\(\sim 1\text{--}5\,\mathrm{Mpc}\)) at high redshifts (\(z \geq 3\)), leading to a suppression in the scale-dependent halo bias and hence in halo cross-correlations by up to a factor of 2 – or even higher. In contrast, deviations at low redshifts remain modest. Additionally, using high-redshift (\(z \sim 3.6\)) galaxy samples, we detect deviations from bias separability that closely align with simulation predictions. The breakdown of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear scales at high redshifts underscore the importance to account for non-separability in models of the galaxy-halo connection in this regime. Furthermore, these results highlight the potential of high-redshift galaxy cross-correlations as a probe for improving the galaxy-halo connection from upcoming large-scale surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure for Mixed Dark Matter Scenarios</a><span class="id">[2507.08792]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We initiate a systematic study of the perturbative nonlinear dynamics of cosmological fluctuations in dark sectors comprising a fraction of non-cold dark matter, for example ultra-light axions or light thermal relics. These mixed dark matter scenarios exhibit suppressed growth of perturbations below a characteristic, cosmologically relevant, scale associated with the microscopic nature of the non-cold species. As a consequence, the scale-free nonlinear solutions developed for pure cold dark matter and for massive neutrinos do not, in general, apply. We thus extend the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure to model the coupled fluctuations of the cold and non-cold dark matter components, describing the latter as a perfect fluid with finite sound speed at linear level. We provide new analytical solutions wherever possible and devise an accurate and computationally tractable prescription for the evaluation of the one-loop galaxy power spectrum, which can be applied to probe mixed dark matter scenarios with current and upcoming galaxy survey data. As a first application of this framework, we derive updated constraints on the energy density in ultra-light axions using a combination of Planck and BOSS data. Our refined theoretical modeling leads to somewhat weaker bounds compared to previous analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phantom crossing or dark interaction?</a><span class="id">[2507.18274]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent results from DESI BAO measurements, together with Planck CMB and Pantheon+ data, suggest that there may be a `phantom' phase ($w_{\rm de}&lt;-1$) in the expansion of the Universe. This inference follows when the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$ is used to fit the data. Since phantom dark energy in general relativity is unphysical, we investigate the possibility that the phantom behaviour is not intrinsic, but effective – due to a non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and non-phantom dark energy. To this end, we assume a physically motivated thawing quintessence-like form of the intrinsic dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$. Then we use a $w_0, w_a$ model for the \emph{effective} equation of state of dark energy. We find that the data favours a phantom crossing for the effective dark energy, but only at low significance. The intrinsic equation of state of dark energy is non-phantom, without imposing any non-phantom priors. A nonzero interaction is favoured at more than $3\sigma$ at $z\sim0.3$. The energy flows from dark matter to dark energy at early times and reverses at later times.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lense-Thirring precession of neutron-star accretion flows: Relativistic versus classical precession</a><span class="id">[2508.13777]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The vertical (Lense-Thirring) precession of the innermost accretion flows has been discussed as a sensitive indicator of the rotational properties of neutron stars (NSs) and their equation of state because it vanishes for a non-rotating star. In this work, we apply the Hartle-Thorne spacetimes to study the frequencies of the precession for both geodesic and non-geodesic (fluid) flows. We build on previous findings on the effect of the NS quadrupole moment, which revealed the importance of the interplay between the relativistic and classical precession. Because of this interplay, the widely used Lense-Thirring metric, linear in the NS angular momentum, is insufficient to calculate the behaviour of the precession frequency across an astrophysically relevant range of NS angular momentum values. We find that even for a moderately oblate NSs, the dependencies of the precession frequency on the NS angular momentum at radii within the innermost accretion region have maxima that occur at relatively low values of the NS angular momentum. We conclude that very different groups of accreting NSs – slow and fast rotators – can display the same precession frequencies. This may explain the lack of evidence for a correlation between the frequencies of the observed low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations and the NS spin. In our work, we provide a full, general description of precession behaviour, and also examples that assume specific NS and quark star (MIT bag) equation of state. Our calculations are reproducible using the associated Wolfram Mathematica notebook.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Degeneracy in DESI DR2: Interacting or Evolving Dark Energy?</a><span class="id">[2508.17955]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, despite its success, is challenged by persistent observational tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($S_8$), motivating the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios. We investigate a dark energy model with a phenomenological interaction in the dark sector, constructed to be exactly degenerate at the background level with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. This setup allows us to test whether models with identical expansion histories but distinct physical mechanisms can be distinguished by cosmological data. We perform a Bayesian analysis using a combination of recent datasets: DESI DR2 BAO measurements, DESY5 supernovae, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that both the interacting model and the CPL model provide significantly better fits to the data than $\Lambda$CDM. Although indistinguishable in background observables, the interacting model predicts a distinct matter-sector evolution driven by a late-time sign change in the dark sector interaction at $z \approx 0.8$, corresponding to the $w=-1$ crossing in the CPL description. In this sense, the interacting picture may be considered more physical, since it avoids the problematic crossing by construction. The resulting decay of dark energy into dark matter lowers $S_8$, potentially alleviating the weak-lensing $S_8$ tension. At the same time, it predicts a sharp suppression of the growth rate $f\sigma_8(z)$ at $z \lesssim 0.8$, which is in tension with current measurements of structure formation. This indicates that the model may not simultaneously reconcile the expansion history and the observed growth of cosmic structure, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis to fully assess its viability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An improved model for the effect of correlated Si-III absorption on the one-dimensional Lyman-$α$ forest power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2509.08613]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an analysis of Si III absorption and its effect on the 1D Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum using the Sherwood-Relics hydrodynamical simulation suite.

We therefore develop a new analytical fitting function that captures two critical effects that have previously been neglected: distinct Ly$\alpha$ and Si III line profiles, and a variable ratio for coeval Ly$\alpha$ and Si III optical depths. In contrast to earlier work, we also predict amplitudes for the Si III power spectrum and Ly$\alpha$–Si III cross power spectrum that decrease toward lower redshift due to the hardening metagalactic UV background spectrum at $z\lesssim 3.5$. The fitting function is validated by comparison against multiple simulated datasets at redshifts $2.2\leq z \leq 5.0$ and wavenumbers $k &lt; 0.2\rm\,s\,km^{-1}$.

Previous simulations have already suggested a resistive dependence of inverse transfer rates and demonstrated the significant influence of magnetic helicity flux density $\epsilon_\mathrm{H}$ on this process. On dimensional grounds, we have $E_\mathrm{M}(k,t)=C_\mathrm{H} \epsilon_\mathrm{H}^{2/3} k^{-1}$ where $C_\mathrm{H}$ represents a potentially universal dimensionless coefficient analogous to the Kolmogorov constant.

A scenario in which nearly all of the primordial resonant chains undergo dynamical instabilities and collisions has previously been found to closely match many features of the observed planet sample. However, existing models have not been tested against new observations that show a steep decline in the resonant fraction as a function of stellar age on a timescale of  100 Myr. We construct a simplified model incorporating Type I migration, growth from embryos, and N-body integrations continued to 500 Myr and use it to generate a synthetic planet population. Nearly all systems exit the disk phase in a resonant configuration but begin slowly diffusing away from the center of the resonance. Dynamical instabilities can arise on timescales of tens or hundreds of Myr, especially when systems formed in disks with a convergent migration trap. In this case, a secondary chain of smaller planets that remained at their birth location eventually breaks, destabilizing the inner resonant chain. We also show that the instability statistics are well modeled by a Weibull distribution, and use this to extrapolate our population to Gyr ages. The close match of our modeled systems to the observed population implies that the high resonance fraction predicted by this class of models is in fact consistent with the data, and the previously-reported overabundance of resonant systems was a consequence of comparing simulations of early evolution to mature Gyr-old systems. This result also suggests that instabilities triggered by disk dissipation or other very early mechanisms are unlikely to be consistent with observed young systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sequential Fragmentation of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) After Its Near-Sun Passage</a><span class="id">[2511.19707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) reached perihelion at 0.33 au on 2025 October 8.

Serendipitous HST/STIS acquisition images obtained on November 8-10 captured the comet only days after this event and resolved five fragments, providing an early high-resolution view of a nucleus in the process of disruption. Fragment motions and morphologies indicate a hierarchical fragmentation sequence, including a slow secondary split of fragment II. Back extrapolation shows that both the primary and secondary breakups preceded their associated photometric outbursts by roughly one to three days. This consistent lag, together with the appearance of thin, short-lived arclets around fragment I in the first HST epoch, suggests that freshly exposed interior material warms rapidly but requires time before dust can be released efficiently. Given the comet's close perihelion passage, rotational instability driven by enhanced outgassing torques is a plausible contributor to nucleus disintegration and dust release, and may represent the primary source of the observed brightening. These combined ground- and space-based observations provide rare, time-resolved constraints on the thermal and structural evolution of a fragmented comet near perihelion and highlight the scientific value of capturing a nucleus within days of disruption, when thermal adjustment, dust mantle re-formation, and outgassing-driven torques jointly govern the onset of activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defects and Inconsistencies in Solar Flare Data Sources: Implications for Machine Learning Forecasting</a><span class="id">[2512.13417]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Machine learning models for forecasting solar flares have been trained and evaluated using a variety of data sources, including Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) operational and science-quality data. Typically, data from these sources is minimally processed before being used to train and validate a forecasting model. However, predictive performance can be affected if defects and inconsistencies between these data sources are ignored. For a set of commonly used data sources, along with the software that queries and outputs processed data, we identify their defects and inconsistencies, quantify their extent, and show how they can affect predictions from data-driven machine-learning forecasting models. We also outline procedures for fixing these issues or at least mitigating their impacts. Finally, based on thorough comparisons of the effects of data sources on the trained forecasting model's predictive skill scores, we offer recommendations for using different data products in operational forecasting.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tales of stellar and binary co-evolution, told by stellar oscillations – Binary demographics and their impact on stellar mass, orbits, and age estimates in main-sequence and red-giant stars</a><span class="id">[2512.13581]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Red giants are increasingly used as stellar population tracers due to their well-understood evolution and the availability of asteroseismic observables. However, stellar binarity can alter observable properties and introduce strong biases. We aim to provide a holistic picture of the binary population and its evolution in the red giant phase by characterizing a sample of binaries hosting oscillating red giants from a combination of extensive asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and astrometric surveys. We investigate the binary properties of evolved stars in the APOKASC3 and APO-K2 catalogs, leveraging asteroseismic constraints and Gaia DR3 non-single-star solutions. We explore the mass distribution of red-giant binary systems and analyze the evolution of their binary fraction. For stars with M$\leq$1.8M$_\odot$, we find binary fractions $\sim$31% and $\sim$41% for oscillating and non-oscillating solar-like stars on the main-sequence (MS). By the power excess ($\nu_\mathrm{max}$) as luminosity proxy, we detect a binary attrition of $\sim$69% and $\sim$81% on the low- and high-luminosity red-giant branch (RGB) and an additional $\sim$38% to the red clump (RC), with respect to the MS. Binaries hosting RC and secondary clump stars (2RC) stars are largely depleted at $P_\mathrm{orb}\lesssim$500 and $\lesssim$200 days, respectively. Mass-dependent differences in binary fractions and orbital properties point to more substantial binary attrition for stars with M $\leq$1.8 M$_\odot$. The distinct mass distributions and the depletion of short-period binaries during the red-giant phase underscore the impact of stellar expansion and binary interactions on stellar evolution. RC systems with $P_\mathrm{orb}\lesssim$800 to 1,000 days are likely shaped by past interactions, such as mass transfer or loss, which can lead to significantly biased age estimates if not accounted for.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Comprehensive Interpretation of Fermi-LAT Pulsars: Fundamental-Plane Death Border, Visibility Thresholds, and GeV-TeV Unification</a><span class="id">[2512.15065]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a framework that links equatorial-current-sheet (ECS) physics to catalog-level, phase-averaged gamma-ray pulsar properties. Guided by analytic scalings and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we show that the pulsar “Fundamental Plane” (relating gamma-ray luminosity, spectral cutoff energy, spin-down power $\dot{\cal{E}}$, and surface magnetic field) is bounded by two regimes: a radiation-reaction-limited branch and a potential-drop-limited branch. Their intersection defines a transition in $\dot{\cal{E}}$ that maps to a gamma-ray visibility threshold on the $P-\dot{P}$ diagram, above which detectability is set by distance and beaming, and below which both cutoff energy and efficiency decline rapidly. Placing ATNF pulsars and McGill magnetars onto these planes reproduces the observed Fermi occupancy, with millisecond pulsars (MSPs) on the observable side, young pulsars (YPs) straddling the threshold, and magnetars clustering at or just below it. At higher $\dot{\cal{E}}$, both MSPs and YPs depart from the maximal radiation-reaction-limited envelope at similar cutoff energies, suggesting that enhanced pair creation screens the accelerating electric field in the ECS. We interpret this behavior with a compactness-based criterion for optically thin $\gamma\gamma$ pair feedback in or near the ECS and briefly note an extension to $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\mu^\pm$ that could yield pulsed multi-TeV neutrinos in the most energetic systems. The framework predicts a MeV-bright, GeV-faint corridor below Fermi sensitivity, a target for next-generation MeV missions. Finally, motivated by the recent HESSII detection of pulsed multi-TeV emission from Vela, we use PIC particle distributions with a seed-photon model to reproduce a multi-TeV inverse-Compton component alongside the GeV curvature emission, supporting a unified ECS-based GeV-TeV origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Dynamo Confinement Scenario for the Solar Tachocline and its Implications for Spin-down in the Radiative Spreading Regime</a><span class="id">[2601.11943]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>At the base of the Sun's convective zone, a narrow shear layer called the tachocline separates strong latitudinal differential rotation above from nearly rigid rotation in the radiative zone below. The observed thinness of the tachocline is a long-standing dynamical puzzle because the tachocline should have spread significantly due to inward-burrowing meridional circulation, also called &quot;radiative spreading.&quot; We recently presented the first pair of global simulations to reveal a statistically stationary tachocline confined against radiative spreading by the Maxwell stresses from the nonaxisymmetric modes of a dynamo, which penetrated into and below the tachocline through a novel magnetic skin effect. In the work presented here, we systematically examine how this &quot;dynamo confinement scenario&quot; works against radiative spreading in a suite of simulations as the governing parameters trend in the direction of the true solar regime. We find that as the stable stratification of the radiative zone is made progressively stronger, the dynamo cycles get longer, the magnetic field consequently penetrates deeper due to the skin effect, and the tachocline becomes more confined. Furthermore, these results have interesting consequences for solar spin-down. In all of our radiatively spreading simulations, the tachocline region spins down due to the burrowing circulation. Below the tachocline, the Maxwell stresses transmit this spin-down further to rigidify the deeper radiative zone. We thus speculate that, in addition to confining the tachocline, the dynamo may provide a pathway to communicate spin-down from the near-surface layers to the deep interior.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lensing without mixing: Probing Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations and other scale-dependent features in cosmic shear surveys</a><span class="id">[2601.19696]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Weak-gravitational lensing tends to wash out scale and time-dependent features of the clustering of matter, such as the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) which appear in the form of wiggles in the matter power spectrum but that disappear in the analogous lensing $C_\ell$. This is a direct consequence of lensing being a projected effect. In this paper, we demonstrate how the noise complexity – often deemed &quot;erasing the signal&quot; – induced by a particular de-projection technique, the Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform arXiv:1312.0430 , can be used to extract the BAO signal and non-gaussian aperture-mass-like properties at chosen physical scales. We take into account parts of the data vectors that should effectively be without cosmological signature and also introduce an additional re-weighting designed to specifically highlight clustering features – both at the probe (summary statistics) or map (amplitude of the field) level. We thus demonstrate why weak-gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure of the Universe, though only in a tomographic setting, does not erase scale and time-dependent features of the dynamics of matter, while providing a tool to effectively extract them from actual galaxy-shapes measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast variability and circular polarization of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser in G33.641$-$0.228</a><span class="id">[2601.20371]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 6.7 GHz methanol maser in a high-mass star-forming region G33.641$-$0.228 is known to exhibit burst-like flux variability due to an unknown mechanism. To investigate the burst mechanism, we conducted high-cadence flux and circular polarization monitoring observations, simultaneously using left- and right-hand circular polarizations. We found that the flux density increased and decreased on a short timescale of 0.3 d during a burst. We also found strong circular polarization, reaching up to 20\% in the component exhibiting the bursts. Circular polarization of 0–20\% was continuously observed from 2009 to 2016, even in the quiescent period. The polarization also varied on timescales of less than one day. When a burst occurred and the flux density increased, the circular polarization decreased to zero. To explain the observational properties of the flux variability and circular polarization, we propose a model in which an explosive event similar to a solar radio burst occurs on the line of sight behind the maser cloud, producing circularly polarized continuum emission due to gyro-synchrotron or gyro-resonance radiation, which is then amplified by the maser.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20808" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How well is the local Large Scale Structure of the Universe known?

Determining the local mass density and velocity distribution is the aim of the CosmicFlows project. An alternate approach is based on catalogs of galaxies, supplemented with some scheme for filling in for unseen galaxies. Here, we compare the density field proposed by Biteau (2021) with the quasi-linear density field of CosmicFlows2 (Hoffman et al. 2018) and the mean posterior field of CosmicFlows4 (Valade 2026). We find factor-two level differences in some regions and even greater in regions toward the Galactic center zone of avoidance (ZoA) (|l| &lt; 30°, |b| &lt; 20°) as filled by Biteau using &quot;cloning&quot;. Within 11 Mpc the density field is well-determined by the Local Volume catalog (Karachentsev et al. 2018) which Biteau directly incorporates; at larger distances, Biteau (2021) should not be used in the ZoA where &quot;galaxies&quot; are entirely fictitious but otherwise is to be preferred over CosmicFlows emphasizing the direction and integrated mass of structures; the radial distribution of mass in Biteau (2021) is less robust due to line-of-sight peculiar velocities. The angular positions of structures in CosmicFlows are sometimes not congruent with evidence in the galaxy catalog.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A redshift survey of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 2199 : No upturn of the faint-end slope of galaxy luminosity function</a><span class="id">[2601.21329]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We determine the galaxy luminosity function of cluster galaxies in the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 2199 (A2199), focusing on the faint-end slope down to $M_r \sim -14.5$. To achieve this, we augment the existing dataset by adding redshift data from our deep MMT/Hectospec survey and from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), significantly improving the spectroscopic completeness down to $r_{\mathrm{petro},0} = 20.8$ within the central $30^\prime$ region. The resulting luminosity function is well described by a Schechter function with a characteristic magnitude $M^* = -21.30 \pm 0.27$ and a faint-end slope $\alpha = -1.23 \pm 0.05$. This faint-end slope is consistent with those measured in the nearby Coma and Virgo clusters and in a cluster from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, and is slightly shallower than that of field galaxies. These findings indicate that the previously claimed steep faint-end upturn (with $\alpha \sim -2$) in nearby galaxy clusters is not supported. Instead, they indicate that environmental processes in dense cluster cores does not seem to trigger the formation or survival of low-mass galaxies, thereby preventing a steep faint-end upturn in the luminosity function.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Projective Transformations for Regularized Central-Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</a><span class="id">[2506.22681]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central-force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called &quot;projective decomposition&quot;. The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07621" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comparing Simulated and Observed Particle Energy Distributions through Magnetic Reconnection in Earth's Magnetotail</a><span class="id">[2509.07621]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic reconnection is an explosive process that accelerates particles to high energies in Earth's magnetosphere, offering a unique natural laboratory to study this phenomenon.

Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fitting NANOGrav 15-year data and ACT data with modified inflation in entropic cosmology</a><span class="id">[2510.20484]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent evidences of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) through Pulsar Time Array (PTA) observations hint towards an alternative inflationary scenario, compared to the usual inflation, for describing the early stage of the universe in order to be compatible with the PTA data. Moreover, currently the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO) refines the constraint on inflationary observables, compared to the only-Planck 2018 measurements. In the present work, we simultaneously address these two issues by incorporating certain modification during inflation over the usual inflationary scenario. Such modification amplifies the primordial tensor perturbation over the modes that are sensitive to the NANOGrav frequency region. For this purpose, we take the thermodynamic route of cosmology where the entropy of the apparent horizon is given by a generalized form of entropy that is able to generalize the other known form of horizon entropies for suitable representations.

Using a simple model we demonstrate the dependence on the spectrum of radiation emitted by strings. We then study the radiation emitted by perturbed straight strings paying particular attention to the difference between the overall phase of the field and the small perturbations about the string solution which are the axions. We find that a significant correction is required to be sure that one is analyzing the axions and not the self-field of the string. Typically this requires one to excise a sizeable region around the string - something which is not usually done in the case of numerical field theory simulations of string networks. We have measured the spectrum of radiation from these strings and find that it is compatible with an exponential, as predicted by the Nambu-like Kalb-Ramond action, and in particular is not a “hard” spectrum often found in string network simulations. We conclude by attempting to assess the uncertainties on relic density and find that this leads to a range of possible axion masses when compared to the measured density from the Cosmic Microwave Background, albeit that they are typically higher than what is predicted by the Initial Misalignment Mechanism. If the decay is via a “soft spectrum” from loops produced close to the backreaction scale we find that $m_{\rm a}\approx 160\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and a detection frequency $f\approx 38\,{\rm GHz}$. If axions are emitted directly by the string network, and we use emission spectra reported in field theory simulations, then $m_{\rm a}\approx 4\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and $f\approx 1\,{\rm GHz}$, however this increases to $m_a \approx 125\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and $f\approx 30\,{\rm GHz}$ using our spectra for the case of an oscillating string. In all scenarios there are significant remaining uncertainties that we delineate.</p></div></details></article></body>
