In this paper, we investigate the contributions of elastic distance measures for detecting patterns in the solar-flare dataset, SWAN-SF. We employ a simple $k$-medoids clustering algorithm to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced, high-dimensional distance metrics. Our results show that, despite thorough optimization, none of the elastic distances outperform Euclidean distance by a significant margin. We demonstrate that, although elastic measures have shown promise for univariate time series, when applied to the multivariate time series of SWAN-SF, characterized by the high stochasticity of solar activity, they effectively collapse to Euclidean distance. We conduct thousands of experiments and present both quantitative and qualitative evidence supporting this finding.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01883" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A continuous transition from Type-C Quasi Periodic Oscillations to the Heartbeat state in the Black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47</a><span class="id">[2511.01883]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a timing analysis of the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) 4U 1630-47 using AstroSat observations from 10-19 March 2023, for the first time capturing a rare and rapid transition in variability properties. Within less than a day, the source evolved from a type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) state, with centroid frequencies between 3-5 Hz, to the Heartbeat state, characterized by a broad peak in the power density spectrum at  25 mHz, corresponding to a  40 s modulation period. As the source evolved, it passed through a transition track where the QPO features weakened and ultimately disappeared in the Heartbeat state. In the hardness-intensity Diagram, the QPOs occur at higher hardness and lower intensity, followed by a brightening phase as the source moved towards the soft intermediate state, and finally reached the Heartbeat state through a transition towards lower hardness. In the power-color diagram, this transition is marked by a clear shift to a distinct region of power color space, separate from the range occupied by other observed states. This work establishes 4U 1630-47 as another system, apart from GRS 1915+105, where a continuous transition from QPO to Heartbeat state has been observed. Notably, 4U 1630-47 is the only system where the QPO is absent during the heartbeat state. This provides us with another probe to understand the physical mechanism governing this transition and the overall accretion mechanism in BHXRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimal strategies for continuous wave detection in pulsar timing arrays: Realistic pulsar noise and a gravitational wave background</a><span class="id">[2511.01919]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), such as those produced by supermassive binary black holes at subparsec separations. The incoherent superposition of GWs emitted by a cosmological population of these sources produces a gravitational wave background (GWB), while some individual sources may be resolvable as deterministic signals with slowly varying GW frequencies, which are often referred to as &quot;continuous waves&quot; (CWs). The Fp-statistic is a frequentist method of detecting these CWs. In this paper, we study how the presence of pulsar red noise and a GWB affect the Fp-statistic. We compare results when marginalizing over the red noise and using the maximum-likelihood values of the red noise, and find little difference between the two. We also present results of using the Fp-statistic to analyze the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set, where we find no evidence for CWs in agreement with the previously published Bayesian results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A short blanket for cosmology: the CMB lensing anomaly behind the preference for a negative neutrino mass</a><span class="id">[2511.01967]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent analyses combining cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) challenge particle physics constraints on the total neutrino mass, pointing to values smaller than the lower limit from neutrino oscillation experiments. To examine the impact of different CMB likelihoods from $\mathit{Planck}$, lensing potential measurements from $\mathit{Planck}$ and ACT, and BAO data from DESI, we introduce an effective neutrino mass parameter ($\sum \tilde{m}_{\nu}$) which is allowed to take negative values. We investigate its correlation with two extra parameters capturing the impact of gravitational lensing on the CMB: one controlling the smoothing of the peaks of the temperature and polarization power spectra; one rescaling the lensing potential amplitude. In this configuration, we infer $\sum \tilde{m}_{\nu}=-0.018^{+0.085}_{-0.089}~\text{eV}~(68\% ~\text{C.L.})$, which is fully consistent with the minimal value required by neutrino oscillation experiments. We attribute the apparent preference for negative neutrino masses to an excess of gravitational lensing detected by late-time cosmological probes compared to that inferred from $\mathit{Planck}$ CMB angular power spectra. We discuss implications in light of the DESI BAO measurements and the CMB lensing anomaly.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inferring the physics of protoplanetary disc evolution from the irradiated Cygnus OB2 region – A comparison of viscous and MHD wind-driven scenarios</a><span class="id">[2511.01972]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Our current understanding has crystallised around two possible evolution scenarios for protoplanetary discs (turbulent viscosity and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind-driven) - but which dominates remains uncertain. Our aims are twofold: Firstly, we investigate whether a single set of model parameters can reproduce the observational constraints of non-irradiated and irradiated discs. Secondly, we propose a novel approach to break degeneracies between the two evolution scenarios by studying the relation of stellar accretion rate and externally driven wind mass-loss rates, which evolve differently depending on the mechanism of angular momentum transport in the outer disc. We evolve synthetic populations of protoplanetary discs using 1D vertically integrated models for both viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution including both internal X-ray and external far ultraviolet (FUV) photoevaporation for both evolution scenarios. We investigate both weak and strong FUV field environments, where the strong FUV field is calculated based on an environment similar to the Cygnus OB2 association. While both scenarios are able to reproduce observational constraints, our simulations suggest that different parameters are needed for the angular momentum transport to explain disc lifetimes and disc mass - stellar accretion rate relation in weakly and strongly irradiated regions. We find that the predicted median disc radii are much larger in low FUV environments compared to Cygnus OB2, but also decreasing with time. In the viscous scenario, the median disc radius in a low FUV field environment is  100au larger than for the MHD wind-driven scenario. We further show that studying stellar accretion rates and externally driven wind mass-loss rates (provided that they can be isolated from internally driven winds; i.e. MHD wind) is indeed a promising way of disentangling the two evolution scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dust back-reaction on gas around planets modifies the cold thermal torque</a><span class="id">[2511.01973]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A nascent planet in a gas disk experiences radial migration due to the different torques which act on it. It has recently been shown that the torques produced by the gas and dust density variations around a non-accreting low-mass planet, the so-called cold thermal and dust streaming torques, can surpass each of the other torque components. We investigate how the total torque acting on the planet is affected by the presence of dust grains and their aerodynamic back-reaction on gas, while taking into account the cold thermal torque produced by thermal diffusion in the gas component. We perform high-resolution local and global three-dimensional two-fluid simulations within the pressureless-fluid dust approximation using the Fargo3D code. We explore the influence of different dust species parameterized by the Stokes number, focusing on non-accreting protoplanets with masses from one-third the mass of Mars to one Earth mass. The dust feedback has substantial impact on the asymmetry of the cold thermal lobes (which produce the cold thermal torque). However, the total torque is dominated by the dust torque when St $&gt;10^{-2}$. The dust torque becomes more negative over time due to the formation of dust lobes that resemble the cold thermal lobes that form in the gas component. Therefore, the dust streaming torque prevails over the cold thermal torque. On the other hand, when St $\leq10^{-2}$, the dust streaming torque is negligible and thus, the total torque on the planet comes from the gaseous component of the disk. Our results suggest that a planet embedded in a gas-dust disk may experience stagnant migration or inward runaway migration in regions of the protoplanetary disk where the dust is not fully coupled to the gas. However, this behaviour could change in regions with strong dust-gas coupling or in the inner transition region of the disk, where the cold thermal torque may become relevant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ExoplaNeT accRetion mOnitoring sPectroscopic surveY (ENTROPY) - II. Time series of Balmer line profiles of Delorme 1(AB)b</a><span class="id">[2511.01979]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accretion processes in the planetary-mass regime remain poorly constrained, yet they strongly influence planet formation, evolution, and the composition of circumplanetary disks (CPDs). We investigate the resolved Balmer hydrogen emission-line profiles and their variability in the  13Mjup, 30-45 Myr-old companion Delorme to constrain the underlying accretion mechanisms. Using VLT/UVES, we obtained 31 new epochs of high-resolution optical spectra (330-680 nm, R = 50,000), probing variability from hours to years. We analyze the shape and flux variability of hydrogen emission lines and compare them to two proposed origins: magnetospheric accretion funnels and localized accretion shocks. We detect Balmer lines from Halpha to H10 (6564-3799 AA) and a UV continuum excess, both indicative of ongoing accretion. All features are variable. The hydrogen lines decompose into two static components that vary only in flux. The broader velocity component correlates strongly with the UV excess and is qualitatively consistent with magnetospheric funnel models, but not with shock models. This component dominates the shape variability. The narrower component, which correlates less with the UV excess, is better matched by shock-emission models and drives most of the flux variability. Line fluxes show low variability on hour timescales but up to  100% over weeks, similar to T Tauri stars. Our findings support magnetospheric accretion as the origin of the broad component. The narrow component may arise from accretion shocks or chromospheric activity. Higher-cadence observations could reveal rotational modulations and help constrain the object's rotation period and accretion geometry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02037" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The complicated nature of the X-ray emission from the field of the strongly lensed hyperluminous infrared galaxy PJ1053+60 at z=3.549</a><span class="id">[2511.02037]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an analysis of XMM-Newton X-ray observations of PJ1053+60, a hyperluminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG) at z=3.549 that is strongly lensed by a foreground group at z=0.837. We also present GNIRS spectroscopy confirming the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the southwest of PJ1053+60 ($AGN_{SW}$) at $z_{SW}$ = 1.373 $\pm$ 0.006. Using this redshift prior, we decompose the X-ray spectrum of PJ1053+60 into $AGN_{SW}$ and high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) components from the HyLIRG. The HMXB component has an unusually high luminosity, $\sim$ 50 times higher than calibration derived from local galaxies, and a characteristic photon index likely too flat to be caused by high-mass X-ray binaries at rest frame energies above a few keV. Our 2-D spatial decomposition also suggests a similarly high X-ray HMXB luminosity, although the limited spatial resolution prevents meaningful morphological constraints on the component. We conclude that the enhanced X-ray emission may only be explained by the presence of another AGN ($AGN_{FG}$) embedded in the foreground group lensing the PJ1053+60 system. The presence of $AGN_{FG}$ is further supported by the detection of a point-like radio continuum source that coincides with the brightest group galaxy (BGG) of the foreground lens. Our study demonstrates the limited capability of current X-ray observatories while highlighting the need for higher angular resolution observations to definitively characterize the nature of X-ray emission in distant, strongly lensed HyLIRGs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plasma flow in force-free magnetospheres: two-fluid model near pulsars and black holes</a><span class="id">[2511.02057]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Force-free electrodynamics describes the electromagnetic field of the magnetically dominated plasma found near pulsars and active black holes, but gives no information about the underlying particles that ultimately produce the observable emission. Working in the two-fluid approximation, we show how particles can be &quot;painted on&quot; to a force-free solution as a function of boundary conditions that encode the particle output of &quot;gap regions&quot; where the force-free approximation does not hold. These boundary conditions also determine the leading parallel electric field in the entire magnetosphere. Our treatment holds in a general (possibly curved) spacetime and is phrased in language intrinsic to the 1+1 dimensional &quot;field sheet spacetimes&quot; experienced by particles stuck to magnetic field lines. Besides the new results, this provides an elegant formulation of some standard equations; for example, we show that the zero-gyroradius guiding center approximation is just the Lorentz force law on the field sheet. We derive a general perturbative method and apply it to pulsar and black hole magnetospheres with radial magnetic fields to produce fully analytic models that capture key features of the full problem. When applied to more realistic magnetic field configurations together with simulation-informed boundary conditions for the gap regions, this approach has the potential to provide global magnetosphere models without the need for global particle-in-cell simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02059" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Holes from Kinetic Preheating</a><span class="id">[2511.02059]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We demonstrate that violent kinetic preheating following inflation can lead to the formation of black holes in the early Universe. In $\alpha$-attractor models with derivative inflaton couplings, nonlinear amplification of field fluctuations drives large spacetime curvature and gravitational collapse shortly after inflation ends. Using fully general-relativistic lattice simulations, we find that these dynamics produce black holes with masses of order tens of grams at sub-horizon scales, without requiring large primordial curvature perturbations. Although such micro-black holes evaporate rapidly via Hawking radiation, their formation modifies the post-inflationary equation of state and their evaporation can successfully reheat the Universe before Big Bang nucleosynthesis. These results identify kinetic preheating as a new, efficient channel for black-hole production and establish a direct connection between inflationary symmetries and strong-gravity phenomena at reheating.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02067" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A JWST Transit of a Jupiter Analog I: Constraints on the Oblateness of Kepler-167e</a><span class="id">[2511.02067]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In October 2024 JWST observed a transit of Kepler-167e, a Jupiter-analog planet on a 1000+ day orbit. These observations, recorded over a long baseline of nearly 60 hours, were designed to search for signatures of planetary oblateness and/or exomoons comparable to Ganymede. In this first in a series of studies analyzing these data we report on constraints on Kepler-167e's oblateness. We explored a large grid of data reduction pipelines and modeling choices, including a new entirely independent reduction pipeline (&quot;katahdin&quot;) and two new treatments for limb darkening. We find that under a Bayesian model comparison framework the data are fit equally well by both spherical and oblate planet models, and that our ability to constrain the oblateness is negatively impacted by the influence of exposure-long trends. Using the most conservative of our posteriors, we place a 95% upper bound on the projected oblateness of $f&lt;0.097$, which corresponds to a rotation period of $P\geq7.11$ hours if the planet's spin axis is aligned with the sky plane. We note, however, that the final bound depends on the choice of reduction pipeline and systematics model, and that our suite of end-to-end analyses produced bounds as low as $f&lt;0.065$ at 95%. We conclude that leveraging JWST to make tighter constraints on planetary oblateness will require further investigation into mitigating exposure-long trends and correlated noise.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02068" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decoding the RVb Enigma of DF Cyg: Pulsations, Circumstellar Disks, and Post-RGB Evolution Revealed by Multi-Wavelength Observations</a><span class="id">[2511.02068]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This investigation integrates five decades of ground-based photometric data from the AAVSO, AFOEV, ASAS, ASAS-SN, and SuperWASP surveys with recently acquired TESS observations, conducting a multi-wavelength and multi-phase photometric analysis to elucidate the complex nature of DF Cyg. For the first time, we analyze approximately four years of Kepler data alongside TESS observations. Furthermore, TESS observations obtained in 120-second cadence mode, constitute the highest-precision photometric dataset for DF Cyg to date. By isolating long-term trends in the TESS data, we quantified short-term variations in the fundamental pulsation frequency and its integer harmonics. The two alternating short-term cycles in the TESS light curve facilitated the unambiguous identification of seven previously undetected integer harmonics of the fundamental frequency in the power spectrum, providing critical new insights into the star's complex pulsation dynamics. A periodogram analysis of the combined ground- and space-based datasets revealed approximately 35 frequencies linked to both long- and short-term variability mechanisms. Stellar parameters derived from Gaia DR3 data specifically, luminosity and radius estimates based on Type II Cepheid PL and PR relations demonstrate consistency with values obtained through SED modeling. Complementary high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of DF Cyg yielded atmospheric parameters of Teff = 4781 K, logg = 1.74 dex, and [FeH] = -0.07 dex, further constraining physical characteristics of the star. This synthesis of multi-epoch, multi-instrument data advances the understanding of pulsational behavior and evolutionary status in RV Tauri systems. Our findings highlight DF Cyg as a critical benchmark for its class, as its characteristics bridge the gap between post-RGB systems in the Magellanic Clouds and higher-luminosity post-AGB stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Correlation Between the Final Separation and Mass Ratio from Common Envelope Simulations</a><span class="id">[2511.02150]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Analytical models for common envelope evolution (CEE), particularly the energy formalism, are used in binary population synthesis to predict post-CEE configurations. This formalism is based on an efficiency parameter alpha, which relates the orbital energy released during CEE to that required to unbind the envelope of the giant. However, one of the main challenges is that CEE is a multiscale, multiphysics process. As a result, there may not be a universal value for alpha, or even a general expression. Using 13 3D simulations of CEE with RGBs (1 and 2 M$_\odot$ primary; four mass ratios; with and without corotation), we present an empirical linear correlation between the post-plunge-in separation and the mass ratio, normalized by the giant radius. This trend for the plunge-in phase of CEE persists across RGB, AGB, and supergiant simulations in the literature, even for partially bound envelopes. Therefore, alpha from simulations should not be used to predict the final separation, but rather as a diagnostic of whether sufficient orbital energy has been liberated to completely eject the envelope immediately after the radial plunge. If this condition is not met, further in-spiral is expected in later stages of CEE, which may explain why the final separation of post-CEE observations is generally smaller than those predicted by the linear fit. Our results reinforce the idea that a better description could emerge if CEE is treated as a sequence of distinct phases, rather than treating it as a single event governed by alpha.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measurement of angular cross-correlation between the cosmological dispersion measure and the thermal Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect</a><span class="id">[2511.02155]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dispersion measures (${\rm DMs}$) from fast radio bursts (FRBs) and the thermal Sunyaev–Zeldovich (tSZ) effect probe the free-electron density and pressure, respectively, in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the intervening galaxies and clusters. Their combination enables disentangling the gas density and temperature. In this work, we present the first detection of an angular cross-correlation between the ${\rm DMs}$ and the Compton $y$ parameter of the tSZ effect. The theoretical expectation is calculated using the halo model $\texttt{HMx}$, calibrated with hydrodynamic simulations. The observational cross-correlation is measured over angular separations of $1^\prime$–$1000^\prime$ using the ${\rm DMs}$ from $133$ localized FRBs and the $y$-maps from the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We detect a positive correlation with amplitudes of $\mathcal{A}=2.26 \pm 0.56$ ($4.0 \sigma$) for Planck and $\mathcal{A}=1.38 \pm 0.92$ ($1.5 \sigma$) for ACT, where $\mathcal{A}=1$ corresponds to the theoretical prediction of the Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Assuming an isothermal gas, the measured amplitude implies an average electron temperature of $\approx 2 \times 10^7 \, {\rm K}$. The correlation is highly sensitive to the matter clustering parameter $\sigma_8$, and its dependence on other cosmological and astrophysical parameters – such as the ionized fraction, the Hubble constant, and baryon feedback – differs from that of the ${\rm DM}$ alone. This suggests that future joint analyses of the ${\rm DMs}$ and the tSZ effect could help break degeneracies among these parameters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring One-point Statistics in HERA Phase I Data: Effects of Foregrounds and Systematics on Measuring One-Point Statistics</a><span class="id">[2511.02190]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Measuring one-point statistics in redshifted 21 cm intensity maps offers an opportunity to explore non-Gaussian features of the early universe. We assess the impact of instrumental effects on measurements made with the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) by forward modeling observational and simulation data. Using HERA Phase I observations over 94 nights, we examine the second (m2, variance) and third (m3) moments of images. We employ the DAYENU-filtering method for foreground removal and reduce simulated foreground residuals to 10% of the 21 cm signal residuals. In noiseless cosmological simulations, the amplitudes of one-point statistics measurements are significantly reduced by the instrument response and further reduced by wedge-filtering. Analyses with wedge-filtered observational data, along with expected noise simulations, show that systematics alter the probability distribution of the map pixels. Likelihood analysis based on the observational data shows m2 measurements disfavor the cold reionization model characterized by inefficient X-ray heating, in line with other power spectra measurements. Small signals in m3 due to the instrument response of the Phase I observation and wedge-filtering make it challenging to use these non-Gaussian statistics to explore model parameters. Forecasts with the full HERA array predict high signal-to-noise ratios for m2, m3, and S3 assuming no foregrounds, but wedge-filtering drastically reduces these ratios. This work demonstrates conclusively that a comprehensive understanding of instrumental effects on m2 and m3 is essential for their use as a cosmological probe, given their dependence on the underlying model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reconstruction of dark energy using DESI DR2</a><span class="id">[2511.02220]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using a model-independent Gaussian process (GP) method to reconstruct the dimensionless luminosity distance $D$ and its derivatives, we derive the evolution of the dimensionless Hubble parameter $E$, the deceleration parameter $q$, and the state parameter $w$ of dark energy. We utilize the PantheonPlus, SH0ES, and Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) data to derive the dimensionless luminosity distance $D$. Additionally, we employ observational $H(z)$ data (OHD) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) to obtain the first derivative of the dimensionless luminosity distance $D^{'}$. To obtain the reconstructed $D$ and $D^{'}$, we utilize the fiducial value from each dataset, with particular emphasis on the varying $H_0$. According to the reconstruction results obtained from PantheonPlus+SH0ES+GRB+OHD and PantheonPlus+SH0ES+GRB+OHD+DESI data, we find that $E$ are consistent with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model at a $2\sigma$ confidence level within the redshift range of $z&lt;2$.

This was followed by a 0.03\% Gd-loading in 2022, a phase referred to as SK-VII. We then conducted a DSNB search using 552.2 days of SK-VI data and 404.0 days of SK-VII data through September 2023. This analysis includes several new features, such as two new machine-learning neutron detection algorithms with Gd, an improved atmospheric background reduction technique, and two parallel statistical approaches. No significant excess over background predictions was found in a DSNB spectrum-independent analysis, and 90\% C.L. upper limits on the astrophysical electron anti-neutrino flux were set. Additionally, a spectral fitting result exhibited a $\sim1.2\sigma$ disagreement with a null DSNB hypothesis, comparable to a previous result from 5823 days of all SK pure water phases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic-type Love number differentiating quark stars from neutron stars</a><span class="id">[2511.02236]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The quark star (QS) is a hypothetical and yet undiscovered stellar object, and its existence would mark a paradigm shift in research on nuclear and quark matter. Although compactness is a well-known signature for distinguishing between two branches of QSs and neutron stars (NSs), some QSs can overlap with NSs in the radius-mass plane. To manifest their evident differences, we investigate the tidal properties of QSs and NSs. We then find that the magnetic-type Love number is a robust indicator for differentiating between QSs and NSs, whereas the electric-type one is insufficient when QSs and NSs have similar masses and radii. Finally, we show that gravitational waves from binary star mergers can be sensitive to differences between QSs and NSs to the detectable level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weak-Lensing Analysis of the Galaxy Cluster Abell 85: Constraints on the Merger Scenarios of Its Southern Subcluster</a><span class="id">[2511.02323]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Abell 85 is a nearby (z=0.055) galaxy cluster that hosts a sloshing cool core, a feature commonly reported in relaxed clusters. However, the presence of multiple past and ongoing mergers indicates that it is an active node within the Abell 85/87/89 complex. We present a weak gravitational lensing (WL) analysis using Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging data to understand its assembly history by investigating the dark matter components of the substructures. Our mass reconstruction resolves three substructures associated with the brightest cluster galaxy (main), the southern (S) subcluster, and the southwestern (SW) subcluster, with WL peak significances of $&gt; 6\sigma$, $&gt; 5\sigma$, and $&gt; 4\sigma$, respectively. The locations of these mass peaks are consistent with those of the member galaxies. We estimate the masses of the main cluster ($M_{200c,main} = 2.91 \pm 0.72 \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$) and the S subcluster ($M_{200c,S} = 1.23 \pm 0.52 \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$) by fitting a multi-halo Navarro-Frenk-White profile. This $\sim$2:1 mass ratio indicates that the system is undergoing a major merger that is actively shaping the current dynamical state of Abell 85. Incorporating X-ray observations, we discuss the merger phase of the S subcluster and further examine the star-forming activity along the putative filament extending southeast of Abell 85.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redshift-dependent Distance Duality Violation in Resolving Multidimensional Cosmic Tensions</a><span class="id">[2511.02357]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we investigate whether violations of the distance-duality relation (DDR) can resolve the multidimensional cosmic tensions characterized by the $H_0$ and $S_8$ discrepancies. Using the Fisher-bias formalism, we reconstruct minimal, data-driven $\eta(z)$ profiles that capture the late-time deviations required to reconcile early- and late-Universe calibrations. While a constant DDR offset preserves the Pantheon-inferred matter density $\Omega_m = 0.334 \pm 0.018$–leaving its inconsistency with the Planck best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model and weak-lensing surveys unresolved–a time-varying DDR substantially reduces cross-dataset inconsistencies and improves the global fit, yielding $\Delta\chi^2 \simeq -10$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM when the SH0ES prior is excluded. This result suggests that the $\Omega_m$ discrepancy may represent indirect evidence for a time-varying DDR. A hybrid scenario combining a time-dependent DDR with a phantom-like dark energy transition achieves the most consistent global reconciliation, reducing the tension with DES-Y3 measurements to below $2\sigma$. These findings indicate that a mild DDR violation, coupled with evolving dark energy, offers a coherent pathway toward jointly addressing the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data-driven Radiative Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations with the MURaM code: the Emerging Active Region Corona</a><span class="id">[2511.02362]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the application of the data-driven branch of the MURaM code, which follows the evolution of the actual active region over 4 days and reproduces many key coronal extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emission features seen in remote sensing observations. Radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations that account for sophisticated energy transport processes, such as those in the real corona, have been extended with the ability to use observations as time-dependent boundaries, such that the models follow the evolution of actual active regions. This opens the possibility of a one-to-one model of a target region over an extensive time period. We use a hybrid strategy that combines fast-evolving idealized zero-$\beta$ models that capture the evolution of the large-scale active region magnetic field over a long time period and sophisticated radiative MHD models for a shorter time period of interest. Synthesized EUV images illustrate the formation of coronal loops that connect the two sunspots or fan out to the domain boundary. The model reveals in three-dimensional space the finer structures in the coronal heating and plasma properties, which are usually concealed behind the EUV observables. The emission-measure-weighted line-of-sight velocity, which represents the Doppler shift of a spectral line forming in a certain temperature range, reveals vigorous dynamics in plasma at different temperatures and ubiquitous MHD waves, as expected in the real solar corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Masses and Radiative Transfer Modeling of HD 698: a Be Binary in Evolutionary Transition</a><span class="id">[2511.02523]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed analysis of the early post-mass-transfer binary HD 698 (V742 Cas) combining high-resolution optical spectroscopy, long-baseline interferometry, and radiative-transfer modeling. Counter-phased radial-velocity curves yield a circular orbit with P=55.927+/-0.001 d and component masses M_Be=7.48+/-0.07 M_sun and M_comp=1.23+/-0.02 M_sun. The Be primary is traced by broad H alpha wings, while narrow metallic absorption lines arise from a slowly rotating companion. The interferometric separation implies a dynamical distance of 888+/-5 pc. The spectral energy distribution is reproduced with E(B-V)=0.321+/-0.016 and a viscous decretion disk of base density rho_0 5x10^12 g cm^-3 at r=R_eq, declining radially as rho(r) r^-n with n=3.0. The companion is luminous and inflated, with T_eff=10.0(+0.2,-0.1) kK, R_comp=13.1+/-0.2 R_sun, and log(L/L_sun)=3.19, contributing significantly to the flux (L_comp/L_Be 0.3). Spectral line mismatches further suggest a hydrogen-poor, CNO-processed atmosphere, consistent with a stripped-envelope star. HD 698 thus adds to the emerging class of Be+bloated OB binaries, capturing a brief post-mass-transfer phase when the donor remains spectroscopically detectable prior to the subdwarf stage.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02528" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recalibration of the Landolt UBVRI Standard Stars and the Generation of 5.4 Million New UBVRI Standard Stars using LAMOST and Gaia</a><span class="id">[2511.02528]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an independent validation and recalibration of the Landolt 2013 (celestial equator and $\delta \sim -50^\circ$) and 2016 ($\delta \sim -50^\circ$) standard stars in the Johnson $UBV$ and Kron-Cousins $RI$ systems, using tens of thousands of XPSP data from the BEst STar (BEST) database. Our analysis reveals an overall zero-point offset between the 2016 and 2013 datasets. We further identify zero-point offsets for each standard field, ranging from 5 – 14 mmag across all $UBVRI$ bands, with correlations between offsets in different bands. Additionally, we confirm the spatial structures up to 7 – 10 mmag in the $BVRI$ bands. We also find that spatial structures are similar across bands for the same field, and similar across different fields for the same band. These similarities may arise from the averaged flat-fields from each observing run. The recalibrated results are consistent with the XPSP data within 48 mmag in the $U$ band, 11 mmag in the $B$ band, and 5 – 6 mmag in the $VRI$ bands in the brightness $G&lt;16$.

They populate the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Using the high-quality, homogeneous spectra of 336 hot subluminous star candidates from the Arizona-Montréal Spectroscopic Survey, we aim to improve our understanding of the atmospheric and stellar properties of hot subdwarf stars. We used large grids of model atmospheres to fit the observed spectra and derived their atmospheric parameters: effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity, and helium abundance. The model grids were further utilized to fit the spectral energy distribution of each star and the $Gaia$ parallax was used to compute the stellar parameters radius, luminosity, and mass. We detected helium stratification in six sdB stars with Teff around 30 kK, making them good candidates for also showing $^3$He enrichment in their atmospheres. The mass distributions of H-rich sdBs and sdOs are similar and centered around 0.47 $\text{M}_\odot$, consistent with the canonical formation scenario of helium ignition under degenerate conditions. Among the H-rich hot subdwarfs, we found no difference between the mass distributions of close binaries and apparently single stars. The He-sdOs have a significantly wider mass distribution than their H-rich counterparts, with an average mass of about 0.78 $\text{M}_\odot$. This strongly favors a merger origin for these He-rich objects. We identified a small number of candidate low-mass ($&lt;$0.45$ \text{M}_\odot$) sdBs located below the EHB that might have originated from more massive progenitors. Finally, we identified more than 80 pulsating stars in our sample and found these to fall into well-defined $p$- and $g$-mode instability regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Comprehensive Study of the Physical and Geometrical Characteristics of the Close Visual Binary System HIP 45571</a><span class="id">[2511.02540]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we estimated the physical and geometrical characteristics of the visually close binary stellar system Hip 45571, using Al-Wardat's method for analyzing binary and multiple stellar systems. We estimated the physical properties of the components of the system for the four measured parallax given by Gaia and Hipparcos, which gives a dynamical mass sum ranges between 2.43 and 2.52 solar mass using the new orbital parameters following Tokovinin's dynamical method. The method used is a spectrophotometrical computational technique that employs Kurucz plane-parallel line-blanketed model atmospheres for single stars. These model atmospheres are used to construct the synthetic spectral energy distributions (SED) of each component and for the entire system. To ensure the method's accuracy, we apply the fit between synthetic and observational photometry under different filters, including the recently published Gaia DR3 measurements. The positions of the components on the H-R diagram and the evolutionary tracks were used to estimate their masses and ages. We found that the system consists of 2.24 Gyr two F2.5 IV and F3.5 IV subgiant components with T_eff_A= 6800, T_eff_B= 6700, logg=4.19 m/s^2, logg=4.33 m/s^2, R_A=1.77 R_sun, R_B=1.34 R_sun, L_A=6.01 L_sun, L_B=3.25 L_sun and Z=0.011. Depending on the masses estimated by Al-Wardat's method, a new parallax value of 28.72+-0.30 mas was obtained. Which lies between the values given by DR2 and DR3. This research underscores the importance of precision and reliability in employing these methods and measurements in a dynamic context, deepening our understanding of such stellar systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02562" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterising EP241107a: Multiwavelength Observations of an Einstein Probe-detected Fast X-ray Transient</a><span class="id">[2511.02562]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) represent a new class of highly luminous transients in soft X-rays ($\sim$0.3-10 keV) associated with violent astrophysical processes. They manifest as short, singular flashes of X-ray photons with durations lasting from minutes to hours. Their origin remains unclear, and they have been associated with various progenitor mechanisms. The newly launched X-ray survey, Einstein-Probe (EP), is revolutionising this field by enabling the discovery and immediate follow-up of FXTs. Here we present the multiwavelength observations of EP-discovered FXT EP241107a and the discovery of its radio counterpart. Comparison of the optical and radio observations of EP241107a and its host properties with other extragalactic transients suggests a gamma-ray burst (GRB) origin.

Its pre-dimming spectral energy distribution shows a persistent infrared excess with a fractional luminosity of approximately 0.5 percent. We model this excess using a two-component blackbody fit and find dust components with temperatures of about 1070 K and 390 K. Archival light curves indicate that ASASSN-24fw was photometrically stable prior to the event, suggesting that the dimming is caused by an external occulting body rather than intrinsic stellar variability. The event lasted about 275 days and exhibits a distinctive flat-bottomed profile of nearly 200 days, unlike most long-duration occultation events reported in the last decade. We analyze the light curve and spectra obtained during dimming to study the properties of both the star and the occulting material. A parametric light-curve model reveals multiple ingress phases, consistent with variations in the density and structure of the obscuring material. A second transit model favors an occulting body consistent with a gas giant or brown dwarf with a minimum mass of about 3.4 Jupiter masses and surrounded by an extended circumplanetary disk or rings of radius roughly 0.17 au. Near-infrared spectra taken during dimming show enhanced infrared excess and spectral features consistent with a late-type companion, approximately M8. We also detect variable H-alpha emission, suggesting evolving gas and dust in the occulting structure. Imaging from LCOGT identifies a nearby object within 3 arcsec, likely a bound companion at a projected separation of about 3000 au. Systems like ASASSN-24fw appear rare, and continued follow-up will help constrain the nature of the occulting body and the circumstellar environment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mass ratio estimates for overcontact binaries using the derivatives of light curves.

In the first paper (Kouzuma 2023, ApJ, 958, 84) , we presented a method to estimate the mass ratios for systems exhibiting a double-peak feature in the second derivatives of their light curves around eclipses. This second paper focuses on overcontact systems that are not addressed in the first paper, that is, systems lacking a double peak in the second derivative. A sample of synthetic light curves for overcontact binaries consists of 89670, covering a parameter space typical of overcontact systems. On the basis of a recent study that proposed a new classification scheme using light-curve derivatives up to the fourth order, the sample light curves were classified. We found that time intervals between two local extrema in the derivatives are associated with the mass ratio in systems that exhibit a high degree of eclipse obscuration. Using regression analysis for the identified associations, we derived empirical formulae to estimate the mass ratio and its associated uncertainty. The application of our proposed method to real overcontact binary data demonstrated its effectiveness in providing reliable estimates for both values.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supernova Classification using the Recurrent Neural Network in the CSST Ultra-Deep Field Survey</a><span class="id">[2511.02631]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study supernova (SN) classification using the machine learning method of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope Ultra-Deep Field (CSST-UDF) photometric survey, and explore the improvement of the cosmological constraint.

Our study indicates that the SNN combined with the Joint Light-curve Analysis like (JLA-like) cuts can enhance the purity of the CSST-UDF SN Ia sample up to over 99.5% with 2,193 SNe Ia and 4 CCSNe, which can significantly increase the reliability of the cosmological constraint results. The method based on the Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS) with Bias Corrections (BBC) framework is used to correct the SN Ia magnitude bias caused by the selection effect and CCSN contamination, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed for cosmological constraints. We find that the accuracy of the constraints on the matter density $\Omega_{\rm M}$ and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ can achieve 14% and 18%, respectively, assuming the flat $w$CDM model.

We construct a learned latent space in which we perform further dimensionality reduction to find underlying structure in the data. Our results demonstrate that the sVAE model achieves high classification accuracy for FRB repeaters and reveals separation between repeater and non-repeater populations. Upon further analysis of the latent space, we observe that dispersion measure excess, spectral index, and spectral running are the dominant features distinguishing repeaters from non-repeaters. We also identify four non-repeating FRBs as repeater candidates, two of which have been independently flagged in previous studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02643" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The First Occurrence Rate Estimates for Exoplanets in Small-Separation Binary Star Systems: Planet Occurrence is Suppressed in Binary Stars</a><span class="id">[2511.02643]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Exoplanet occurrence rates facilitate comparisons between observations of planets and theoretical models of planet formation. Despite their deductive power, exoplanet occurrence rates for half the stars in the sky are missing because occurrence rate studies systematically exclude binary star systems. We assembled a large sample of high-likelihood binaries from the Kepler mission to calculate occurrence rates for circumstellar (S-type) planets in small-separation binary star systems ($\lesssim 100$ au) for the first time. For a sample of high-likelihood small-separation binaries, we found binaries to host 58% fewer planets per system than single stars to 11.4$\sigma$ significance within 1-4 $R_{\oplus}$ and 1-50 d, and 50% fewer planets compared to single stars when integrating over the full parameter space of 1-10 $R_{\oplus}$ and 1-100 d to 3.8$\sigma$ significance.. We found no evidence for a radius valley or radius cliff, instead detecting a smooth decline in planet occurrence with increasing planetary radius. The difference between the single-star planet radius distribution and the binary-star planet radius distribution is 4.3$\sigma$ significant from a Kolomogorov-Smirnov test. These results suggest significantly different planet formation and survival outcomes in binaries compared to single stars, and support other studies that have measured a deficit of observed planets in binary star systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resonances and Stellar Cycles: Observations and Modelling</a><span class="id">[2511.02669]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the paper we discuss the possibility of the influence of parametric excitation, in particular, planetary gravitational interaction, on the behavior of stellar magnetic activity cycles.

From a total of 27 hours of radio and 29 hours of optical observations, we examine the correspondence of the action of accelerated electrons of different energies in two distinct regions of the stellar atmosphere. We find that out of 9 optical flares with suitable radio coverage, only four have plausible evidence for a radio response. Optical photometric properties cannot predict which flares will have a radio response. From flares with time-resolved optical spectroscopy available, optical-only flares have similar implied electron distributions, while those with radio responses better correlate with higher low-energy cutoffs. The optical flares with a radio response all exhibit a delay between the optical and radio peaks of $\approx$1-7 minutes, with the optical flare peaking earlier in all cases. This likely indicates multiple loops are involved in the event, and/or the different impacts on electrons trapped in a magnetic loop (producing radio emission), versus those directly precipitating from the loop (producing the optical flare). We also remark on the radio spectral index behavior at early times for the largest radio flare observed in this study, which we interpret as evidence for increased opacity from a chromospheric evaporation front.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cesam2k20: A code for a new generation of stellar evolution models.

However, the relative contribution of each mechanism remains uncertain, particularly in light of their observational signatures. We investigate whether spatially resolved emission and synthetic spectral line profiles can distinguish between thermally and magnetically driven winds in protoplanetary discs. We modelled three disc wind scenarios with different levels of magnetisation: a relatively strongly magnetised wind ($\beta$4), a rather weakly magnetised wind ($\beta$6), and a purely photoevaporative wind (PE). Using radiative transfer post-processing, we generated synthetic emission maps and line profiles for [OI] 6300 Å, [NeII] 12.81 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, and o-H2 2.12 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, and compared them with observations. The $\beta$4 model generally produces broader and more blueshifted low-velocity components across all tracers, consistent with compact emission regions and steep velocity gradients. The $\beta$6 and PE models yield narrower profiles with smaller blueshifts, in better agreement with most observed narrow low-velocity components (NLVCs). We also find that some line profile diagnostics, such as the inclination at maximum centroid velocity, are not robust discriminants. However, the overall blueshift and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the low-velocity components provide reliable constraints. The $\beta$4 model reproduces the most extreme blueshifted NLVCs in observations, while most observed winds are more consistent with the $\beta$6 and PE models. Our findings reinforce previous conclusions that most observed NLVCs are compatible with weakly magnetised or purely photoevaporative flows. The combination of line kinematics and emission morphology offers meaningful constraints on wind-driving physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark neutron stars from a heavy dark sector</a><span class="id">[2511.01984]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the formation and properties of dark neutron stars in a scenario where dark matter is made up of (heavy) dark baryons in a sequestered copy of the MSSM. This scenario naturally explains the coincidence of baryonic and dark matter abundances without the need for tuning particle masses. In particular, the supersymmetry breaking scales in the visible and dark sectors may differ by up to 10-11 orders of magnitude. We argue that dark neutrons should be the lightest dark baryons, but that dark protons may be cosmologically long lived. This allows a small fraction of dark matter to remain ionized until the first halos start to form, providing cooling mechanisms that foster the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of sub-halo structures, ultimately resulting in dark neutron star and black hole formation. For a wide range of model parameters, we find dark neutron stars with generally smaller mass and radius than ordinary visible sector neutron stars. We also discuss their potential detectability, particularly through gravitational microlensing and dark magnetic dipole radiation at radio frequencies through photon-dark photon kinetic mixing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-relativistic freeze-out: a bridge from WIMPs to FIMPs</a><span class="id">[2511.02117]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We re-examine the case for dark matter (DM) produced by ultra-relativistic freeze-out (UFO). UFO is the mechanism by which Standard Model (SM) neutrinos decouple from the radiation bath in the early universe at a temperature $T_{d} \approx 1$ MeV. This corresponds to chemical freeze-out without Boltzmann suppression, such that the freeze-out (decoupling) temperature $T_{d}$ is much greater than $m_{\nu}$ and the neutrinos are therefore ultra-relativistic at freeze-out. While UFO has historically been rejected as a viable mechanism for DM production due to its association with hot DM and the accompanying incompatibility with $\Lambda$CDM, we show that when the approximation of instantaneous reheating after inflation is lifted, UFO can produce cold DM and account for the entire observed relic density in large regions of parameter space. In fact, DM with masses ranging from sub-eV to PeV scales can undergo UFO and be cold before structure formation, given only a simple perturbative, post-inflationary reheating period prior to radiation domination. For some interactions, such as a contact interaction between the Higgs and DM scalars, there is a seamless transition between the WIMP and FIMP regimes which excludes UFO. However, for many other interactions, such as SM fermions producing fermionic DM via a heavy scalar or vector mediator, the WIMP to FIMP transition occurs \textit{necessarily} via a large intermediate region corresponding to UFO. We characterize the general features of UFO in this paper, while we supply a more detailed analysis in a companion paper. We find that UFO during reheating can produce the correct relic density ($\Omega_{\chi}h^2 = 0.12$) for DM masses spanning about 13 orders of magnitude, reheating temperatures spanning 17 orders of magnitude, and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) effective interaction scales spanning 11 orders of magnitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euler-Heisenberg action for fermions coupled to gauge and axial vectors: Hessian diagonalization, sector classification, and applications</a><span class="id">[2511.02118]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler–Heisenberg effective actions for Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis. Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the Strong-CP problem.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Matter Freeze-in from a $Z^\prime$ Reheaton</a><span class="id">[2511.02184]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider the Standard Model (SM) extended by a secluded $U(1)_D$ gauge sector encompassing a Dirac fermion ($\chi$) dark matter (DM), an abelian gauge boson $Z^\prime$ and a SM-singlet complex-scalar field $\Phi$, whose radial component drives cosmic inflation.

We explore the possibility that DM freezes-in via non-thermal $Z^\prime$ decays before reheating ends, giving rise to substantial viable parameter space.

The relativistic mean field (RMF) formalism is employed to illustrate the hadronic equation of state (EOS), while a physically motivated, gravitationally captured, non-uniform fermionic Higgs-portal DM component is incorporated to model DM-admixed NS. The DM distribution is characterized by two free parameters: $\alpha M_\chi$, an effective scaling factor that combines the DM concentration and the DM candidate mass, and $\beta$, a steepness index controlling the DM density distribution. The quasi normal mode (QNM) characteristics such as fundamental ($f$) mode frequency and its corresponding gravitational-wave (GW) damping time ($\tau$) is calculated for DM-admixed NS by solving the general relativistic perturbed equations involving axial as well as polar modes. The study demonstrates how the inclusion of DM distribution modifies the $f$-mode frequency and enhances the damping rate, reflecting a stronger coupling between matter and spacetime perturbations. Considering DM effects, the correlation analysis among DM model parameters, NS observables and QNM characteristics also carried out. Analytic fits for the $f-C-\tau$ and $f-\Lambda -\tau$ relations are constructed and calibrated for DM-admixed NS models. Building upon asteroseismic universal relations (URs), multimessenger constraint from the GW170817 event is employed by mapping the tidal deformability $\Lambda_{1.4}$ into the $(f_{1.4},\tau_{1.4})$ space, thereby providing observational bounds on the oscillation properties of canonical DM-admixed NS model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Stars with Large Quark Cores</a><span class="id">[2511.02653]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutron stars (NSs) are interesting objects capable of reaching densities unattainable on Earth. The properties of matter under these conditions remain a mystery. Exotic matter, including quark matter, may be present in the NS core. In this work, we explore the possible compositions of NS cores, in particular, the possible existence of large quark cores. We use the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with nonlinear terms for the hadron phase and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and Mean Field Theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (MFTQCD) for the quark phase. Through Bayesian inference, we obtain different sets of equations: four sets with hybrid equations (three using the NJL model and the other using the MFTQCD model), and one set with only the hadron phase. We impose constraints regarding the properties of nuclear matter, X-ray observational data from NICER, perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, and causality on all sets. One set of hybrid NJL equations of state was also constrained by adding the GW170817 detection. All sets can describe observational data and theoretical restrictions. The MFTQCD allows for a phase transition to quark matter at lower densities compared to the NJL models. The MFTQCD model indicates that NSs with 1.4 solar mass have quark matter in their inner core. However, NJL models suggest that it is more probable that 1.4 solar mass NSs do not contain quark matter. Both the MFTQCD and NJL models agree that there is quark matter in 2 solar mass NSs. It is discussed that hybrid stars with a stiff quark equation of state could explain a larger radius of more massive stars, such as two solar mass stars, with respect to the canonical NS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GW231123 ringdown: interpretation as multimodal Kerr signal</a><span class="id">[2511.02691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GW231123 is a short-duration, low-frequency gravitational wave signal consistent with a binary black hole coalescence and dominated by the merger-ringdown regime due to the high mass of the source. We demonstrate that fits of this ringdown signal using two quasinormal modes are statistically preferred over single-mode fits, for a broad range of fit start times. We also find that two-mode fits give remnant mass and spin measurements consistent with those of the inspiral-merger-ringdown model NRSur7dq4, whereas one-mode fits struggle to do so. Agreement of our fits with those of NRSur7dq4 is achieved by labeling the two quasinormal modes as the ${(\ell,m)=(2,2)}$ and ${(2,0)}$ Kerr prograde fundamental modes. However, we find some indications that fits with the ${(2,1)}$ quasinormal mode instead of the ${(2,0)}$ mode may describe the data better, hinting at possible NRSur7dq4 error or other systematics. When fitting at early times near the estimated peak strain, we find that the inclusion of a third mode, an ${(\ell,m,n)=(2,2,1)}$ prograde overtone, improves consistency with fits at later times. Finally, we perform a test of general relativity by searching for deviations from the Kerr frequency spectrum. Setting issues of systematics aside, we validate the Kerr frequency and damping rate spectrum to within $\pm10\%$ at the 90$\%$ credible level using a fundamental mode fit, and we also report $\pm8\%$ constraints using a model with fundamental modes and an overtone fit at times near the peak strain. Understanding the systematic errors that may be affecting the most accurate analyses of GW231123 is crucial in the context of population and binary formation studies – our ${(2,1)}$ mode fits return a significantly higher remnant mass and spin than all available inspiral-merger-ringdown models including NRSur7dq4, and this difference in parameter estimates may have astrophysical implications.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02702" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisited for existence proof of optimal solution in Bernoulli free boundary problem using an energy-gap cost functional</a><span class="id">[2511.02702]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bernoulli free boundary problem is numerically solved via shape optimization that minimizes a cost functional subject to state problems constraints.

In particular, we restrict our analysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric function is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\alpha$ and of the one-form $\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the conformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of conformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models obtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the presence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The generalized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the Riemannian metric $\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker representation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a specific relationship between the component of the one-form $\beta$ and the conformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is determined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free parameter $\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological models are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of $\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM model is also performed. Our results indicate that the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple, alternative to standard cosmological models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redshift-Space Distortion constraints on neutrino mass and models to alleviate the Hubble tension</a><span class="id">[2410.21925]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We discuss the neutrino mass and Hubble tension solutions and examine their effects on the Redshift-Space Distortion (RSD) observations.

We have evaluated the impacts of RSD observations on some extended models, including the varying electron mass model, a time-dependent dark energy model with two parameter equations of state (EOS), and a model where the number of neutrino species is free. When we estimate the cosmological parameters for data including RSD, we found that the EOS parameter for dark energy is larger than that of the cosmological constant, and the effective number of neutrino species is smaller than the standard value, which infers a smaller present Hubble parameter $H_0$.

Using a functional form for time-only evolution gives $\mu_0=0.11^{+0.44}_{-0.54}$ from DESI(FS+BAO)+BBN and a wide prior on $n_{s}$. Using DESI(FS+BAO)+CMB+DESY3+DESY5-SN, we obtain $\mu_0=0.05\pm 0.22$ and $\Sigma_0=0.008\pm 0.045$ in the $\Lambda$CDM background. In $w_0 w_a$CDM, we obtain $\mu_0=-0.24^{+0.32}_{-0.28}$ and $\Sigma_0=0.006\pm 0.043$, consistent with GR, and still find a preference for dynamical dark energy with $w_0&gt;-1$ and $w_a&lt;0$. We then use binned forms in the 2 backgrounds starting with 2 bins in redshift and then adding 2 bins in scale for a total of 4 and 8 MG parameters, respectively. All MG parameters are found consistent with GR. We also find that the tension reported for $\Sigma_0$ with GR from Planck PR3 goes away when using LoLLiPoP+HiLLiPoP likelihoods. As noted previously, this seems to indicate the tension is related to CMB lensing anomaly in PR3 which is also resolved when using these likelihoods. We then constrain the class of Horndeski theory in both EFT-basis and $\alpha$-basis. Assuming a power law for the non-minimal coupling function $\Omega$, we obtain $\Omega_0=0.012^{+0.001}_{-0.012}$ and $s_0=0.996^{+0.54}_{-0.20}$ from DESI(FS+BAO)+DESY5SN+CMB in a $\Lambda$CDM background, consistent with GR.

However, a major challenge in fully exploiting GWs as standard sirens with current and future GW observatories is developing efficient and robust codes capable of analyzing the increasing data volumes that are, and will be, acquired. We present here CHIMERA 2.0, an advanced computational framework for hierarchical Bayesian inference of cosmological, modified gravity, and population hyperparameters using standard sirens and galaxy catalogs. This upgrade introduces novel GPU-accelerated algorithms to estimate the hierarchical likelihood, enabling the analysis of thousands of events - crucial for next-generation experiments - and includes the two-parameter ($\Xi_0-n$) modified GW propagation model. Using CHIMERA 2.0, we forecast cosmological and modified GW propagation constraints for the future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5-like run. We analyze three binary black hole populations of 300 events at SNR&gt;20, each with a different value of $\Xi_0$: 0.6, 1 (corresponding to GR), and 1.8. Multiple analyses were performed each catalog, comprising a population of approximately 5000 events, thanks to CHIMERA 2.0, which is 10-1000 times faster depending on the settings and catalog size. We jointly infer cosmological, modified GW propagation, and population hyperparameters. With spectroscopic galaxy catalogs, the fiducial $\Xi_0$ is recovered with a precision of $22\%$, $7.5\%$, and $10\%$ for $\Xi_0$ = 0.6, 1, and 1.8, respectively; while the precision on $H_0$ is 2-7 times worse than when $\Xi_0$ is not inferred. Finally,in the case of photometric redshifts the constraints degrade on average by 3.5 times in all cases, underscoring the importance of future spectroscopic surveys in maximizing the constraining power of standard sirens.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-tracer beyond linear theory</a><span class="id">[2504.18245]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The multi-tracer (MT) technique has been shown to outperform single-tracer analyses in the context of galaxy clustering.

We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Unhurried Universe: A Continued Search for Long Term Variability in ASAS-SN</a><span class="id">[2507.07174]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We search a sample of 5,685,060 isolated sources in the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) with 14.5&lt;g&lt;15 mag for slowly varying sources with brightness changes larger than  0.03 mag/year over 10 years.

The strongest associations suggest a correlation between neutrinos and active galactic nuclei. However, it is still unclear which specific regions and mechanisms of the accreting supermassive black hole are responsible for their production. In this paper we investigate the correlation between the positions of IceCat-1 neutrino events and a large, optically selected quasar catalogue extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Within this sample, we distinguish radio-quiet quasars from flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) based on radio emission data from the Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey (CLASS) catalogue. While all the associations between neutrino events and radio-quiet quasars are consistent with being random matches, FSRQs exhibit a moderately significant correlation (2.7 sigma) with neutrino positions. Additionally, we observe that the distribution of minimum distances between neutrino events and FSRQs differs significantly for events at declinations above and below 20 deg. In particular, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we find that the high-declination event distribution deviates strongly (4 sigma) from a random distribution. We interpret all these results as an indication that a large fraction of the neutrino events (&gt;60%) observed by IceCube could be produced by the FSRQs and that the emission mechanism is likely related to the relativistic jets rather than the radio-quiet component of these sources, such as the accretion disk or corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20334" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predicting the X-ray signatures of the imminent T Coronae Borealis outburst through 3D hydrodynamic modeling</a><span class="id">[2507.20334]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova with eruptions in 1866 and 1946. Mounting evidence suggests an imminent outburst, offering a rare opportunity to observe a nearby nova in detail. We constrain the circumbinary medium (CBM) by modeling inter-eruption radio observations and simulate the hydrodynamic evolution of the upcoming outburst to predict its X-ray signatures, focusing on the roles of the red giant companion, accretion disk, and equatorial density enhancement (EDE). We model thermal radio emission from a CBM composed of a spherical wind and a torus-like EDE to estimate its density. We then perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the nova outburst, varying explosion energy, ejecta mass, and CBM configuration. From these, we synthesize X-ray light curves and spectra as they would appear to XMM-Newton and XRISM. The CBM in T CrB is significantly less dense than in other symbiotic novae, with a mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} \approx 4 \times 10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for a 10 km s$^{-1}$ wind. Despite the low-density EDE, the blast is collimated along the poles by the accretion disk and EDE, producing a bipolar shock. The red giant partially shields the ejecta, forming a bow shock and hot wake. X-ray evolution proceeds through three phases: an early phase (first few hours) dominated by shocked disk material; an intermediate phase ($\sim 1$ week-1 month) driven by reverse-shocked ejecta; and a late phase dominated by shocked EDE. Soft X-rays trace shocked ejecta, hard X-rays arise from shocked ambient gas, and synthetic spectra show asymmetric, blueshifted lines due to absorption by expanding ejecta. The X-ray evolution resembles that of RS Oph and V745 Sco, with a peak luminosity of $L_\mathrm{X} \approx 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, but features a more prolonged soft X-ray phase, reflecting the lower CBM density and distinct ejecta-environment interaction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective Field Theory Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from the High-Redshift Lyman-$α$ Forest</a><span class="id">[2508.04767]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present updated constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) dark matter from the high-redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data from MIKE/HIRES experiments. Our analysis leverages an effective field theory (EFT) description of the 1D flux power spectrum, allowing us to analytically predict the Lyman-$\alpha$ fluctuations on quasi-linear scales from first principles. Our EFT-based likelihood enables robust inference across redshifts $z = 4.2-5.4$ and down to scales of 100 kpc, within previously unexplored regions of parameter space for this dataset. We derive new bounds on the PBH fraction with respect to the total dark matter $f_{\text{PBH}}$, excluding populations with $f_{\text{PBH}} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ for masses $M_{\text{PBH}} \sim 10^{4}-10^{16} M_{\odot}$. This offers the leading constraint for PBHs heavier than $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ and highlights the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as a uniquely sensitive probe of new physics models that modify the structure formation history of our universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09161" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning Confirms GW231123 is a &quot;Lite&quot; Intermediate Mass Black Hole Merger</a><span class="id">[2509.09161]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently reported GW231123, a black hole merger with total mass of around 190-265 solar mass. This event adds to the growing evidence of &quot;lite&quot; intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) discoveries of post-merger black holes &gt;100 solar mass. GW231123 posed several data analysis challenges owing to waveform-model systematics and presence of noise artifacts called glitches. We present the first comprehensive machine learning analysis to further validate this event, strengthen its astrophysical inference, and characterize instrumental noise in its vicinity. Our approach uses a combination of tools tailored for specific analyses: GW-Whisper, an adaptation of OpenAI's audio transformer, ArchGEM, a Gaussian mixture model-based soft clustering and density approximation software and AWaRe, a convolutional autoencoder. We identify the data segment containing the merger with &gt;70% confidence in both detectors and verify its astrophysical origin. We then characterize the scattered light glitch around the event, providing the first physically interpretable parameters for the glitch. We also reconstruct the real waveforms from the data with slightly better agreement to model-agnostic reconstructions than to quasi-circular models, hinting at possible astrophysics beyond current waveform families (such as non-circular orbits or environmental imprints). Finally, by demonstrating high-fidelity waveform reconstructions for simulated mergers with total masses between 100-1000 solar mass, we show that our method can confidently probe the IMBH regime. Our integrated framework offers a powerful complementary tool to traditional pipelines for rapid, robust analysis of massive, glitch-contaminated events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining Cosmology with Double-source-plane Strong Gravitational Lenses from the AGEL Survey</a><span class="id">[2509.15012]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Double-source-plane strong gravitational lenses (DSPLs), with two sources at different redshifts, are independent cosmological probes of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We present the lens model for the DSPL AGEL035346$-$170639 and infer cosmological constraints from this system for flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter and flat $w$CDM cosmologies. From the joint posterior of $w$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ in the flat $w$CDM cosmology, we extract the following median values and 1$\sigma$ uncertainties: $w = -1.52^{+0.49}_{-0.33}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.192^{+0.305}_{-0.131}$ from AGEL0353 alone. Combining our measurements with two previously analyzed DSPLs, we present the joint constraint on these parameters from a sample of three, the largest galaxy-scale DSPL sample used for cosmological measurement to date. The combined precision of $w$ from three DSPLs is higher by 15% over AGEL0353 alone. Combining DSPL and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements improves the precision of $w$ from CMB-only constraints by 39%, demonstrating the complementarity of DSPLs with the CMB. Despite their promising constraining power, DSPLs are limited by sample size, with only a handful discovered so far. Although ongoing and near-future wide-area sky surveys will increase the number of known DSPLs by up to two orders of magnitude, these systems will still require dedicated high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic follow-ups like those presented in this paper. Our ASTRO 3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses collaboration is undertaking such follow-up campaigns for several newly discovered DSPLs and will provide cosmological measurements from larger samples of DSPLs in the future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar – I. Polarization- and spectrum-dependent structure, and the emergent continuum</a><span class="id">[2510.25762]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar is simulated numerically in the framework of a three-dimensional (geometrically two-dimensional) model. The radiative transfer within the emitting region and the structure of the latter are calculated with the use of the self-consistent algorithm developed earlier. The magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on the photon energy and polarization have been incorporated. Second-order bulk Comptonization over entire emitting region, induced Compton scattering, the switching of the polarization modes, free-free processes, the cyclotron emission because of electron-proton collisions, and a realistic shape of the accretion channel have been taken into account. The case of a dipole magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect can play a notable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock zone. Within the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than in the post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons gaining the energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the thermal Doppler effect are responsible for the formation of high-energy regions in the emergent continuum of the polarization modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modular invariant inflation and reheating</a><span class="id">[2411.18603]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use modular symmetry as an organizing principle that attempts to simultaneously address the lepton flavor puzzle, inflation, and post-inflationary reheating. We demonstrate this approach using the finite modular group $A_4$ in the lepton sector. In our model, neutrino masses are generated via the Type-I see-saw mechanism, with modular symmetry dictating the form of the Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrino masses. The modular field also drives inflation, providing an excellent fit to recent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. The corresponding prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio is very small, $r \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$, while the prediction for the running of the spectral index, $\alpha \sim -\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, could be tested in the near future. An appealing feature of the setup is that the inflaton-matter interactions required for reheating naturally arise from the expansion of relevant modular forms. Although the corresponding inflaton decay rates are suppressed by the Planck scale, the reheating temperature can still be high enough to ensure successful Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The same couplings responsible for reheating can also contribute to generating baryon asymmetry of the Universe through non-thermal leptogenesis. However, the contribution is negligibly small in the current inflationary setup.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19960" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signatures of quasi-Dirac neutrinos in diffuse high-energy astrophysical neutrino data</a><span class="id">[2503.19960]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although the sources of astrophysical neutrinos are still unknown, they are believed to be produced by a population of sources in the distant universe. Measurements of the diffuse, all-sky astrophysical flux can thus be sensitive to flavor and energy-dependent propagation effects, such as very long baseline oscillations. These oscillations are present in certain neutrino mass models, such as when neutrinos are quasi-Dirac. Assuming generic models for the source flux, we find that these oscillations can still be resolved even when integrated over wide distributions in source redshift. We use two sets of IceCube all-sky flux measurements, made with muon and all-flavor neutrino samples, to set constraints at the $3\sigma$ level on quasi-Dirac mass-splittings between $(5 \times 10^{-19}, 8 \times 10^{-19})~\textrm{eV}^2$. We also consider systematic uncertainties on the source population and find that our results are robust under alternate spectral hypotheses or physical redshift distributions. Our analysis shows that spectral features in the all-sky neutrino measurements provide strong constraints on massive neutrino scenarios and are sensitive to uncharted parameter space.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02719" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expansion-contraction duality breaking in a Planck-scale sensitive cosmological quantum simulator</a><span class="id">[2506.02719]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra.

Employing the dimensionally reduced 3d effective field theory of the SM at high temperature, we identify the symmetry structure – including higher-form and magnetic symmetries – and analyze their spontaneous breaking patterns across the crossover. We further define a gauge-invariant mixing angle that interpolates between $\mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ and $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{em}$ magnetic fields. Based on this framework, we examine baryogenesis via decaying magnetic helicity and identify three key effects: the baryon asymmetry is modified by an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ factor due to (1) the gauge-invariant definition of the mixing angle and (2) the approximate conservation of the unconfined magnetic flux; (3) a novel non-perturbative process in the presence of magnetic flux, which has been overlooked in previous analyses. Our findings suggest that the previous estimation of baryon asymmetry from the magnetic helicity decay may have sizable uncertainties, and we caution against relying on it, calling for further investigation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weak Lensing Approximation of Wave-optics Effects from General Symmetric Lens Profiles</a><span class="id">[2508.17486]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational lensing of electromagnetic (EM) waves has yielded many profound discoveries across fundamental physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. Similar to EM waves, gravitational waves (GWs) can also be lensed. When their wavelength is comparable to the characteristic scale of the lens, wave-optics (WO) effects manifest as frequency-dependent modulations in the GW waveform. These WO features encode valuable information about the lensing system but are challenging to model, especially in the weak lensing regime, which has a larger optical depth than strong lensing. We present a novel and efficient framework to accurately approximate WO effects induced by general symmetric lens profiles. Our method is validated against numerical calculations and recovers the expected asymptotic behavior in both high- and low-frequency limits. Accurate and efficient modeling of WO effects in the weak lensing regime will enable improved lens reconstruction, delensing of standard sirens, and provide a unique probe to the properties of low-mass halos with minimal baryonic content, offering new insights into the nature of dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18079" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Data from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA through the First Part of the Fourth Observing Run</a><span class="id">[2508.18079]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA form a network of gravitational-wave observatories.

Our analysis follows the semiclassical WKB approach, where spatially varying complex masses across expanding bubble walls feel CP-violating forces that bias plasma transport. Starting from the stationary Boltzmann equation in the wall frame and projecting onto a hierarchy of velocity moments, we derive a compact, fluid-like system of coupled differential equations for chemical potentials and velocity perturbations. After obtaining the solutions, one can define the left-handed baryon chemical potential, which acts as the source term for the weak sphalerons. These processes generate the baryon asymmetry in front of the wall, which is subsequently frozen once it passes through it. We validate the framework against established formalisms and provide benchmarks in representative scenarios, including singlet extensions of the Standard Model, two-Higgs-doublet models, and Higgs$-\phi^6$ constructions. The resulting BARYONET implementation delivers an automated, reproducible pipeline for WKB-based baryogenesis studies, connecting formal derivations with phenomenological applications. In parallel, we revisit standard EWBG ingredients$-$diffusion constants, Yukawa/helicity-flip rates, and strong/weak sphaleron rates$-$to clarify conventions, update numerical inputs, and present a pedagogical derivation, ensuring transparent reproducibility.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vacuum breakdown around a Kerr black hole surrounded by a magnetic field</a><span class="id">[2510.23886]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the invariant characterization of the region where vacuum breakdown into electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pairs occurs due to an overcritical electric field, the dyadoregion, in the case of a Kerr black hole (BH) in the presence of an external, asymptotically uniform test magnetic field aligned with the BH rotation axis, using the Wald solution.

The I-spin counterpart for the interactions among nucleons has been extensively investigated, i.e., the nuclear symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{sym}(n_\mathrm{b})$, which characterizes the variation of binding energy as the neutron to proton ratio in a nuclear system. In this work, we propose U-spin symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ for hyperonic matter to characterize the variation of the binding energy with the inclusion of hyperons. In particular, being the lightest hyperon, $\Lambda$ hyperons are included in dense matter, where the U-spin symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ is fixed according to state-of-the-art constraints from nuclear physics and astrophysical observations using Bayesian inference approach. It is found that $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ is much smaller than that of $E_\mathrm{sym}(n_\mathrm{b})$, indicating much stronger proton-neutron attraction than that of nucleon-hyperon pairs. Consequently, $\Lambda$ hyperon potential increases significantly and becomes repulsive at large density, where there is more than 80\% probability that $\Lambda$ hyperons do not emerge in neutron stars. For those undergoing emergence within neutron stars, the onset density of $\Lambda$ hyperons $n_\mathrm{b}^\Lambda$ is typically larger than $\sim$0.8 fm$^{-3}$, corresponding to neutron stars more massive than 1.7 $M_\odot$.</p></div></details></article></body>
