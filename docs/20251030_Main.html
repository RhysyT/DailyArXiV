These discs may have any slowly varying surface density or temperature profile. For specific 'self-similar' disc profiles, solutions to our equation match (novel) smooth non-linear exact spiral solutions derived via a separate method, which highlight that non-linear spiral waves need not shock. Indeed, at low amplitudes, we find that dispersion can overcome wave steepening, and may prevent the inner spiral wakes excited by low mass planets (below roughly 1% of a thermal mass) embedded in protoplanetary discs from shocking. At high amplitudes, we find a simple universal description of non-linear spiral waves with shocks, as well as caps on the possible amplitude and wave action flux of non-linear spirals both with and without shocks, depending on how many arms they have. We further find that highly non-linear spirals are far more loosely wound than their linear counterparts. These developments shed light on why two-armed spirals are prevalent across a range of astrophysical systems which don't necessarily possess an intrinsic twofold symmetry, and why they appear surprisingly loosely wound in observations. These results are supported by very high-resolution numerical simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emission and Absorption Features of Magnetically Driven Disk Winds in Black Hole X-Ray Binaries</a><span class="id">[2510.24844]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate accretion disk winds commonly observed in galactic black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRB), which manifest as blueshifted absorption features in X-ray spectra. We model these winds as ideal magnetohydrodynamic outflows of hot plasma driven by global magnetic fields threading the accretion disk around the BH. Using Monte Carlo simulations with MONACO, we solve three-dimensional radiative transfer equations to determine the large-scale ionization structure that produces the observed ionic column densities. Focusing on the high/soft state of the BH XRB, where disk emission provides the dominant source of ionizing X-rays, we calculated synthetic spectra showing resonance absorption and scattered emission from ions in various charge states. Our results demonstrate that systems viewed at high polar angles exhibit prominent multi-ion absorption lines with asymmetric profiles, accompanied by P-Cygni-like emission features that partially reproduce the characteristics seen in the observed spectra. This further implies that even a dense disk wind with a high polar angle is unlikely to be saturated due to effective scattering.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24854" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Underground Oceans to Continents: A Glimpse into the Water Inventory on Rocky Planets using Host Star Abundances</a><span class="id">[2510.24854]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The amount of surface water is thought to be critical for a planet's climate stability and thus habitability. However, the probability that a rocky planet may exhibit surface water at any point its evolution is dependent on multiple factors, such as the initial water mass, geochemical evolution, and interior composition. To date, studies have examined the influence of interior composition on the water inventory of the planet or how surface oceans may be impacted by planet topography individually. Here, we provide the first exploration on the impact of interior composition, topography, and planet radius on the water inventory of rocky planets using a sample of 689 rocky planets with spectroscopically derived stellar abundances from APOGEE and GALAH. We find that the oxidation state of the mantle (FeO content) significantly impacts the mantle water storage capacity and potential for surface flooding. For an FeO  11 wt%, the water storage capacity of a 1 M$_\oplus$ is 2 times that of Earth, indicating that the oxidation state may reduce the amount of surface water. We quantify the impact of topography on seafloor pressures, showing that flat topographies are more likely to be flooded for all planet compositions and radii. We also find that Mars-like topographies are more likely to have seafloor pressures that may form high-pressure ice, reducing seafloor weathering. Thus, for the first time, we show that the composition and topography of the mantle influence the water inventory of rocky planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast-Cooling Synchrotron Prompt Emission from Internal Shocks in GRB 241030A</a><span class="id">[2510.24864]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a time-resolved, joint Swift-Fermi spectral study of GRB 241030A (z=1.411) that cleanly isolates the synchrotron origin of its prompt emission and favors a matter-dominated, internal-shock scenario. The light curve shows two episodes separated by a quiescent gap. Episode I (0-45 s) is well described by a single power law with photon index $\simeq -3/2$, consistent with the fast-cooling synchrotron slope below the peak. Episode II (100-200 s), exhibits two robust spectral breaks: a low-energy break at $E_{b}$$\sim$$2-3$ keV that remains nearly constant in time, and a spectral peak $E_{p}$ that tracks the flux within pulses but steps down between them. The photon indices below and above $E_{b}$ cluster around -2/3 and -3/2, respectively, as expected for fast-cooling synchrotron emission. The burst displays an unusually small (consistent with zero) spectral lag across GBM bands. At later times ($\geq 230$ s), the spectrum softens toward $\sim-2.7$, as expected when the observing band lies above both $\nu_m$ and $\nu_c$. These behaviors are difficult to reconcile with a globally magnetized outflow with a decaying field, which naturally produces hard-to-soft Ep evolution, growing $\nu_c$, and appreciable lags. By contrast, internal shocks with a roughly steady effective magnetic field and a time-variable minimum electron Lorentz factor (equivalently, e.g., a varying fraction of accelerated electrons simultaneously account for (i) the stable $E_{b}$, (ii) the intensity-tracking yet step-down $E_{p}$, (iii) the canonical -2/3 and -3/2 slopes, and (iv) the near-zero lag.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The White Dwarf Initial-Final Mass Relation from Open Clusters in Gaia DR3</a><span class="id">[2510.24877]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The initial-final mass relation (IFMR) links a star's birth mass to the mass of its white dwarf (WD) remnant, providing key constraints on stellar evolution. Open clusters offer the most straightforward way to empirically determine the IFMR, as their well-defined ages allow for direct progenitor lifetime estimates. We construct the most comprehensive open cluster WD IFMR to date by combining new spectroscopy of 22 WDs with an extensive literature review of WDs with strong cluster associations. To minimize systematics, we restrict our analysis to spectroscopically confirmed hydrogen-atmosphere (DA) WDs consistent with single-stellar origins. We separately analyze a subset with reliable Gaia-based astrometric membership assessments, as well as a full sample that adds WDs with strong cluster associations whose membership cannot be reliably assessed with Gaia. The Gaia-based sample includes 69 spectroscopically confirmed DA WDs, more than doubling the sample size of previous Gaia-based open cluster IFMRs. The full sample, which includes 53 additional literature WDs, increases the total number of cluster WDs by over $50\%$ relative to earlier works. We provide functional forms for both the Gaia-based and full-sample IFMRs. The Gaia-based result useful for $M_i \geq 2.67\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ is $$M_f = \left[0.179 - 0.100 H(M_i-3.84\,\mathrm{M}_\odot) \right ] \times (M_i-3.84\,\mathrm{M}_\odot)+0.628\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$$ where $H(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. Comparing our IFMR to recent literature, we identify significant deviations from best-fit IFMRs derived from both Gaia-based volume limited samples of field WDs and double WD binaries, with the largest discrepancy occurring for initial masses of about $5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The cosmological analysis of DES 3$\times$2pt data from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure</a><span class="id">[2510.24878]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data using predictions from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). Specifically, we fit three two-point observables (3$\times$2pt), galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and cosmic shear, using the one-loop expressions for the projected angular correlation functions. We validate our pipeline against numerical simulations and we check for several internal consistencies before applying it to the observational data. Fixing the spectral tilt and the baryons abundance, we measure $S_8=0.833\pm 0.032$, $\Omega_m = 0.272\pm 0.022$, and $h = 0.773\pm 0.049$, to about $3.8\%$, $8.1\%$, and $6.3\%$, at $68\%$CL, respectively. While our results are consistent within $\lesssim 2\sigma$ with those from Planck and the BOSS full-shape analyses, they exhibit stronger tension with those from DES collaboration 3$\times$2pt analysis combined with a Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis prior, highlighting the impact of modeling, scale cuts, and choice of prior. The theory code and likelihood used for our analyses, \texttt{PyFowl}, is made publicly available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24924" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistical Overview of Long-Lived Active Regions Observed Across Multiple Carrington Rotations</a><span class="id">[2510.24924]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The study of solar active regions (ARs) is of central importance to a range of fundamental science, as well as the practical applications of space weather. Active region emergence and life cycles are two areas of particular interest, yet the lack of consistent full-Sun observations has made long-term studies of active regions difficult. Here, we present results from a study to identify and characterize long-lived active regions (LLARs), defined as those which were observed during at least two consecutive Carrington rotations and which did not undergo significant successive flux emergence once the decay phase began. Such active regions accounted for 13% of all NOAA-identified ARs between 2011 and 2019, and their distribution closely follows the annual sunspot number. This implies that LLARs are produced by the same basic driving processes as regular ARs. LLAR areas tend to be significantly larger and contain more magnetic flux compared to other ARs, but the two categories have similar magnetic complexity distributions. The most striking result, however, is that LLARs are 3-6 times more likely than other ARs to be the source of a solar flare of GOES class C or greater. This highlights the importance of studying what makes a LLAR and how to identify them at emergence with a view towards improved space weather forecasting. The further implications of these findings for AR heating spatial and temporal patterns will be explored in an upcoming study.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fate of Hydrogen and Helium: From Planetary Embryos to Earth- and Neptune-like Worlds</a><span class="id">[2510.24956]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hydrogen, helium, silicates, and iron are key building blocks of rocky and gas-rich planets, yet their chemical interactions remain poorly constrained. Using first-principles molecular dynamics and thermodynamic integration, we quantify hydrogen and helium partitioning between molten silicate mantles and metallic cores for Earth-to-Neptune-mass planets. Hydrogen becomes strongly siderophilic above $\sim$25 GPa but weakens beyond $\sim$200 GPa, whereas helium remains lithophilic yet increasingly soluble in metal with pressure. Incorporating these trends into coupled structure-chemistry models suggests that majority of hydrogen and helium reside in planetary interiors, not atmospheres, with abundances strongly depending on planet mass. Such volatile exchange may influence the redox states of secondary atmospheres, longevity of primordial envelopes, predicted CHNOPS abundances, and emergence of helium-enriched atmospheres, while He 1083 nm and H Lyman-$\alpha$ lines provide potential probes of atmosphere-interior exchange. These findings link atomic-scale interactions to planetary-scale observables, providing new constraints on the origins of Earth-to-Neptune-sized worlds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterization of the Three-Flavor Composition of Cosmic Neutrinos with IceCube</a><span class="id">[2510.24957]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutrinos oscillate over cosmic distances. Using 11.4 years of IceCube data, the flavor composition of the all-sky neutrino flux from 5 TeV–10 PeV is studied. We report the first measurement down to the $\mathcal{O}$(TeV) scale using events classified into three flavor-dependent morphologies. The best fit flavor ratio is $f_e:f_{\mu}:f_{\tau}\,=\,0.30:0.37:0.33$, consistent with the standard three-flavor neutrino oscillation model. Each fraction is constrained to be $&gt;0$ at $&gt;$ 90\% confidence level, assuming a broken power law for cosmic neutrinos. We infer the flavor composition of cosmic neutrinos at their sources, and find production via neutron decay lies outside the 99\% confidence interval.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24962" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Extreme Scattering Event Toward PSR J2313+4253</a><span class="id">[2510.24962]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present evidence of an extreme scattering event (ESE) toward PSR J2313+4253 using high-cadence observations taken with the Green Bank Observatory 20m telescope. The high density of observations in time allow for detailed tracking of the event. We observe a pair of caustic spikes along with the characteristic drop in scintillation bandwidth that is expected during an ESE. This pattern implies that the structures predominantly responsible for scattering occur at different distances than those from previous and subsequent epochs. A secondary spectrum processed during the event shows a detached feature similar to those found in double lensing events from previously observed ESEs. We measure this event as originating from a scattering region with a distance of 1.04(1) kpc, a transverse size of 15 AU, and a duration of approximately 220 days. We model the event using a Gaussian plasma lens, which, when compared to a pure-noise model, is 197 times more probable. These rare events provide opportunities to study the properties of small-scale structures in the ISM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24971" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XRISM/Resolve reveals the complex iron structure of NGC 7213: Evidence for radial stratification between inner disk and broad-line region</a><span class="id">[2510.24971]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first high-resolution X-ray spectrum of NGC 7213 obtained with XRISM/Resolve, supported by simultaneous XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and SOAR optical data. The XRISM spectrum resolves the neutral Fe K$\alpha$ into two components: a narrow core ($\rm FWHM = 650_{-220}^{+240}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) consistent with emission at the dust sublimation radius, and a broader, asymmetric line best described by disk-like emission from $\sim 100\,\rm R_{g}$. This disk component mirrors the profile of the double-peaked H$\alpha$ line observed in the optical. In addition, we detect broadened Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission lines whose inferred locations bridge the gap between the inner disk and the optical broad-line region. The weak narrow Fe K$\alpha$ equivalent width ($\rm EW = 32 \pm 6\,eV$) and absence of a Compton hump imply a low-covering-fraction, Compton-thin torus. Together, these results reveal a radially stratified structure in NGC 7213, spanning nearly four orders of magnitude in radius, and place the source in an intermediate accretion state ($\rm \lambda_{Edd} = 0.001-0.01$) where the inner disk and BLR remain, while the torus shows signs of dissipation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulse profile variations in the accreting X-ray pulsar Vela X-1</a><span class="id">[2510.24973]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Vela X-1 is a well-studied accreting X-ray pulsar, with a distinctive pulse profile that has been found to be very similar in different observations spread out over decades. On the other hand, significant variations down to the timescale of individual pulses have been observed. The physical mechanisms leading to the energy-resolved pulse profile and its variations are not fully understood. Long, uninterrupted observations of Vela X-1 with XMM-Newton in 2000, 2006 and 2019 at different orbital phases allow us to study variations of the pulse properties in the soft X-ray range on all timescales in detail. We aim to characterize and quantify the variations of pulse profiles and individual pulse cycles on all timescales probed, and to identify possible factors driving the observed variations on these timescales. We generated consistent energy-resolved pulse profiles for each observation, as well as profiles built from subsets of individual pulse cycles selected by time, flux, or similarity to the mean profiles. We identified five pulsed phases based on the profile morphology and hardness, and examined the relative contributions over time. To quantify short-timescale variability, we compared individual pulse cycles with synthetic light curves derived from scaled versions of the average profiles. The pulse profile of Vela X-1, when averaged over many pulse cycles, remains remarkably stable, as expected. The most prominent variations between epochs are attributable to changes in absorption. Residual systematic differences are primarily flux-dependent, with profiles showing less variability at higher flux levels. On shorter timescales, most individual pulse cycles resemble the average profile, even though significant, sporadic deviations are also present.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sculpting protoplanetary discs – modelling circumbinary cavities at observable scales with radiation hydrodynamics</a><span class="id">[2510.25010]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of circumbinary discs reveal inner cavities, with their shape and size varying strongly between different systems. The structure of the cavity is determined by the complex interplay between spirals induced by tidal forcing from the binary and the viscous and radiative damping of the spirals at the cavity edge. To fully understand what determines the properties of observed cavities, it is therefore necessary to capture the effect of radiative processes in modelling. To this end, we run 27 simulations of circumbinary discs in 2D using the PLUTO code. These simulations include various size scales, binary eccentricities and thermodynamic models. We find that the diverse cavity shapes are a natural outcome of the radially-varying cooling timescale, as different radiative processes mediate cooling at different disc size regimes. For binaries with separation of a few au, where the cooling timescale is comparable to the orbital timescale at the cavity edge, we recover much more circular cavities than for quickly- or slowly-cooling discs. Our results show that the cavity structure around several binary systems such as Cs Cha and GG Tau can be explained with one physical model, and highlight the importance of radiative cooling in modelling the dynamical evolution of circumbinary discs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physical properties of long-rising type II Supernovae – Bayesian Analytic Modelling and Spectrophotometric Correlations</a><span class="id">[2510.25018]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernova (SN) 1987A, with its long-rising ($\gtrsim$40 days) light curve, defines a rare subclass of type II SNe known as 1987A-like events. Representing only $\sim$1-3\% of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of 1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive 1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i) lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\sim$0.07 M$_\odot$), similar to SN 1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\sim$5 foe) with larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale. An anti-correlation between Ba II line strength and photospheric velocity indicates that stronger Ba II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable and accurate modelling of the growing number of peculiar transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 2025 June 01 Forbush Decrease measured over a range of primary cosmic ray energies</a><span class="id">[2510.25046]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 2025 June 01 Forbush Decrease in the terrestrial ground-level flux of cosmic ray secondaries was recorded by many cosmic ray systems. This was the deepest such decrease, from the quiescent value of the flux, which has been observed in the past two decades. It resulted from a complex series of solar events, none of which on its own reached the most extreme level. The extreme depth of this Decrease has enabled measurements of the flux reduction to be made, which would normally be severely limited by particle counting statistics. In particular, here we examine the Decrease phenomenon over a primary cosmic ray energy range which is rarely accessible, due to the low flux of high energy cosmic rays. This work considers data mainly from a muon telescope system which can respond to both unaccompanied muons and small cosmic ray air showers, providing data from GeV to mid-TeV energies, where the Forbush Decrease ceases to be statistically observable. This paper examines the depth of the flux Decrease, as a fraction below its quiescent value, over that primary energy range. The progressive development of internal time structure in the flux through the seven days of the phenomenon is also demonstrated.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25068" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reconnection nanojets associated with a prominence eruption observed with Solar Orbiter/EUI-HRI</a><span class="id">[2510.25068]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic reconnection is a proposed mechanism for nanojets associated with coronal heating. We investigate the characteristics of reconnection-driven nanojets just before and during a prominence eruption using the High Resolution Imager (HRI) of the Extreme Ultraviolet imager (EUI) aboard Solar Orbiter during its perihelion on September 30, 2024. Extreme UV (EUV) images at unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution from \hrieuv were analysed. The dimensions and propagation speeds of nanojets were estimated and used to estimate the kinetic energies. Nanojet activity was compared with GOES X-ray flux to assess its relation to flare evolution. The high spatial and temporal resolution in the EUV was found to be essential to fully capture the properties and numbers of reconnection nanojets. Approximately 120 nanojets were detected during the eruption, with 40 analysed in detail. Nanojets exhibited lengths of $200 - 5000$ km, widths of $200 - 500$ km and durations of $2-12$ s. Instant velocities ranged from 150 km s$^{-1}- 600~$km s$^{-1}$ with kinetic energies reaching $1.56\times10^{27}$ erg. These nanojets are faster, longer, more energetic and more numerous compared to previous studies. We also find clear signatures of acceleration and deceleration, reflecting magnetic tension release and reach of new equilibria. Reconnection events during the eruption were found to be more frequent and energetically intense. Pre-flare nanojet clustering indicates small-scale reconnection may precede large eruptive activity. These results suggest that nanojets also occur in fully ionised coronal plasma, playing a role in both quiescent and eruptive solar activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25089" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XRISM Spectroscopy of the Stellar-mass Black Hole GRS 1915+105</a><span class="id">[2510.25089]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRS 1915$+$105 was the stellar-mass black hole that best reproduced key phenomena that are also observed in Type-1 active galactic nuclei. In recent years, however, it has evolved to resemble a Type-2 or Compton-thick AGN. Herein, we report on the first XRISM observation of GRS 1915$+$105. The high-resolution Resolve calorimeter spectrum reveals that a sub-Eddington central engine is covered by a layer of warm, Compton-thick gas. With the obscuration acting as a coronagraph, numerous strong, narrow emission lines from He-like and H-like charge states of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni dominate the spectrum. Radiative recombination continuum (RRC) features are also observed, signaling that much of the emitting gas is photoionized. The line spectrum can be fit by three photoionized emission zones, with broadening and bulk velocities suggestive of an origin in the outer disk atmosphere and/or a slow wind at $r \simeq 10^{6}~GM/c^{2}$. The Fe XXV He-$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI Ly-$\alpha$ lines have a broad base that may indicate some emission from $r \sim 3\times 10^{3}~GM/c^{2}$. These results broadly support a picture wherein the current state in GRS 1915$+$105 is due to obscuration by the irradiated outer disk. This could arise through disk thickening if the Eddington fraction is higher than inferred, but it is more likely due to a warped, precessing disk that has brought the outer disk into the line of sight. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this interpretation and our modeling, and possible explanations of some potentially novel spectral features.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Systematic Search for Gaseous Debris Disks in DESI Early Data Release White Dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2510.25097]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detecting gaseous debris disks around white dwarfs offers a unique window into the ultimate fate of planetary systems and the composition of accreted planetary material.

The detected emission lines are predominantly weak and require confirmation by follow-up observations. Three of these candidates also exhibit infrared excess in WISE photometry, suggesting a possible coexistence of gas and dust. However, the high candidate rate indicates that most are likely false positives due to telluric residuals or unresolved binaries. This work demonstrates the potential of DESI spectra for blind searches of rare circumstellar phenomena. The recently released DESI DR1, with its substantially larger spectroscopic sample, will enable searches for more gaseous disks and provide better insights into their occurrence and nature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25158" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multifaceted Accretion: The Interplay of Turbulence, Resistivity, Thermal Transport, and Dust around Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2510.25158]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accretion near black holes (BHs) is multidimensional, with turbulence, resistivity, thermal transport, and dust dynamics all playing essential roles. In cold accretion discs (ADs) or the region of an AD where magnetic fields (MFs) are negligible (or absent), hydrodynamic (HD) turbulence is probably dominating. However, Magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is the primary cause of turbulence in ADs. Significant velocity variations and rapid pressure changes are characteristics of turbulent flows, which allow better mixing and more angular momentum (AM) and energy transfer. Also, in accretion flow (AF), the interaction between turbulence and resistivity determines the efficiency of energy dissipation and heat transfer. Radiation, convection, and thermal conduction (TC) are the heat transport modes existing in AFs, where TC enables energy transfer in accreting materials via heat flux. Moreover, convection, also generated by turbulence, significantly impacts the stability of the AD and its vertical structure. The disc may be affected by radiation from the AD surrounding the BH when X-ray emission occurs. The emission from the disc is also affected by dust particles. Dust grains near BH are exposed to high temperatures and intense radiation, which might affect the flow characteristics, as seen in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This chapter highlights the combined effect of turbulence, resistivity, transport mechanisms, and dust particles on BH AF. Future studies in this field must thoroughly investigate how dust, transport mechanisms, and turbulence interact in the BH accretion system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Physical and Chemical Characteristics of an Extremely Early Class 0 Protostar in G204.4-11.3A2-NE</a><span class="id">[2510.25230]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have observed the low-mass molecular cloud core G204.4-11.3A2-NE (G204NE) in the direction of Orion B giant molecular cloud with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Band 6. The $\rm 1.3\ mm$ continuum images and visibilities unveil a compact central structure with a radius of $\sim$12 au, while showing no signature of binarity down to 18 au. The bolometric temperature and luminosity of this source are derived to be ${\sim}$33 K and $\sim$1.15 $~L_{\odot}$, respectively. Chemical stratification is observed in dense gas tracers, with C$^{18}$O emission peaking at the continuum position surrounded by the spatially extended emission of N$_2$D$^+$ and DCO$^+$. This implies that the core is in a very early evolutionary stage in which $\rm CO$ depletion occurs in most regions except for a small area heated by the central source. The envelope kinematics indicates a rotating and infalling structure with a central protostar mass of 0.08-0.1 $M_{\odot}$. The protostar drives a collimated outflow traced by CO, SiO, SO, and H$_2$CO, with misaligned blueshifted and redshifted lobes exhibiting a pair of bow-like patterns. High-velocity jets, extending up to 720 au, are detected in CO, SiO, and SO lines. The jet launching region is likely within twice of the dust sublimation zone. The absence of a binary signature suggests the outflows and jets are driven by a single protostar, although a close binary cannot be ruled out. The observed deflection of the outflows and jet is likely due to turbulent accretion in a moderately magnetized core.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of accretion disc-corona in the TDE Candidate AT 2019avd</a><span class="id">[2510.25247]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT 2019avd show drastic variabilities in flux and spectral shape over hundreds of days, providing clues on the accretion disc-corona evolution. We utilize a disc-corona model, in which a fraction of the gravitational energy released in the disc is transported into the hot corona above/below. Some soft photons emitted from the disc are upscattered to X-ray photons by the hot electrons in the optically thin corona. By fitting the NICER observations of AT 2019avd during epochs when the spectra exhibit significant hardening, we derive the evolution of the mass accretion rate, $\dot{m}$, and the coronal energy fraction, $f$. Our results show that $f$ decreases with increasing $\dot{m}$, which is qualitatively consistent with that observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), while the slope of this source, $f\propto \dot{m}^{-0.30}$, is much shallower than that of AGNs. We also find that the non-thermal X-ray spectrum in this source is significantly softer than those typically seen in AGNs and black-hole X-ray binaries. We argue that these quantitative differences can be a powerful diagnostic of the underlying magnetic turbulence, which may imply a stronger magnetic field within the TDE accretion disc than that in typical AGNs. It is also found that the evolution of the fitted neutral hydrogen column density follows a similar pattern to that of the accretion rate evolution, which may reflect the accumulation of absorbing material originating from the inflowing streams of stellar debris and/or other related sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Dual-Resolution Prescription in the $S_N$ Method for Boltzmann Neutrino Transport I: Proof of Principle and the Resolution of Collision Term</a><span class="id">[2510.25274]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a dual-resolution prescription meant for the Boltzmann neutrino transport, in which the advection and collision terms are calculated with different angular resolutions in momentum space. The purpose is to address the issue of the low resolution that afflicts the $S_N$ method in the multi-dimensional neutrino transport simulations for core-collapse supernovae. We handle with a high resolution the advection term alone, assuming that the collision term does not require such high resolutions. To confirm this surmise as well as our new conversion scheme, from low- to high-angular resolutions and vice versa, we run a couple of experimental one-zone (in space) simulations. Neutrino scatterings on nucleons are considered with small recoils fully taken into account whereas the advection term is replaced by the angle- and energy-dependent source terms that are designed to mimic the results of a Boltzmann simulation, inducing the anisotropy in momentum space. For the conversion from a low-resolution distribution function to a high-resolution one, we employ a polynomial interpolations in the zenith and azimuth directions separately with the number conservation and continuity (and periodicity only in the azimuth direction). We find that this dual-resolution scheme works well and that the current angular resolution employed in the canonical supernova simulations with our Boltzmann solver or a bit better in the $\phi_\nu$ direction will be sufficient for the collision terms if they are coupled with the advection terms calculated with a high-angular resolution via this prescription.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial black hole formation from the merger of oscillons</a><span class="id">[2510.25300]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that the merger of oscillons results in a broad spectrum of the oscillon mass.

Using the criterion for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation from the oscillon collapse obtained in previous studies, we estimate the abundance of PBHs and conclude that a sizable number of PBHs can be produced from oscillons.

In contrast, no rings have been observed around any inner Solar System objects. To constrain the dynamical origin of this ringed-versus-ringless dichotomy, we employ a numerically cross-checked analytical model of gigayear-scale Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag due to the solar flux acting on an isolated particle, expressed as a function of the host body's heliocentric distance \(\,a_{\mathrm{pla}}\) and the particle radius \(\,r_{\mathrm{par}}\). Here we show that, in the absence of additional perturbations, PR drag alone can explain the observed ring architecture of the Solar System: outer planets and Centaurs/TNOs are able to retain rings for the age of the Solar System, whereas any rings around the inner planets are removed on much shorter timescales. Because the PR-drag lifetime scales steeply with heliocentric distance \(\bigl(\tau_{\mathrm{decay}}\propto a_{\mathrm{pla}}^{2} \,r_{\mathrm{par}}\bigr)\), we predict that forthcoming surveys will reveal an ever-growing population of ring-bearing bodies in the distant Solar System.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BEBOP VIII.

Comparisons of the physical and orbital parameters between the circumbinary planet population and the population of exoplanets orbiting single stars will reveal how these disc perturbations affect the assembly of planets. Circumbinary exoplanets detected thus far typically have masses $&lt; 3 \,\rm M_{jup}$ raising the question of whether high-mass circumbinary planets are possible, and also whether population features such as the brown dwarf desert would appear in circumbinary configurations like for single star systems. Here, we report observations taken with the SOPHIE high-resolution spectrograph. These observations reveal an $m_{\rm b}\,\sin i_{\rm b} = 20.9 \,\rm M_{jup}$ outer companion, on an eccentric ($e = 0.43$), $1800\,\rm d$ orbit, which we call BEBOP-4 (AB) b. Using dynamical arguments we constrain the true mass $m_{\rm b}&lt; 26.3 \,\rm M_{jup}$. The inner binary's two eclipsing stellar components have masses $M_{\rm A} = 1.51\,\rm M_\odot$, and $M_{\rm B} = 0.46\,\rm M_\odot$. Their orbital period is $72\,\rm d$, and their eccentricity is $0.27$. This system contains the longest period binary surveyed by the BEBOP project. BEBOP-4b is expected to be detectable using Gaia DR4 single epoch astrometric measurements. Despite a large period ratio of $\sim 25:1$, the substantial eccentricities of both orbits mean that the outer orbit is on the edge of orbital stability, and located in between two destabilising secular resonances. Should the outer companion survive, the BEBOP-4 system appears like a precursor to several post-common envelope binaries exhibiting eclipse timing variations where very massive circumbinary companions have been proposed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling multiphase plasma in the corona: prominences and rain</a><span class="id">[2510.25336]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We review major achievements in our understanding of multiphase coronal plasma, where cool-dense and hot-tenuous matter coexists, brought about by advances in modeling and theory, inspired by observations.

Here, we introduce a new method for determining $n(z)$ for weak lensing surveys based on high-quality redshifts and neural network-based importance weights. Additionally, we present the first unified photometric redshift calibration of the three leading stage-III weak lensing surveys, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey and the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), with state-of-the-art spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We verify our method using a new, data-driven approach and obtain $n(z)$ constraints with statistical uncertainties of order $\sigma_{\bar z} \sim 0.01$ and smaller. Our analysis is largely independent of previous photometric redshift calibrations and, thus, provides an important cross-check in light of recent cosmological tensions. Overall, we find excellent agreement with previously published results on the DES Y3 and HSC Y1 data sets while there are some differences on the mean redshift with respect to the previously published KiDS-1000 results. We attribute the latter to mismatches in photometric noise properties in the COSMOS field compared to the wider KiDS SOM-gold catalog. At the same time, the new $n(z)$ estimates for KiDS do not significantly change estimates of cosmic structure growth from cosmic shear. Finally, we discuss how our method can be applied to future weak lensing calibrations with DESI data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unusual periodic modulation in the radio emission of the methane dwarf binary WISEP J101905.63+652954.2</a><span class="id">[2510.25475]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Brown dwarfs display Jupiter-like auroral phenomena, such as rotationally modulated electron cyclotron maser radio emission. Radio observations of cyclotron maser emission can be used to measure their magnetic field strength, topology, and to deduce the presence of magnetically interacting exoplanets. Observations of the coldest brown dwarfs (spectral types T and Y) are especially intriguing, as their magnetospheric phenomena could closely resemble those of gas-giant exoplanets. Here we report observations made over ten epochs, amounting to 44 hours, of WISEP J101905.63+652954.2 (J1019+65 hereinafter) using the LOFAR telescope between 120 and 168 MHz. J1019+65 is a methane dwarf binary (T5.5+T7) whose radio emission was originally detected in a single-epoch LOFAR observation to be highly circular polarised and rotationally modulated at $\approx 3$h. Unexpectedly, our long-term monitoring reveals an additional periodic signature at $\approx 0.787$h. We consider several explanations for the second period and suggest that it could be the rotationally modulated emission of the second brown dwarf in the binary, although follow-up infrared observations are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In addition, the data also allow us to statistically estimate the duty cycle and observed radio-loud fraction of the 120-168 MHz cyclotron emission from methane dwarfs to be $\langle D \rangle = 0.030^{+0.034}_{-0.030}$ and $F^{'}_{\rm radio} = 0.088^{+0.168}_{-0.088}$ respectively.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25476" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coronal electron density: Insights from radio and in situ observations, and EUHFORIA modeling</a><span class="id">[2510.25476]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The distribution of the coronal electron density at different distances from the Sun strongly influences the physical processes in the solar corona and is therefore a very important topic in solar physics. Most methods, including radio observations, used for estimating coronal electron density were not fully validated due to the absence of in situ observations closer to the Sun. Consequently, space weather forecasting models that simulate coronal density lacked proper validation. Newly available PSP in situ observations at distances close to the Sun provide an opportunity to study plasma properties near the Sun and to compare observational and modeling results. This work studies type III bursts, estimates their propagation path, and validates coronal electron density obtained from radio, in situ observations, and modeling with EUHFORIA. Type III bursts observed during the second PSP perihelion are analyzed using radio triangulation and modeling. We determine 3D positions of radio sources and use EUHFORIA to estimate electron densities at various locations. The electron densities derived from radio observations and EUHFORIA modeling are inter-validated with in situ PSP measurements. We studied 11 type III bursts during the second PSP perihelion, with radio triangulation showing propagation paths southward from the solar ecliptic plane. Radio source sizes ranged from 0.5 to 40 deg (0.5 to 25 Rs) with no clear frequency dependence, indicating that scattering of radio waves was not very significant. Comparison of electron densities from radio triangulation, PSP data, and EUHFORIA modeling showed a large range of values, influenced by different propagation paths and model limitations. Despite these variations, EUHFORIA identified high-density regions along type III burst paths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25489" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on Cosmic Birefringence from SPIDER, Planck, and ACT observations</a><span class="id">[2510.25489]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Early Dark Energy (EDE) model has been proposed as a candidate mechanism to generate cosmic birefringence through a Chern-Simons coupling between a dynamical scalar field and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photon. Such birefringence induces a nonzero cross-correlation between the CMB $E$- and $B$-modes, providing a direct observational signature of parity violation. Recent measurements of the $EB$ and $TB$ power spectra, however, cannot yet unambiguously separate instrumental miscalibration ($\alpha$) from a true cosmic-rotation angle ($\beta$). For this reason, we perform a model-independent analysis in terms of the total effective rotation angle $\alpha+\beta$. We analyze the latest $EB$ and $TB$ measurements from the SPIDER, Planck, and ACT experiments and derive constraints on the Chern-Simons coupling constant $gM_{Pl}$ and on the polarization rotation angle $\alpha+\beta$. We find that the coupling $gM_{Pl}$ is not compatible with the SPIDER data, while it provides reasonable fits to the Planck and ACT measurements. The fits for $\alpha+\beta$ prefer a value larger than zero: when combined, Planck+ACT yield a detection significance of approximately 7$\sigma$. We also find that ACT data alone do not provide sufficiently tight constraints on either $gM_{Pl}$ or $\alpha+\beta$, whereas the combination Planck+ACT improves the statistical consistency of ACT's high-$\ell$ results and leads to a better PTE for those measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The R-Process Alliance: Exploring the cosmic scatter among ten r-process sites with stellar abundances</a><span class="id">[2510.25500]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The astrophysical origin of the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), which produces about half of the elements heavier than iron, remains uncertain.

We present a homogeneous chemical abundance analysis of ten r-process-enhanced, metal-poor stars that show strong enrichment in r-process elements with minimal contamination from other nucleosynthetic sources. Using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra, we examined over 1400 absorption lines per star through equivalent width measurements and spectral synthesis under one-dimensional LTE assumptions with the MOOG radiative transfer code. Abundances for 54 chemical species were derived, including 29 neutron-capture elements spanning the full r-process pattern. We quantified the cosmic scatter of elemental ratios relative to Zr (light) and Eu (heavy) and found remarkably small dispersions for the rare-earth and third-peak elements, {\sigma}[La/Eu] = 0.08 dex and {\sigma}[Os/Eu] = 0.11 dex, while the light-to-heavy ratio shows slightly larger variation, {\sigma}[Zr/Eu] = 0.18 dex.

In this paper, we aim at assessing the consistency between line-of-sight (LoS) velocity measurements from the two instruments. Reliable measurements of up and down flows from SO/PHI are crucial and unique when Solar Orbiter is facing the far side of the Sun. Also, a combination of measurements from two vantage points to study horizontal flows must rely on consistent observations. For this purpose, we compare the LoS velocity measured by SO/PHI's High Resolution Telescope (SO/PHI-HRT) and SDO/HMI on 29 March 2023, when Solar Orbiter was crossing the Sun-Earth line at a distance of 0.39 au from the Sun. Because such co-alignments are rare, this configuration offered an almost unique opportunity to directly compare data products from both telescopes. The data are aligned and remapped to allow a pixel-by-pixel comparison of the whole time series of 4 hours length. Temporal and spatial variations are considered for a direct combination of the measurements. The LoS velocity distributions are evaluated and a clear linear relation is found between the two instruments with a slope of 0.94 and a correlation of 90%. We find that the signals form at similar heights, with a separation of 10$\pm$12 km, which is larger than previous estimates. A close-up look at the penumbra of a sunspot and its Evershed flow is presented.

The planet's pericenter is initially $60\%$ of the stellar radius and is fully engulfed after tens of orbits. Once inside the stellar envelope, the planet generates pressure disturbances that steepen into shocks, ejecting material from the envelope.

A prolonged hydrogen recombination plateau appears when the ejecta cools to about $10^4\,\rm{K}$. The late-time rapid dimming of the light curve follows dust formation, which obscures the radiation.

We present one-dimensional distributions of masses and spins, explore their correlations, and examine their evolution with redshift. These features may reflect astrophysical processes associated with binary black hole formation channels, although most remain poorly constrained. A notable feature is a peak near $10M_\odot$ in the primary mass and $8M_\odot$ in the chirp mass. Additionally, the primary and secondary masses correlate uniquely, producing pronounced peaks in the chirp mass around $14M_\odot$ and $27M_\odot$. The three peaks are roughly separated by a factor of two. A simple explanation for such well-placed peaks is a hierarchical merger scenario, in which the first peak arises from mergers of black holes of stellar origin, and higher-mass peaks arise from repeated mergers of black holes from lower-mass peaks. Although most binaries do not exhibit the high spins and characteristic mass ratios expected from hierarchical mergers, those that do are associated with the peaks observed in the chirp mass distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining baryonic feedback and cosmology from DES Y3 and Planck PR4 6$\times$2pt data.

We constrain the contribution of the precessional instability to tidal dissipation and heat transport, using Cartesian hydrodynamical simulations in a small patch of a planet, and study its interaction with turbulent convection, modelled as rotating Rayleigh-Bénard convection. The precessional instability without convection results in laminar flow at low values and turbulent flow at sufficiently high values of $\mathrm{Po}$. The associated tidal dissipation rate scales as $\mathrm{Po}^2$ and $\mathrm{Po}^3$ in each regime, respectively. With convection, the Poincaré number at which turbulent flow is achieved shifts to lower values for stronger convective driving. Convective motions also act on large-scale tidal flows like an effective viscosity, resulting in continuous tidal dissipation (scaling as $\mathrm{Po}^2$), which obfuscates or suppresses tidal dissipation due to precessional instability. The effective viscosities obtained agree with scaling laws previously derived using (rotating) mixing-length theory. By evaluating our scaling laws using interior models of Hot Jupiters, we find that the precessional instability is significantly more efficient than the effective viscosity of convection. The former drives alignment in 1 Gyr for a Jupiter-like planet orbiting within 23 days. Linearly excited inertial waves can be even more effective for wider orbits, aligning spins for orbits within 53-142 days.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25636" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observations of the Relationship between Magnetic Anisotropy and Mode Composition in Low-$β$ Solar Wind Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2510.25636]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Turbulence is a ubiquitous process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales, thereby influencing particle transport and heating. Recent progress has improved our understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence with respect to the mean magnetic field; however, its exact form and implications for magnetic topology and energy transfer remain unclear. In this Letter, we investigate the nature of magnetic anisotropy in compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence within low-$\beta$ solar wind using Cluster spacecraft measurements. By decomposing small-amplitude fluctuations into Alfvén and compressible modes, we reveal that the anisotropy is strongly mode dependent: quasi-parallel (`slab') energy contains both Alfvén and compressible modes, whereas quasi-perpendicular (`two-dimensional'; 2D) energy is almost purely Alfvénic, a feature closely linked to collisionless damping of compressible modes. These findings elucidate the physical origin of the long-standing `slab+2D' empirical model and offer a new perspective on the turbulence cascade across the full three-dimensional wavevector space.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observing Orbital Decay in the Ultracompact Hot Subdwarf Binary System ZTFJ213056.71+442046.5</a><span class="id">[2510.25653]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultracompact Galactic binary systems (UCBs) emit low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). The emission of GWs is causing these systems to lose angular momentum, which is detectable by observing an orbital period decay. ZTFJ213056.71+442046.5 (ZTFJ2130) is an UCB with a period of 39.3401(1) minutes consisting of a Roche lobe-filling hot subdwarf and a white dwarf companion. We attempt to measure the orbital decay rate $\dot{P}$ caused by GW emission of ZTFJ2130 and predict the expected GW signal for LISA. High-speed photometry was conducted using the FLI Kepler KL4040FI CMOS camera, mounted to the 1.2-meter Oskar Lühning telescope at the Hamburg Observatory as well as the Hamamatsu ORCA-Quest 2 qCMOS camera at the 1.23-meter telescope at CAHA in Spain. ZTFJ2130 was observed on six nights between August 2024 and September 2025. The obtained lightcurves combined with previous high-cadence observations were used to conduct an O-C timing analysis. Additionally, we employed the LISA data analysis tool ldasoft to model the expected GW data. We measure a period change of $(-1.97\pm0.05)\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{ss^{-1}}$. Assuming only GW emission, this result was used to calculate a chirp mass of $(0.408\pm0.006)\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. From ldasoft we predict that LISA will be able to measure the chirp mass with an uncertainty of 5%. We measure $\dot{P}$ with an uncertainty of only 2% and show that modern (q)CMOS detectors are well suited to provide precise timing measurements, enabling the measurement of the orbital decay of UCBs with high precision with modest size telescopes. The derived orbital decay is fully consistent with predictions from spectral and lightcurve modeling. We show that future observations with LISA can potentially provide a deviation from only gravitational wave effects, e.g. due to accretion, if the effect is sufficiently large.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25672" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morphological Zoo of Inflationary Gravitational Wave Spectra imprinted by a Sequence of Post-Inflationary Epochs</a><span class="id">[2510.25672]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The expansion history of the Universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) remains largely unconstrained. The high-energy post-inflationary era may involve multiple distinct epochs, each characterized by a different equation of state (EoS). A key prediction of inflation is the generation of tensor perturbations that later manifest as a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The large-scale amplitude and small-scale spectral tilt ($n_{\rm GW}$) of these GWs encode the inflationary energy scale and the subsequent expansion history, respectively. A soft post-inflationary EoS ($w&lt;1/3$) yields red-tilted GW spectra ($n_{\rm GW}&lt;0$), while a stiff EoS ($w&gt;1/3$) results in a blue-tilt ($n_{\rm GW}&gt;0$). In our previous work [ arXiv:2407.07956 ], we developed an analytical framework for computing the GW spectral energy density, $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$, for multiple post-inflationary transitions ($w_1 \to w_2 \to \cdots \to w_n \to 1/3$), focusing on the parameter space relevant for future GW observations. In this paper, we extend that framework to systematically investigate the $morphological~diversity$ of inflationary GW spectra generated by multi-epoch post-inflationary histories. Remaining model agnostic, we demonstrate that a wide variety of spectral shapes, ranging from convex and concave monotonic profiles to multi-peaked non-monotonic spectra, can naturally emerge depending on the sequence and duration of these epochs. We also introduce GWInSpect, a publicly available Python package that computes $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$ for arbitrary sequences of EoS transitions, providing a practical tool to study the pre-BBN expansion history of the Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Engulfment of a hot Jupiter as a possible origin of the rapid spin and internal spin misalignment of the planet-hosting red giant Kepler-56</a><span class="id">[2510.25680]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A recent asteroseismic analysis suggests that Kepler-56 – a planet-hosting red giant – exhibits a unique spin structure: (1) the spin axes of the core and envelope are misaligned; and (2) the envelope rotates approximately an order of magnitude faster than typical red giants. In this paper, we investigate a feasible scenario to reproduce this spin structure by estimating the amount of the angular momentum (AM) supply from the planets through the simplified calculation of the time evolution of AM. As a result, unless the tidal efficiency is extremely high, we show that the tidal interactions between the known close-in planets (Kepler-56 b and c) are insufficient to supply the AM required to accelerate Kepler-56 from the spin rate observed in typical red giants. We also show that the engulfment of a hot Jupiter can be expected to provide sufficient AM supply for the acceleration ant that the mass and orbit of the engulfed hot Jupiter are constrained by a mass of 0.5-2 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 1-6 days. On the other hand, if Kepler 56 was already rapidly spinning before entering the RG stage and requires no acceleration, the obliquity damping by the known close-in planets can reproduce the spin structure of Kepler-56. Even in such cases, planetary engulfment during the MS stage might be involved in achieving rapid spin before the tidal alignment. These discussions demonstrate the importance of Kepler-56 as a candidate for planetary engulfment that may leave traces of its spin structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25690" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Light-Cone Approach to Higher-Order Cosmological Observables</a><span class="id">[2510.25690]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a second-order cosmological perturbation theory on a background geometry expressed in terms of light-cone coordinates, extending the first-order analyses available in the literature.

Through a consistent matching procedure, we identify the second-order gauge fixing that corresponds to the non-linear Geodesic Light-Cone gauge within standard perturbation theory, known as the Observational Synchronous Gauge. We then emphasize its conceptual similarities and differences wrt the standard Synchronous Gauge. Finally, within this new perturbative framework, and adopting a fully gauge-invariant approach, we compute the luminosity distance-redshift relation up to second order with anisotropic stress as seen by a free-falling observer. Remarkably, we show how divergences at the observer position can be eliminated in a completely model independent way. These results validate our perturbative framework and establish it as a novel formalism for evaluating cosmological observables at second order.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Constraints from Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Cluster Lensing and Abundances with Simulation-based Forward-Modeling</a><span class="id">[2510.25706]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a simulation-based forward-modeling framework for cosmological inference from optical galaxy-cluster samples, and apply it to the abundance and weak-lensing signals of DES-Y1 redMaPPer clusters.

The radiative transfer within the emitting region and the structure of the latter are calculated with the use of the self-consistent algorithm developed earlier. The magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on the photon energy and polarization have been incorporated. Second-order bulk Comptonization over entire emitting region, induced Compton scattering, the switching of the polarization modes, free-free processes, the cyclotron emission because of electron-proton collisions, and a realistic shape of the accretion channel have been taken into account. The case of a dipole magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect can play a notable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock zone. Within the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than in the post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons, gained the energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the thermal Doppler effect, are responsible for the formation of high-energy regions in the emergent continuum of the polarization modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spherically Symmetric Quantum-Corrected Black Holes with String Clouds: A Multi-Observable Analysis</a><span class="id">[2510.25764]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an investigation of quantum-corrected black hole spacetimes coupled with clouds of strings, examining two distinct theoretical models that incorporate quantum gravitational effects through different implementations of correction terms.

The analysis reveals fundamental modifications to particle trajectories that distinguish quantum-corrected solutions from their classical counterparts, with observable implications for high-energy astrophysics. We investigate quasi-periodic oscillations arising from test particle motion, deriving frequency relationships that could serve as observational probes of quantum gravity effects in accreting black hole systems. Through rigorous gravitational lensing analysis using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate weak-field deflection angles and identify distinctive signatures that enable discrimination between the two quantum correction models. The gravitational lensing study reveals opposite dependencies on quantum parameters between the models, providing unambiguous observational discriminants. Additionally, we analyze the thermodynamic properties including temperature, entropy, and heat capacity modifications, exploring topological characteristics and phase transition behavior in these quantum-corrected systems. The investigation reveals that the two models exhibit contrasting behaviors across multiple observational channels, from gravitational lensing deflection angles to quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies, providing remarkable discriminants for testing quantum gravity theories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comparison of Australasian tektites with Australasian microtektites and BeLaU spherules recovered from the ocean</a><span class="id">[2510.24743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Australasian strewn field covers more than 15% of Earth's surface, consisting of tektites and microtektites.

For the first time, we employ a Bayesian framework to assess the detectability and distinguishing features of such an SGWB with spaceborne detectors, while accounting for contamination from the Galactic foreground. Our analysis covers eccentric SBBHs from three formation channels: isolated binary evolution, dynamical assembly in globular clusters (GCs), and in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We find that TianQin, LISA, and Taiji can detect the SGWBs from both isolated and GC-formed SBBHs after 4 years of operation, with the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios of around 10, 60, and 170. However, these backgrounds are spectrally degenerate with a strictly power-law SGWB. Furthermore, highly eccentric SBBHs formed in AGNs yield an SGWB marked by a spectral turnover and sharp decline. While this feature lowers the signal-to-noise ratio by approximately an order of magnitude, it can enable a clear distinction from the strictly power-law background using LISA and Taiji.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matter Sourced Bubble Nucleation in the Asymmetron Scalar-Tensor Theory</a><span class="id">[2510.25499]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate how matter density distributions affect thin-wall bubble formation in the asymmetron mechanism, a scalar-tensor theory with a universal coupling to matter and explicit symmetry-breaking, and analyse the stability of its metastable state. We show that the screening mechanism of the asymmetron inside dense objects induces a surface tension associated with the boundary of the screening object, leading to a richer class of bubble solutions than the standard Coleman-Callan bulk nucleation. These boundary surface tensions are used to modify the Nambu-Goto action for instantons, allowing for the computation of the corresponding Euclidean action for bubbles nucleating on flat planes, as well as on concave and convex cylindrical surfaces. We find that the smallest Euclidean action occurs for bubbles nucleating along the edge of a concave spherical surface. Comparing this edge nucleation channel with the bulk one, we determine the maximum curvature radius for which concave edge nucleation is preferred. Since the maximum radius of curvature is exponentially suppressed by the action of a bulk bubble, we find that within the regime of the instanton approximation, edge nucleation is always preferred. This is largely due to the weak couplings of the asymmetron. We apply these findings to determine the maximum curvature radius of a cosmic void and discuss how our results affect the seeding of $N$-body simulations of asymmetron domains, showing that domain wall nucleation preferentially occurs at the edges of cosmological voids. We also demonstrate that the presence of a homogeneous gas around the dense substrates reduces the maximum curvature radius, enabling bulk bubbles to form preferentially as the asymmetron undergoes a density-driven phase transition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Non-Axisymmetric Hall Instabilities in a Rotating Plasma</a><span class="id">[2510.25532]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Non-axisymmetric, flow-driven instabilities in the incompressible Hall-MHD model are studied in a differentially rotating cylindrical plasma.

However, HI intensity mapping (IM) experiments will suffer the loss of long-wavelength line-of-sight HI modes in the foreground subtraction process. This significantly reduces HI IM cross-correlations with projected large-scale structure tracers, such as CMB secondary anisotropies. Here we propose a cross-bispectrum estimator, $B^{\bar \kappa \delta T_{21} \delta T_{21}},$ to recover the cross-correlation of the HI IM field, $\delta T_{21},$ with the CMB lensing field, $\kappa,$ constructed by correlating the position-dependent HI power spectrum with the mean overdensity traced by CMB lensing. We study the cross-bispectrum estimator in the squeezed limit and forecast its detectability based on HI IM measurements from HIRAX and CMB lensing measurements from Advanced ACT. We find that $B^{\bar \kappa \delta T_{21}\delta T_{21}},$ in combination with the HI IM and CMB lensing auto-spectra, can place sub-percent constraints on the growth rate of fluctuations, $f,$ and the small scale amplitude of fluctuations, $ \sigma_8.$ The cross-bispectrum, in combination with the auto-spectra and Planck priors, improves dark energy constraints to 0.025 on $w_0$ and 0.11 on $w_a$ for flat models. These results are robust to HI foreground removal because they derive from small-scale HI modes. The HI-CMB lensing cross-bispectrum thus provides a novel way to recover HI correlations with CMB lensing and constrain cosmological parameters at a level that is competitive with next-generation galaxy redshift surveys. As a striking example of this, we find a tight constraint of 27.8 meV (29.0 meV) on the sum of neutrino masses, while varying all redshift and standard cosmological parameters within a flat $\Lambda$CDM ($w_0w_a$CDM) model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Radio Counterpart to the Fast X-ray Transient EP240414a</a><span class="id">[2409.19055]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Despite being operational for only a short time, the Einstein Probe mission, with its large field of view and rapid localisation capabilities, has already significantly advanced the study of rapid variability in the soft X-ray sky.

The radio emission at $3\,\rm{GHz}$ peaks at $\sim30$ days post explosion and with a spectral luminosity $\sim2\times10^{30}\,\rm{erg}\,\rm{s}^{-1}\,\rm{Hz}^{-1}$, similar to what is seen from long gamma-ray bursts, and distinct from other extra-galactic transients including supernovae and tidal disruption events, although we cannot completely rule out emission from engine driven stellar explosions e.g. the fast blue optical transients. An equipartition analysis of our radio data reveals that an outflow with at least a moderate bulk Lorentz factor ($\Gamma\gtrsim1.6$) with a minimum energy of $\sim10^{48}\,\rm{erg}$ is required to explain our observations. The apparent lack of reported gamma-ray counterpart to EP240414a could suggest that an off-axis or choked jet could be responsible for the radio emission, although a low luminosity gamma-ray burst may have gone undetected.

The amides may have formed by hydrothermal alteration of carboxylic acids and amines on Ryugu's parent body or by irradiation of 15N-depleted N-bearing ice in the outer Solar System or interstellar medium. Such amides delivered by primitive small bodies may have contributed to prebiotic chemistry on early Earth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Energy Spectrum of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays across Declinations $-90^\circ$ to $+44.8^\circ$ as measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory</a><span class="id">[2506.11688]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The energy spectrum of cosmic rays above 2.5 EeV has been measured across the declination range $-90^\circ \leq\delta\leq +44.8^\circ$ using data from $\sim 310{,}000$ events accrued at the Pierre Auger Observatory from an exposure of $(104{,}900\pm 3{,}100)$ km$^2\,$sr$\,$yr.

We compare LambdaCDM, wCDM, and w_0w_aCDM models to evaluate how the choice of data basis and the width of the prior on w_a affect dark-energy inference. Ratio-only fits (D_M/D_H) amplify the (w_0, w_a) degeneracy and can produce large apparent shifts in point estimates without genuine evidence for dynamical dark energy. Joint fits using (D_V/r_d, D_M/D_H) restore parameter consistency and show that these shifts mainly trace the degeneracy ridge. The pivoted equation of state, w_p = w(a_p) \simeq -0.9 \pm 0.1 at z_p \simeq 0.34, remains stable and consistent with a cosmological constant within 1sigma. Model-selection diagnostics (AIC, BIC, and Bayes factors) provide only moderate support for LambdaCDM, indicating no significant evidence for an evolving w(a).

The precession is commonly attributed to the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect, which arises from the BH's rotation twisting the surrounding spacetime and accretion flow. In the strongly magnetized regime, which is preferred accretion flow conditions for M 87$^*$ and likely other jet-producing systems, the large-scale magnetic field can significantly influence the flow dynamics. Here, we perform large-scale three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted accretion onto a rotating BH, and find a never-seen-before new retrograde precession. This precession arises from a magnetic torque on the disk generated by the poloidal magnetic field aligned with the BH's rotation, opposing the LT torque. This finding highlights the unique property of highly magnetized accretion flows around BHs and provides a new interpretation of jet precession observed in many systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Radio Bursts from non-resonant Alfvén waves and synchrotron maser emission in the magnetar wind</a><span class="id">[2508.05840]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Non-resonant interactions between Alfvén waves and a relativistic plasma result in the formation of the population inversions necessary for synchrotron maser emission (SME) across a wide range of magnetisations and temperatures.

However, the contribution of hard X-rays (HXR; 3–20 keV)-which penetrate deeper into planetary atmospheres-to mass loss and particle acceleration has remained poorly understood. To quantify the HXR share of the total radiative budget, we conducted quasi-simultaneous observations of the active M-dwarf AU Mic using NuSTAR, Swift, and the Einstein Probe. Our analysis detected two major flares, and we performed an empirical check by deriving a quiescent-phase soft X-ray (SXR; 0.3–3 keV)-HXR relation and then applying it to the flares. By combining this with the quiescent coronal SXR-EUV relations conversion of J. Sanz-Forcada et al. (2011), we computed the total high-energy flux (EUV + SXR + HXR) and assessed the relative role of HXR in atmospheric escape. We find that HXR accounts for only a few percent of the total radiative energy budget during both quiescent and flaring states. While a high-energy spectral tail is detected in the second flare, time-resolved spectroscopy reveals a dominant chromospheric-evaporation signature, indicating that the flare energetics are primarily thermal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Very high-energy gamma-ray and neutrino emission from hadronic interaction in compact binary millisecond pulsars</a><span class="id">[2508.20952]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Blackwidow and redback systems are millisecond pulsars in compact orbits with ultra-light and low-mass companions, respectively, collectively known as “spider pulsars&quot;. In such systems, an intrabinary shock can form between the pulsar and the companion winds, serving as a site for particle acceleration and associated non-thermal emission. Assuming that protons can be extracted from the neutron star surface and accelerated at the intrabinary shock and/or within the pulsar wind, we model the very high-energy gamma-ray and neutrino emissions ($0.1-10^3$ TeV) produced through interactions with the companion wind and the companion star. We first calculate the high-energy emissions using an optimistic combination of parameters to maximize the gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes. We find that, for energetic spider pulsars with a spin-down power $\gtrsim 10^{35}\rm erg\, s^{-1}$ and a magnetic field of $\sim 10^{3}\, \rm G$ in the companion region, the gamma-ray emission could be detectable as point sources by CTA and LHAASO, while the neutrino emission could be detectable by the future TRIDENT detector. Finally, we build a synthetic population of these systems, compute the cumulative neutrino flux expected from spider pulsars, and compare it with the Galactic neutrino diffuse emission measured by IceCube. We find that, under realistic assumptions on the fraction of the spin-down power converted into protons, the contribution of spiders to the diffuse Galactic neutrino flux is negligible.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Natal kicks of compact objects</a><span class="id">[2509.01430]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When compact objects - neutron stars and black holes - are formed in a supernova explosion, they may receive a high velocity at formation, which may reach or even exceed 1000 km s-1 for neutron stars and hundreds of km s-1 for black holes. The origin of the velocity kick is intimately related to supernova physics. A better understanding of kick properties from astronomical observations will shed light on the unsolved problems of these explosions, such as the exact conditions leading to exotic electron capture and ultra-stripped supernovae. Kick velocities are profoundly important in several areas of astrophysics. Being a result of supernova explosions, the kick velocity distribution must be explained in the framework of the supernova mechanism. The kick magnitudes and directions influence many topics related to binary systems, including the rate of compact object coalescences observable through gravitational waves. Moreover, knowledge of the kick velocity distribution is significant in predicting future observational results and their interpretation. For example, it is expected that the Roman space telescope will discover many microlensing events related to neutron stars and black holes; accurate estimates of the number of observable microlensing events require precise kinematic properties of these compact objects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05910" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar System Experiments in the Search for Dark Energy and Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2509.05910]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We reassess the realistic discovery reach of Solar-System experiments for dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM), making explicit the bridge from cosmology-level linear responses to local, screened residuals.

We emphasize a two-branch strategy. In a detection-first branch, a verified local anomaly – an Einstein equivalence principle (EEP) violation, a Shapiro-delay signal with $|\gamma-1|\sim\mathrm{few}\times 10^{-6}$, an AU-scale Yukawa tail, or a ultralight DM (ULDM) line in clocks/atom interferometers in space (AIS) – triggers a joint refit of cosmology and Solar-System data under a common microphysical parameterization $\{V(\phi),A(\phi)\}$. In a guardrail branch, Solar-System tests enforce constraints (EEP; PPN parameters $\gamma,\beta$; and $\dot G/G$) and close unscreened or weakly screened corners indicated by cosmology. We forecast, per conjunction, $|\gamma-1|\lesssim (2-5)\times 10^{-6}$ (Ka-/X-band or optical Shapiro), $\eta_{EEP}\sim (1\mbox{--}10)\times 10^{-17}$ (drag-free AIS), $|\dot G/G|\sim(3-5)\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (sub-mm-class LLR), a uniform  2x tightening of AU-scale Yukawa/DM-density bounds, and $(3-10)\times$ improved ULDM-coupling reach from clocks.

Crucially, the complexity of the model – namely, the number, positions, and weights of triangulation nodes – is inferred directly from the data, resulting in a highly efficient approach that requires about one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and significantly less calibration than current state-of-the-art methods.

However, it has now been 8 years since this discovery, and the search for a second EM-GW detection has yielded no robust discoveries. Recently, on August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration reported a low-significance (high false alarm rate) binary neutron star merger candidate S250818k. Rapid optical follow-up revealed a single optical candidate AT2025ulz ($z=0.08484$) that initially appeared consistent with kilonova emission. We quickly initiated a set of observations with \textit{Swift}, \textit{XMM-Newton}, \textit{Chandra}, and the Very Large Array to search for non-thermal afterglow emission. Our deep X-ray and radio search rules out that the optical rebrightening of AT2025ulz is related to the afterglow onset, reinforcing its classification as a stripped-envelope supernova (SN 2025ulz). We derive constraints on the afterglow parameters for a hypothetical binary neutron star merger at the distance of AT2025ulz ($\approx 400$ Mpc) based on our X-ray and radio limits. We conclude that our observational campaign could exclude a GW170817-like afterglow out to viewing angles of $\theta_\textrm{v}\approx 12.5$ degrees. We briefly discuss the prospects for the future discovery of off-axis afterglows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23917" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing common approximations of neutrino fast flavor conversion</a><span class="id">[2510.23917]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A new chapter is opening in the theory of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers as simulations of these events begin to incorporate fast flavor conversion (FFC) and other forms of neutrino flavor mixing.

These planets are high-priority targets for biosignature searches, as they combine abundant surface liquid water with easy-to-characterize $H_2$-rich atmospheres. Perhaps their most unusual climate feature is convective inhibition, which can dramatically alter a planet's temperature structure. However, so far hycean planets have mostly been investigated using 1D models that do not account for convective inhibition, and its effects are still poorly understood. This work develops pen-and-paper theory to analyze the effects of moist convective inhibition on hycean planets. The theory is tested and verified against a 1D radiative-convective model. We show that hycean planets near the onset of convective inhibition can exhibit either bistability or oscillations, due to the inhibition layer's trapping of heat and moisture. Meanwhile, hot hycean planets exhibit multistability, in which the inhibition layer and surface climate show multiple stable equilibria due to the lack of constraints on the water cycle inside the inhibition layer. The water cycle inside the inhibition layer is influenced by numerous processes that are challenging to resolve in 1D, including turbulent diffusion, convective overshoot and large-scale circulations. Our results demonstrate that hycean planets have unexpectedly rich climate dynamics. Meanwhile, previous claims about hycean planets should be treated with caution until confirmed with more self-consistent 1D and 3D models; this includes the claim that K2-18b might be habitable, and the proposal to infer $H_2O$ oceans on sub-Neptunes from JWST measurements of chemical species in their upper atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eppur si eclissa: Eccentric low-mass companions and time-in-dust selection explain long secondary periods</a><span class="id">[2510.24281]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>[abbreviated] Long Secondary Periods (LSPs) are observed in about one third of pulsating red giants yet remain unexplained. Four key observational constraints anchor the discussion: (i) a roughly 30 percent occurrence rate in semi-regular variable AGB stars (SRVs), with a much lower rate or absence in regularly pulsating Mira-type AGB stars (Miras), (ii) about 50 percent of LSP stars show a secondary mid-infrared minimum, (iii) Keplerian fits to radial-velocity curves favor argument of periastron greater than 180 degrees, and (iv) the radial-velocity to light-curve phase lag clusters around minus 90 degrees. We test whether a close-in, eccentric, low-mass companion that spends only part of its orbit within the giant's dust-formation zone can match all four empirical constraints. Guided by observed radial-velocity amplitudes and periods of about 500 to 1500 days, we adopt companion masses of 0.08 to 0.25 solar masses, orbital separations of 1.5 to 3 AU, eccentricities up to 0.6, and dust condensation radii of about 2.5 to 3 AU for SRVs (larger for Miras via scaling with luminosity). We compute the fraction of the orbit spent outside the condensation radius and apply line-of-sight criteria for detectability. We test the first three empirical constraints analytically, then model the phase offset using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Our scenario explains the observed excess of systems with argument of periastron greater than 180 degrees and yields LSP detectability of about 27 percent for SRVs and about 2.5 percent for Miras, with a conditional secondary mid-infrared eclipse fraction of about 44 percent. The hydrodynamical models place the optical-depth maximum downstream of the companion near apastron and then shift it forward by roughly 90 to 225 degrees later in the orbit, consistent with the observed radial-velocity to light-curve offsets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03411" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electromagnetic radiation reaction and energy extraction from black holes: The tail term cannot be ignored</a><span class="id">[2303.03411]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study electromagnetic radiation reaction in curved space and the dynamics of radiating charged particles.

Since GWs directly measure their luminosity distances, joint GW-EM observations from BNSs help with the study of cosmology, particularly the Hubble constant, unaffected by cosmic distance ladder systematics. However, detecting the EM emissions is not always possible. Additionally, the tidal deformability of neutron stars (NSs), combined with the knowledge of the NS EoS, can break the degeneracy between mass parameters and redshift, allowing for the inference of the Hubble constant. While several studies have aimed to infer the Hubble constant using dark BNSs (without EM counterparts), none have consistently combined the uncertainties of population, cosmology, and NS EoS within a Bayesian framework. In this study, we propose a novel Bayesian analysis to jointly constrain the NS EoS, population, and cosmological parameters using a population of dark BNSs detected through GW observations. We demonstrate the statistical robustness of our method using $50$ simulated BNS events following Gaussian and double Gaussian mass distributions, detected by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors operating at O5 sensitivity. We show that such measurements can constrain the Hubble constant with a precision of $\lesssim 35\%$ ($90\%$ credible interval). This level of precision is unattainable without incorporating NS EoS, especially when observing BNS mergers without EM counterpart information. We also report the Hubble constant measurements obtained from a more realistic set of $5$ simulated BNS events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravity Wave Phase Shift in a Cold Quark Star with a Nonconvex QCD BZT Shock Wave Van Der Waals Equation of State</a><span class="id">[2412.07601]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate BZT shocks and the QCD phase transition in the dense core of a cold quark star in beta equilibrium subject to the multicomponent van der Waals (MvdW) equation of state (EoS) as a model of internal structure.

They either plunge into the black hole or escape to infinity after making some oscillations around the equatorial plane. This exponentially unstable motion causes information production. In the case of the photons that escape to infinity, it was recently suggested that this information can be used to resolve the subring structure of the shadow image and obtain more precise data about the black hole mass and spin. Here, we extend this method to obtain more precise results by including th non-equatorial contributions to the Lyapunov exponents. For massive particles plunging into the Kerr black hole, we show that the associated Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy derived from the Lyapunov exponents can be interpreted in the context of black hole thermodynamics and obeys Bekenstein's bound on the entropy of a physical system. Thus, the perturbed unstable orbits, either ending inside the black hole or at the observer's screen, have physical consequences.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Covariant Energy Density Functionals for Neutron Star Matter Equation of State Modeling: Cross-Comparison Analysis Using \texttt{CompactObject}</a><span class="id">[2506.03112]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study analyzes and contrasts different phenomenological methods used to model the nuclear equation of state (EOS) for neutron star matter based on covariant energy density functionals (CEDF). Using two complementary methodologies, we seek to capture a comprehensive picture of the potential behaviors of ultra-dense nucleonic matter and identify the most plausible models based on current observational and experimental constraints. Observational data from radio pulsar timing, gravitational wave detection of GW170817, and X-ray timing provide critical benchmarks for testing the models. We have derived the EOS posteriors for various CEDF models within the \texttt{CompactObject} package, utilizing recent observational data on neutron stars, state-of-the-art theoretical constraints from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) calculations for pure neutron matter at low densities, and pQCD-derived constraints. Our analysis has demonstrated that while all considered CEDF models broadly reproduce current astrophysical and theoretical constraints, subtle yet important differences persist among them, with each framework exhibiting distinct characteristics at supra-nuclear density. This is in particular true for the proton fraction inside neutron stars, but also supported by the models' behavior with respect to the pure neutron matter EOS and the density dependence of the speed of sound. Our study highlights the sensitivity of dense matter predictions to the underlying EOS parameterizations and the priors considered.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02642" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lepton parity dark matter and naturally unstable domain walls</a><span class="id">[2508.02642]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a simple and predictive setup that connects neutrino masses, dark matter (DM), and gravitational waves. A minimal lepton parity DM scenario is considered where the residual symmetry $(-1)^L$ from the type I seesaw acts as the dark parity $D=(-1)^{L+2j}$, ensuring DM stability without imposing any new symmetry. A singlet Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity serves as the DM candidate, interacting via a real scalar $\sigma$ which is also even lepton parity. The scalar potential possesses an accidental $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry, whose spontaneous breaking gives rise to unstable domain walls (DW) in the presence of explicit $\mathcal{Z}_2$ breaking terms allowed by the lepton parity. The subsequent DW annihilation generates a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background potentially observable at different GW experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03053" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viability Constraints on Baryogenesis in f (R, Lm, T) Gravity</a><span class="id">[2509.03053]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Our study explores gravitational baryogenesis in the context of f(R, Lm, T) gravity, where R denotes the Ricci scalar, Lm represents the Lagrangian density of the matter field, and T stands for the metric contraction of T_{mu nu}. We focus on a linear model: f(R, Lm, T) = alpha R + beta Lm + gamma T, and examine the parameter constraints for a successful baryon asymmetry generation in four different eras of the cosmos under the assumption of a power-law cosmic expansion. The computed baryon-to-entropy ratio is found to be consistent with the observed order of asymmetry ratio, 9.42 x 10^-11. Furthermore, the study is extended to the generalized framework of gravitational baryogenesis, where the outcome shows strong agreement with the current observational data. Our findings indicate that the f(R, Lm, T) framework provides a compatible theoretical foundation for producing the observed matter imbalance of the cosmos, thereby emphasizing its potential significance in early-universe cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmology, Decoherence and the Second Law</a><span class="id">[2509.07077]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider quantum decoherence and entropy increase in early universe cosmology. We first study decoherence in a discrete bipartite quantum system for which a single qubit gets entangled with an environment and the entropy increase is correlated with the decay of the off-diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix. We compare this system with continuous systems relevant for cosmology for which there is a natural external intervention, corresponding to the time-dependent separation between the sub- and super-horizon inflationary fluctuations. We find, in this case, that the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix, in a field basis, do not decay as sometimes assumed in cosmological set-ups. Nevertheless, following a recent treatment in terms of open Effective Field Theories (EFTs), we compute the entanglement entropy for a Gaussian state and show that it actually increases monotonically ($\dot S&gt;0$) during the accelerated phases ($\ddot a&gt;0$ with $a(t)$ the scale factor). We generalise this result to include non-Gaussian states and briefly discuss the relevance of computing the von Neumann entropy as compared to the thermodynamic entropy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark matter: red or blue?</a><span class="id">[2509.20423]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the first calculation of light scattering on heavy dark matter (DM) particles. We show that despite the fact that DM has no direct coupling to photons, the light-DM($\gamma\chi$) ($m_\chi \sim 1$ TeV) cross-section is non-vanishing, albeit small. The cross section, calculated within the Standard Model (SM) framework, is particularly large in the case of heavy Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP). Combined with astrophysical observation, these results can constrain existing WIMP DM models in favor of lighter DM, $M_\chi&lt;&lt;M_{\mathrm{Planck}}$, (axions, composite DM, etc..) or non-weakly interacting pure gravitational DM. We also show that the energy dependence of light scattering on dark matter should make the DM colored - red in the case of weak-DM and blue for the gravitational-DM, when a white background light is passing through. Gravitational scattering of light on DM particles also leads to non-trivial polarization effects, which might be easier to detect than the deflection of light from the scattering on DM particles, $\gamma\chi\rightarrow\gamma\chi$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observable spins in gravitational waves from compact binary mergers</a><span class="id">[2510.17449]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the measurability of effective inspiral spin in the detectable compact binary mergers using gravitational-wave observations. Measurements from the latest gravitational-wave transient catalog do not rule out the existence of binary systems with non-zero effective spins. However, we observe an apparent correlation between the inferred effective inspiral spin and the loudness of the gravitational-wave events – loud events typically have close-to-zero effective spins whereas fainter events tend to be inferred with relatively arbitrary effective spins. Through simulations, we demonstrate that non-negligible effective spins can be systematically inferred from non-spinning systems at small signal strengths. These two observations support the possibility that the effective spin magnitudes in the observable compact binaries are generally small. Future detections can have potential impact on the understanding of their population and other astrophysical inferences.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sensitivity forecasts for gravitational-wave detectors to dark matter decaying into gravitons</a><span class="id">[2510.18958]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter may not be perfectly stable, and its decay could generate distinctive gravitational-wave signatures.
