<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07883" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: Experimental Predictions</a><span class="id">[2601.07883]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the experimental predictions of the local scale invariant, non-Hermitian pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) formulation of quantum theory introduced in arXiv:2601.03567 . We use Weyl's definition of gravitational radius of charge to obtain the fine-structure constant for non-integrable scale effects $\alpha_S$. The minuteness of $\alpha_S$ relative to $\alpha$ ($\alpha_S/\alpha \sim 10^{-21}$) effectively hides the effects in usual quantum experiments. In an Aharonov-Bohm double-slit experiment, the theory predicts that the position probability density depends on which slit the particle trajectory crosses, due to a non-integrable scale induced by the magnetic flux. This experimental prediction can be tested for an electrically neutral, heavy molecule with mass $m \sim 10^{-19} \text{g}$ at a $\sim 10^5 \text{ esu}$ flux regime. We analyse the Weyl-Einstein debate on the second-clock effect using the theory and show that spectral frequencies are history-independent. We thereby resolve Einstein's key objection against local scale invariance, and obtain two further experimental predictions. First, spectral intensities turn out to be history-dependent. Second, energy eigenvalues are modified by tiny imaginary corrections that modify spectral linewidths. We argue that the trajectory dependence of the probabilities renders our theory empirically distinguishable from other quantum formulations that do not use pilot-wave trajectories, or their mathematical equivalents, to derive experimental predictions.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A pedagogical derivation of the first-order effective Hamiltonian for the two-mode Jaynes-Cummings model</a><span class="id">[2601.17208]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work presents a pedagogical and self-contained derivation of the first-order effective Hamiltonian for the two-mode Jaynes-Cummings model in the dispersive regime. A perturbative unitary transformation removes nonresonant atom-field terms, revealing dispersive frequency shifts leading to an atom-induced effective beam-splitter interaction between the field modes. The resulting Hamiltonian is diagonalized through a simple geometric rotation in the two-mode bosonic space, providing a transparent interpretation of the underlying dynamics. The exposition emphasized clarity and physical insight, making effective Hamiltonian methods accessible for teaching and learning in multimode light-matter interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physics Computational Literacy: Programming, modeling and collaboration at the journeyman level</a><span class="id">[2505.21246]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Computation has become an integral part of physics research. However, little is known about how students learn to productively use computation as a tool beyond the introductory level, especially as they transition into physics research. In this study, we apply the theory of physics computational literacy and the novice-expert framework to describe the development of expertise in computational physics, as students transition from novice to journeyman computational physicists. We base this description on a thematic analysis of interviews with 13 computational physics master's students with extensive experience using computation. We first describe the most important elements driving the development of computational physics expertise, identifying two distinct transitions of competence during their studies, driven by experience with large computational projects and professional research. We then present an overview of the various skills students attain on this path toward the journeyman level of computational physics expertise. Based on these results, we argue for the need to assist students in collaborative coding and in the learning of new tools, as well as for the importance of large, scaffolded, computational projects in helping students develop the advanced skills needed for computational research.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teaching light absorption and the Beer-Lambert law using everyday materials: a tomato juice experiment for introductory physics</a><span class="id">[2509.04163]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I describe a visually engaging experiment to demonstrate the Beer-Lambert law in introductory physics or general science courses. By using diluted tomato juice as a naturally colored absorber and a halogen lamp as a broadband light source, students can explore how light attenuation depends on concentration and wavelength. The activity connects the optical concept of exponential absorption with everyday materials, making it accessible for classrooms with limited resources. Transmission spectra obtained with a compact spectrometer reveal a strong absorption band around 500 nm, corresponding to the green-blue region absorbed by lycopene. Plotting absorbance against concentration allows students to confirm linear behavior at low concentrations and to discuss deviations at higher ones. The experiment emphasizes conceptual understanding of light-matter interaction, quantitative data analysis, and the limitations of ideal laws, providing a memorable learning experience in optics and spectroscopy.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Macroscopic &quot;Lola/Mola&quot; Cat State</a><span class="id">[2503.23433]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first–ever example of a macroscopic system in a quantum superposition. The system in question is a Siamese cat known as Lola; however, on a time scale of about 12 hours it oscillates into a different state that we refer to as &quot;Mola&quot;. In the &quot;Lola&quot; state, the system is sweet and friendly and allows to cuddle itself, but in the &quot;Mola&quot; state, it is malevolent and witchy. When the probability of the system being in the &quot;Mola&quot; state is high, decoherence is strongly discouraged!</p></div></details></article></body>
