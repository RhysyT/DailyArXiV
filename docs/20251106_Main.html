Using photometric data from the TESS Full-Frame-Images we have performed a transit search for exoplanets with post-main sequence hosts to search for the imprints of these impacts on the giant planet population. We detect 130 short period planets and candidates, thirty-three of which are newly discovered candidates, from a sample of \Ntotal\ post-main sequence stars spanning the evolutionary stages from the end of the main sequence to the bottom of the red giant branch. We measure an occurrence rate of $0.28 \pm 0.04$% for short period giant planets orbiting post-main sequence stars. We also measure occurrence rates for two stellar sub-populations, measuring values of $0.35 \pm 0.05$% for a sub-population representing the earliest stages of post-main sequence evolution and $0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$% for a sub-population of more evolved stars. We show that the giant planet occurrence rate decreases with increasing stellar evolution stage, with a larger occurrence rate decrease observed for shorter period planets. Our results are clear evidence that the population of short period giant planets is being sculpted by the post-main sequence evolution of the host stars, and we conclude that this is most likely through the destruction of these giant planets through the increased strength of planet-star tidal interactions resulting in the rapid tidal decay of the planets' orbits.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distributions and evolution of the equatorial rotation velocities of 2937 BAF-type main-sequence stars from asteroseismology</a><span class="id">[2511.02909]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Studies of the rotational velocities of intermediate-mass main-sequence stars are crucial for testing stellar evolution theory. They often rely on spectroscopic measurements of the projected rotation velocities. These not only suffer from the unknown projection factor but tend to ignore additional line-profile broadening mechanisms aside from rotation, such as pulsations and turbulent motions near the stellar surface. This limits the accuracy of Veq distributions. We use asteroseismic measurements to investigate the distribution of the equatorial rotation velocity, its ratio with respect to the critical rotation velocity, and the specific angular momentum for several thousands of BAF-type stars, covering a mass range from 1.3M$_\odot$ to 8.8M$_\odot$ and almost the entire core-hydrogen burning phase. We rely on high-precision model-independent internal rotation frequencies, as well as on masses and radii from asteroseismology to deduce Veq, Veq/Vcrit, and J/M for 2937 gravity-mode pulsators in the Milky Way. The sample stars have rotation frequencies between almost zero and 33$\mu$Hz, corresponding to rotation periods above 0.35d. We find that intermediate-mass stars experience a break in their J/M occurring in the mass interval $[2.3,2.7]\,$M$_\odot$. We establish unimodal Veq and Veq/Vcrit distributions for the mass range $[1.3,2.5[$M$_\odot$, while stars with $M\in[2.5,8.8]$M$_\odot$ reveal some structure in their distributions. We find that the near-core rotation slows down as stars evolve, pointing to very efficient angular momentum transport. The kernel density estimators of the asteroseismic internal rotation frequency, equatorial rotation velocity, and specific angular momentum of this large sample of intermediate-mass field stars can conveniently be used for population synthesis studies and to fine-tune the theory of stellar rotation across the main sequence evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantifying how Surface Complexity Influences Properties of the Solar Corona and Solar Wind</a><span class="id">[2511.03011]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Sun's magnetic field is a key driver in coronal heating and consequently solar wind acceleration. Remote measurement of the photosphere provides the magnetic surface boundary condition necessary for data-constrained 3D global coronal models. With one such model, we explore how the spatial resolution of the surface boundary condition influences the global properties of the magnetic field and coronal heating. Using spherical harmonic decomposition, we quantify how three different resolution simulations vary in the low and middle corona. Through examination of the magnetic field, the squashing factor, and the heating rate, we demonstrate that small-scale photospheric magnetic flux enhances heating across spatial regimes. We calculate 40% more heating in our best resolution simulation as compared to our base resolution. We describe a strong correlation between the structure of the magnetic field and structure of the heating rate in the low corona across resolutions. These results provide key information as to what more efficient, low-resolution models might inherently miss. This can provide context to incorporate the effects of unresolvable features in future modeling efforts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Massive stars in the era of large spectroscopic surveys: The MEIGAS project</a><span class="id">[2511.03018]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the era of large spectroscopic surveys, a vast amount of spectra of massive stars will be gathered and supplemented by the wealth of astrometric and photometric data provided by the Gaia satellite. Released data will mean a major step forward in the study of massive stars, giving us the chance to create statistically significant samples to explore the role of almost any parameter. In this contribution, I introduce to the community the Multi-wavelength Exploration of massIve star-forminG regions and ASsociations project (MEIGAS) and long-term plans for conducting comprehensive studies in the major galactic and near extragalactic star-forming regions and OB associations. Benefiting from current and forthcoming data from large scale spectroscopic surveys such as WEAVE and 4MOST (among others), as well as complementary observations at different wavelength ranges, the project aims to achieve crucial and complementary information to adequately characterize these regions and their stellar content, something imperative to improve our understanding of star formation and poorly known evolutionary pathways of massive stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-inclination Centaur reservoirs beyond Neptune</a><span class="id">[2511.03021]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>(Abridged) Numerical simulations of the past evolution of high-inclination Centaurs showed they originated from orbits beyond Neptune that were perpendicular to the Solar System's invariable plane in a region called the polar corridor. Recently, a study of Centaur injection in the three-body problem showed that Neptune-crossing TNOs in the polar corridor in the range [40:160] au have dynamical times that exceed the Solar System's age suggesting the presence of long-lived Centaur-producing reservoirs. We demonstrate the existence of such reservoirs in the Solar System by simulating the TNOs' time-forward evolution in the presence of the giant planets, the Galactic tide and passing stars using the IAS15 integrator of the REBOUND and REBOUNDx packages. We also assess the efficiency of Centaur injection as a function of the initial inclination and determine if high-inclination Centaurs may be produced by low inclination reservoirs. We find that TNO reservoirs in the semi-major axis range [50:140] au are long-lived and their populations peak at the Tisserand parameters T=0.5 and T=-1.5. Saturn is found to induce secondary structures in the polar corridor by holding the perihelia of a fraction of high-inclination reservoir material. We find that the Centaur inclination at minimum semi-major axis depends linearly on the Tisserand parameter regardless of the initial semi-major axis. Its amplitude shows that low inclination reservoirs such as the early protoplanetary disk are unlikely to produce high-inclination Centaurs in contrast to reservoirs in the polar corridor. We identified the likely location of the closest reservoirs to Neptune populated by TNOs captured in the early Solar System that produce high-inclination Centaurs. The Legacy Survey of Space and Time will be able to constrain the reservoirs' extent and population size</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantifying the Impact of Starspot-Crossing Events on Retrieved Parameters from Transit Lightcurves</a><span class="id">[2511.03045]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Starspot-crossing events (SCEs) in exoplanet transit lightcurves are becoming increasingly common as we focus on cooler host stars and observe higher precision photometric and spectroscopic lightcurves. In this work we explore how these events affect our retrievals of transit depths, and the accuracy with which we can derive spot properties. We inject and recover synthetic SCEs in photometric lightcurves using starry. We find that for high signal-to-noise SCEs we constrain the spot longitudes tightly (&gt;80% within 1 degree of the true value), but degeneracies complicate retrieving spot contrasts, radii and latitudes (within 17%, 19%, and 9 degrees respectively). On average the difference between injected and recovered transit depths is 0.78% or 78.3ppm. In most (80%) injections we recover the transit depth to within 0.6%. For transit depths inflated &gt;1.3% by the Transit Light Source Effect (TLSE), fitting for a spot-crossing improves the transit depth retrieval over masking the SCE in &gt;95% of cases. However, we find that for spots with small contrasts (&lt;5%) and/or covering fractions (&lt;2%), we are likely to over-correct for the TLSE, recovering a worse transit depth than simply masking. In addition, even when fitted, we find SCEs can inflate the uncertainties on recovered transit depths significantly, especially for JWST-like precisions. Finally, we determine how SCE observables can narrow the degenerate spot parameter space to provide useful priors for MCMC sampling, demonstrating this technique on a real SCE observed in Kepler-51d's lightcurve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03067" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium-resolution spectroscopic study of the intermediate-mass pre-main sequence binary $θ^1$ Ori E</a><span class="id">[2511.03067]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>$\theta^1$ Ori E is a very young and relatively massive pre-main sequence (PMS) spectroscopic and eclipsing binary with nearly identical components. We analyze Échelle spectra of the system obtained over fifteen years and report 91 radial velocities measured from cross-correlating the observations with a suitable synthetic spectrum. The spectra of individual binary components are indistinguishable from each other, with a composite spectral type around G4 III. The projected equatorial velocity is estimated to be $v \sin{i} = 32\pm 3~km~s^{-1}$, consistent with rotational synchronization. We find that the circular orbit has $P_{\rm orb} = 9.89522 \pm 0.00003~d$, $K_1 = 83.36 \pm 0.29~km~s^{-1}$, $K_2 = 84.57 \pm 0.28~km~s^{-1}$, and $asini = 32.84\pm0.08\ R_\odot$. The mass ratio is $q = 0.9856 \pm 0.0047$, indicating nearly identical but significantly different masses. The systemic velocity of the binary, $\gamma = 29.7 \pm 0.2~km~s^{-1}$, is similar to that of other Trapezium members. Using Spitzer light curves and our results, we derive $M_1 = 2.755\pm0.043\ M_{\odot}$, $M_2 = 2.720\pm0.043\ M_{\odot}$, $R_1=6.26\pm0.31R_{\odot}$ and $R_2=6.25\pm0.30R_{\odot}$. Together with our estimate of the effective temperature, $T_{\rm eff}=5150\pm200\ K$, a bolometric luminosity of $28.8\pm4.6\ L_{\odot}$ is derived for each component. Compared to evolutionary models of PMS stars, the binary age turns out to be less than or equal to $\sim 10^5$ years. Its components are probably the most massive stars known with masses determined with precision better than 2 percent, with both being PMS stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Study of Four nulling pulsars with FAST</a><span class="id">[2511.03150]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an analysis of 4 nulling pulsars with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). For PSR J1649+2533, our results suggest mode changing rather than subpulse drifting as previously reported at lower frequencies. For PSR J1752+2359, we confirm its quasi-periodic switching between distinct emission states, but further show that the so-called &quot;quasi-null&quot; or &quot;RRAT-like&quot; state actually consists of persistent low-level emission superposed with occasional bright pulses. For PSR J1819+1305, our data confirm the modulation reported earlier, while additional weaker features are also seen. For PSR J1916+1023, we detect both nulling and subpulse drifting, but find no clear evidence of direct interaction between them. These results provide new insights into the diverse manifestations of pulsar nulling, highlight the capability of FAST to detect subtle emission states, and add to the growing body of work on pulsar emission variability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03172" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the spectral characteristics of the periodic burster 4U 1323-62: Type-I X-ray burst and persistent emission</a><span class="id">[2511.03172]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on the results obtained by the analysis of persistent and type-I thermonuclear X-ray burst emission observed from the periodic burster 4U 1323-62. These analyses are based on the NuSTAR observation performed on 2024 August 7 for a total exposure of around 90 ks. The persistent emission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model. An absorption edge is also detected at an energy of approximately 7.87 keV, which indicates the presence of absorbing material in the vicinity of this system. Six bursts have been observed during this observation, wherein we find the burst recurrence time to be approximately 4.52 hr. All the bursts exhibit the characteristics of a sharp rise and exponential decay. We perform the time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst spectra described by a model consisting of thermal emission from the neutron star surface and a varying persistent emission component to study the evolution of burst parameters. The enhancement of the persistent emission during burst exposure is characterized by the scaling parameter f a, which reflects the increasing strength of the burst-disc interaction with burst intensity, likely driven by Poynting-Robertson drag. The spectral analysis of bursts estimate the average apparent blackbody emitting radius of the neutron star to lie within 1.5-3.5 km. The ignition depths computed from the burst parameters indicate short Type-I thermonuclear bursts from a mixed hydrogen-helium fuel layer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimizing Earth-Moon Transfer and Cislunar Navigation: Integrating Low-Energy Trajectories, AI Techniques and GNSS-R Technologies</a><span class="id">[2511.03173]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rapid growth of cislunar activities, including lunar landings, the Lunar Gateway, and in-space refueling stations, requires advances in cost-efficient trajectory design and reliable integration of navigation and remote sensing. Traditional Earth-Moon transfers suffer from rigid launch windows and high propellant demands, while Earth-based GNSS systems provide little to no coverage beyond geostationary orbit. This limits autonomy and environmental awareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer strategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel efficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic missions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is highlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition and digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables adaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and decision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced Positioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation capabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for mapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems support autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated satellite swarm operations. Combining these developments establishes a scalable framework for sustainable cislunar exploration and long-term human and robotic presence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISOSCELES project: A grid-based quantitative spectroscopic analysis of massive stars</a><span class="id">[2511.03184]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive stars play a fundamental role in galactic evolution through their strong stellar winds, chemical enrichment, and feedback mechanisms. Accurate modelling of their atmospheres and winds is critical for understanding their physical properties and evolutionary pathways. Traditional spectroscopic analyses often rely on the $\beta$-law approximation for wind-velocity profiles, which may not capture the complexity of observed phenomena. This study aims to introduce and validate the grId of Stellar atmOSphere and hydrodynamiC modELs for massivE Stars (ISOSCELES), a grid-based framework for the quantitative spectroscopic analysis of massive stars. The project leverages hydrodynamic wind solutions derived from the m-CAK theory, including both fast and $\delta$-slow solutions, to improve the accuracy of derived stellar and wind parameters. We constructed a comprehensive grid of models based on hydrodynamic wind solutions from the Hydwind code and synthetic spectral line profiles generated by the Fastwind code. The grid spans a broad parameter space covering OBA-type stars with solar metallicity. A semi-automatic fitting procedure was developed to analyse key spectral lines and derive the stellar and wind parameters. Applying ISOSCELES to six stars demonstrates its ability to reproduce observed spectral profiles with high fidelity. The $\delta$-slow solution proved effective for two early-type B supergiants. The grid also highlights the difference of using the $\beta$-law in modelling stellar winds compared with the m-CAK wind solutions. The ISOSCELES database represents a step forward in quantitatively analysing massive stars, offering an alternative to the $\beta$-law approximation. Future work will address the inclusion of UV lines and metallicity effects to further refine its applicability across diverse stellar populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring scattering variations in pulsar timing observations: A test of the fidelity of current methods</a><span class="id">[2511.03185]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The turbulent nature of the ionised interstellar medium (IISM) causes dispersion measure (DM) and scattering variations in pulsar timing measurements. To improve precision of gravitational wave measurements, pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have begun the use of sophisticated and intricate noise modelling techniques such as modelling stochastic variations induced by the turbulent IISM and quasi-deterministic processes attributed to discrete structures. However, the reliability of these techniques has not been studied in detail, and it is unclear whether the recovered processes are physical or if they are impacted by misspecification. In this work, we present an analysis to test the efficacy of IISM noise models based on the data from the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array (MPTA) 4.5-year data release. We first performed multi-frequency, long-length (500 refractive length scale) simulations of multipath propagation in the IISM to study the properties of scattering variations under a variety of scattering conditions. The results of our simulations show the possibility of significant radio-frequency decorrelation in the scattering variations, particularly for the anisotropic scattering medium. Our analysis of the observed DM and scattering variations using the MPTA 4.5-year data set shows that there can be apparent anticorrelations between DM and scattering variations, which we attribute to the model fitting methods. We also report a possibility that plasma underdensities might exist along the sight lines of PSR J1431$-$5740 and PSR J1802$-$2124. Finally, using simulations, we show that the IISM noise models can result in the apparent measurement of strong frequency dependence of scattering variations observed in the MPTA data set. Our analysis shows that improvements in the IISM noise modelling techniques are necessary to accurately measure the IISM properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The First Upper Bound on the Non-Stationary Gravitational Wave Background and its Implication on the High Redshift Binary Black Hole Merger Rate</a><span class="id">[2511.03262]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of black hole binaries (BHBs) is a direct probe to distinguish astrophysical black holes (ABHs) and primordial black holes (PBHs), which can be studied using the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). The conventional analyses solely based on the power spectrum are limited in constraining the properties of the underlying source population under the assumption of a non-sporadic Gaussian distribution. However, recent studies have shown that SGWB will be sporadic and non-Gaussian in nature, which will cause non-zero 'spectral correlation' depending on the high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of the compact objects. In this work, we present the first spectral covariance analysis of the SGWB using data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration during the third and the first part of the fourth observing runs. Our analysis indicates that the current spectral correlation is consistent with non-stationary noise, yielding no detection from the current data and providing only upper bounds between frequencies in the range 25 Hz to 100 Hz. This upper bound on the spectral correlation translates to the upper bounds on the mass-dependent merger rate of PBHs between $2.4\times10^{4}$ and $2.3\times10^{2} \rm ~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ (at ${\rm z} = 1 $ ) with a log-normal mass distribution with median masses between $20 ~M_{\odot}$ and $120 ~M_{\odot}$. This provides a stringent upper bound on the PBH merger rate at high redshift and hence puts constraints on the PBH formation scenario even in the presence of large spatial clustering. In the future, detection of this signal will lead to direct evidence of the high-redshift black hole population using gravitational waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Case for an Inhomogeneous Einstein-de Sitter Universe</a><span class="id">[2511.03288]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In our local-to-global cosmological framework, cosmic acceleration arises from local dynamics in an inhomogeneous Einstein-de Sitter (iEdS) universe without invoking dark energy. An iEdS universe follows a quasilinear coasting evolution from an Einstein-de Sitter to a Milne state, as an effective negative curvature emerges from growing inhomogeneities without breaking spatial flatness. Acceleration can arise from structure formation amplifying this effect. We test two realizations, iEdS(1) and iEdS(2), with $H_0=\{70.24,74.00\}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ and $\Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}=\{0.290,0.261\}$, against CMB, BAO, and SN Ia data. iEdS(1) fits better than $\Lambda$CDM and alleviates the $H_0$ tension, whereas iEdS(2) fully resolves it while remaining broadly consistent with the data.

We post-process these simulations with a general-relativistic ray-tracing code to obtain synthetic observations in thermal emission. We find the lump and its associated electromagnetic (EM) modulation, already reported in the pre-decoupling epoch, to survive post-decoupling up until the end of the simulation. For LISA sources, our findings point to an active EM signature in UV during optimal gravitational wave source localization.

Its puzzling feature is the presence of a strong and broad Fe K line, while the continuum consists of a strong disk blackbody and a very weak power-law tail. The irradiation of the disk by a power-law spectrum fitting the tail is much too weak to account for the strong line. Two solutions were proposed in the past. One invoked an intrinsic Fe K disk emission, and the other invoked disk irradiation by the returning blackbody emission. We instead find that the strong line is naturally explained by the irradiation of the disk by the spectrum from Comptonization of the disk blackbody by coronal relativistic electrons. The shape of the irradiating spectrum at $\lesssim$10 keV reflects that of the disk blackbody; it is strongly curved and has a higher flux than that of a fit with a power-law irradiation. That flux accounts for the line. While this result is independent of the physical model used for the disk intrinsic emission, the value of the fitted spin strongly depends on it. When using a Kerr disk model for a thin disk with a color correction, the fitted spin corresponds to a retrograde disk, unlikely for a Roche-lobe overflow binary. Then, a model accounting for both the disk finite thickness and radiative transfer yields a spin of $a_*\approx0.8$–0.9, which underlines the strong model-dependence of X-ray spin measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03419" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar critical parameters in the uniform density approximation</a><span class="id">[2511.03419]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar models are calculated in the approximation of a uniform density distribution.

We attempt to answer this question for the tMSP PSR J1023+0038 by segregating high-mode data and performing detailed spectral analysis using the XMM-Newton EPIC-PN+MOS1+MOS2 joint observations, XMM-Newton+NuSTAR joint observations, NICER and Chandra individual observations during different epochs. With the sum of longest exposures ($\sim$202 ksec of high mode data from $\sim$364 ksec of total exposure), we performed a self-consistent spectral analysis and constrain the inner disc radius 16.8 $\pm$ 3.8 km with at least 3$\sigma$ significance. Such a measurement is found consistent with best-fit spectral values of inner disc radius from other observatory like NICER and a joint observations with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR within 3$\sigma$ limits. We also detect a Fe emission line at 6.45 keV, for the first time from a tMSP, in the Chandra spectrum with 99% significance with an upper limit of the inner disc radius of 21 R$_g$, supporting independently the fact that inner disc extends into neutron stars's magnetosphere during high mode. All results from our analysis imply that the accretion disc is significantly present and extended within the corotation radius of the neutron star in PSR J1023+0038 during the X-ray high-mode of the tMSP PSR J1023+0038. The measured range of inner disc radius is fully consistent with an independent analysis by Bhattacharyya (2020), which suggests continuous gravitational wave emission from this neutron star, and the standard model of X-ray pulsations in accreting MSPs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Associated Neutrino Search for a Failed Supernova Candidate with Super-Kamiokande</a><span class="id">[2511.03470]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In 2024, a failed supernova candidate, M31-2014-DS1, was reported in the Andromeda galaxy (M31), located at a distance of approximately 770 kpc.

Based on the estimated time of black hole formation inferred from optical and infrared observations, we define a search window for neutrino events in the SK data. Using this window, we develop a dedicated analysis method for failed supernovae and apply it to M31-2014-DS1, by conducting a cluster search using the timing and energy information of candidate events. No significant neutrino excess is observed within the search region. Consequently, we place an upper limit on the electron antineutrino luminosity from M31-2014-DS1 and discuss its implications for various failed SN models and their neutrino emission characteristics. Despite the 18 MeV threshold adopted to suppress backgrounds, the search remains sufficiently sensitive to constrain the Shen-TM1 EOS, yielding a 90% confidence level upper limit of 1.76 \times 10^{53} erg on the electron antineutrino luminosity, slightly above the expected value of 1.35 \times 10^{53} erg.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03496" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of the Shock Properties of the 2023 March 13 Event from In-Situ and Remote-Sensing Data</a><span class="id">[2511.03496]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most powerful accelerators of gradual solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the inner heliosphere. On 2023 March 13, a halo CME, as seen from the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) and the Sun TErrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), gave rise to a strong SEP event. In this work, we aim to analyze this CME-driven shock from multiple spacecraft, using both remote sensing observations from STEREO-A/COR2 and in-situ data from Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Orbiter (SolO), and Wind. In order to determine its direction of propagation and kinematic properties, we model the shock geometry using STEREO-A/COR2 and SoHO/LASCO/C3 observations as an expanding ellipsoid. The density compression ratio of the shock is determined by fitting the brightness profile from the coronagraphic images with that obtained from raytracing simulations of a double-Gaussian shock density profile. We compare physical quantities such as compression ratio and Alfvénic Mach number derived from remote sensing observations with in-situ measurements by PSP, SolO, STEREO-A, and Wind. From STEREO-A/COR2, we determine the compression ratio around the entire shock front in the corona, finding significant non-homogeneities that can impact the values found during in-situ crossings. Following the evolution of the parameters characterizing the CME from the source to space, we find that closer to the Sun, both the gas compression ratio and the Alfvénic Mach number remain almost constant, while they increase at larger radial distances. This indicates a non-trivial evolution of the shock parameters during its journey through the interplanetary space.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03539" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Ray Observations of Old Nearby Supernovae: Constraints on Compact Object Populations and Late Interaction</a><span class="id">[2511.03539]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The properties of the population of compact objects created in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are uncertain. X-ray observations years to decades after the explosions offer a way to gain insight into this, as hard X-ray emission from the central regions will emerge as the ejecta absorption decreases. Here we analyze and place upper limits on late-time X-ray emission in 242 nearby SNe, using 607 observations from Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NuSTAR. We use absorption models based on 3D simulations of neutrino-driven explosions to account for absorption of emission from the compact objects by the asymmetric ejecta. We detect X-ray emission from 12 SNe, including four for the first time (SN 1982R, SN 1984J, SN 1992bu, and SN 2003gk), and several of the others at later epochs than before. The X-ray spectra of these SNe are consistent with interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM), with the possible exception of SN 1979C, which shows an additional hard component, as also noted in previous studies at earlier epochs. This emission may be due to a pulsar wind nebula. Using the upper limits in the full sample, we also perform a population synthesis to constrain the fraction of SNe that produce pulsars and the properties of the pulsars themselves. We find that pulsar populations with mean initial spin periods $\gtrsim100\rm~ ms$ are favored. Finally, we note that the high luminosities of several of the SNe with CSM interaction imply interactions with dense shells.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03558" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observed Joys law of Bipolar Magnetic Region tilts at the emergence supports the thin flux tube model</a><span class="id">[2511.03558]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bipolar sunspots, or more generally, Bipolar Magnetic Regions, BMRs, are the dynamic magnetic regions that appear on the solar surface and are central to solar activity. One striking feature of these regions is that they are often tilted with respect to the equator, and this tilt increases with the latitude of appearance, popularly known as Joys law. Although this law has been examined for over a century through various observations, its physical origin is still not established. An attractive theory that has been put forward behind Joys law is the Coriolis force acting on the rising flux tube in the convection zone, which has been studied using the thin flux tube model. However, observational support for this theory is limited. If the Coriolis force is the cause of the tilt, then we expect BMRs to hold Joys law at their initial emergence on the surface. By automatically identifying the BMRs over the last two solar cycles from high resolution magnetic observations, we robustly capture their initial emergence signatures on the surface. We find that from their appearance, BMRs exhibit tilts consistent with Joys law. This early tilt signature of BMRs suggests that the tilt is developed underneath the photosphere, driven by the Coriolis force and helical convection, as predicted by the thin flux tube model. Considerable scatter around Joys law observed during the emergence phase, which reduces in the post emergence phase, reflects the interaction of the vigorous turbulent convection with the rising flux tubes in the near surface layer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Broad Iron Line as a Relativistic Reflection from Warm Corona in AGN</a><span class="id">[2511.03575]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present that the broad feature usually observed in X-ray spectra can be explained by a ray-traced emission from a two-slab system containing a dissipative, warm corona on top of an accretion disk in an AGN. Such an accretion flow is externally illuminated by X-ray radiation from a lamp located above a central SMBH. Thermal lines from highly ionized iron ions (FeXXV and FeXXVI), caused by both internal heating and reflection from the warm corona, can be integrated into an observed broad line profile due to the close vicinity of the SMBH. We investigate the dependence of the broad line profile by varying the SMBH spin parameter, viewing angle, lamp height, and dissipation factor. Our results introduce a new method to probe properties of the warm corona using high-resolution spectroscopic measurements. We use the photoionization code TITAN to compute local ion populations and emission line profiles, and the ray-tracing code GYOTO to include relativistic effects on the outgoing X-ray spectrum. In our models, the temperature of the inner atmosphere covering the disk can reach values of 10^7 - 10^8 K due to internal warm corona dissipation and external illumination, which is adequate for generating the highly ionized iron lines. These lines can undergo significant gravitational redshift near the black hole, leading to a prominent spectral feature centered around 6.4 keV. For all computed models, the relativistic corrections shift highly ionized iron lines to the X-ray region, usually attributed to fluorescent emission from the illuminated skin of an accretion disk. Hence, in the case of a warm corona covering the inner disk regions, the resulting theoretical line profile under strong gravity is a sum of different iron line transitions, and those originating from highly ionized iron contribute the most to the observed total line profile in AGN.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Bow-Shock Nebula Around the Z Camelopardalis-type Cataclysmic Variable FY Vulpeculae</a><span class="id">[2511.03587]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present deep images of the faint nebulosity StDr 90, which we have discovered surrounds the cataclysmic variable (CV) star FY Vulpeculae.

We present a simplified but physically grounded algebraic approach that models the dipole contribution of active regions (ARs) while incorporating two key nonlinearities: tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). Using ensembles of synthetic cycles across the dynamo effectivity range $\lambda_R$, we quantify how these mechanisms suppress the axial dipole and impose self-limiting feedback. Our results show that (i) both TQ and LQ reduce the polar field, and together they generate a clear saturation (ceiling) of dipole growth with increasing cycle amplitude; (ii) the balance between LQ and TQ, expressed as $R(\lambda_R) = \mathrm{dev(LQ)}/\mathrm{dev(TQ)}$, transitions near $\lambda_R \approx 12^\circ$, with LQ dominating at low $\lambda_R$ and TQ at high $\lambda_R$; (iii) over $8^\circ \leq \lambda_R \leq 20^\circ$, the ratio follows a shallow offset power law with exponent $n \approx 0.36 \pm 0.04$, significantly flatter than the $n=2$ scaling assumed in many surface flux–transport (SFT) models; and (iv) symmetric, tilt-asymmetric, and morphology-asymmetric AR prescriptions yield nearly identical $R(\lambda_R)$ curves, indicating weak sensitivity to AR geometry for fixed transport. These findings demonstrate that nonlinear saturation of the solar cycle can be captured efficiently with algebraic formulations, providing a transparent complement to full SFT simulations. The method highlights that the LQ\–TQ balance is primarily controlled by transport ($\lambda_R$), not by active-region configuration, and statistically disfavors the SFT-based $1/\lambda_R^{2}$ dependence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03625" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidally Torn: Why the Most Common Stars May Lack Large, Habitable-Zone Moons</a><span class="id">[2511.03625]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Earth-like planets in the habitable zone (HZ) of M-dwarfs have recently been targeted in the search for exomoons.

We find that those moons have a notably different likelihood of existence (and, by implication, observability). Large moons orbiting Earth-like planets in the HZs of M4 and M2 dwarfs become unstable well before $10^7$ and $10^8 \textrm{ yr}$, respectively, and in most cases, those orbiting M0-dwarfs become unstable in much less than $10^9 \textrm{ yr}$. We conclude that HZ planets orbiting M-dwarfs are unlikely to harbor large moons, thus affecting the total number of possible moons in our galaxy and the Universe at large. Since moons may help enhance the habitability of their host planet, besides being possibly habitable themselves, these results may have notable implications for exolife, and should also be considered when seeking solutions to the Drake equation and the Fermi paradox.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03636" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantifying Weighted Morphological Content of Large-Scale Structures via Simulation-Based Inference</a><span class="id">[2511.03636]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we perform a simulation-based forecasting analysis to compare the constraining power of two higher-order summary statistics of the large-scale structure (LSS), the Minkowski Functionals (MFs) and the Conditional Moments of Derivative (CMD), with a particular focus on their sensitivity to nonlinear and anisotropic features in redshift-space. Our analysis relies on halo catalogs from the Big Sobol Sequence(BSQ) simulations at redshift $z=0.5$, employing a likelihood-free inference framework implemented via neural posterior estimation. At the fiducial cosmology of the Quijote simulations $(\Omega_{m}=0.3175,\,\sigma_{8}=0.834)$, and for the smoothing scale $R=15\,h^{-1}$Mpc, we find that the CMD yields tighter forecasts for $(\Omega_{m}},\,\sigma_{8})$ than the zeroth- to third-order MFs components, improving the constraint precision by ${\sim}(44\%,\,52\%)$, ${\sim}(30\%,\,45\%)$, ${\sim}(27\%,\,17\%)$, and ${\sim}(26\%,\,17\%)$, respectively. A joint configuration combining the MFs and CMD further enhances the precision by approximately ${\sim}27\%$ compared to the standard MFs alone, highlighting the complementary anisotropy-sensitive information captured by the CMD in contrast to the scalar morphological content encapsulated by the MFs. We further extend the forecasting analysis to a continuous range of cosmological parameter values and multiple smoothing scales.

Its bounds and density profile carry crucial information about the nature of superdense matter. Physically, the EOS-parameter $\phi$ represents the mean stiffness of matter accumulated from the stellar surface up to a given density. Based on the intrinsic structure of the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations, we show that $\phi$ decreases monotonically outward from the NS center, independent of any specific input NS EOS model. Furthermore, observational evidence of a peak in the speed-of-sound squared (SSS) density-profile near the center effectively rules out a valley and a subsequent peak in the radial profile of $\phi$ at similar densities, reinforcing its monotonic decrease. These model-independent relations impose strong constraints on the near-center behavior of the EOS-parameter $\phi$, particularly demonstrating that the mean stiffness (or equivalently $\Delta$) reaches a local maximum (minimum) at the center.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02915" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accuracy of ringdown models calibrated to numerical relativity simulations</a><span class="id">[2511.02915]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ”ringdown” stage of gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole mergers, mainly consisting of a superposition of quasinormal modes emitted by the merger remnant, is a key tool to test fundamental physics and to probe black hole dynamics.

The acceleration process proceeds through multiple stages triggered by counterpropagating wave-particle resonant acceleration (CWRA) via decay instability. Initially, parent and daughter Alfvén waves resonantly accelerate particles perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. The resultant modulational instability generates electrostatic fields within the wave packet, which are locally amplified by the ponderomotive force of the Alfvén wave packet. These fields subsequently drive further acceleration within a few relativistic gyroperiods via gyroresonant surfing acceleration (GRSA). During this, the v*B force facilitates momentum transfer from the perpendicular to the parallel direction. In the later stage, particles become trapped by the parent wave and gain additional energy through single wave resonant acceleration (SWRA). Furthermore, the accumulation of accelerated particles induces electrostatic trailing fields behind and at the tail of the wave packet, which drive trailing-field acceleration (TFA) of other electrons. The combined effects of these mechanisms, CWRA followed by GRSA and SWRA, result in highly relativistic electron energy. The electron energy accelerated through the above process is higher than that accelerated through TFA. This multistage acceleration process provides insights into the generation of high energy cosmic rays in astrophysical environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast and accurate analytical formulas for light propagation in general static, spherically symmetric spacetimes</a><span class="id">[2511.03144]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this article, we extend our previously presented analytical formulas (Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 12, 124055) for describing light rays passing near or emitted in the vicinity of compact objects to a broader class of spherically symmetric, static spacetimes, including the Johansen-Psaltis and Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric families.

However, this region has often been dismissed for DM studies because of the evidence for an unexpected gamma-ray component over astrophysical backgrounds at GeV energies, firstly discovered in the data of the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT), the so-called Galactic Center Excess (GCE). While this was initially considered to hint at GeV thermal relics, recent work supports a GCE interpretation in terms of a stellar population of millisecond pulsar-like sources in the Galactic bulge. Building on this preference, we re-evaluate the GC as a powerful target for indirect DM searches via gamma rays. This is achieved by combining adaptive template fitting and pixel-count statistical methods to assess the role of sub-threshold point sources in the observed \textit{Fermi}-LAT gamma-ray counts, while minimizing the mismodeling of Galactic diffuse emission backgrounds. In a fully self-consistent way, the gamma-ray data are fitted with a mixed model comprising a DM signal and a stellar bulge, both potentially contributing to the GCE. The space left for signals from weak-scale DM particle annihilations is quantified by extracting 95\% C.L. upper limits on the annihilation cross section, which, depending on the DM density profile, result in stringent limits for masses $\lesssim 300$ GeV.

To examine how robust the decay dynamics of oscillons via parametric resonance we previously found in Li et al. 2025 are to the specific form of the coupling, we extend the analysis to include a three-point interaction $g_3\phi\chi^2$. We compute the Floquet exponents of the external field $\chi$ under an oscillating oscillon background and analyze how the instability bands depend on the coupling constants and the oscillon shapes. Numerical simulations of the two-field system show that, similar to the four-point case, the parametric resonance may cease before the oscillon is destroyed, leaving a smaller oscillon that decays only perturbatively. This indicates that the partial decay of oscillons through parametric resonance is a generic phenomenon of oscillon-scalar couplings, qualitatively insensitive to the specific interaction form, while the shape of instability bands, parameter dependence, and the precise critical oscillon energies depend on the specific coupling. Our findings provide further insights into the decay dynamics of oscillons and their potential role in the post-inflationary reheating process.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burgers dynamics for Poisson point process initial conditions</a><span class="id">[2511.03647]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the statistical properties of one-dimensional Burgers dynamics evolving from stochastic initial conditions defined by a Poisson point process for the velocity potential, with a power-law intensity.

These initial conditions gives rise to self-similar dynamics with probability distributions that display power-law tails. In the limit where the exponent $\alpha$ of the Poisson process that defines the initial conditions goes to infinity, the power-law tails steepen to Gaussian falloffs and we recover the spatial distributions obtained in the classical study by Kida (1979) of Gaussian initial conditions with vanishing large-scale power.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What can cosmic-ray knees reveal about source populations?</a><span class="id">[2404.15097]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic ray (CR) knees (spectral steepenings) encode information on CR accelerator populations. We seek population features that imprint onto knee observables in a manner that is robust enough to be discernible even in the presence of significant systematics in CR data. In particular, we explore how diversity among population members could imprint on the knee phenomenology, under the assumption that a knee is due to a fixed-rigidity cutoff in the source spectra. We use a simple theoretical model for a population of CR accelerators. Each population member accelerates CR to a power-law spectrum, up to a cutoff rigidity. We allow for variance among members, in cutoff rigidity and power-law slope. We find that: (a) the slope step of the spectrum is $\sim 0.5$, decreasing weakly with increasing spread in either property; (b) composition always breaks first; (c) the difference between the break energies in composition and flux increases with increasing diversity; (d) composition and flux break together only if population diversity is minimal. These trends are robust under our assumptions; deviations from them would indicate more complex physics than encoded in our simple model. Comparing these trends with observed CR knees, we conclude that: (i) the primary knee at $\sim 4\times10^{15}$ eV is consistent with a constant-rigidity cutoff according to KASCADE-Grande data processed with post-LHC hadronic models, but not according to other datasets; (ii) the second knee at $\sim 5 \times 10^{17}$ eV requires more complexity than our model; (iii) the spectral feature identified by Auger at $\sim 10^{19}$ eV is consistent with a constant-rigidity source cutoff only if there is a substantial spread in both cutoff rigidity and slope. Interestingly, a significant spread in slope would also result in spectral curvature before the break, which would in turn be contributing to the ankle feature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03444" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark matter from inflationary quantum fluctuations</a><span class="id">[2501.03444]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore a scenario in which dark matter is a massive bosonic field, arising solely from quantum fluctuations generated during inflation. In this framework, dark matter exhibits primordial isocurvature perturbations with an amplitude of ${\cal O}(1)$ at small scales that are beyond the reach of current observations such as those from the CMB and large-scale structure. We derive an exact transfer function for the dark matter field perturbations during the radiation dominated era. Based on this result, we also derive approximate expressions of the transfer function in some limiting cases where we confirm that the exact transfer function reproduces known behaviors. Assuming a monochromatic initial power spectrum, we use the transfer function to identify the viable parameter space defined by the dark matter mass and the length scale of perturbations. A key prediction of this scenario is copious formation of subsolar mass dark matter halos at high redshifts. Observational confirmation of a large population of such low-mass halos will support for the hypothesis that dark matter originated purely from inflationary quantum fluctuations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the Equivalence Principle on Cosmological Scales Using Peculiar Acceleration Power Spectrum</a><span class="id">[2502.02426]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While the (weak) Equivalence Principle (EP) has been rigorously tested within the solar system, its validity on cosmological scales, particularly in the context of dark matter and dark energy, remains uncertain. In this study, we propose a novel method to test EP on cosmological scales by measuring the peculiar acceleration power spectrum of galaxies using the redshift drift technique. We develop an EP estimator, $E_{\rm ep}$, to evaluate the consistency of the peculiar acceleration power spectrum across different tracers. By calculating the ratio of the peculiar acceleration power spectra of tracers, the ensemble average of $E_{\rm ep}$ is expected to be unity if EP holds on cosmological scales for these tracers. We validate this estimator using N-body simulations, focusing on four redshift bins with $z\leq 1.5$ and scales of $k$ in the range of $0.007$ and $0.2$ $h/\rm Mpc$. By fitting a single parameter $\delta_{\rm ep}$ across redshifts, we find that DM particle mocks without EP violation yield $\delta_{\rm ep}$ consistent with zero under the small redshift measurement uncertainty case, while the large redshift uncertainty case slightly induces biases at low redshifts. In addition, when using DM halo mocks with controlled EP violations, no-violation and mild-violation cases show no significant detection, while moderate and strong violations produce statistically significant $\delta_{\rm ep}$ values and high $\chi^2$, especially at low redshifts, confirming the estimator's sensitivity. Taking advantage of advanced observing capabilities, such as next-generation facilities that extend beyond the Square Kilometer Array, the proposed method offers a promising approach for future cosmological tests of EP.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distinguishing Distance Duality breaking models using electromagnetic and gravitational waves measurements</a><span class="id">[2505.13613]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Several assumptions at the foundation of the standard cosmological model have as a direct consequence a specific relation between cosmological distances, known as the distance duality relation, whose violation would be a smoking gun of deviations from standard cosmology.

We consider an inflaton potential that is quadratic near the minimum and flattens in the inflationary regime. By simulating the dynamics in 2+1-dimensional lattices, we have tracked the long-term evolution of the equation of state for about ten e-folds of expansion, for various coupling strengths. The trilinear interaction initially excites daughter field modes through a process of tachyonic resonance immediately after inflation and triggers a temporary deviation of the equation of state from $\bar{w} = 0$ to a maximum value $\bar{w} = \bar{w}_{\rm max} &lt; 1/3$. However, at much later times, the inflaton homogeneous mode once again dominates the energy density, pushing the equation of state towards $\bar{w} = 0$ until the onset of perturbative reheating. By combining the lattice results with a Boltzmann approach, we characterize the entire post-inflationary expansion history, which allows to calculate precise predictions for the inflationary CMB observables. We also accurately compute the redshift of the stochastic gravitational wave background produced during preheating, and show that taking the temporary return of the equation of state towards $\bar{w} = 0$ into account can reduce the amplitude by many orders of magnitude relative to previous estimates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESIgning concordant distances in the age of precision cosmology: the impact of density fluctuations</a><span class="id">[2507.17969]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Discrepancies between distance measurements and $\Lambda$CDM predictions reveal notable features in the distance-redshift relation, possibly suggesting the presence of an evolving dark energy component. Given the central role of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in modeling cosmological distances, we investigate here whether these features instead point to a possible departure from the fundamental FLRW symmetries. Exploiting the transverse and line-of-sight distances provided by baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations, we demonstrate that observed distances hint at a slight but systematic preference for an anisotropic expansion rate emerging regardless of the dark energy model considered. Leveraging this non-FLRW feature, we investigate an inhomogeneous extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model that naturally provides an anisotropic expansion rate. Our analysis demonstrates that models featuring spherical overdensities can explain BAO, supernova, and cosmic microwave background data, providing fits statistically indistinguishable from those obtained with a phantom dark energy scenario. When Pantheon+ data is considered, our analysis challenges the FLRW framework at $2.8\sigma$ and yields scenarios that can be interpreted as subtle but non-negligible deviations from the FLRW metric. When DESY5 supernovae are considered instead, deviations are notably more significant, yielding scenarios that mildly violate the Copernican principle and exclude the FLRW assumption at $5.2\sigma$. Overall, our results motivate a more in-depth investigation of whether the perfectly homogeneous and isotropic FLRW paradigm can still be assumed to accurately predict cosmological distances in the era of precision cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EP250108a/SN2025kg: A Magnetar-powered Gamma-Ray Burst Supernova Originating from a Close Helium-star Binary via Isolated Binary Evolution</a><span class="id">[2507.18544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>SN 2025kg, linked to EP250108a, is among the brightest broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) known, showing unique helium absorptions, a late-time broad H$\alpha$, and an early bump.

To explain SN 2025kg's exceptionally luminous peak, potential energy injection into the $\sim2.5\,M_\odot$ ejecta from a magnetar with initial period $\sim1.7\,{\rm{ms}}$ and magnetic field $\sim2\times10^{15}{\rm{G}}$ may be required, implying a rapidly rotating $\sim4\,M_\odot$ progenitor. Thus, the progenitor may be a low-mass helium star with an extended helium envelope, supported by helium absorption lines and an inferred weak pre-SN wind. Hydrogen-rich material may reside in the inner ejecta layers, as suggested by the late-time broad H$\alpha$, possibly originating from main-sequence companion material evaporated by the magnetar wind. Since the observed near-solar metallicity challenges the popular quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution channel, the rapidly rotating helium-star progenitor of EP250108a/SN 2025kg might attain angular momentum by being tidally spun up by a main-sequence companion in a close binary formed through isolated binary evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23157" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Impacts of Black Hole Mergers: No Relief in Sight for the Hubble Tension</a><span class="id">[2507.23157]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The values of the Hubble constant inferred from local measurements and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) exhibit an approximately 5 sigma tension.

We consider mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), mergers of stellar-mass black holes, and the formation of SMBHs from mergers of smaller black holes. We find that these processes cannot alleviate the tension, as an unrealistically large merger rate, or an overproduction of SMBHs is required.

Due to their short durations and cosmological distances, their dispersion measure (DM) - redshift ($z$) relation is useful for constraining cosmological parameters and detecting the baryons in the Universe. The increasing number of localized FRBs in recent years has provided more precise constraints on these parameters. However, the larger dataset reveals limitations in the widely used probability density function ($p_{\rm diff}$) for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$, which refers to the diffuse electron term of FRB DM. In this project, we collect 117 of the latest, localized FRBs, discuss the effect of a more accurate $\sigma_{\rm diff}$, which is a parameter in $p_{\rm diff}$ and once thoughts as “effective standard deviation”, and more clearly rewrite their likelihood to better constrain the parameters above. We find that the widely used approximation $\sigma_{\rm diff} \sim F/\sqrt{z}$ only works under contrived assumptions and shows the greatest deviation from the true standard deviation in low redshift. In general, one should use an accurate method to derive this parameter from $p_{\rm diff}$. Our method yields better constraints on $H_0\Omega_b f_{\rm diff} = 2.813_{-0.258}^{+0.250}\;{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ or $H_0 = 66.889_{-5.459}^{+6.754} \;{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ when combining the FRB data with CMB measurements and taking $f_{\rm diff} = 0.84$.

In this article, we study a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry group, in which two of the nontrivial symmetries (“Reflection Reality” and a 180 degree rotation) are implied by Unitarity and Lorentz Invariance respectively, while the third is $\mathbf{CRT}$. (In cosmology, Scale Invariance plays the role of Lorentz Invariance.) This naturally leads to converses of the CPT theorem, as any two of the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries will imply the third one. Furthermore, in many field theories, the Reflection Reality $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is actually sufficient to imply the theory is fully unitary, over a generic range of couplings. Building upon previous work on the Cosmological Optical Theorem, we derive non-perturbative reality conditions associated with bulk Reflection Reality (in all flat FLRW models) and $\mathbf{CRT}$ (in de Sitter spacetime), in arbitrary dimensions. Remarkably, this $\mathbf{CRT}$ constraint suffices to fix the phase of all wavefunction coefficients at future infinity (up to a real sign) – without requiring any analytic continuation, or comparison to past infinity – although extra care is required in cases where the bulk theory has logarithmic UV or IR divergences.

Focusing on the induced spectral distortions, we present bounds on the neutrino-Majoron couplings, as a function of the lightest neutrino mass, that are either complementary or competitive with current ones.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plausible Indication of Gamma-Ray Absorption by Dark Matter in NGC 1068</a><span class="id">[2504.21560]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>NGC 1068 is the brightest extragalactic source in high-energy neutrinos as seen by IceCube, yet the accompanying gamma-ray flux is orders of magnitude weaker. It has been argued that this indicates that the bulk of neutrinos and gamma rays are emitted in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive black hole, which is transparent to neutrinos, but opaque to gamma rays. Even in such extreme scenarios for the acceleration of cosmic rays, astrophysical models typically overestimate the low-energy gamma-ray flux and/or require some fine-tuning in the physical parameters. Here we suggest instead that the dark matter surrounding the supermassive black hole may absorb the gamma rays, inducing the observed deficit. We show that for a dark matter-photon scattering cross section in the range $\sigma_{\rm DM-\gamma}/m_{\rm DM} \simeq 10^{-28}-10^{-30}$ cm$^2$/GeV, Fermi-LAT measurements can be well reconciled with IceCube data. We also present some simple particle physics examples that achieve the correct spectral energy dependence while respecting complementary constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Once-in-a-lifetime encounter models for neutrino media II: Quasi-steady states and miscidynamic flavor evolution</a><span class="id">[2508.14331]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extended the once-in-a-lifetime encounter (OILE) model to stochastic interactions among neutrinos. As in the original OILE model, the new model reproduces the mean-field behavior of a dense neutrino gas for time $t\lesssim (\mu\gamma)^{-1}$, where $\mu$ measures the strength of the mean-field neutrino self-interaction potential and is proportional to the neutrino density, and the dimensionless &quot;impact parameter&quot; $\gamma$ is a measure of the change in the flavor quantum state of a neutrino during interaction with another neutrino when the wave packets of the two neutrinos overlap. As in the mean-field case, the OILE model with random neutrino velocities experiences kinetic flavor decoherence as the flavor quantum states of the neutrinos diverge from each other. Unlike the mean-field case, however, the OILE model has a &quot;collision term&quot; due to the quantum entanglement among neutrinos. For $\gamma\ll1$, this incoherent effect can drive the neutrinos into a quasi-steady state that is similar to the collective precession mode in a homogeneous and isotropic neutrino gas in the mean-field approximation. Subsequently, the collision term drives the neutrino gas adiabatically through different quasi-steady states and eventually to flavor equilibration. This process is an example of miscidynamic flavor evolution, with the mixing equilibria being the quasi-steady precession states.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02729" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational tests of the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina cosmological model</a><span class="id">[2511.02729]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider detailed cosmological tests of dark energy models obtained from the general conformal transformation of the Kropina metric, representing an $(\alpha,\beta)$-type Finslerian geometry. In particular, we restrict our analysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric function is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\alpha$ and of the one-form $\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the conformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of conformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models obtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the presence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The generalized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the Riemannian metric $\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker representation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a specific relationship between the component of the one-form $\beta$ and the conformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is determined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free parameter $\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological models are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of $\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM model is also performed. Our results indicate that the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple, alternative to standard cosmological models.</p></div></details></article></body>
