Pal &amp; R. Saha 2024) of using ANNs to infer cosmological density parameters by determining optimal architecture for varying synthetic Hubble data SNRs in estimating the density parameters $\Omega_{m, 0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda, 0}$ across redshift values $z \in [0, 1]$. To generate the synthetic data, this study randomly sampled initial free parameter values at $z=0$ from theoretically motivated priors and evolved them backwards using the first Friedmann Equation to generate clean $H(z)$ curves. Then, this paper adds realistic noise of high, normal, and low SNR by sampling relative uncertainties from a Gaussian KDE on 47 real data observations compiled by A. Bouali et al. (2023). In the end, this study found that a RNN that uses BiLSTM is the most effective for high and normal SNR data across four quantitative metrics. On the other hand, a combination of convolution and recurrent layers that uses GRU performed the best for low SNR data across the same four metrics. A comparison between the results of this paper's ANN predictions and those of ParamANN shows that all architectures tested in this paper regardless of training SNR are statistically consistent within 1 standard deviation of ParamANN. However, most ANN results are not statistically consistent within 3 standard deviations of Planck Collaboration et al. (2020), showing a significant difference between ANN and the more traditional MCMC methods used by Planck collaboration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unified kinetic theory of induced scattering: Compton, Brillouin, and Raman processes in magnetized electron and positron pair plasma</a><span class="id">[2510.12869]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a unified theoretical framework for induced (stimulated) scattering-parametric instabilities of electromagnetic waves, including induced Compton, stimulated Brillouin, and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in strongly magnetized electron-positron pair plasma. By solving the dispersion relations derived from kinetic theory, taking into account the ponderomotive force due to the beat of incident and scattered waves, we obtain analytical expressions for the linear growth rates of the ordinary, neutral, and charged modes of density fluctuations. Our results clarify which type of scattering dominates under different thermal coupling, resonance, and density conditions. In strong magnetic fields, scattering of perpendicularly polarized waves is generally suppressed, but by different powers of the cyclotron frequency. Moreover, SRS, which is forbidden in unmagnetized electron and positron pair plasma, becomes possible in the charged mode. This framework enables a comprehensive evaluation of induced scattering in extreme astrophysical and laboratory plasma, such as fast radio burst (FRB) emission and propagation in magnetar magnetospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing evolution of Dark Energy density from observations</a><span class="id">[2510.12881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a model–independent reconstruction of the normalized dark energy density function, $X(z) \equiv \rho_{\mathrm{de}}(z)/\rho_{\mathrm{de}}(0)$, derived directly from the DES-SN5YR Type Ia supernova sample. The analysis employs an inversion formalism that relates the derivative of the distance modulus, $\mu^{\prime}(z)$, to the expansion history, allowing the data to determine the shape of $X(z)$ without assuming a specific equation–of–state or dark energy density parameterization. A statistically optimized binning of the supernova sample (using 17 intervals following the Freedman–Diaconis criterion and 34 following Scott's rule) ensures a stable estimation of $\mu^{\prime}(z)$ and a controlled propagation of uncertainties throughout the inversion process. The resulting $X(z)$ remains statistically consistent with a constant value within one standard deviation across the entire redshift range, showing no significant evidence for an evolving dark energy component at present. In a direct comparison among $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and the quadratic $X^2(z)$ parameterization – where CPL and $X^2(z)$ each introduce two additional free parameters relative to $\Lambda$CDM – the CPL model attains the best statistical agreement with the data, albeit only marginally and strictly within this restricted model set. These outcomes indicate that current observations are compatible with an almost constant dark energy density ($w \simeq -1$), while the inversion framework remains sensitive to subtle departures that forthcoming high–precision surveys could resolve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mean Motion Resonances in AGN Disks</a><span class="id">[2510.12895]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mean motion resonances (MMRs) are a generic outcome of convergent migration for bodies embedded in accretion disks around a central mass. Long studied in planetary systems, the same phenomenon should occur for stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in AGN disks. In this work, we derive simple analytic criteria describing when BH pairs are driven out of resonance, and use them to chart MMR stability across AGN parameter space, accounting for disruption from general-relativistic apsidal precession, hydrodynamic turbulence, and stellar stirring. Across plausible AGN disk models, we find three MBH mass regimes: (i) for $M/ M_\odot\gtrsim 10^{7.5}$, first order resonances are generically unstable; (ii) for $M/ M_\odot\lesssim 10^{6.5}$, stable MMRs are always present; (iii) for $10^{6.5}\lesssim M / M_\odot \lesssim 10^{7.5}$, stability depends on disk mass flux, the summed mass of the orbiters, and the nuclear-cusp slope. When present, stable MMRs commonly occur between an inner anti-trap and an outer trap set by thermal torque, a region where embedded objects migrate outward in the disk. These results imply that high-mass AGN allow convergent migration to proceed to LVK-band mergers largely without resonant chains, whereas low/intermediate-mass AGN can host MMRs, with the potential to reshape merger pathways.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strategy for identifying Vera C. Rubin Observatory kilonova candidates for targeted gravitational-wave searches</a><span class="id">[2510.12932]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Since the observation of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and the associated kilonova AT2017gfo, the next joint gravitational-wave/optical kilonova has been highly anticipated. Overlapping observations between the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the international gravitational-wave detector network are expected soon. Wide-field survey facilities, such as Rubin, can serve dual roles in gravitational-wave astronomy: conducting dedicated optical counterpart searches following gravitational-wave triggers and, through surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), providing opportunities for fortuitous kilonova discoveries during routine operations. We use simulations to develop a strategy for identifying kilonova candidates observed by Rubin and processed by the Fink broker. These candidates can be used as astrophysical triggers for a targeted gravitational-wave search. We simulate kilonovae light-curves for the first year of Rubin with the latest observing strategy for the Wide-Fast-Deep and the Deep Drilling Fields. Assuming a kilonova rate of 250 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, we find that Rubin brokers should observe $\sim 4$ kilonovae per year with at least one alert above a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 within the gravitational-wave detector horizon ($\sim 350$ Mpc). Most of these will be faint, and detected 1-2 days following the neutron star merger. Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up will be limited to large telescopes. Using archival data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and our proposed selection criteria, we estimate a minimum contamination of at least 30 events per month from other transients and variables, even under our strictest selection criteria. A deep gravitational-wave search targeting Rubin kilonova candidates may lead to the next multi-messenger discovery.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Ray Transport and Gamma-Ray Signatures in the Interstellar Medium</a><span class="id">[2510.12965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The interaction of cosmic rays (CRs) with magnetic fields and the interstelar medium (ISM) leads to the production of nonthermal radiation. Although this has been a topic of study for many years, it still poses many challenges to the understanding of these processes. In this work we present a short review of recent advances in the understanding of CR propagation in magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence, in particular the process of mirror diffusion, and how it can help explain recent observational constraints for CR diffusion away from sources. We also present preliminary results from Monte Carlo simulations of CR cascading and propagation within a young massive stellar cluster (YMSC), aimed at probing the origin of very-high-energy (VHE) emission from these sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Resolution Modelling of Coronae and Winds in Solar-type Stars with Varying Rotation Rates I. X-ray Coronae</a><span class="id">[2510.12969]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar coronae are believed to be the main birthplace of various stellar magnetic activities. However, the structures and properties of stellar coronae remain poorly understood. Using the Space Weather Modelling Framework with the Alfvén Wave Solar Model (SWMF-AWSoM) and dynamo-generated surface magnetic maps, here we model the coronae of four solar-type stars. By incorporating the Sun, our work covers a range of stars with the rotation varying from 1.0 to 23.3 $\Omega_\odot$ (periods of 25 to 1 days). Guided by observations, we scale the magnetic field strength with increasing rotation, covering a range between 6.0 G to 1200 G approximately. In our models, energy release associated with small-scale magnetic flux is a key source of coronal heating and is essential for reproducing realistic coronal structures. Our models capture dense (1$-$2 orders of magnitude higher than solar values) and ultra-hot ($\sim 10\,\mathrm{MK}$) coronae dominated by closed field structures. Using the CHIANTI atomic database, we also compute synthetic X-ray spectra and derive the corresponding X-ray luminosities $(L_X)$, which follow a scaling law to magnetic field $L_X \propto \langle|\mathbf{B}|\rangle^{1.75}$. Furthermore, the coronal X-ray emission is found to be rotationally modulated by the alternating presence of bright active regions and dark coronal holes. These results provide new insights into the extremely high-energy coronae of rapidly rotating solar-type stars, which differ markedly from the Sun.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galactic X-ray Transients in the First eROSITA All Sky Survey</a><span class="id">[2510.12982]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although a multitude of studies have focused on targeted observations of Galactic X-ray transients, blind surveys and population studies have been limited. We have used the ROSAT, eROSITA and Gaia source catalogs to find Galactic X-ray transients having timescales $&lt;$30 years. We report the properties of 738 transients found in our search, majority of which are active stars or interacting binaries. We have also found $\sim$40 compact object systems among which are at least 8 newly-identified white-dwarf systems, 3 known X-ray binaries, and one known pulsar. We use eROSITA (soft X-ray) spectra of the Galactic transients to show that two distinct types of flaring systems are prevalent: one having peak around 1 keV, well fit by thermal models, and another having peak below 0.2 keV and requiring a power-law component. Our study also reveals that single star or interacting binary systems (X-ray transients) involving giant stars exhibit significantly higher X-ray luminosities than systems involving only main-sequence stars or young stellar objects. Finally, we discuss the properties of the transients in the context of their putative emission mechanisms, the fraction of transients with respect to the total population, and the rates of Galactic transients expected in blind searches of the X-ray sky.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">When Tiny Halos Stir Spacetime: Gravitational Waves from Fifth-Force Mergers</a><span class="id">[2510.12984]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter fermions interacting via attractive fifth forces mediated by a light mediator can form dark matter halos in the very early universe. We show that bound systems composed of these halos are capable of generating gravitational wave (GW) signals detectable today, even when the individual halos are very light. The Yukawa force dominates the dynamics of these halo binaries, rather than gravity. As a result, large GW signals can be produced at initially extremely high frequencies, which are then redshifted to frequency bands accessible to current or future GW observatories. In addition, the resulting GW signals carry distinctive features that enable future observations to distinguish them from conventional ones. Notably, even if only a tiny fraction of dark matter experiences strong fifth-force interactions, such effects provide a new avenue to discover self-interacting dark matter through GW observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13014" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond OCCAM: Measuring Optical Neutron Capture Abundances of Open Cluster Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.13014]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Open clusters have long been used to determine ages of stars, as well as calibrate stellar evolution models and other methods of age-dating stellar groups, e.g., gyrochronology, asteroseismology, and chemical clocks.

In this work, we investigate two FXRTs, the LEIA X-ray Transient LXT 240402A and the Einstein Probe EP 250207b, whose precise positions lie close to nearby ($z\!\lesssim\!0.1$) quiescent galaxies with negligible probability of chance coincidence, identifying them as particularly promising cases of merger-driven explosions in the local Universe. We used Chandra to derive accurate localizations for both events and secure otherwise ambiguous associations with their optical counterparts. Deep optical and near-infrared observations with VLT, GTC, and LBT were performed to characterize the surrounding environment and search for kilonova emission, the hallmark of neutron star mergers. Complementary early-time X-ray monitoring with Swift and Einstein Probe was used to constrain the non-thermal afterglow. We find that both FXRTs remain compatible with a compact binary merger progenitor, which produced low-mass ejecta and kilonova emission subdominant to the afterglow. However, alternative explanations such as a distant ($z\!\gtrsim\!1$) core-collapse supernova cannot be conclusively ruled out.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Highly Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes in Galactic Nuclei</a><span class="id">[2510.13066]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A significant fraction of compact-object mergers in galactic nuclei are expected to be eccentric in the Laser-Interferometer-Space-Antenna (LISA) frequency sensitivity range, $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}\ \rm Hz$. Several compact binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration may retain hints of residual eccentricity at $10$ Hz, suggesting dynamical or triple origins for a significant fraction of the gravitational-wave-observable population. In triple systems, von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations perturb both the eccentricity and the argument of pericentre, $\omega$, of the inner black hole binary. The latter could be fully \textit{circulating}, where $\omega$ cycles through $2\pi$, or may \textit{librate}, with $\omega$ ranges about a fixed value with small or large variation. We use \texttt{TSUNAMI}, a regularised N-body code with up to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) term corrections, to identify four different families of orbits: (i) circulating, (ii) small and (iii) large amplitude librating, and (iv) merging orbits. We develop and demonstrate a new method to construct gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole formula utilising the instantaneous {\it total} acceleration of each binary component in \texttt{TSUNAMI}. We show that the four orbital families have distinct waveform phenomenologies, enabling them to be distinguished if observed in LISA. The orbits are also distinguishable from an isolated binary or from a binary perturbed by a different tertiary orbit, even if the secular timescale is the same. Future burst timing models will be able to distinguish the different orbital configurations. For efficient binary formation, about $\sim 50$ binaries can have librating orbits in the Galactic Centre.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Highly Eccentric Stellar Binary Black-Holes in Galactic Nuclei</a><span class="id">[2510.13074]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A significant fraction of gravitational-wave mergers are expected to be eccentric in the Laser-Interferometer-Space-Antenna (LISA) frequency band, $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ Hz.

II. Alignment with DESI BAO and Signs of a Non-Accelerating Universe</a><span class="id">[2510.13121]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernova (SN) cosmology is based on the key assumption that the luminosity standardization process of Type Ia SNe remains invariant with progenitor age. However, direct and extensive age measurements of SN host galaxies reveal a significant (5.5{\sigma}) correlation between standardized SN magnitude and progenitor age, which is expected to introduce a serious systematic bias with redshift in SN cosmology. This systematic bias is largely uncorrected by the commonly used mass-step correction, as progenitor age and host galaxy mass evolve very differently with redshift. After correcting for this age-bias as a function of redshift, the SN dataset aligns more closely with the w0waCDM model recently suggested by the DESI BAO project from a combined analysis using only BAO and CMB data. This result is further supported by an evolution-free test that uses only SNe from young, coeval host galaxies across the full redshift range. When the three cosmological probes (SNe, BAO, CMB) are combined, we find a significantly stronger (&gt; 9{\sigma}) tension with the {\Lambda}CDM model than that reported in the DESI papers, suggesting a time-varying dark energy equation of state in a currently non-accelerating universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13129" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2510.13129]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In these lecture notes, we describe the current state-of-the-art for numerical simulations of large-scale structure and galaxy formation. Numerical simulations play a central role in the preparation and the exploitation of large-scale galaxy surveys, in which galaxies are the fundamental observational objects. We first describe basic methods for collisionless N-body dynamics that enable us to model dark matter accurately by solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations. We then discuss simple methods to populate dark matter halos with galaxies, such as Halo and Sub-halo Abundance Matching techniques and baryonification techniques for capturing baryonic effects on the matter distribution. We finally describe how to model the gas component by solving the Euler-Poisson equations, focusing on the foundational assumptions behind these equations, namely local thermo-dynamical equilibrium, and the nature of the truncation errors of the numerical scheme, namely numerical diffusion. We show a few examples of simulations of a Milky-Way-like halo without cooling, with cooling and with star formation. We finally describe different subgrid prescriptions recently developed to model star formation, supernovae feedback and active galactic nuclei and how they impact cosmological simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some problems associated with the standardization of the light curve of type 1a supernovae</a><span class="id">[2510.13187]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that the parameters used to standardize the luminosity of Type 1a supernovae in the SALT2 and SiFTO models are strongly dependent on the redshift z. Consequently, when standardized with increasing z, the average absolute magnitudes of Type 1a supernovae are artificially increased. This means that for a given apparent magnitude they are, on average, assigned larger distances than they actually are, creating the appearance of their recession with acceleration and requiring the introduction of the concept of antigravity (dark energy) to explain it. We also show that after standardization, Type 1a supernovae cease to be standard candles. We therefore argue that such a standardization is not suitable for measuring the distances to Type 1a supernovae, and hence the accelerating expansion of the Universe is called into question.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13249" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monte Carlo simulation of the Compton scattering and disk reflection of a cylinder with hot electrons moving away from a black hole</a><span class="id">[2510.13249]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For accreting black holes (BHs), the lamp-post scenario is a simple and popular model: a hot and point-like corona is located above the black hole, irradiating the accretion disk with hard X-ray radiation, which is believed to be generated by inverse Compton scattering in the corona. Although the lamp-post model successfully explains the disk reflection component, it fails to address the origin of seed photons and the geometry of the hot corona, because this model simplistically treats the corona as a point-like source generating a cutoff powerlaw spectrum. In this paper, we make simulations on a possible physical realization of the lamp-post scenario: the shape of the scattering zone is set to be a cylinder, corresponding to the jet base near a BH. The source of seed photons in this system is assumed to be the multicolor blackbody radiation of the accretion disk. In our simulations, the Compton scattering process is simulated with a custom Monte Carlo program based on the Geant4 package and the disk reflection process is simulated with the xilconv model in XSPEC. Our simulation results have confirmed that the relativistic motion of the jet can weaken or even completely suppress the reflection of the accretion disk, and simultaneously, the Comptonization of disk photons in the jet can still make a major contribution to the observed X-ray spectrum in high energy range. We discuss the implications of our simulation results, in light of the recent observations of a very weak reflection component in the presence of a strong hard X-ray radiation from the outburst of Swift J1727.8-1613.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13294" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global linear analysis of the magneto-thermal instability in a stratified spherical model of the intracluster medium</a><span class="id">[2510.13294]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The buoyancy stability properties of the ICM are modified because of the anisotropic transport of heat along the magnetic field lines. This feature gives rise to the MTI when the temperature gradient is aligned with the gravity, which occurs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Most previous linear analyses of the MTI adopted a local, Boussinesq approach. However, the conduction length, which sets the characteristic length scale of the MTI, might be a non-negligible fraction of the scale height in the ICM. We want to assess the impact of locality assumptions on the linear physics of the MTI. Another goal is to unveil the deeper connections between these global MTI modes and their MRI counterparts in accretion discs. Our third objective is to provide a new benchmark against which any numerical code implementing the Braginskii heat flux in spherical geometry can be tested. We perform a global linear analysis of the MTI in a spherical stratified model of the ICM. We use a combination of analytical results, corroborated by numerical results obtained with both a pseudo-spectral solver and IDEFIX, to better explain the physics of the global MTI modes. We obtain scaling laws and approximate expressions for the growth rates of the global modes. We show that the associated functions are confined within an inner region, limited by a turning point, where the mode is allowed to grow. The most unstable local MTI modes correspond to the portion of the global mode localised near the turning point. This phenomenology is similar to that of the global MRI modes. Finally, direct simulations successfully reproduce the global MTI modes and their growth rates, with errors smaller than 1%. Overall, this study provides us with new insights on the linear theory of the global MTI in the ICM, and a useful numerical test bench for any astrophysical fluid dynamics code embedding anisotropic heat flux.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relativistic reflection within an extended hot plasma geometry</a><span class="id">[2510.13337]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reflection of X-rays at the inner accretion disk around black holes imprints relativistically broadened features in the observed spectrum. Besides the black hole properties and the ionization and density of the accretion disk the features also depend on the location and geometry of the primary source of X-rays, often called the corona. We present a fast general relativistic model for spectral fitting of a radially extended, ring-like corona above the accretion disk. A commonly used model to explain observed X-ray reflection spectra is the lamp post, which assumes a point-like source on the rotational axis of the black hole. While often being able to explain the observations, this geometric model does not allow for a constraint on the radial size of the corona. We therefore extend the publicly available relativistic reflection model RELXILL by implementing a radially extended, ring-like primary source. With the new RELXILL model allowing us to vary the position of the primary source in two dimensions, we present simulated line profiles and spectra and discuss implications of data fitting compared to the lamp post model. We then apply this extended RELXILL model to XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data of the radio-quiet Seyfert-2 AGN ESO 033-G002. The new model describes the data well, and we are able to constrain the distance of the source to the black hole to be less than three gravitational radii, while the angular position of the source is poorly constrained. We show that a compact, radially extended corona close to the ISCO can explain the observed relativistic reflection equally well as the point-like lamp post corona.

Some of these stars exhibit enhanced s-process and/or r-process elements, hence are classified as CEMP-s, CEMP-rs, or CEMP-r. This classification is challenging due to the limited availability of heavy element abundances, particularly among r-process elements. Heavy r-process elements such as terbium, holmium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, tantalum, and iridium have rarely been measured because their sensitive lines are located in the ultraviolet. However, they provide sensitive diagnostics of the s-, r-, and i- nucleosynthetic processes. In this work, we aim to obtain a secure classification of CEMP-s and -rs stars and investigate whether the i-process can account for the measured abundance patterns in CEMP-rs stars. We derive the abundance profiles, notably for twelve heavy r-elements, including, in some cases, tantalum, using high-resolution UVES spectra of seventeen CEMP-s and -rs stars. Based on indicators such as the [s/r] abundance ratio or the model-independent 'abundance distance', nine stars are confirmed as CEMP-rs and six as CEMP-s. The classification of two objects remains uncertain. The i-process satisfactorily reproduces the abundance patterns of CEMP-rs stars. However, larger samples are needed to confirm trends with metallicity and clarify how CEMP-rs stars differ from CEMP-s stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13388" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ON the stability of triangular Lagrangian points in the spatial restricted three-body problem</a><span class="id">[2510.13388]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the present paper, which is a development of an earlier study by the author \cite{Sosnitskii08}, we consider the stability of triangular libration points in the spatial circular restricted three-body problem and improve the result of author's work \cite{Sosnitskii08}.

Using 13.1 years of IceCube data, we present a follow-up search for neutrino sources in the northern sky. NGC 1068 remains the most significant neutrino source among 110 preselected gamma-ray emitters while also being spatially compatible with the most significant location in the northern sky. Its energy spectrum is characterized by an unbroken power-law with spectral index $\gamma = 3.4 \pm 0.2$. Consistent with previous results, the observed neutrino flux exceeds its gamma-ray counterpart by at least two orders of magnitude. Motivated by this disparity and the high X-ray luminosity of the source, we selected 47 X-ray bright Seyfert galaxies from the Swift/BAT spectroscopic survey that were not included in the list of gamma-ray emitters. When testing this collection for neutrino emission, we observe a 3.3$\sigma$ excess from an ensemble of 11 sources, with NGC 1068 excluded from the sample. Our results strengthen the evidence that X-ray bright cores of active galactic nuclei are neutrino emitters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Examining a new form of non-standard dark matter using DESI DR2 data</a><span class="id">[2510.13436]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we propose a non-standard dark matter (NSDM) model in which the equation of state (EoS) of dark matter (DM) is parameterized as $w_{\rm dm} = w_2 a^2$, and this DM model is motivated by the idea that DM must become cold dark matter (CDM) in the neighborhood of the scale factor $a = 0$, which implies that both the EoS of DM, $w_{\rm dm}$, and its derivative with respect to the scale factor, ${\rm d}w_{\rm dm}/{\rm d}a$, vanish at $a = 0$. By incorporating the latest cosmological datasets – including the Planck2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), together with three independent Type Ia Supernova datasets, namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus sample – we constrain the $\Lambda w_2$DM, $ww_2$DM, and $w_0w_aw_2$DM models, which are constructed by replacing CDM with NSDM in the $\Lambda $CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models, respectively. We find that there is a preference for a negative DM EoS at more than the $3\sigma$ confidence level for the data combinations CMB+DESI+Union3 and CMB+DESI+DESY5. Moreover, for all data combinations, replacing CDM with NSDM in the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM models significantly reduces the probability of violating the null energy condition. Furthermore, both $ww_2$DM and $w_0w_aw_2$DM are favored over $\Lambda $CDM with a significance comparable to that of the $w_0w_a$CDM model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13477" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Primordial black holes with the distortion of Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</a><span class="id">[2510.13477]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), arising from the incoherent superposition of numerous compact binary coalescences, serves as a powerful probe of both astrophysical populations and fundamental physics.

Assuming PBHs as dark matter candidates with a broad cosmic distribution, we show that their lensing optical depth can be significantly enhanced, producing pronounced effects with relative deviations at the 10^-1 level. By systematically varying the PBH mass (M_PBH) and abundance (f_PBH), we demonstrate that the mass predominantly determines the frequency-dependent diffraction features of the spectrum, while the abundance primarily amplifies the overall lensing-induced deviation. Although the SGWB from binary black holes has not yet been observed, our analytical results provide theoretical insight into the possible imprint of lensing on its spectrum and suggest that future detections could offer a novel avenue to constrain dark matter scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13479" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaotic Dynamics and Zero-Velocity Structures in the Pluto-Charon CR3BP</a><span class="id">[2510.13479]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pluto and Charon are a dwarf binary system with a high mass ratio $\mu$, preventing Trojan companions.

This study models the Pluto-Charon system in the planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) and compares the tadpole and horseshoe orbits of a massless particle with known low-$\mu$ orbits. Moreover, it compares the trajectories for instances where the L1 neck is opened and closed, and exhibits the corresponding zero-velocity curves; RK4 integration was used to update the position and velocity of the particle. The simulations consistently showed chaotic and unpredictable trajectories, where small changes in initial parameters could completely alter the results; trajectories displayed the influence of higher values of $\mu$ on the stability of binary systems. These findings confirm that Pluto-Charon cannot host long-lived Trojan companions and instead behaves as a system of chaotic transport. Future work could extend the study to include the spatial or elliptic three-body problem, further refining the understanding of instability in high-$\mu$ binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recent progress on interstellar radionuclides on Earth and the Moon</a><span class="id">[2510.13486]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of interstellar radionuclides in geological archives provides insights into nucleosynthesis in stars and stellar explosions as well as interstellar medium dynamics in the Local Bubble and the Local Interstellar Cloud.

Using 1000 \Euclid-like cluster catalogues, we investigate the effect of systematic uncertainties on cluster summary statistics and their auto- and cross-covariance, and perform a likelihood analysis to evaluate their impact on cosmological constraints, with a focus on the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and on the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$. Combining cluster clustering with number counts significantly improves cosmological constraints, with the figure of merit increasing by over 300\% compared to number counts alone. We confirm that the two probes are uncorrelated, and the cosmological constraints derived from their combination are almost insensitive to the cosmology dependence of the covariance. We find that photometric redshift uncertainties broaden cosmological posteriors by 20–30\%, while secondary effects like redshift-space distortions (RSDs) have a smaller impact on the posteriors – 5\% for clustering alone, 10\% when combining probes – but can significantly bias the constraints if neglected. We show that clustering data below $60\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc provides additional constraining power, while scales larger than acoustic oscillation scale add almost no information on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ parameters. RSDs and photo-$z$ uncertainties also influence the number count covariance, with a significant impact, of about 15–20\%, on the parameter constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13527" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the Formation of Planets Interior to in situ Hot Jupiters</a><span class="id">[2510.13527]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The population of hot Jupiters with adjacent planetary companions is small but growing, and inner companions appear to be a nearly ubiquitous outcome within this subset of the exoplanet census.

In this work, we explore the possibility of in situ formation for both hot Jupiters and their interior companions. Using numerical simulations performed with the N-body integrator REBOUND, we investigate the growth of interior companions under various assumptions about disk conditions and hot Jupiter final orbital positions.

Understanding their luminosity function and formation rate is crucial for elucidating their nature. Based on the latest catalog of EP-detected FXTs, we present, a model-independent, non-parametric approach to derive the luminosity function and formation rate of FXTs. Our analysis reveals significant cosmological luminosity evolution, characterized by a scaling relationship of $(1+z)^{3.58}$. After accounting for this evolution, we establish that the local luminosity function is best represented by a broken power law, with a break luminosity of $(4.17 \pm 0.34) \times 10^{46}$ erg/s. The formation rate exhibits a gentle decline with redshift, following the relation $(1+z)^{-0.21}$, yielding a local rate of approximately $28.0_{-16.4}^{+27.3}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate is comparable to that of low-luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). Our findings indicate a potential correlation between FXTs and LGRBs, supporting the majority of FXTs may be linked to collapsar progenitors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 2024 outburst of the neutron star LMXB EXO 0748-676: an investigation of bursts and eclipses with AstroSat</a><span class="id">[2510.13556]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed analysis of the Type-I (thermonuclear) X-ray bursts and eclipses observed from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) EXO 0748–676 with AstroSat during the second known outburst of the source following a 16-year-long quiescence period. We detect three thermonuclear X-ray bursts, with two displaying simultaneous coverage in the soft X-rays. Simultaneous UV observations show evidence of reprocessed burst emissions in the far-ultraviolet band. The time-resolved spectral analysis reveals the photospheric radius expansion (PRE) nature for two bursts. We estimate the distance to the source to be $7.42\pm0.53$ kpc using the peak flux of PRE. Notably, one of the bursts exhibited a secondary peak, $\sim30$ s after the primary, particularly dominating in the softer X-rays, which reveals a correlation with the evolution of burst hotspot radius with no temperature dependence. The burst properties and corresponding flux values suggest that mixed H/He burning may have fueled the bursts. We also detect evidence of a soft excess during one burst, likely arising from the interaction of the burst photons with the surroundings. We uncover evidence for a hard X-ray deficit during the peak of all bursts and a hard lag of $\sim4$ s, which can be attributed to the Compton cooling of the corona by the burst photons. We also probe the temporal evolution and the energy dependence of the eclipses, which offer insights into the binary environment. Our study helps gain deeper insight into the physics of burst ignition, flame propagation, the burst-accretion interaction, and the evolution of LMXBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyperons and $Δ$'s in rotating protoneutron stars: Local properties</a><span class="id">[2510.13574]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The structural evolution of rotating protoneutron stars encodes essential information about their observable signatures, while microscopic properties provide complementary knowledge to advance observational investigations. Using a relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent couplings that account for temperature and particle composition, we investigate rotation, neutrino-emission-driven changes in angular momentum, particle distributions, temperature profiles, and sound speed to probe the internal dynamics of protoneutron star matter. Additionally, we track the evolution of macroscopic quantities such as energy distribution and gravitational mass and establish direct links between microphysics and global evolution. Extending the framework of Phys. Rev. D 112, 023007 (2025), which focuses on the global properties of rotating protoneutron star evolution, our results reveal that protoneutron star deformation and thermal evolution are governed by angular momentum, mass, and composition. Exotic matter (hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances) and rapid rotation enhance deformation leading to a reduction in core temperature, whereas slowly rotating stars like PSR J0740$+$6620 remain nearly spherical. Our predicted equatorial radii for PSR J0740$+$6620, $13.0\ \mathrm{km} &lt; R_e &lt; 13.5\ \mathrm{km}$, are consistent with NICER measurements.

To confirm the existence of this oscillation and precisely measure its period, I conducted extensive photometric observations of the object over 25 nights between 2022 and 2024. The total duration of these observations was 139 hr. The observations revealed the oscillation on each observation night. This oscillation was coherent throughout all the observations covering 18 months. Due to the large coverage of observations, I was able to determine the oscillation period with high precision. It was found to be 41.485867+0.000026 min. The semi-amplitude of the oscillation was large, averaging 0.154(2) mag. The pulse profile of the oscillation did not change during the observations and followed a perfect sinusoidal pattern. With the high precision of the period, I created an ephemeris for the oscillation with a validity time of 30 years. This ephemeris can be used in future studies of changes in the oscillation period. Although short-period X-ray oscillations have not yet been detected in 1RXS J014549.6+514314, the high coherence of its 41-minute oscillation suggests that this object is most likely to be an intermediate polar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar Cycle Variation of Sustained Gamma-ray Emission Events from the Sun and Related Energetic Events</a><span class="id">[2510.13610]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun is one of the fascinating high energy phenomena closely related to the acceleration of protons to energies &gt;300 MeV. Here we report on the solar cycle variation of SGRE events based on observations from Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT). This report covers solar cycles (SCs) 24 and 25 during which Fermi has been operating. Since SGRE events are closely related to solar energetic particle (SEP) events and interplanetary type II radio bursts caused by fast and wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we consider these phenomena as well. Many studies have shown that SC 25 is similar or slightly stronger than SC 24. The number of SEP events, GLE events, IP type II bursts, and fast and wide CMEs confirm this conclusion. However, the number of SGRE events observed by Fermi LAT has diminished significantly in SC 25 relative to SC 24. One of the issues has been the reduced coverage of the Sun since 2018 due to a mechanical problem with a solar array of the Fermi mission. By identifying the Fermi LAT gaps and the number of energetic events (fast and wide CMEs, interplanetary type II bursts) we conclude that about three times more SGRE events must have occurred than the 15 events observed by Fermi.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planetary-mass companions to a retired B star BD+37 3172 and a retired F star BD+42 2315</a><span class="id">[2510.13728]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radial velocity searches may lead to detection of exoplanets at large orbital separations only if long-enough time-series of data are available.

This study utilizes the magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO to simulate collisions and mergers of $5$ to $10 \,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ main-sequence stars, systematically comparing the properties of the resulting products. Both collisions and mergers yield more massive, strongly magnetized, rapidly and differentially rotating stars with cores enriched in hydrogen, but notable quantitative differences emerge. Merger products exhibit core hydrogen fractions up to $10\%$ higher than those of collision products. In both scenarios, turbulent mixing amplifies magnetic field energies by $9$ to $12$ orders of magnitude. However, magnetic fields in small-impact-parameter collision products display small-scale reversals that may dissipate over time, whereas merger products and large-impact-parameter collision products develop large-scale ordered, potentially long-lived magnetic fields. Additionally, only merger products display magnetically driven, bipolar outflows with radial velocities exceeding $300$ to $400 \,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

We use two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations to study the effect of a central energy source, varying the amount, rate, and isotropy of the energy deposition. We post-process the results with a time-dependent Monte Carlo radiation transport code to extract observational signatures. The engine excavates a bubble at the centre of the ejecta, which becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. Sufficiently powerful engines are able to break through the edge of the bubble and accelerate, shred, and compositionally mix the entire ejecta. The breakout of the engine-driven wind occurs at distinct rupture points, and the outflowing high-velocity gas may eventually give rise to radio emission. The dynamical impact of the engine leads to faster rising optical light curves, with photon escape facilitated by the faster expansion of the ejecta and the opening of low-density channels. For models with strong engines, the spectra are initially hot and featureless, but later evolve to resemble those of broad-line Ic supernovae. Under certain conditions, line emission from ionized, low-velocity material near the centre of the ejecta may be able to escape and produce narrow emission similar to that seen in interacting supernovae. We discuss how variability in the engine energy reservoir and injection rate could give rise to a heterogeneous set of events spanning multiple observational classes, including the fast blue optical transients, broad-line Ic supernovae, and superluminous supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effects of primordial magnetic fields on 21 cm multifrequency angular power spectra</a><span class="id">[2510.13752]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmic 21 cm line signal of neutral hydrogen provides the possibility to constrain the matter power spectrum.

We use particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection and magnetized turbulence, coupled to polarization-sensitive radiative transfer code, to interpret IXPE observations of Mrk 421 during a high flux state recorded in December of 2023. To evaluate the fitness of the theoretical scenarios, we rely on a quantitative comparison the statistical properties of simulated and observed X-ray flux and polarization light curves using five evaluation metrics, rather than attempting to fit individual data points. We propose a multi-zone model where jet emission is represented as the sum of the radiative output of many independent cells, each described by a simulation run viewed at different orientations. Comparison of ensembles of simulated Stokes-parameter light curves with IXPE data shows that magnetic reconnection dominated models provide the best match to the observed X-ray flux and polarization dynamics. The optimal configuration corresponds to N = 15 emitting cells, which reproduces the observed amplitudes and timescales of the X-ray flux and polarization variations. Magnetized turbulence models underpredict both the flux and polarization variability. Our results indicate that a multi-zone, reconnection-powered emission scenario can describe the X-ray polarization behavior of Mrk 421 and establish a quantitative framework for testing theoretical models against IXPE observations of other high-synchrotron-peaked blazars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13788" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating double bump air showers with the SKA-Low</a><span class="id">[2510.13788]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Double-bump showers are a rare class of extensive air showers (EAS) predicted by Monte Carlo simulations. They occur when a high-energy secondary particle, the leading particle, travels significantly farther than the rest, creating a distinct double-peaked longitudinal profile. So far, no experiment has been able to directly detect these showers. The unique radio footprint of double-bump showers, characterized by multiple Cherenkov rings, provides a way to reconstruct longitudinal profiles from radio observations. With its dense antenna array and broad frequency range, the Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will be the first experiment capable of detecting these features, offering a new opportunity to probe hadronic interactions and constrain particle cross sections at high energies. In our analysis, we simulate the EAS using CORSIKA with the CoREAS plugin for radio. We developed a new method based on the Akaike information criterion to identify double bump showers in simulations by analyzing their longitudinal profiles. Then we investigate the prevalence of these double bump showers across different cosmic ray primary particles and various hadronic interaction models. We create a skeleton of the EAS which consists of all the particles with at least $1\%$ of the primary energy, allowing us to confirm the leading particle hypothesis and track shower development following these particles. This will enable us to relate the attributes of the leading particle to measurable parameters. Depending on the exact shower properties, the radio footprint of a double bump shower can create a complex interference pattern, consisting of multiple rings. From this information, the longitudinal profiles can be extracted. SKA due to its dense antenna array and frequency range will be the first experiment able to observe these double bump showers in detail.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Density reconstruction from biased tracers: Testing the equivalence principle through consistency relations</a><span class="id">[2510.13803]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Consistency relations of large-scale structure offer a unique and powerful test of the weak equivalence principle (EP) on cosmological scales. If the EP is violated, different tracers will undergo different accelerations in response to a uniform gravitational field, and this loss of universality manifests as a dipole with a characteristic $1/K$ scale dependence in the squeezed limit of the bispectrum. In this work we show that such a violation can be identified with a particular anti-symmetric {modulation} in the local cross-power spectrum of distinct tracers. Based on this observation, we propose to test the EP using quadratic estimators as a more practical alternative to the conventional approach of directly estimating the bispectrum. We apply our quadratic estimator to a DESI-like survey and forecast constraints on the overall amplitude of EP violation. Including mildly nonlinear scales in our reconstruction ($k_\mathrm{max}\simeq0.15\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), we find that our estimator is competitive with the more exhaustive direct bispectrum approach. This means surveys like DESI can already benefit from the quadratic estimator approach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$\texttt{SBi3PCF:}$ Simulation-based inference with the integrated 3PCF</a><span class="id">[2510.13805]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present $\texttt{SBi3PCF}$, a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework for analysing a higher-order weak lensing statistic, the integrated 3-point correlation function (i3PCF). Our approach forward-models the cosmic shear field using the $\texttt{CosmoGridV1}$ suite of N-body simulations, including a comprehensive set of systematic effects such as intrinsic alignment, baryonic feedback, photometric redshift uncertainty, shear calibration bias, and shape noise. Using this, we have produced a set of DES Y3-like synthetic measurements for 2-point shear correlation functions $\xi_{\pm}$ (2PCFs) and i3PCFs $\zeta_{\pm}$ across 6 cosmological and 11 systematic parameters. Having validated these measurements against theoretical predictions and thoroughly examined for potential systematic biases, we have found that the impact of source galaxy clustering and reduced shear on the i3PCF is negligible for Stage-III surveys. Furthermore, we have tested the Gaussianity assumption for the likelihood of our data vector and found that while the sampling distribution of the 2PCF can be well approximated by a Gaussian function, the likelihood of the combined 2PCF + i3PCF data vector including filter sizes of $90'$ and larger can deviate from this assumption. Our SBI pipeline employs masked autoregressive flows to perform neural likelihood estimation and is validated to give statistically accurate posterior estimates. On mock data, we find that including the i3PCF yields a substantial $63.8\%$ median improvement in the figure of merit for $\Omega_m - \sigma_8 - w_0$. These findings are consistent with previous works on the i3PCF and demonstrate that our SBI framework can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to analyse the i3PCF in wide-area weak lensing surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of facility timing and coordination for next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</a><span class="id">[2510.11861]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer proposals for next-generation, ground-based detectors promise vastly improved sensitivities to gravitational-wave signals, only joint observations are expected to enable the full scientific potential of these facilities, making timing and coordination between the efforts crucial to avoid missed opportunities. This study investigates the impact of long-term delays on the scientific capabilities of next-generation detector networks. We use the Fisher information formalism to simulate the performance of a set of detector networks for large, fiducial populations of binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and primordial black-hole binaries. Bootstrapping the simulated populations, we map the expected observation times required to reach a number of observations fulfilling scientific targets for key sensitivity and localization metrics across various network configurations. We also investigate the sensitivity to stochastic backgrounds. We find that purely sensitivity-driven metrics such as the signal-to-noise ratio are not strongly affected by delays between facilities. This is contrasted by the localization metrics, which are very sensitive to the number of detectors in the network and, by extension, to delayed observation campaigns for a detector. Effectively, delays in one detector behave like network-wide interruptions for the localization metrics for networks consisting of two next-generation facilities. We examine the impact of a supporting, current-generation detector such as LIGO India operating concurrently with next-generation facilities and find such an addition will greatly mitigate the negative effects of delays for localization metrics, with important consequences on multi-messenger science and stochastic searches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12870" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the maximum compactness of neutron stars</a><span class="id">[2510.12870]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The stellar compactness, that is, the dimensionless ratio between the mass and radius of a compact star, $\mathcal{C} := M/R$, plays a fundamental role in characterising the gravitational and nuclear-physics aspects of neutron stars. Yet, because the compactness depends sensitively on the unknown equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter, the simple question: “how compact can a neutron star be?” remains unanswered. To address this question, we adopt a statistical approach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all known constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given EOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of the sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture for a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking. However, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that it is true in general. Exploiting the conjecture, we can concentrate on the compactness of the maximum-mass stars and show that an upper limit appears for the maximum compactness and is given by $\mathcal{C}_{\rm max} = 1/3$. Importantly, this upper limit is essentially independent of the stellar mass and a direct consequence of perturbative-QCD constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Spallation Background Rejection Techniques to Greatly Improve the Solar Neutrino Sensitivity of JUNO</a><span class="id">[2510.12873]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While the potential of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure solar neutrinos is known, realizing this potential requires new techniques to reduce detector backgrounds. One of the most serious backgrounds is due to the beta decays of unstable nuclei produced through muon breakup (spallation) of nuclei. This background is much more significant in JUNO compared to Super-Kamiokande due to JUNO's shallower depth and its lack of directional information. We present the first detailed theoretical calculations of spallation backgrounds in JUNO, showing the underlying physical processes and new ways to cut backgrounds while preserving signals. A key point is showing the importance of neutron tagging to identify hadronic showers, which are rare but produce almost all of the dangerous isotopes. With our new techniques, JUNO will be able to reduce deadtime (signal loss) by a factor of five and to reduce the running time needed to meet sensitivity goals by a factor of two. This will give JUNO greatly improved sensitivity to $^8$B and $hep$ solar neutrinos, as we will explore in a separate paper.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Matter-Electron Interactions Alter the Luminosity and Spectral Index of M87</a><span class="id">[2510.12877]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the possibility that cosmic-ray electron cooling through dark matter-electron scatterings contributes to the low radiative efficiency observed in radio-loud galaxies such as M87.

This geometry allows a unified treatment of gravitational and magnetic influences across weak to ultra-strong regimes. The analysis reveals a critical magnetic field strength above which no circular geodesics, timelike or null, can exist, establishing an upper magnetic bound for orbital motion. For subcritical fields, the photon circular orbit admits two real roots, the outer of which defines an outermost stable circular orbit (OSCO), complementing the conventional innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and confining stable motion within a finite radial domain. Exact expressions for the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies, and their associated precession rates, show substantial deviations from Kerr behavior, including a magnetically induced reversal of periastron precession within a finite radial range. For astrophysically relevant magnetic field strengths, the retrograde precession could be observable at large radii around astrophysical BHs, offering a potential diagnostic of large-scale magnetization.

The model is based on an extended $U(1)_X$ Froggatt-Nielsen–like mechanism, which naturally generates suppressed Yukawa couplings and realizes a Dirac seesaw for neutrino masses. An additional $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry stabilizes the dark sector, where chiral fermions charged under $\mathbb{Z}_4$ serve as ADM candidates. Leptogenesis occurs through the out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy Dirac neutrinos, where the generated asymmetry is shared between the visible and dark sectors due to exact lepton-number conservation. The same suppression mechanism that explains the smallness of neutrino masses also determines the GeV-scale ADM mass. Numerical studies demonstrate that a fully asymmetric DM scenario is realized, consistent with relic abundance, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and direct detection constraints. This framework provides an experimentally testable connection between neutrino physics, dark matter, and baryogenesis within an anomaly-free setup.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial magnetogenesis in loop quantum cosmology</a><span class="id">[2510.13742]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) are magnetic fields generated during the early universe.

With this motivation, we study the generation of the primordial magnetic field in the context of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). In LQC, inflation is preceded by a quantum bounce. In this work, we consider an electromagnetic field coupled to the background as a test field and study its evolution through the bounce and through the subsequent inflationary phase. We investigate the power spectra generated in LQC and show that it is scale-dependent.

We compile a catalog of known outbursts of 87 transient neutron star (identified through bursts or pulsations) low-mass X-ray binaries, until mid-2025. Most outbursts are taken from the literature, but we also identify some outbursts from public X-ray monitoring lightcurves. We find 109 outbursts not previously identified in the literature; most are from the frequent transients GRS 1747-312 and the Rapid Burster MXB 1730-335, though we suspect that two outbursts from Liller 1 may be from another transient, besides the Rapid Burster. We also find new outbursts for 10 other systems, and verify substantial quiescent intervals for XMM J174457-2850.3, XMMU J174716.1-281048, and AX J1754.2-2754. Outburst detection has been relatively efficient since 1996 for outbursts above $F_X$(2-10)$=3\times10^{-10}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$. While several systems have many known outbursts, 40 of the 87 systems we track have zero or one recorded outburst between 1996 and 2023. This suggests that many faint Galactic Center X-ray binaries may be neutron star X-ray binaries, though we cannot completely rule out the proposition that most neutron star X-ray binaries undergo frequent outbursts below all-sky monitor detection limits.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modified gravity constraints with Planck ISW-lensing bispectrum</a><span class="id">[2503.09893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present updated constraints on modified gravity by including the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect from CMB lensing-CMB temperature cross-correlations, based on the latest Planck PR4 maps.

We derive constraints from Planck CMB, Planck and ACT CMB lensing, DESI DR1 BAO, CMB ISW-lensing, and type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data. The constraints on the EFT parameters controlling the kinetic braiding and non-minimal coupling are consistent with General Relativity (GR) at the $95\%$ CL. In particular, we obtain a bound on the kinetic braiding parameter, $c_B &lt; 1.2$ at $95\%$ CL. In the $w_0$-$w_a$ parameter space, our results imply a crossing of the phantom divide, $w=-1$. The modified gravity model shows a mild preference over $\Lambda$CDM at the $1.8\sigma$, $2.6\sigma$ and $3.2\sigma$ levels for the combinations with Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 supernova datasets.

In particular, we consider the impact of adiabatic modes with wave numbers $k$ in the range $(10^{-4} - 4 \times 10^{-3})~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} $, corresponding to wavelength scales of several Gpc. Such modes can create large-scale density variations, likely causing anisotropies in the distribution of matter and, as a result, affecting the number density of observed quasars. We find that these can lead to a significant contribution to the dipole for sources up to redshifts of about 1, but are unable to explain the observed dipole. We also demonstrate that a superhorizon curvature perturbations mode, with a comoving wavenumber $k\lesssim0.3H_0$ can lead to a significant enhancement in the locally inferred Hubble constant.

We expand upon this framework by revisiting the shoreline using existing hydrodynamic escape models applied to Earth-like, Venus-like, and steam atmospheres for rocky exoplanets, and we estimate energy-limited escape rates for CH4 atmospheres. We determine the critical instellation required for atmospheric retention by calculating time-integrated atmospheric mass loss. Our analysis introduces a new metric for target selection in the Rocky Worlds Director's Discretionary Time and refines expectations for rocky planet atmosphere searches. Exploring initial volatile inventory ranging from 0.01% to 1% of planetary mass, we find that its variation prevents the definition of a unique clear-cut shoreline, though nonlinear escape physics can reduce this sensitivity to initial conditions. Additionally, uncertain distributions of high-energy stellar evolution and planet age further blur the critical instellations for atmospheric retention, yielding broad shorelines. Hydrodynamic escape models find atmospheric retention is markedly more favorable for higher-mass planets orbiting higher-mass stars, with carbon-rich atmospheres remaining plausible for 55 Cancri e despite its extreme instellation. We caution that our estimates are sensitive to processes with poorly understood dynamics, such as atomic line cooling.

In this paper we perform joint analyses that combine full-shape + post-reconstruction information from the DESI DR1 BGS and LRG samples along with angular cross-correlations with Planck PR4 and ACT DR6 CMB lensing maps. We show that adding galaxy-lensing cross-correlations tightens clustering amplitude constraints, improving $\sigma_8$ uncertainties by $\sim 40\%$ over RSD+BAO alone.

This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities, examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE. Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence at redshift $z_{\rm cross}\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\sim 2-4\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark energy density below $z\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed.

In this paper, we demonstrate that there are small errors introduced by the standard treatment of photon redshift in the OS approximation and provide a simple method to correct these errors. These errors are constant in phase, so this results in a constant absolute reduction in the flux. For PSR J0740+6620, the most rapidly spinning of the pulsars observed by NICER, we estimate the flux errors are less than 1\%, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the uncertainty in the distance, so this does not affect the mass and radius constraints found for this pulsar. The errors for the other pulsars observed by NICER are even smaller. However, this correction should be included when analyzing data for more rapidly rotating X-ray pulsars with spin frequencies near 600 Hz.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 GeV halo-like excess of the Galactic diffuse emission and implications for dark matter annihilation</a><span class="id">[2507.07209]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fifteen years of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the halo region of the Milky Way (MW) are analyzed to search for gamma rays from dark matter annihilation.

A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a spectral peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative to the LAT standard background model, which contains non-template patches adjusted to match the observed map. The halo excess spectrum can be fitted by annihilation with a particle mass $m_\chi \sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and cross section $\langle \sigma \upsilon \rangle \sim$ (5-8)$\times 10^{-25} \ \rm cm^3 \, s^{-1}$ for the $b\bar{b}$ channel.

All detected targets display inverted radio/millimeter spectra, with spectral indices in the range $\alpha =0.6-0.8$ for those systems where accurate SED fits could be performed. We conclude, firstly, that the low-frequency SEDs of neutron star SFXTs and SgXBs are dominated by free-free emission from the OB supergiant's stellar wind, and that jet emission is unlikely to be observed unless the systems can be detected at sub-GHz frequencies. Secondly, we find that SFXTs are fainter at 100 GHz than prototypical SgXBs, probably due to systematically less dense winds in the former, as supported further by the differences in their fluorescence Fe K$\alpha$ lines. We furthermore compare the stellar wind constraints obtained from our millimeter observations with those from IR/optical/UV studies and bow shock detections, and present evidence for long-term stellar wind variability visible in the thermal emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1-2 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</a><span class="id">[2508.10514]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. Our analysis reveals that the predicted value of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ by the DESI DR2 LRG1 and LRG3+ELG1 datapoints deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction and from different supernova compilations. We find that analyzing the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers strongly affects the model predictions especially $\omega_0$, which shifts from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0&gt;-1$, $\omega_a&lt;0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a&lt;-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02671" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Double-faced white dwarfs and the magnetic inhibition of convection</a><span class="id">[2509.02671]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>About one in five white dwarfs undergoes spectral evolution from a helium atmosphere to hydrogen and then back to helium. These short-lived hydrogen envelopes - the result of residual hydrogen diffusion - are eventually destroyed by either hydrogen or helium convection. An emerging class of double-faced white dwarfs seems to catch this process in the act, with varying amounts of hydrogen across regions of the stellar surface. Here, we quantitatively test the hypothesis that these inhomogeneities are the result of the magnetic inhibition of convection. We compute the critical magnetic field $B_{\rm crit}(M,T_{\rm eff})$ required to inhibit convection in both hydrogen and helium for $0.6-1.2\,M_\odot$ white dwarfs using two methods. Initially, we estimated $B_{\rm crit}\sim\sqrt{8\pi P}$ where $P$ is the pressure at the base of the convection zone, finding that most (three out of four) of the observed magnetic double-faced white dwarfs could potentially be explained by the magnetic inhibition of hydrogen convective energy transfer, with measured $B\gtrsim B_{\rm crit}^{\rm H}$. Then, we incorporated the magnetic field consistently into the stellar structure and directly computed the boundary of convective mixing. With this more appropriate method, we find that only half (two out of four) of the stars could be explained by the magnetic inhibition of helium convection, with $B\gtrsim B_{\rm crit}^{\rm He}$. Specifically, order of unity variations in the magnetic field's strength or orientation across the surface could account for the double-faced nature of these stars. Given our mixed results, other - including non-magnetic - scenarios should be considered as well.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The EBLM project XVI.

There is likely too much angular momentum in a collapsing, fragmenting protostellar cloud to form such binaries in situ, suggesting some post processing. One probe of a binary's dynamical history is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes – its obliquity. The classical method for determining stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, but to less than a dozen stellar binaries. In this paper, we present the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of EBLM J0021-16, a $0.19M_\odot$ M-dwarf eclipsing a $1.05M_\odot$ G-dwarf on a 5.97 day, almost-circular orbit. We combine CORALIE spectroscopy with TESS photometry of primary and secondary eclipses and star spot modulation. We show that the orbital axis is well-aligned with the primary star's spin axis, with a true 3D obliquity of $\psi=4.01\pm0.54^{\circ}$. EBLM J0021-16 becomes one of only a handful of eclipsing binaries where a true obliquity has been measured. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf's mass and radius to a fractional precision better than 1\%. The radius of the M dwarf is inflated by 6\% ($7.4\sigma$) with respect to stellar models, consistent with many other M-dwarfs in the literature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</a><span class="id">[2510.02260]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J0136, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k=3) at pressure levels (&gt; 1 bar) corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation suggest North/South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. These vertical maps demonstrate robust interaction between deep convective weather layers and the overlying stratified and radiative atmosphere. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find that the mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Empirical Optimization of the Source-Surface Height in the PFSS extrapolation</a><span class="id">[2510.05513]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The potential field source surface (PFSS) method is a widely used magnetic field extrapolation technique in the space weather community. The only free parameter in the PFSS method is the source-surface height ($R_{\rm SS}$), beyond which all field lines are open. Although $R_{\rm SS}$ is known to vary with solar activity, there is no consensus on how to determine it for a given surface magnetic field distribution. In this study, we investigate the nature of $R_{\rm SS}$ using a long-period (2006-2023) data, covering two solar minima and one maximum. We adopt ADAPT-GONG magnetograms and determine $R_{\rm SS}$ by matching the open flux estimated from observations at 1 au with that calculated using the PFSS method. Our analysis reveals that $R_{\rm SS}$ increases slightly after the solar minima and around the solar maximum, and that it can be characterized by both the mean unsigned photospheric magnetic field strength and the dipolarity parameter $f_{\rm dip}$, defined as $f_{\rm dip} = B_{\rm dip}^2/(B_{\rm dip}^2 + B_{\rm quad}^2 + B_{\rm oct}^2)$, with $B_{\rm dip}$, $B_{\rm quad}$, and $B_{\rm oct}$ denoting the magnitudes of dipolar, quadrupolar, and octupolar components of photospheric radial magnetic field, respectively. Our results suggest that $R_{\rm SS}$ does not exhibit a simple monotonic dependence on the solar activity and must be determined by properly considering both surface magnetic field strength and global field structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12495" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limits of Standard Tidal Models at Quaoar: Matching Weywot's Orbit, Missing the Spin</a><span class="id">[2510.12495]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Weywot, Quaoar's small satellite, follows a nearly circular orbit at a distance of 12.9 times Quaoar's diameter and coexists with a compact ring system. Nevertheless, Quaoar's flattening of 0.16, slow 17.7hr rotation and Weywot's low mass are difficult to reconcile with conventional tidal-evolution theory. We assess whether standard tides can reproduce the present-day architecture of the Quaoar-Weywot system and identify the initial conditions required. Orbit-averaged integrations spanning 4.5Gyr were carried out with two formalisms: (i) a constant phase-lag (CPL) and (ii) an Andrade creep-tide (ACT) framework. With the nominal Weywot mass, both tidal prescriptions converge on Weywot's observed orbital distance for a wide range of initial orbital distances and eccentricities; eccentricity is damped and present-day tidal torques are negligible, rendering the orbit quasi-stationary. Quaoar's spin, however, remains essentially unchanged from its inferred primordial period based on its present-day flattening, and does not reproduce the observed value. A match is possible only if Weywot is 5-10x more massive than current estimates and if its initial eccentricity is finely tuned; such scenarios are inconsistent with occultation-derived masses and imply an implausibly dense satellite. Based on the best fitting viscoelastic parameters, the most plausible composition for Quaoar is found to be a partially differentiated dwarf planet containing roughly equal masses of silicate rock and H2O-dominated warm (150-180K) ices. Standard tidal models reproduce Weywot's semimajor axis but cannot account for Quaoar's slow 17.7hr rotation without invoking an unrealistically massive satellite or external torques, suggesting that non-tidal processes - such as a largely primordial spin, early satellite loss, or a retrograde secondary giant impact - must have influenced Quaoar's rotational evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarization from Rapidly Rotating Massive Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.12500]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar rotation has long been recognized as important to the evolution of stars, by virtue of the chemical mixing it can induce and how it interacts with binary mass transfer. Binary interaction and rapid rotation are both common in massive stars and involve processes of angular momentum distribution and transport. An important question is how this angular momentum transport leads to the creation of two important classes of rapidly rotating massive stars, Be stars defined by disklike emission lines, and Bn stars defined by rotationally broadened absorption lines. A related question is what limits this rotation places on how conservative the mass transfer can be. Central to addressing these issues is knowledge of how close to rotational break-up stars can get before they produce a disk. Here we calculate diagnostics of this rotational criticality using the continuum polarization arising from a combination of rotational stellar distortion (i.e., oblateness) and redistribution of stellar flux (i.e., gravity darkening), and compare polarizations produced in the von Zeipel approximation with the approach of Espinosa Lara &amp; Rieutord (ELR). Both produce similar photospheric polarizations that rise significantly in the far ultraviolet (FUV) for B stars, with a stronger signal in the von Zeipel case. For early main-sequence and subgiant stars, it reaches a maximum of  1% at 140 nm for stars rotating at 98% of critical, when seen edge-on. Rotational rates above 80% critical result in polarizations of several tenths of a percent, at high inclination. These predicted stable signal strengths indicate that determinations of near-critical rotations in B stars could be achieved with future spectropolarimetric instrumentation that can reach deep into the FUV, such as CASSTOR, the Polstar mission concept, or the POLLUX detector design.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13714" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational-wave signatures of non-violent non-locality</a><span class="id">[2411.13714]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Measurement of gravitational waves can provide precision tests of the nature of black holes and compact objects. In this work, we test Giddings' non-violent non-locality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range – up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from non-violent non-locality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in non-violent non-locality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third-generation network.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spin oscillations of neutrinos scattered by the supermassive black hole in the galactic center</a><span class="id">[2501.19404]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we study the propagation and spin oscillations of neutrinos in their scattering by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) surrounded by a realistic accretion disk. We review various descriptions of the fermion spin evolution in a curved spacetime under the influence of external fields. The overview of the test particle motion in the gravitational field of a rotating SMBH is also present. The external fields which a neutrino spin interacts with are the electroweak forces in plasma and the toroidal magnetic field in the accretion disk surrounding SMBH. Spin precession of neutrinos, which are supposed to be Dirac particles, is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk. We use a semi-analytical model of a thick accretion disk and review its characteristics. The cases of co-rotating and counter-rotating disks with respect to BH are discussed. We consider the incoming flux of neutrinos having an arbitrary angle with respect to the BH spin since the recent results of the Event Horizon Telescope indicate that the BH spin in the galactic center is not always perpendicular to the galactic plane. For our study, we consider a large number of incoming test neutrinos. We briefly discuss our results and their applications in the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Wave Production and Baryogenesis in a Simple Left-Right model</a><span class="id">[2505.04751]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The left-right model with the simplest Higgs structure has a $SU(2)_L$ doublet $H_L$, a $SU(2)_R$ doublet $H_R$, and a singlet $\sigma$ that couples to the doublets as $\sigma(|H_L|^2-|H_R|^2)$. The left-right symmetry has $H_L\leftrightarrow H_R$ and $\sigma\leftrightarrow-\sigma$. We study gravitational wave production and baryogenesis in the electroweak phase transitions in the model. For two benchmark points, $\sigma$ first gets a vev, followed by $H_R$ and then $H_L$. An interesting feature is that the vev of $H_L$ is initially much higher than its zero temperature value, leading to a more strongly first-order transition and higher frequency gravitational waves. An unusual benchmark point has the $\sigma$ vev at zero when the electroweak symmetry breaks. This results in both $H_L$ and $H_R$ vevs being equal and in the multi-TeV range. At a lower temperature, the $\sigma$ vev turns on, breaking the left-right symmetry and $H_L$ drops to its standard model value. Since the electroweak symmetry is broken at the multi-TeV scale, the frequency of gravitational waves will be much higher than usual. Baryogenesis is also discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11206" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extra-natural production of superheavy Kaluza-Klein particles</a><span class="id">[2508.11206]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gauge fields in extra compact dimensions can drive inflation in the four-dimensional (4D) non-compact spacetime, a scenario known as extra-natural inflation. A time-dependent gauge field configuration generates the electric field along the compact dimension, enabling the production of Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles charged under the field via the Schwinger effect. We construct the extra-natural inflation model within a five-dimensional (5D) quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework coupled to gravity including matter fields that generate the inflationary one-loop effective potential. In general, multiple charged fields can exist, and we show that KK particle production occurs under these conditions. Since KK momentum is conserved, the produced KK particles may become superheavy dark matter or dominate the universe, depending on the model parameters. Furthermore, we show that even when the gauge field acts not as the inflaton but as a spectator field, its post-inflationary oscillations, initiated when the Hubble friction becomes negligible, can also generate superheavy KK modes. This suggests that KK particle production is a generic outcome when gauge potentials along compact dimensions are light.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is the $Λ$CDM Model in Crisis?</a><span class="id">[2509.17124]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present strong evidence for dynamical dark energy challenging the $\Lambda$CDM model. Several dark energy models are explored, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, and BA, along with non-flat cosmologies accounting for potential spatial curvature. Our analysis supports a flat Universe ($\Omega_k \approx 0$). Using the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm, we analyze data from BAO of DESI DR2, Type Ia Supernovae, and CMB to constrain model parameters. We find strong evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, with deviations from $\Lambda$CDM favoring dynamical dark energy consistent with the Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$). We also derive upper bounds on $\sum m_\nu$ from CMB + DESI DR2. For $\Lambda$CDM we find $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.066~\text{eV}$, while for $\omega$CDM it is $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.075~\text{eV}$. In o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM the limits are $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.263~\text{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.520~\text{eV}$, respectively. For other models, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE, the upper limits range from $&lt; 0.043~\text{eV}$ to $&lt; 0.127~\text{eV}$. Constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\text{eff}}$, remain consistent with the standard value $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.044$ for all models. Bayesian evidence shows that combining DES-SN5Y and Union3 SNe Ia with CMB + DESI DR2 reveals deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, while no model reaches the $5\sigma$ threshold, some show $&gt; 3\sigma$ tensions with DES-SN5YR or Union3, hinting at cracks in the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</p></div></details></article></body>
