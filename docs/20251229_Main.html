More precisely, it has been estimated that $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}M_\odot$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km (at the $1\sigma$ level), while a redshited surface temperature of $153^{+4}_ {-2}$ keV at an age of 2-6 kyrs has been reported. In the present work, we conduct an in-depth investigation on the possible nature (hadronic, hybrid, quark) of this compact object by attempting to not only explain its mass and radius but also the corresponding estimations for its temperature and age. In the case of hybrid stars we also examine possible effects of the symmetry energy on the activation of different neutrino emitting process, and hence on the resulting cooling curves. We found that the reported temperature and age may be compatible to hadronic stellar configurations regardless of whether pairing effects are included. In the scenario of hybrid stars, we found that the strange quark matter core has to be in a superconducting state in order to reach an agreement with the observational constraints. In addition, the hadronic phase must be soft enough so that the direct Urca process is not activated. Furthermore, we have shown that the considered cooling constraints can be reconciled within the framework of strange stars. However, quark matter has to be in a superconducting state and the quark direct Urca process needs to be blocked.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of the EPOS.LHC-R hadronic interaction model on the Centaurus A ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray scenario</a><span class="id">[2512.21415]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We discuss the impact of the recent this http URL -R hadronic interaction model on the scenario in which most of the cosmic rays with energies above 5 EeV originate in the nearby Centaurus A radiogalaxy. The heavier composition inferred when considering this hadronic model implies that the amount of H and He emitted by the source is reduced compared to what was found with previous hadronic models. The elements of the CNO group play a more predominant role in the instep region just above the ankle while the elements of the Si and Fe groups can contribute significantly in the suppression region of the energy spectrum above 50 EeV. We also obtain the predictions for the amplitude of the dipolar anisotropy in different energy bins above 4 EeV, showing that they can be well consistent with the measurements for appropriate values of the extragalactic turbulent magnetic field and source lifetime. A new method to extract the information on the cosmic ray masses from that of the depth of the maximum development of the air showers is also introduced.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Modal Approach to Constrain Inflation through Numerical Bispectra</a><span class="id">[2512.21432]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Constraining inflationary models with high precision bispectra across broad parameter ranges is a challenging task, requiring intensive computations at all stages, first, predicting the primordial inflation bispectrum from quantum field theory, secondly, projecting this forward with transfer functions to the late universe and, finally, comparing with the bispectrum extracted from the observational data and matching mock catalogues. Here, the longstanding separable \texttt{Modal} pipeline for constraining primordial bispectrum templates using WMAP and Planck CMB data has been supplemented by the more recently developed \texttt{Primodal} code to accurately calculate bispectra numerically from inflation models, showing great potential for enhanced computational efficiency; \texttt{Primodal} exploits the in-in separability of the tree-level in-in formalism, together with a separable mode-expansion technique to bypass the need for point-by-point bispectrum calculations. Building upon this progress, we propose a bispectrum pipeline that systematically explores the parameter space of inflationary Lagrangians, numerically computing the tree-level bispectrum (and power spectrum) for each scenario and comparing with the \texttt{Modal} bispectrum decompositions obtained from the Planck 2018 data. Our pipeline identifies and excludes disfavored scenarios through this analysis, providing direct constraints on the parameter space, the sound speed and other quantities from the surviving observationally viable scenarios. This is preparatory work for a planned analysis using much higher-resolution CMB data from the Simons Observatory. To validate our pipeline, we perform a proof-of-concept analysis of the IR DBI inflation model, obtaining constraints of $c_s \geq 0.073$ for the sound speed and $\beta \leq 0.39$ for the parameter space, demonstrating the pipeline's accuracy and effectiveness.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elemental abundance pattern and temperature inversion on the dayside of HAT-P-70b observed with CARMENES and PEPSI</a><span class="id">[2512.21470]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy has identified various chemical species in the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters, including neutral and ionized metals, providing key insights into planet formation through refractory element abundances. We observed the dayside thermal emission spectrum of the UHJ HAT-P-70b using the high-resolution spectrographs CARMENES and PEPSI. Through cross-correlation analysis, we detect emission signals of Al i, AlH, Ca ii, Cr i, Fe i, Fe ii, Mg i, Mn i, and Ti i, marking the first detection of Al i and AlH in an exoplanetary atmosphere. Tentative signals of C i, Ca i, Na i, NaH, and Ni i are also identified. These detections enable atmospheric retrievals to constrain the thermal profile and elemental abundances of the planet's dayside hemisphere. The retrieved temperature-pressure profile reveals a strong thermal inversion. The chemical free retrieval yields a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.38(+0.74/-1.11), while the chemical equilibrium retrieval gives [Fe/H] = 0.23(+1.08/-0.98), both consistent with solar metallicity. We also tentatively find an enhanced abundance of Ni, possibly due to the accretion of Ni-rich planetesimals during formation. On the other hand, elements with condensation temperatures above 1400 K (e.g., Ca, Ti, and V) appear slightly depleted, which may be caused by nightside cold trapping. However, Al, with the highest condensation temperature at 1653K, displays a solar like abundance, which might reflect the formation-related enrichment of Al. Our retrieval indicates extremely high volume mixing ratios of metal ions (Fe ii and Ca ii), which are significantly inconsistent with predictions from chemical equilibrium models. This disequilibrium suggests that the atmosphere is likely undergoing significant hydrodynamic escaping, which enhances the atmospheric density at high altitudes where the ionic lines are formed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21493" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Episodic planetesimal disruptions triggered by dissipation of gas disk</a><span class="id">[2512.21493]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Catastrophic disruptions of planetesimals occur in high-velocity collisions. Radioisotope dating of planetesimal disruption events recorded in meteorites confirms frequent catastrophic collisions in the first $\sim$10 Myr of the Solar System, reflecting a violent environment of the time. However, the nebula gas can damp the eccentricity of planetesimals and suppress the frequency of planetesimal collisions. Strong dynamical mechanisms that excited the protoplanetary disk are required. Here we show that the sweeping secular resonances of Jupiter and Saturn induced by the nebular gas dissipation, together with the mean motion resonances of Jupiter, can trigger a large number of catastrophic collisions, which occur episodically when the secular resonances are at $\sim$2-3 au and continue thereafter. After the gas dissipation completes, catastrophic collisions decrease in frequency, with scattering by planetary embryos becoming the major driving force of the collisions. Our results suggest that the violent environment excited by secular and mean motion resonances can be ubiquitous in protoplanetary disks during nebula dissipation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiband Gravitational Wave Detection Prospects for M31 UCXB-1 System in Low and Middle Frequency Band</a><span class="id">[2512.21520]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recent discovery of M31 UCXB-1, the first extragalactic ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) with an orbital period of $T_{\rm orb} \sim 465$ s, presents a unique laboratory for studying close binary evolution and an unprecedented target for continuous gravitational wave (GW) searches. Its identification as a strong candidate black hole-white dwarf (BH-WD) system, combined with its exceptionally short period and high X-ray luminosity, suggests it may be one of the most vital low-frequency GW sources in M31. In this \textit{Letter}, we investigate the detectability of its GW signal for future space-borne detectors in multiband GW detection. We find that while its signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for low-frequency detectors remains marginal for high-confidence detection, middle-frequency detectors such as DECIGO and BBO are far more promising, potentially achieving S/N $\varrho&gt;8$ within reasonable observational duration. With a primary mass of only $m_1 &gt; 5.4M_\odot$ (or $6.6M_\odot$), the network of all low and middle frequency detector (or BBO alone) is capable of detecting GW from this system with a $\varrho &gt; 8$, during 10-year observation. Furthermore, orbital eccentricity can enhance the GW strain at higher harmonics, further improving its detectability, especially for middle-frequency detectors. This study establishes M31 UCXB-1 as a key prototype of short-period UCXBs, cementing its role as a cornerstone for multiband, multi-messenger astrophysics and a vital bridge between X-ray astronomy and the future GW era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Particle production and Higgs reheating</a><span class="id">[2512.21658]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reheating is essential for transforming the cold, vacuum dominated Universe at the end of inflation into the hot thermal bath required by the Standard Model. In many well motivated inflationary models, however, the inflaton has no direct couplings to other fields, raising the question of how the Universe becomes repopulated with particles. We address this question within the framework of geometric reheating, where energy transfer occurs purely through gravitational effects. Focusing on a Higgs inflationary scenario with a non-minimal curvature coupling $\xi \phi^2 R$, we derive the post-inflationary dynamics and compute particle production using the Bogoliubov formalism. We show that the rapid, oscillatory evolution of the curvature scalar after inflaton acts as a time dependent gravitational pump, creating scalar spectator particles even in the absence of explicit interactions. This curvature driven production mechanism provides a natural and efficient route to reheating, demonstrating that gravity alone can initiate the standard thermal history and bridge inflation with radiation domination in minimal, coupling free models of the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VLBI Diagnostics of Off-axis Jets in Radio Flares of Tidal Disruption Events</a><span class="id">[2512.21669]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of late-time radio flares in tidal disruption events remains unclear. In particular, the peculiar radio flare observed in AT2018hyz has motivated two leading scenarios: a delayed outflow launched $\sim1000\,\rm days$ after discovery, or an off-axis relativistic jet directed far from our line of sight. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging provides the most direct way to distinguish between these scenarios. In this paper, we calculate synthetic radio images for both models and examine their observational signatures. The motion of the emission centroid is the most powerful diagnostic for breaking the degeneracy. In the delayed-outflow scenario, the centroid motion is confined within a non-relativistic distance, whereas in the off-axis jet scenario it exhibits apparent superluminal motion. Detecting such superluminal motion would therefore provide a smoking-gun signature of the off-axis jet interpretation. We also find that the jet image exhibits characteristic features, including a non-monotonic evolution of the image aspect ratio. These results are expected to be generic and applicable to other jetted explosions, such as microquasars and gamma-ray bursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21676" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the signs of evolutionary characteristics in the energy spectrum of shock wave acceleration</a><span class="id">[2512.21676]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Under ideal conditions, the theory of shock acceleration for cosmic rays predicts that different elements should exhibit strictly identical spectral indices when accelerated to the same rigidity (R). However, recent high-precision measurements of elemental energy spectra have definitively established the existence of variations in spectral indices across different elements. This study constrains the spectral indices of cosmic-ray elements using AMS-02 and DAMPE observations within the Spatially Dependent Propagation (SDP) model. For elements with A/Z = 2, spectral indices shows significant positive correlations with both atomic number Z and mass number A, likely due to A or Z-dependent fragmentation cross-sections. Predictions indicate that the observed spectra of Ni and Zn will align with the Fe spectrum, while their injection spectra will exhibit slightly softer spectral indices compared to Fe. Future observations from AMS-02, DAMPE and HERD are expected to verify these findings, while theoretical models are needed to systematically explain this phenomenon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Effect of Magnetic Field Dissipation in the Inner Heliosheath: Reconciling Global Heliosphere Model and Voyager Data</a><span class="id">[2512.21688]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Global ideal magnetohydrodynamic models of the heliosphere typically predict a greatly exaggerated magnetic field pile-up in the inner heliosheath (IHS), the region between the termination shock and heliopause. However, Voyager 1 and 2 observations show only a gradual increase throughout this region. This mismatch is largely attributed to the simplified assumption of a unipolar solar magnetic field in many global models, which neglects the complex, folded structure of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). The IHS, especially at low heliolatitudes, contains these compressed sector boundaries, widely considered prime locations for magnetic dissipation via reconnection. To align global model simulations with observations without incurring the prohibitive computational cost of resolving the kinetic-scale current sheet, this work introduces a phenomenological term into the magnetic field induction equation. This term captures the macroscopic effect of magnetic energy dissipation due to unresolved HCS dynamics. It is designed to mitigate the artificial magnetic pile-up, preserve the topological integrity of the magnetic field lines, and avoid explicit magnetic diffusion. This study demonstrates that incorporating a phenomenological dissipation term into global heliospheric models helps to resolve the longstanding discrepancy between simulated and observed magnetic field profiles in the IHS. The proposed mechanism reduces exaggerated magnetic energy (converts it into thermal energy), aligns model output with Voyager measurements of both magnetic field and proton density, and produces the outward shift in termination shock position and a reduction of the IHS thickness. We found that the characteristic time for magnetic field dissipation of about 6 years provides improved agreement with Voyager data in the IHS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A self-consistent 3D MHD model producing a solar blowout jet</a><span class="id">[2512.21728]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Solar blowout jets are a distinct subclass of ubiquitous extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray coronal jets. Aims. Most existing models of blowout jets prescribe an initial magnetic field configurations and apply ad-hoc changes in the photosphere to trigger the jets. In contrast, we aim for a self-consistent magneto-convective description of the jet initiation. Methods. We employ a 3D radiation magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of a solar coronal hole region using the MURaM code. The computational domain extends from the upper convection zone to the lower corona. We synthesize the emission in the extreme UV and X-rays for a direct comparison to observations and examine the evolution of the magnetic field structure of the event. Results. In the simulation a twisted flux tube forms self-consistently, emerges through the surface and interacts with the pre-existing open field. Initially the resulting jet is of the standard type with a narrow spire. The release of the twist into the open field causes a broadening of the jet spire turning the jet into a blowout type. At the same time this creates a fast heating front propagating at the local Alfvén speed. The properties of the modeled jet closely match observations of blowout jets: a slow (180 km/s) mass upflow and a fast (500 km/s) propagating front form, the latter being a signature of the heating front. Also the timing of the jet with respect to the flux emergence and subsequent cancellation matches observations. Conclusions. The near-surface magneto-convection self-consistently generates a twisted flux tube that emerges through the photosphere. The tube then interacts with the pre-existing magnetic field by means of interchange reconnection. This transfers the twist to the open field region and produces a blowout jet that matches the main characteristics of this type of jet found in observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21729" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden and Silver Dark Sirens for precise H0 measurement with HETDEX</a><span class="id">[2512.21729]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences are standard sirens that provide a direct measure of the source's luminosity distance, enabling an independent measurement of the Hubble constant (H0). While a bright siren – a GW event with an identified electromagnetic (EM) counterpart – provided the first such constraint, most detections, currently dominated by black hole mergers, lack EM signatures. A measurement of H0 is still possible with these dark sirens by statistically associating GW events with galaxies in existing catalogs based on the sky localization. In this work, we explore the potential of two subsets of sirens: rare golden dark sirens, for which a single galaxy dominates the H0 posterior, and silver dark sirens, which are far more common but have a larger set of plausible host galaxies. Using the fifth internal data release of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), we assess the suitability of the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) for spectroscopic follow-up of dark sirens. VIRUS exposures of the standard HETDEX depth provide precise redshifts and exquisite completeness within z = 0.2. After a single year of observations with the upgraded LIGO-A# network, the combined sample of golden and silver dark sirens with z &lt; 0.2 and follow-up VIRUS observations can potentially yield a few-percent constraint on H0. Our predictions suggest that spectroscopic redshift surveys such as HETDEX can play a key role in realizing high-precision cosmology with dark sirens in the near future. Standard-siren distance measurements offer a critical, fully independent path to the local value of H0 to resolve the Hubble tension.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comprehensive study of solar type II radio bursts and the properties of the associated shock waves</a><span class="id">[2512.21846]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type II radio bursts are solar radio emissions generated by electrons accelerated by coronal shocks. These bursts are typically found close to expanding coronal mass ejections (CMEs), making them valuable for studying the properties and dynamics of CME-driven shocks in the solar corona. Here, we aim to determine the regions in the solar corona where shock waves accelerate electrons and determine their characteristic properties. To do this, we combine radio observations of type II solar radio bursts with magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the solar corona. We analyse ten type II radio bursts from Solar Cycle 25 exhibiting emissions. The novelty of this study lies in using radio imaging data for all type II bursts to examine the positions of the radio sources. The radio source positions, combined with a geometrical fitting of the CME shock and the MHD simulations, are used to determine essential shock parameters at the acceleration region, such as the Alfvén Mach number $(M_{\rm A}$ and $\theta_{\rm BN}$. The shock parameters are then combined with the properties of the radio emission and the associated eruption in a comprehensive study. We found that for all events, the type II bursts are located near or inside coronal streamers. The estimated shock speeds are high, resulting in the formation of super-critical shocks $(3.6~\leq~M_{\rm A}~\leq~6.4$) at the type II locations. In most events, type II bursts are located at oblique shocks rather than near-perpendicular geometries, suggesting that the shock structure is more complex at local scales than the simple spherical shock models usually applied to CME shocks. Our results suggest that CME-streamer interaction regions are necessary for the generation of type II bursts, as they provide ideal plasma conditions for the formation of super-critical shocks and the subsequent acceleration of electrons.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21872" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compact Ca II K Brightenings Precede Solar Flares: A Dunn Solar Telescope Pilot Study</a><span class="id">[2512.21872]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a uniform analysis of compact Ca II K (3934 Å) brightenings that occur near flare kernels and assess their value as short-lead indicators of solar flare onset. Using high-cadence imaging from the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) instrument at the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST), we examine eight flare sequences (seven C-class and one B-class) obtained between 2021 and 2025. Fixed, detector-coordinate regions of interest are used to generate mean-intensity light curves, which are detrended and smoothed to isolate impulsive brightenings. In every event, a compact Ca II K brightening is detected within or adjacent to the flaring region that peaks 10–45 min before the primary kernel and the corresponding rise in GOES 1–8 Å flux. The measured temporal offsets scale with the deprojected separation between the brightening and flare kernels, implying an apparent propagation speed of $\sim$30–35 km s$^{-1}$ that is consistent with chromospheric reconnection. Complementary Spectropolarimeter for Infrared and Optical Regions (SPINOR) spectropolarimetry for one event shows topological reconfiguration from closed to open or extended connectivity, supporting a reconnection-driven origin. These results demonstrate that compact Ca II K brightenings are reproducible, physically meaningful precursors to flare onset. Their simplicity and cadence make them attractive chromospheric indicators, and future work will evaluate their predictive skill alongside established UV/EUV and magnetic diagnostics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21885" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral State Switching in Mrk 421: Results from the AstroSat LAXPC/SXT Observations</a><span class="id">[2512.21885]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We carried a detailed time and flux resolved X-ray spectral analysis of the high-synchrotron-peaked blazar Mrk 421 using simultaneous AstroSat and LAXPC20/SXT observations. The 100 s binned LAXPC20 light curve obtained during 3–8 January 2017 reveals pronounced flux variability. The source exhibits a fractional variability amplitude of $F_{\mathrm{rms}} = 0.210 \pm 0.005$ in the SXT band and $F_{\mathrm{rms}} = 0.316 \pm 0.006$ in the LAXPC20 band. During this interval, the source reached a peak count rate of 122.94 counts s$^{-1}$. This enabled us to carry flux resolved spectroscopy by selecting ten flux states, S1–S10 each having a width of 8 counts s$^{-1}$. We noted that the spectra in these flux states are well described by a synchrotron-convolved broken power-law (BPL), which consistently provides a better fit than a log-parabola. The low-energy particle index (index before the break) is found to cluster around two discrete values across flux states indicating two spectra states in the source. The break energy consistently moves to high energy with increase in flux level in these states. Time-resolved spectroscopy (10-ks segments) confirms that the flux histogram is best modelled as a double lognormal distribution and the index histogram is bimodal. Inclusion of two additional long observations spanning 2017-2019 shows the same double-state behaviour on longer timescales. Together, the results indicate that Mrk 421 routinely occupies two dominant spectral; in a leptonic synchrotron framework this can be explained by Gaussian-like fluctuations in acceleration conditions producing lognormal flux states.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21888" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implications of Cosmic Birefringence for Multi-Field ALP Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2512.21888]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic birefringence, characterized by the observed rotation of the polarization plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, serves as a critical probe for testing theories beyond the standard cosmological scenario. As a major component of the universe, dark matter plays a pivotal role in cosmic evolution, particularly in the formation of large-scale structures. However, its fundamental nature remains elusive. Axion-like particles (ALPs), as promising dark matter candidates, possess unique advantages in naturally explaining such phenomena. Previous studies on the implications of cosmic birefringence for these ultralight ALP fields have focused on single-field models with conventional potentials. These models face exclusion due to the washout effect - a suppression of the CMB polarization power spectrum induced by oscillatory dynamics of the scalar field within the mass range of less than $10^{-23}$ eV. To address this limitation, we develop a more general theoretical framework incorporating two ALP fields, providing analytical approximations and numerical calculations. Our findings reveal that the superposition of two ALP fields with distinct masses can relax the constraints imposed by the washout effect and reconcile with observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long-term monitoring of repeating FRB 20220912A with the uGMRT at low radio frequencies</a><span class="id">[2512.21889]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Some repeating FRBs exhibit occasional extreme repetition rates, but very few show a sustained high activity level. One such hyperactive repeater is FRB 20220912A, which was discovered by CHIME/FRB Collaboration on 2022 September 12. Here, we present results from a long-term monitoring campaign of FRB 20220912A using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in the frequency range from 300 to 750 MHz. Over the course of nearly two years, we detected a total of 643 bursts in this frequency range. The source exhibited extreme activity for a few months after its discovery and sustained its active phase for over 500 days, with unsystematic modulations in the activity during this phase. The cumulative energy distributions in both bands show a break, consistent with other active repeaters like FRB 20121102A, FRB 202011124A, etc., suggesting common underlying emission mechanisms. Moreover, we show that the energy distribution shape for FRB 20220912A remains broadly same across a large range of frequencies and over time. Overall, the extended high activity, estimated total energy output, persistent power-law tails in the energy distributions, and the lack of detectable short timescale periodicity favor progenitor models invoking young dynamic magnetars, potentially emitting pulses across large rotation phase ranges.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21892" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Rare Millisecond Pulsar with Cross-Pole Emission: Single-Pulse Insights from PSR J1857+0943</a><span class="id">[2512.21892]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Studies of subpulse variability in millisecond pulsars (MSPs) offer important constraints on their emission physics. Using the high sensitivity of FAST, we present the first identification of distinct single pulse fluctuation behaviour in PSR J1857+0943. We find that the third component(MP\_C3) of the main pulse may originate from a different region than the other two main-pulse components and may instead share a common origin with the interpulse. This conclusion is supported by four observational evidence as follows: First, the LRCCF shows a clear anticorrelation between MP\_C3 and the interpulse. Second, the single-pulse polarization at the main-pulse longitude reveals obvious component mixing. Third, the modulation period of the interpulse components is roughly twice that of MP\_C3. Fourth, the reduced modulation index in MP\_C3 suggests possible mixing of emission from different regions. The interpretation in this letter contrasts with the usual assumption that the main pulse and interpulse originate from opposite magnetic poles. Hence, PSR J1857+0943 provides a rare laboratory for probing component-dependent plasma behaviour in an MSP magnetosphere. Our results offer direct evidence that the main pulse can include emission associated with more than one magnetic pole and highlight the importance of single-pulse diagnostics for understanding the geometry and dynamics of pulsars with interpulse emission. In addition, we analyse the jitter properties of this pulsar and measure a one-hour jitter of $\sigma_{J,1\rm h} = 78 \pm 3~\mathrm{ns}$ at 1.25 GHz, consistent with previous studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The First X-ray Polarimetry of GRS 1739–278 Reveals Its Rapidly Spinning Black Hole</a><span class="id">[2512.21899]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a joint spectro-polarimetric analysis of the black hole X-ray binary GRS 1739–278 during its 2025 mini-outburst, using simultaneous observations from \ixpe\ and \nustar. The \ixpe\ data show a polarization degree of ${\rm PD} = (2.3 \pm 0.4)\%$ and a polarization angle of ${\rm PA} = 62^\circ \pm 5^\circ$ in the 2–8 keV range. The model-independent analysis reveals that the PD increases from $\sim 2\%$ at 2 keV to $\sim 10\%$ in the 6–8 keV band, while the PA remains stable across the \ixpe\ band within statistical uncertainties. Broadband spectral modeling of the combined \ixpe\ and \nustar\ datasets shows that hard Comptonization contributes negligibly in this soft-state observation, while a substantial reflected component is required in addition to the thermal disk emission. We then model the \ixpe\ Stokes spectra using the \texttt{kynbbrr} model. The best-fitting results indicate that high-spin configurations enhance the contribution of reflected returning radiation, which dominates the observed polarization properties. From the \texttt{kynbbrr} modeling, we infer an extreme black hole spin of $a = 0.994^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ and a system inclination of $i = 54^\circ{}^{+8^\circ}_{-4^\circ}$. Owing to the large contribution from returning radiation, the observed polarization direction is nearly parallel to the projected system axis, the position angle of which is predicted to be $58^\circ \pm 4^\circ$. Our results demonstrate that X-ray polarimetry, combined with broadband spectroscopy, directly probes the geometry and relativistic effects in accretion disks around stellar-mass black holes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Superradiant and dynamical spin-down of neutron stars with gravitational wave implications</a><span class="id">[2512.21955]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutron stars such as pulsars and magnetars lose angular momentum primarily through electromagnetic dipole radiation, gravitational waves, $r$-mode oscillation, and also affected by fallback accretion processes.

We introduce a new method to recover this lost parameter by using a more accessible and routinely measurable quantity: spin-orbit misalignment. In isolated binary evolution, a natal kick from the second supernova both tilts the orbital plane and injects orbital eccentricity, forging a direct and quantifiable connection between spin-tilt and post-supernova eccentricity. By measuring this spin-tilt using gravitational waves, we can not only constrain the natal kick, but we can also reconstruct the binary's formation eccentricity. We apply this method to GW190412 and GW241011, assuming an isolated formation channel, and show how their eccentricity at formation can be constrained even in the absence of direct eccentricity measurements. As more advanced detectors come online, improved signal-to-noise ratios will tighten spin-tilt constraints, allowing more precise and reliable estimates of BBH formation eccentricity. Combining this method with multiband observations from LISA and next-generation (XG) detectors will allow us to recover not only eccentricity but also the binary's orbital separation and redshift at formation, offering a clearer picture of the birth environments of BBH systems and processes that drive their merger.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial black holes and smooth coarse-graining in excursion set theory</a><span class="id">[2512.22075]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The excursion-set formalism enables us to infer the mass distribution of collapsed objects, such as primordial black holes (PBHs), by the language of stochastic processes.

With recent progress on both theoretical and observational frontiers, we have reached the point where these novel signals of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) can be systematically tested with increasingly precise data. In this paper, we present the results of improved CMB data analysis for cosmological collider signals using Planck CMB data. To set the stage, we first construct a set of simplified but characteristic collider templates which are accurate over a broad range of particle masses, spins and sound speeds. In order to break degeneracies with single-field PNG, we propose an orthogonalization scheme such that the collider templates are uncorrelated with the highly constrained equilateral and orthogonal shapes. On this basis, we deploy the Modal bispectrum estimator for the Planck analysis and perform a systematic scan of parameters to search for the most significant collider signal. The maximum signal-to-noise ratio is found to be $2.35\sigma$ for massive spin-0 exchange after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect. In addition, we cross-validate the Modal analysis with the CMB-BEST pipeline, which demonstrates the consistency of results across the benchmark examples of collider templates. Given the low signal-to-noise ratio regime we find at the current stage of PNG observations, we believe the orthogonalization procedure provides an optimized strategy for future tests of the cosmological collider with the ability to rule out single field inflation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2512.22117]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernovae (SNe), the catastrophic end of stars' lives, are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe. Mapping the aftermath of the explosions to the properties of pre-SN stars is challenging due to the lack of knowledge about the evolution of different types of stars. The immediate surroundings of pre-SN stars carry the signature of the progenitors, and radio observations are the best way to examine the ambient media. Since radio emission originates from the interaction of supersonic SN ejecta with the relatively stationary circumstellar medium, with a few years of radio study, the mass-loss history of progenitor stars can be probed from just before the explosion of the star to thousands of years before the onset of the SN. Moreover, this can provide crucial details about the explosions, which are poorly understood to date. In this paper, we review the radio properties of different types of core-collapse explosions and thermonuclear runaways to understand their mass-loss evolution–which allows us to unravel the imprints of the progenitors on the surrounding media and thus the nature of the exploded stars. Additionally, we discuss the current state of the art in this field, including existing and the next-generation radio facilities with enhanced capabilities that provide further details about these explosions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21342" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Enhanced &quot;Flux-Corrected Transport&quot;-Based Plasmasphere Refilling Model</a><span class="id">[2512.21342]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A previously developed multi-ion, two-stream Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) hydrodynamic model for plasmasphere refilling has been extended to incorporate self-consistent electron temperature evolution. The past assumption of a constant temperature along the modeled flux tube has been replaced by solving the electron energy equation, permitting spatially and temporally varying temperature. This improvement provides a more physically complete representation of the pressure and ambipolar electric-field gradients that influence ion transport. The extended model allows us to investigate two-stage refilling behavior established by prior observations and simulations. The model continues to reproduce the expected dominance of H+, enhanced early-time O+ contributions, and the coupling between H+ and He+ through the ambipolar electric field during the transition between stages. Sensitivity experiments with modified initial ion concentrations, including cases representing seasonal effects, highlight the distinct roles of each ion species in shaping the refilling trajectory. Comparisons across L-shells 3 and 4 further confirm the robustness of the model framework for future extension to three-dimensional geometries. Overall, by incorporating more realistic temperature variations, this enhanced model strengthens the physical understanding for interpreting complex multi-ion transport processes during plasmasphere recovery following geomagnetic storms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$Sp(4,\mathbb{Z})$ modular inflation</a><span class="id">[2512.21597]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate inflation models governed by the Siegel modular group $Sp(4,\mathbb{Z})$.

However, there is still lack of quantitative comparison between the simulations and the theory of the dynamo. Results: We study the critical magnetic Reynolds number ($Rm_c$) and the growth rate near the threshold both in the limit of very high and in the case of moderate Reynolds numbers. We argue that in Kazantsev equation for magnetic field generation, one should use the quasi-Lagrangian correlator of velocities instead of Eulerian, as usually implied when comparing theory and simulations. The theoretical results obtained with this correlator agree well with numerical results. We also propose the explanation of the decrease of $Rm_c$ as a function of Reynolds number ($Re$) at intermediate-high $Re$. It is probably due to Reynolds-dependent intermittency of the velocity structure function: we show that the scaling exponent of this function in the inertial range affects strongly the magnetic field generation, and it is known to be an increasing function of the Reynolds number. Conclusions: Use of quasi-Lagrangian correlator in the Kazantsev theory gives good accordance with numerical simulations. An ideal way to compare them should be to find the correlator substituted to the Kazantsev equation and the generation properties in the same simulation. At least one has to use universal parameters independent of the properties of pumping scale. Reynolds-dependent intermittency can explain recently observed decrease of the critical magnetic Reynolds number at small Prandtl numbers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mass-to-Horizon Entropic Cosmology: A Unified Thermodynamic Pathway to Cosmic Acceleration</a><span class="id">[2512.22103]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the observational tests of generalized mass-to-horizon entropic cosmology by incorporating large-scale structure growth data in addition to purely geometric probes.

Within this setting, cosmic acceleration arises as an emergent phenomenon driven by an entropic force acting on the cosmological horizon. While earlier studies demonstrated that these entropic cosmologies can reproduce the background expansion history of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, here we present a comprehensive observational analysis that jointly employs Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova data with SH0ES calibration, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance priors, and a suite of cosmological structure growth observations.

M87 has been detected by LHAASO with a statistical significance $\sim 9\sigma$. The observed energy spectrum extends to 20 TeV, with a possible hardening at $\sim 20$ TeV and then a clear softening at higher energies. Assuming that the intrinsic spectrum is described by a single power law up to 20 TeV, a tight upper bound on the extragalactic background light (EBL) intensity is obtained. A strong VHE flare lasting eight days, with the rise time of $\tau_{r}^{\rm rise} = 1.05\pm0.49$ days and decay time of $\tau_{d}^{\rm decay} = 2.17\pm0.58$ days, was found in early 2022.

The variability time as short as one day seen in the LHAASO data suggests a compact emission region with a size of $\sim 3\times 10^{15}\delta\, {\rm cm}$ ($\delta$ being the Doppler factor of the emitting region), corresponding to a few Schwarzschild radii of the central supermassive black hole in M87.

Sustained, stable Snowball episodes require a Snowball bifurcation and climate bistability between the globally ice-covered Snowball state and a state with at least some open ocean. We find that climate bistability disappears for an aquaplanet with a slab ocean in the global climate model ExoCAM when the orbital eccentricity is increased to 0.2-0.3. This happens because the Snowball state ceases to exist as seasonal insolation variations intensify, while the warm state remains stable due to the ocean's large heat capacity. We use a low-order ice-thermodynamic model to show that the Snowball state ceases to exist as seasonality increases because winter freezing at the ice bottom is reduced relative to summer melting at the ice top due to ice self-insulation. Combined with previous research showing that Snowball climate bistability diminishes for planets orbiting low-mass stars and ones with longer rotation periods, and that it disappears entirely for tidally locked planets, our work suggests that the Snowball climate bistability may not be as robust to planetary parameters as previously thought, representing one aspect of habitability more consistent with the rare Earth hypothesis than the Copernican principle.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Prediction from the joint observation of MeerKAT and CSST at $z$ = 0.4 $\sim$ 1.2</a><span class="id">[2509.23343]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cross-correlating neutral hydrogen (HI) 21cm intensity mapping with galaxy surveys provides an effective probe of astrophysical and cosmological information.

We reconstruct, for the first time, the dynamics of the interior large-scale magnetic fields by assimilating observed line-of-sight photospheric magnetogram data from MDI/SOHO &amp; HMI/SDO along with helioseismic differential rotation data over three decades (1996-2025) into a 3D Babcock-Leighton dynamo model. The assimilation of observational magnetogram data allows us in realistic modelling of Babcock-Leighton mechanism as observed on the Sun without any simplified parameterization. As a result, our data-driven model successfully reproduces key observational features such as the surface butterfly diagram, accurate polar field evolution, and axial dipole moment. The reconstructed interior field dominated by toroidal component exhibits an equatorward migration and reproduces the realistic amplitude and modulation of cycles 23-25. We observe that the non-axisymmetric behaviour of the interior toroidal field becomes less prominent as we move deep towards the tachocline according to our model.

Instead, we observe a statistically significant reduction in skewness from the pre to the post-flare light curves, which implies the blazar transitioned from an energetic state with frequent flaring to a more plateaued state with occasional flaring. We further find that this state transition can be explained through magnetic relaxation, where many reconnection events caused the 2017 flare, after which the magnetic field was ordered and its energy reached a minimum. To explain this further, we use a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model where GeV flares are produced only when a maximum number of minijets move toward the broad line region and towards the line of sight, in the context of an external Compton model. The flux distributions (both observed and simulated) could be fit by a modified log-normal power-law distribution, implying our minijets model can reproduce the GeV flares in CTA 102 as well as their flux distributions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02619" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Non-Thermal Leptogenesis with Early Matter Domination on Gravitational Waves from First-order Phase Transition</a><span class="id">[2508.02619]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the impact of non-thermal leptogenesis on the spectrum of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by a strong first-order phase transition in the early Universe. We consider a scenario in which a heavy scalar field, $\phi$, dominates the energy density of the early Universe and decays into heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of RHNs generates a lepton asymmetry, which is partially converted into the observed baryon asymmetry via the sphaleron process. The $\phi$-dominated era and the entropy injection from the decays of $\phi$ and RHNs leave characteristic imprints on the GW spectrum, such as damping and modified frequency dependence, that distinguish it from the standard cosmological evolution. We identify the parameter space in which non-thermal leptogenesis is successful, leading to distinctive GW spectral features. We show that these GW signals can fall within the sensitivity ranges of future detectors such as ET, DECIGO and BBO. If observed, they would provide valuable insights into the thermal history and dynamics of the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A New Definition of Horndeski Theory and the Possibility of Multiple Scalar Field Extensions</a><span class="id">[2511.15423]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the single-field case, Horndeski provides the most general scalar-tensor theory with second-order field equations. By contrast, systematic multi-field extensions remain incomplete: while the general field equations for the bi-Horndeski case are known, a general action has not been established, and for cases with three or more fields, neither a general action nor general equations are available. We characterize Horndeski by two mild axioms: closure under invertible pure disformal transformations and the requirement that the theory includes the minimal Horndeski theory. Under this characterization, we recover the standard single-field action up to boundary terms and obtain a practical path to multi-field constructions. In particular, we show that antisymmetric structures, such as those identified by Allys, Akama, and Kobayashi, appear within this framework, and indicate that this viewpoint has the potential to account for features captured by known bi-Horndeski equations.</p></div></details></article></body>
