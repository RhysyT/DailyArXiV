The population of merging binary black holes has been used so far to provide a constraint on the Hubble constant and dark matter fraction under the hypothesis of a flat-$\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter Universe. In this work, we provide the first non-parametric constrain on the Hubble parameter from 137 dark sirens reported in GWTC-4.0. We employ the relation between detector and source frame masses for detected GW signals, to obtain a statistical redshift evaluation for the population of binary black holes (BBHs). We model the Hubble parameter as a non-parametric autoregressive process in terms of the scale factor, using splines. In addition, we introduce two novel features: the use of \textit{anchor} points for $H(z)$ derived from an external probe - here, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) - and a constraining power coefficient that quantifies where the inference is most data-driven by GW detections. We highlight three key findings: (i) using GWs alone, the Hubble parameter determination is the most GW-data-driven around redshift $z = 0.44$, yielding to $H(0.44) = 92.3_{-36.6}^{+29.9}\rm\, km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$. Its value at $z = 0$, the Hubble constant, is therefore less constrained by the GW data. (ii) The Hubble parameter inferred from analyses assuming a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmological model is strongly affected by the cosmological model assumption. (iii) Introducing an anchor point for $H(z)$ enhances the inferred constraints and provides a clear visualization of the redshift range where GWs contribute most to the constraining power.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydrodynamic instabilities in long-term three-dimensional simulations of neutrino-driven supernovae of 13 red supergiant progenitors</a><span class="id">[2511.11796]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present long-term three-dimensional (3D) simulations of Type-IIP supernovae (SNe) for 13 non-rotating, single-star, red-supergiant (RSG) progenitors with zero-age-main-sequence masses between 12.5 M$_{\odot}$ and 27.3 M$_{\odot}$. The explosions were modelled with a parametric treatment of neutrino heating to obtain defined energies, ${}^{56}$Ni yields, and neutron-star properties in agreement with previous results. Our 3D SN models were evolved from core bounce until 10 days to study how the large-scale mixing of chemical elements depends on the progenitor structure. Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (RTIs), which grow at the (C+O)/He and He/H interfaces and interact with the reverse shock forming after the SN shock has passed the He/H interface, play a crucial role in the outward mixing of ${}^{56}$Ni into the hydrogen envelope. We find most extreme ${}^{56}$Ni mixing and the highest maximum ${}^{56}$Ni velocities in lower-mass (LM) explosions despite lower explosion energies, and the weakest ${}^{56}$Ni mixing in the 3D explosions of the most massive RSGs. The efficiency of radial ${}^{56}$Ni mixing anti-correlates linearly with the helium-core mass and correlates positively with the magnitude of a local maximum of $\rho r^3$ in the helium shell. This maximum causes shock deceleration and therefore facilitates high growth factors of RTI at the (C+O)/He interface in the LM explosions. Therefore fast-moving ${}^{56}$Ni created by the asymmetric neutrino-heating mechanism is carried into the ubiquitous RT-unstable region near the He/H interface and ultimately far into the envelopes of the exploding RSGs. Our correlations may aid improving mixing prescriptions in 1D SN models and deducing progenitor structures from observed SN properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rock vapour is opaque: implications for dynamics and observations of lava planets</a><span class="id">[2511.11800]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extreme instellation on lava planets causes the rocky surface to melt and vaporize. Because the rock vapour composition is intrinsically tied to the mantle, atmospheric characterization of lava planets can hold valuable insight into the interior processes of rocky planets. To help interpret current data and strategize for future observations, we develop the model SonicVapour to simulate the dynamics of chemically complex secondary atmosphere of lava planets. We find that for planets with surface temperatures exceeding 2700 K, the rock vapour outgassed is optically thick, making the atmosphere vertically isothermal thus suppressing convection and severely limiting atmospheric detection via emission spectroscopy. In contrast, cooler planets with surfaces between 2300 K - 2700 K have an atmospheric opacity close to 50% and produce distinct spectral features. Counter-intuitively, therefore, cooler lava planet atmospheres are easier to detect. Our results ultimately emphasize the importance of considering atmospheric &quot;detectability&quot; in tandem with signal-to-noise for future observation programs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11808" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflation without an Inflaton II: observational predictions</a><span class="id">[2511.11808]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a complete computation of the scalar power spectrum in the \emph{inflation without inflaton} (IWI) framework, where the inflationary expansion is driven solely by a de Sitter (dS) background and scalar fluctuations arise as second-order effects sourced by tensor perturbations. By explicitly deriving and numerically integrating the full second-order kernel of the Einstein equations, we obtain a scale-invariant scalar spectrum without invoking a fundamental scalar field. In this framework, the amplitude of the scalar fluctuations is directly linked to the scale of inflation. More precisely, we show that matching the observed level of scalar fluctuations, $\Delta_{\phi}^2(k_\ast)\approx 10^{-9}$ at Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales, fixes the inflationary energy scale $H_{\rm inf}$ as a function of the number of observed e-folds $N_{\rm obs}$. For $N_{\rm obs}\simeq 30 - 60$, we find $H_{\rm inf} \simeq 5\times 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV} - 2\times 10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, corresponding to a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 0.01 - 5\times 10^{-9}$. In particular, requiring consistency with instantaneous reheating, we predict a number of e-folds of order $\mathcal{O}(50)$ and an inflationary scale $H_{\rm inf} \simeq 10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$. We also incorporate in our framework the quantum break-time of the dS state and show that it imposes an upper bound on the number of particle species. Specifically, using laboratory constraints on the number of species limits the duration of inflation to $N_{\rm obs}\lesssim 126$ e-folds. These results establish the IWI scenario as a predictive and falsifiable alternative to standard inflaton-driven models, linking the observed amplitude of primordial fluctuations directly to the quantum nature and finite lifetime of dS space.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11814" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the coincidence between the close passage of HD7977 and the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition</a><span class="id">[2511.11814]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Oort Cloud's dynamical evolution is significantly influenced by both the galactic tide and stellar flybys. This study investigates the particular case of HD7977's close encounter 2.47 Myr ago, which likely repopulated the Inner Oort Cloud and potentially triggered a significant comet shower on Earth. Our results demonstrate that the shower's intensity strongly depends on HD7977's impact parameter ($b$), with possible flyby distances ranging from 2,300 AU to $\sim$ 13,000 AU. For the closest approach ($b \sim 2,300$ AU), the terrestrial impact probability of 1 km comets increases by an order of magnitude compared to the steady state, slightly exceeding the asteroid impact probability at this size scale. We propose an analytical method to compute the probability of comet showers impacting Earth, which saves considerable computation time compared to N-body simulations. We identify a threshold diameter $D_0 = 2.25$ km for which yields $P = 1$ in our model, with $D_0$ following a logarithmic dependence on $b$. These findings suggest that HD7977's flyby may have caused an enhanced comet flux during the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition, which could plausibly be related to the environmental changes at this era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Transition from Giant Planets to Brown Dwarfs beyond 1 au from the Stellar Metallicity Distribution</a><span class="id">[2511.11818]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Giant planets and brown dwarfs are thought to form via a combination of pathways, including bottom-up mechanisms in which gas is accreted onto a solid core and top-down mechanisms in which gas collapses directly into a gravitationally-bound object. One can distinguish the prevalence of these mechanisms using host star metallicities. Bottom-up formation thrives in metal-rich environments, whereas top-down formation is weakly dependent on ambient metal content. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model and the results of the California Legacy Survey (CLS), a low-bias and homogeneously analyzed radial velocity survey, we find evidence for a transition in the stellar metallicity distribution at a companion mass of $\gamma = 27_{-8}^{+12} \, M_{\rm Jup}$ for companions with orbital separations between $1-50$ au. Companions below and above this threshold tend to orbit stars with higher ($\rm{[Fe/H]} = 0.17 \pm 0.12$ dex) and lower ($\rm{[Fe/H]} = -0.03 \pm 0.10$ dex) metallicities, respectively. Previous studies of relatively close-in companions reported evidence of a lower transition mass of $\leq 10 \, {\rm M_{\rm Jup}}$. When applied to the CLS sample, our model predicts the probability of a transition in the stellar metallicity distribution at or below $10 \, { M_{\rm Jup}}$ to be $&lt; 1 \%$. We compare our results to estimates of $\gamma$ gleaned from other observational metrics and discuss implications for planet formation theory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11887" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disk mass predictions for binary neutron star mergers: limitations of proposed symbolic regression models</a><span class="id">[2511.11887]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modeling disk formation and mass ejection in binary neutron star systems is an important component in the construction of models for the electromagnetic signals powered by these events. Most models rely on analytical formulae for the disk mass and dynamical ejecta that are fitted to the results of numerical simulations, yet these fits have large uncertainties that significantly limit our ability to extract information from merger observations. In a recent manuscript, Darc et al claim that disk mass formulae constructed using symbolic regression outperform existing formulae and robustly extend to regions of the parameter space outside of the fitting region. I show here that the improvement over the most directly comparable existing model comes mostly from the use of different error measures in optimizing the fitting parameters. For the limited training data used so far, that existing fitting formula has a performance similar to symbolic regression models when optimized over the same error measure. More importantly, I show that many of the formulae obtained through symbolic regression provide unphysical results when used over the whole range of parameters relevant to the modeling of binary neutron star mergers, making them dangerous to use within parameter estimation pipelines. I conclude that fitting formulae with more physics input (e.g. Lund et al 2025), albeit certainly imperfect, remain safer to use in data analysis than these symbolic regression results. Symbolic regression results used in conjunction with careful physics-based vetting may however outperform them in the future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11915" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atmospheric Response to Large Electron Beam Fluxes in Solar Flares III: Comprehensive Modeling of the Brightest Observed Near-Ultraviolet Continuum Source in an X9 Solar Flare</a><span class="id">[2511.11915]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I report on the high resolution spectra of the remarkable X9 solar flare of 2024 Oct 03 (SOL2024-10-03T12:08) and evaluate the extent to which nonthermal electron beams that generate dense chromospheric condensations can power very bright kernels in solar flares. 1D Radiative-hydrodynamic models predict extreme H$\alpha$ near-wing broadening, bright continuum intensities, and a rapid Fe II red wing asymmetry evolution at the brightest NUV continuum source in the flare. Detailed comparisons to the spectral observations reveal that the H$\alpha$ line is too broad, the Fe II red wing is too bright, and the NUV continuum decays too slowly in a fiducial high-flux beam model. However, chromospheric condensations with maximum electron densities of $n_e \approx 5 \times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ and optical depths $\tau \approx 1$ in the near wing of H$\alpha$ are consistent with the observed intensity of a broad spectrum in the Southern ribbon. Model similarities demonstrate that Fe I emission lines and the FUV continuum intensity can form at chromospheric heights during flares, but I find that the ratios of the NUV to FUV continuum intensities are generally too large in the models. This suggests that radiative-hydrodynamic models of chromospheric condensations cool through $T \approx 30,000$ K too rapidly. The larger than expected FUV continuum intensities are not nearly bright enough to explain recent stellar megaflare spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Through the Heliospheric Lens: Directional Deflection of High-Energy Cosmic-Ray Electrons and Positrons</a><span class="id">[2511.11936]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate how the large-scale heliosphere alters the arrival directions of high-energy cosmic-ray electrons and positrons and ask if and when this &quot;heliospheric lens&quot; can be ignored for anisotropy and source-association studies - an especially timely topic given, for instance, the persistent cosmic-ray positron fraction and its unknown origin. Using a modular back-tracing framework, we explore a set of widely used magnetic-field descriptions - from a Parker spiral baseline to more structured configurations that include latitudinal wind contrasts, Smith-Bieber-type azimuthal strengthening, and tilted or wavy heliospheric current sheets. Across these models the picture is consistent: most bending is accumulated within the inner tens of astronomical units and decreases rapidly with energy. Field choices and solar-cycle geometry set the overall normalization, with stronger spiral winding or a more highly tilted current sheet producing larger deflections at the same energy. Differences between electrons and positrons are most apparent at lower energies, where drift histories and current-sheet encounters diverge, and become increasingly small at multi-TeV energies. We summarize these trends with a practical threshold energy describing when heliospheric bending falls below an instrument's angular resolution, and we verify that our conclusions are robust to numerical settings. For current instruments, heliospheric effects can usually be treated as a small correction at the highest energies, while sub-TeV analyses benefit from a calibrated envelope that accounts for plausible field configurations during the observing epoch.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SourceREACH (Source REconstruction of Arcs behind Cluster Halos): A New Source Reconstruction Algorithm Optimized for Giant Arcs and Galaxy Cluster Lenses</a><span class="id">[2511.11952]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a new algorithm designed for use with extended lensed images, specifically giant arcs lensed by galaxy clusters. These highly magnified images contain important information about both the mass distribution of the cluster and the properties of the background source, but modeling them requires significant computational effort. Our new source reconstruction methodology is designed to be accurate and efficient for high-resolution observations in which point spread function effects are not significant. The overall process deconvolves the observed image by the point spread function, de-lenses the image pixels, and uses interpolation or regression with smoothing to determine the model source. By working with de-lensed points, the method accounts for varying resolution across the source plane. We evaluate the speed and accuracy of different interpolation and regression methods using both mock data and real data for the giant arc in Abell 370. We find that utilizing K Nearest Neighbor Regression results in the best balance of noise smoothing and preservation of compact detail in the source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He-star donor pathway for the hypervelocity star D6-2</a><span class="id">[2511.11998]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type Ia supernovae are thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, yet the nature of their progenitor systems remains uncertain. Recent discoveries of hypervelocity stars provide unique constraints, as these stars likely represent the surviving companions of such explosions. Using detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA and population synthesis with MSE, we investigate the outcomes of hot subdwarf + white dwarf binaries undergoing helium accretion. We find that donors can nearly exhaust their helium and form compact, C/O cores before explosion. The predicted ejection velocities span a broad distribution reaching up to $\sim 1000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, with D6-2 representing the extreme high-velocity tail of this population. We estimate analytically that the thin residual helium envelope can be stripped by the supernova ejecta, producing a C/O-rich surface composition consistent with the observed spectrum. The Type Ia supernova rate from this channel is ${\sim}(1.69\pm0.06)\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot^{-1}}$, consistent with 1% of the observed Type Ia supernova rate. Hot subdwarf + white dwarf binaries containing nearly exhausted He-star donors can therefore naturally explain the velocity and composition of D6-2 while providing a quantitatively consistent contribution to the observed Type Ia supernova rate. Our models predict a distribution of surviving donor remnants with various core He fractions and with ejection velocities extending down to $\sim 450\,\mathrm{ km\,s^{-1}}$. The orbital velocities of donor stars in this progenitor channel naturally yield orbital velocities consistent with US 708, LP 40-365 stars, and D6-2, indicating that a single class of thermonuclear supernova progenitors can account for their entire range of ejection velocities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational wave standard sirens from GWTC-3 combined with DESI DR2 and DESY5: A late-universe probe of the Hubble constant and dark energy</a><span class="id">[2511.12017]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data and the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements has shown a $\sim$3$\sigma$ preference for a dynamical dark energy model with a phantom-crossing behavior. However, such a phantom-crossing dark energy evolution further exacerbates the already severe Hubble tension in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, there exists a $\sim2\sigma$ tension between the DESI DR2 BAO and CMB datasets. Therefore, it is essential to measure the Hubble constant and dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameters using only late-universe observations. In this work, we investigate a novel late-universe data combination: gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, BAO, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This combination provides a fully distance-ladder- and CMB-independent determination of the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS. Using 47 GW standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, the DESI DR2 BAO data, and DESY5 SNe Ia data, in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we obtain $H_0=74.8^{+6.3}_{-8.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.320^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, $w_0=-0.775^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, and $w_a=-0.80\pm0.47$, indicating a mild phantom-crossing behavior within the $1\sigma$ credible interval with an $H_0$ value consistent with the distance ladder measurements. Our analysis demonstrates the power of GW standard sirens in breaking parameter degeneracies, and this novel data combination provides joint constraints on the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS parameters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doppler imaging combined with high-cadence photometry.

Revisiting the surface of a pre-main-sequence flare star</a><span class="id">[2511.12190]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Latitude distribution of stellar magnetic activity is not well constrained by observations, despite its importance for a better understanding of stellar dynamos. We aim to obtain an accurate reconstruction of the surface spot distribution on the young, rapidly rotating K2 star PW And by combining spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics. In particular, we seek to assess how the inclusion of continuous high-precision TESS photometry in parallel with high-resolution spectroscopy improves latitude recovery of starspots, especially at low latitudes and in the southern hemisphere, which are poorly constrained by Doppler imaging (DI) alone. We explore the spatial origins of the observed white-light flares. We performed simultaneous Doppler imaging and light curve inversion (DI+LCI) using contemporaneous high-resolution GAOES-RV spectra from the 3.8 m Seimei telescope (R 65000) and high-precision TESS light curves. Surface reconstructions employ the SpotDIPy code to model both line profiles and continuum brightness variations. We compare DI+LCI maps with DI-only solutions, conduct artificial-spot simulations to evaluate the effects of latitude, phase coverage, and S/N on reconstruction reliability. We also investigate the spatial correlation between the DI+LCI reconstructed map and flares detected in the TESS data. The DI+LCI reconstruction reveals significant spot features at mid-to-low latitudes, equatorial regions, and even in the southern hemisphere. Simulations show that DI+LCI provides more accurate reconstructions than DI-only, especially under conditions of incomplete phase coverage and low S/N, by better recovering both spot latitudes and filling factors. A comparison between the DI+LCI map and the TESS flare timings also suggests potential association between flare occurrence and reconstructed spot longitudes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pre-Supernova Multiple Giant Eruptions in Massive Stars</a><span class="id">[2511.12312]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive stars can exhibit giant eruptions with high mass loss shortly before their explosion as a core-collapse Supernova. These multiple giant eruptions (MGEs) may have a commutative effect that brings the star to a different state, possible one that favors the explosion. To address this problem, we evolve a 100 solar mass star and initiate a series of three giant eruptions lasting one year each, testing different mass loss rates and different metallicities. Following each eruption, we track the recovery phase to examine the post-eruption behavior of the star and its recovery timescale. The MGEs lead to a decrease in luminosity, accompanied by a slight increase in temperature. Later, during the recovery phases as the star starts to retain its equilibrium state, its luminosity increases. The recovery time-scale varies significantly after each eruption for independent on the mass loss rate, but it is shorter for lower metallicities. For the higher mass-loss rates during the recovery phase, the outer layers of the star exhibit oscillations and undergo compression at higher metallicity. These oscillations are most likely a consequence of thermal imbalance in the outer envelope. This behavior at higher mass-loss rates also suggests that the thermal readjustments during recovery may create favorable conditions for a subsequent eruption of the star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterization of type Ibn SNe</a><span class="id">[2511.12362]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type Ibn supernovae (SNe) are characterized by narrow helium (He I) lines from photons produced by the unshocked circumstellar material (CSM). About 80 SNe Ibn have been discovered to date, and only a handful have extensive observational records. Thus, many open questions regarding the progenitor system and the origin of the CSM remain. Here we investigate potential correlations between the spectral features of the prominent He I $\lambda$5876 line and the optical and X-ray light curve properties of SNe Ibn. We compile the largest sample of 61 SNe Ibn to date, of which 24 SNe have photometric and spectroscopic data from the Young Supernova Experiment and 37 SNe have archival data sets. We fit 24 SNe Ibn with sufficient photometric coverage ($B$ to $z$ bands) using semi-analytical models from MOSFiT. We demonstrate that the light curves of SNe Ibn are more diverse than previous analyses suggest, with absolute $r$-band peak magnitudes of $-19.4\pm0.6$ mag and rise (from $-10$ days to peak) and decay-rates (from peak to +10 days) of $-0.08\pm0.06$ and $0.08\pm0.03$ mag/day, respectively. We find that the majority of SNe Ibn in the sub-sample are consistent with a low-energy explosion ($&lt;10^{51}$ erg) of a star with a compact envelope surrounded by $\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$ of helium-rich CSM. The inferred ejecta masses are small ($\sim 1$ M$_{\odot}$) and expand with a velocity of $\sim$5000 km/s. Our spectroscopic analysis shows that the mean velocity of the narrow component of the He I lines, associated to the CSM, peaks at $\sim1100$ km/s. The mean CSM and ejecta masses inferred for a sub-sample of SNe Ibn indicate that their progenitors are not massive ($\sim10$ M$_{\odot}$), single stars at the moment of explosion, but are likely binary systems. This agrees with the detection of potential companion stars of SNe Ibn progenitors, and the inferred CSM properties from stellar evolution models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral-Timing Evolution of a Black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613: Linking Disk Reflection and Type-C QPO Frequency During the 2023 Outburst</a><span class="id">[2511.12466]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive spectral-timing analysis of a BHXB Swift J1727.8$-$1613 during its 2023 outburst, using five pointed \textit{NuSTAR} observations sampling the luminous hard-intermediate state. Broadband 3-79 keV spectroscopy employs a physically motivated model combining a cool truncated disk (\texttt{diskbb}), relativistic reflection (\texttt{relxill} in reflection-only mode), and Comptonized continuum (\texttt{nthComp}) to probe the inner accretion geometry around a rapidly spinning black hole ($a_\ast\!=\!0.98$) at moderate inclination. Simultaneous timing analysis reveals type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with novel coherence evolution: the quality factor ($Q$) exhibits a striking non-monotonic dependence on both QPO frequency and luminosity, peaking near $\nu_{\rm QPO}\!\sim\!1.2$ Hz and declining at both lower and higher frequencies. This turnover directly constrains Lense-Thirring precession geometry, implying optimal coherence at intermediate truncation radius. A tight photon-index-QPO-frequency correlation demonstrates that spectral softening and frequency rise are concurrent signatures of inward truncation-radius motion.

However, direct observational evidence of disk-jet co-precession remains elusive. Here, we report the most compelling case to date: a tidal disruption event (TDE) exhibiting unprecedented 19.6-day quasi-periodic variations in both X-rays and radio, with X-ray amplitudes exceeding an order of magnitude. The nearly synchronized X-ray and radio variations suggest a shared mechanism regulating the emission regions. We demonstrate that a disk-jet Lense-Thirring precession model successfully reproduces these variations while requiring a low-spin black hole. This study uncovers previously uncharted short-term radio variability in TDEs, highlights the transformative potential of high-cadence radio monitoring, and offers profound insights into disk-jet physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The first AKRA mass map reconstruction from HSC Y1 data</a><span class="id">[2511.12488]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Weak lensing mass-mapping from shear catalogs faces systematic challenges from survey masks and spatially varying noise. To overcome these issues and reconstruct unbiased convergence $\kappa$ maps, we have constructed the AKRA (Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm), a prior-free and maximum-likelihood based analytical method. It has been validated for mock shear catalogs with a variety of survey masks. In this work, we present the first real-data application of the AKRA on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 1 (HSC Y1) data. We first validate AKRA using mock shear catalogs from the \texttt{Kun} simulation suite, with masks corresponding to the six HSC Y1 regions (\texttt{GAMA09H}, \texttt{GAMA15H}, \texttt{HECTOMAP}, \texttt{VVDS}, \texttt{WIDE12H}, and \texttt{XMMLSS}). The investigated statistics, including the lensing power spectrum, $\langle \kappa^2\rangle$, $\langle \kappa^3\rangle$, and the one-point probability distribution function of $\kappa$, are all unbiased. We then apply AKRA to the HSC Y1 shear catalog and provide reconstructed $\kappa$ maps ready for subsequent scientific analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The homogeneity scale in the Local Universe: model-independent estimate from S-PLUS DR4 blue galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.12532]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a model-independent estimate of the angular homogeneity scale in the Local Universe by analysing data from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). Two complementary estimators are employed: (i) a parametric approach fitting the power-law of the two-point angular correlation function, which yields the homogeneity scale $\theta_H = 9.01_{-3.61}^{+8.43}\;{\rm deg}$; and (ii) a non-parametric fractal correlation dimension method, computing $\mathcal{D}_2(\theta)$ directly from the correlation function, which results in $\theta_H = 6.28_{-4.43}^{+8.72}\;{\rm deg}$. From the mock catalogues generated with the GLASS algorithm, we find that the estimates from both methods are within $1 \sigma$ of the median values obtained by applying both methodologies to the mocks. The transition scale to homogeneity, according to the $\Lambda$CDM model, is defined for matter, i.e. $b = 1$. Measurements of this scale with observational data clearly depends on the cosmic tracer analysed, and a calibration is necessary. Our study with blue galaxies, with bias $b \simeq 1$, provides a suitable estimate for comparison. Indeed, the results obtained in both approaches are compared with the value expected in the $\Lambda$CDM model, obtaining a good concordance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12557" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulations of structured upflows from plumes and their connection to the solar wind</a><span class="id">[2511.12557]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Small-scale transient jetlet activity and associated upflows from coronal hole plumes are potential sources of the solar wind. To elucidate the magnetic origins and driving mechanisms of such upflows, we perform three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the MURaM code, spanning from the upper convection zone to the low corona. We synthesize Fe {\sc x} 174 Å emission to capture the plume evolution comparable to observations, examining underlying plasma flows, thermal structures, and magnetic topologies. We identify a pronounced transition from cool downflows in the lower atmosphere to hot upflows in the corona at the interface between plume-rooted like-polarity flux concentrations. These upflows are threaded by a complex, filamentary network of Quasi-Separatrix Layers (QSLs) – a topology distinct from standard interchange reconnection scenarios. The domain-averaged mass flux over a 38-minute interval ranges from $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-8}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$, substantially exceeding observed solar-wind loss rates. Our results demonstrate that highly structured plasma outflows are channeled along strong QSLs at open–open field boundaries, providing a pathway to sustain the solar wind from coronal-hole plumes without requiring interchange reconnection triggered by opposite-polarity flux emergence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Chandra Strong Lens Sample: Measuring the Dynamical States and Relaxation Fraction of a Sample of 28 Strong Lensing Selected Galaxy Clusters</a><span class="id">[2511.12707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the results of our dynamical state proxy measurements performed on 28 strong lensing galaxy clusters from the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS). Using Chandra ACIS-I/S X-ray data supplemented with HST WFC3 imaging, we measure four morphological parameters: the concentration parameter (c), asymmetry parameter (A), centroid shift (log(w)), and the X-ray-BCG centroid separation (D [kpc]). Our goals are to (A) provide a robust classification of the dynamical state of the clusters in this strong lensing selected sample to enable studies that test various problems in cluster astrophysics and observational cosmology; (B) identify correlations, biases, or disagreements between different measurement proxies and cluster properties; and (C) measure the relaxation fraction (the fraction of clusters classified as relaxed based on X-ray morphology) and compare it to relaxation fractions from cluster samples selected using other methods. We combine the four morphological parameters into a single metric, the combined parameter M, which effectively separates the cluster sample into four dynamical state categories: relaxed; moderately relaxed; moderately disturbed; and disturbed. We find no significant trend in a cluster's dynamical state with its size, and only a weak, statistically limited dependence on mass and redshift. Based on our classification system, we find that $43\%^{+9}_{-9}$ of the clusters are relaxed, which is consistent with relaxation fractions measured for other cluster samples selected on mass-observables. This implies a strong lensing selected sample of clusters is on average dynamically similar to clusters selected via different methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12716" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsar B1237+25 Aberration/Retardation Analysis from Decimeter to Decameter Wavelength: Challenge to &quot;Radius-to-Frequency Mapping&quot;</a><span class="id">[2511.12716]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>PSR B1237+25 is perhaps the canonical example of a pulsar with a core/double cone profile. Moreover, it is bright with little spectral turnover, and its profile perhaps uniquely remains undistorted by scattering far into the decametric band. Here we assemble more than a dozen of the highest quality profiles (30 MHz to 5 GHz) from half a dozen observatories, where possible polarimetric. The pulsar's 2.6$^{\circ}$ core component marks the magnetic axis longitude, and we confirm that this point coincides both with the linear polarization angle inflection point and the zero-crossing of its antisymmetric circular signature – thus providing the possibility to estimate emission heights over a very broad band using aberration/retardation (A/R). We then carefully fit the profile components with Gaussians to identify and study the subtle asymmetries produced by A/R. We find a consistent A/R in the pulsar's profiles of some 0.5$^{\circ}$ longitude or 2 ms – corresponding to a putative conal emission height of 200-400 km – with a formal error of about 100 km. Our analysis finds no evidence whatsoever for an emission height increase with wavelength, the so-called “radius-to-frequency mapping”. Nor do we find any significant difference in A/R effect between the outer and inner cones.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observations of Five Southern-Hemisphere Cataclysmic Binary Stars</a><span class="id">[2511.12762]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present observations and analyses of five little-studied cataclysmic binary stars in the southern celestial hemisphere.

(ii) J0916-26 had been suspected of being a magnetic CV with an eclipse period of 3.37 hr. Our spectrum corroborates this classification. (iii) GSC 08944 is a novalike variable with Porb = 3.80 hr.

Our spectrum shows shows broad emission lines consistent with this, and the extensive TESS data show a persistent modulation near 1.35 hr, evidently a negative superhump. It is less luminous than most novalikes, but significantly brighter than quiescent dwarf novae with comparably short periods.

Current empirical evidence indicates that M dwarfs with spectral types ranging from M3 / M4 to late-type M dwarfs, stellar masses smaller than 0.15 M$_\odot$, and rotational period shorter than four days display either a stable dipolar magnetic field or magnetic structures with significant time variability. The magnetic activity of fully convective M dwarfs is known to be regulated by a mechanism named the ${\alpha}^2$ dynamo. To further constrain the physics of this mechanism, we use a low-dimensional model for thermally driven magnetoconvection producing an ${\alpha}^2$ dynamo, specifically a modified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shell model. Although the model neglects density stratification, it captures the essential nonlinear dynamics of an $\alpha^2$ dynamo. Therefore, the results should be interpreted in a qualitative sense, highlighting possible trends rather than providing direct quantitative predictions for fully convective stars. The model is validated by comparing the statistical properties of magnetic polarity reversals with paleomagnetic data, since the geodynamo provides the only natural ${\alpha}^2$ dynamo with sufficiently rich reversal statistics. Our findings reveal that increased convective heat transport correlates with more frequent magnetic-polarity reversals, resulting in enhanced magnetic variability. This suggests that the observed magnetic dichotomy in late M dwarfs could be interpreted in terms of differences in global heat transport efficiency. However, additional models and observations of M dwarfs are needed to further constrain this interpretation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital Eccentricities Suggest a Gradual Transition from Giant Planets to Brown Dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2511.12816]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To date, hundreds of sub-stellar objects with masses between $1-80\ M_{\rm Jup}$ have been detected orbiting main-sequence stars. The current convention uses the deuterium-burning limit, $M_c \approx 13 M_{\rm Jup}$ to divide this population between giant planets and brown dwarfs. However, this classification heuristic is largely divorced from any formation physics and may not accurately reflect the astrophysical nature of these objects. Previous work has suggested that a transition from “planet-like” to “brown-dwarf-like” characteristics occurs somewhere in the range $1-10 M_{\rm Jup}$, but precise the crossover mass and whether the transition is gradual or abrupt remains unknown. Here, we explore how the occurrence rate, host star metallicity, and orbital eccentricities vary as a function of mass in a sample of 70 Doppler-detected sub-stellar objects ($0.8 &lt; M_c/M_{\rm Jup} &lt; 80$) from the California Legacy Survey. Our population consists of objects near and beyond the water ice line ($1 &lt; a / \text{AU} &lt; 10$), providing valuable clues to the details of giant planet formation physics at a location in the proto-stellar disk where planet formation efficiency is thought to be enhanced. We find that occurrence rate, host star metallicity, and orbital eccentricity all change gradually across the mass range under consideration, suggesting that “bottom-up” core accretion mechanisms and “top-down” gravitational instability mechanisms produce objects that overlap in mass. The observed eccentricity distributions could arise either from different formation channels or from post-formation dynamical interactions between massive sub-stellar objects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12824" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling stellar convective transport with plumes : II. Transport Properties of Locally and Non-locally driven Convection</a><span class="id">[2511.12824]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of two idealized regimes of stellar convection: a cooling-driven model (Model C) and an entropy-gradient-driven model (Model S). The two regimes exhibit striking contrasts: while Model S develops large, relatively stationary eddies excited at depth, Model C is dominated near the surface by intermittent plume-like downflows that produce broad non-Gaussian velocity distributions and a turbulent energy flux that exceeds Model S by nearly an order of magnitude in the upper convection zone. Conventional gradient-diffusion (GD) closures reproduce the transport in Model S but significantly underestimate it in Model C, demonstrating that plume-driven convection lies beyond the scope of local, gradient-based models. To address this, we introduce a Time-Space Double Averaging (TSDA) method that extracts coherent fluctuations, yielding a diagnostic variable $\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}$ that peaks where the flux is largest. Building on this insight, we propose a modified GD closure in which the turbulent diffusivity is corrected by a plume-mediated term, achieving quantitative agreement with simulation results. Although the closure requires a calibrated model parameter and a careful choice of the averaging window, it provides a physically transparent framework that links coherent plume dynamics to mean-field transport, and offers a pathway toward improved subgrid models for non-equilibrium stellar convection zones.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbit Elements from Kepler Solutions in Projective Coordinates</a><span class="id">[2511.12957]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Closed-Form Kepler solutions in projective coordinates are used to define a corresponding set of eight orbit elements and obtain their governing equations for arbitrarily-perturbed two-body dynamics.

A key prediction of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models is a transition from poloidally dominated fields near the engine to toroidally dominated fields downstream, yet direct tests within the ACZ are hampered by weak polarization and strong Faraday rotation. We report quasi-simultaneous, high-sensitivity, multifrequency very long baseline interferometric polarimetry of M87 spanning 1.4-24.4GHz. We present high-fidelity, Faraday rotation-corrected maps of intrinsic linear polarization that continuously resolve the ACZ in the de-projected distance range of  9e3 to  3.6e5 gravitational radii from the black hole. The maps reveal pronounced north-south asymmetries in fractional linear polarization and electric vector position angle (EVPA), peaking in the inner ACZ at a projected distance of  20mas along the jet and remaining prominent out to  100mas. These signatures are best reproduced by models with a large-scale, ordered helical field that retains a substantial poloidal component-contrary to the rapid toroidal dominance expected under steady, ideal MHD. This tension implies ongoing magnetic dissipation that limits toroidal buildup over the ACZ. The handedness of the helix provides an independent constraint on the black hole's spin direction, supporting a spin vector oriented away from the observer, consistent with the orientation inferred from horizon-scale imaging. Farther downstream, the asymmetries diminish, and the EVPA and fractional polarization distributions become more symmetric; we tentatively interpret this as evolution toward a more poloidally dominated configuration, while noting current sensitivity and dynamic-range limits.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reheating and Inflationary dynamics driven by an inverse tangent potential</a><span class="id">[2511.13045]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we study the early universe inflation and the post-inflation reheating era employing an inverse tangent potential of the form $V=V_0 \cdot[tan^{-1}(\frac{\kappa \phi}{m_p})]^2$, where $\kappa$ is a free parameter of the potential and $m_p$ is the reduced Planck mass.

For the first time, our three-dimensional magneto-frictional simulation, driven by supergranular motions, self-consistently replicates the commonly observed multi-arch bridge morphology and its characteristic structures of solar quiescent prominences in a magnetic flux rope. In comparison with traditional views, our simulations demonstrate that the spine, feet, and voids (bubbles) are inherent prominence structures spontaneously forming as the flux rope evolves to a mature state. The voids mainly consist of legs of sheared magnetic loops caused by unbalanced supergranular flows, and prominence feet settle at the bottom of helical field lines piled up from the photosphere to the spine. Similarities between the simulated prominences and observed real prominences by the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer, the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, and NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory suggest the high validity of our model.

Among candidate mechanisms, vortex creep heating (VCH) provides a robust link between spin-down and frictional dissipation in the pinned inner-crust superfluid, yet its interplay with fast DUrca cooling in massive stars remains insufficiently explored. We (i) implement VCH in our cooling code and validate it; (ii) identify the physically consistent domain where the steady-state form $L_{\text{h}}=J|\dot\Omega_\infty|$ applies; (iii) quantify how $(B,P_0)$ regulate observable VCH signatures under DUrca cooling; and (iv) introduce a 3D representation that resolves degeneracies hidden in standard 2D projections. Cooling is computed with BSk24 and APR EoS, standard pairing gaps, and iron/carbon envelopes. VCH is modeled with $J\simeq10^{42.9\text{--}43.8}$ erg s, and a quantum-creep coverage fraction $f_{\text{Q}}(t)$ diagnoses when steady-state heating is valid. We survey $B=10^{10\text{--}13}$ G and $P_0=10$–$570$ ms for $1.4$ and $2.0\,M_\odot$, and compare with a curated set of ordinary pulsars with measured $(P,\dot P)$. Results: (1) Our implementation reproduces published VCH bands. (2) The $(B,P_0)$ validity boundary follows magnetic-dipole spin-down, confirming consistency with $|\dot\Omega|$. (3) DUrca+VCH maintains $T_{\text{s}}^\infty\gtrsim10^5$ K for $B\gtrsim10^{11-12}$ G up to $P_0\sim10^2$ ms. (4) The 3D representation shows that sources appearing coincident in $(t,T_{\text{s}}^\infty)$ occupy distinct $B$-layers, removing degeneracies. VCH can substantially reshape late-time thermal states when spin-down power remains high; its observability depends chiefly on $(B,P_0)$ rather than on mass alone.

Follow-up observations from $\sim$1.5 to 100 days post-trigger were obtained across X-ray, UV, optical, near-infrared, and radio bands with ground- and space-based facilities. The redshift is constrained to $z = 0.7485$ from prominent optical spectral features. The optical light curve shows complex evolution: an initial $\sim t^{-0.7}$ decay, followed by a rapid re-brightening peaking at day 7.7 with $\sim t^{-1.7}$ decay, and a third phase peaking near day 19 with $\sim t^{-1.3}$ decay. The spectral energy distribution (SED) and its temporal evolution are consistent with a mix of non-thermal and thermal components. Early optical-to-X-ray spectral indices agree with optically thin synchrotron emission, while steepening of the optical SED after $\sim$20 days indicates either a shift in emission mechanism or the emergence of an additional component.

However, the presence of bright foregrounds over four orders of magnitude stronger than the HI signal makes its extraction highly challenging. While all methods perform well when assuming a Gaussian beam degraded to the worst resolution, most of them degrade significantly in the presence of a more realistic beam model. In this work, we investigate the performance of SDecGMCA. This method extends DecGMCA to spherical data, combining sparse component separation with beam deconvolution. Our goal is to evaluate this method in comparison with established foreground removal techniques, assessing its ability to recover the cosmological HI signal from single-dish intensity mapping observations under varying beam conditions. We use simulated HI signal and foregrounds, covering the frequency ranges relevant to MeerKAT and SKA-Mid. The foreground removal techniques tested fall into two main categories: model-fitting methods (polynomial and parametric) and blind source separation methods (PCA, ICA, GMCA, and SDecGMCA). Their effectiveness is evaluated based on the recovery of the HI angular and frequency power spectra under progressively more realistic beam conditions. While all methods perform adequately under a uniform degraded beam, SDecGMCA remains robust when frequency-dependent beam distortions are introduced. In the oscillating beam case, SDecGMCA suppresses the spurious spectral peak at $k_\nu \sim 0.3$ and achieves $\lesssim 5\%$ accuracy at intermediate angular scales ($10 &lt; \ell &lt; 200$), outperforming other methods. Beam inversion, however, remains intrinsically unstable beyond $\ell \sim 200$, setting a practical limit on the method.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stray Light Correction for the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager</a><span class="id">[2511.13348]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report a point spread function (PSF) and deconvolution procedure to remove stray light from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data. Pre-launch calibration observations, post-launch Venus transit and lunar transit data were used to develop the PSF and evaluate how well it reproduced the observed scattering. The PSF reported differs from previous stray light removal efforts since we do not use Gaussians as the central mathematical component. Instead, we use a Lorenztian convolved with an Airy function. In 2018, the HMI team began providing full-disk, stray-light-corrected data daily. Intensity, Doppler, magnetogram, and vector magnetic field data are provided. The deconvolution uses a Richardson-Lucy algorithm and takes less than one second per full-disk image. The results, on average, show decreases in umbral continuum intensity, a doubling of the granulation intensity contrast, increases in the total field strength, most notably in plage by $\sim$1.4–2.5 the original value, and a partial correction for the convective blueshift. Local helioseismology analyses using corrected data yield results that are consistent with those from uncorrected data, with only negligible differences, except in sunspot regions. The new data are found in JSOC with names similar to the original but with the qualifying term '$\_dcon$' or '$\_dconS$' appended, denoting whether the deconvolution was applied to the filtergrams or Stokes images. The HMI team recommends using the corrected data for improved visual clarity, more accurate irradiance reconstruction, better co-alignment with high-resolution data, reduced errors in tracking algorithms, and improved magnetic field strengths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Neutral Hydrogen Fraction from SKA Simulated Observation using a Double-Gaussian Decomposition Technique</a><span class="id">[2511.13370]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a unique phase in cosmic history, marked by the ionization of neutral hydrogen by the first luminous sources. The global neutral hydrogen fraction (x_HI) is a key observable for probing this era. This paper presents a novel, statistically robust method to extract the evolution of x_HI from the challenging noise-dominated data from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Data Challenge 3b. Our approach is based on a key physical insight: the pixel value distribution in SKA intensity maps is a mixture of signals from ionized and neutral regions. We model this distribution as a superposition of two Gaussian components-one fixed at zero representing noise and ionized bubbles, and a second, offset Gaussian tracing the neutral hydrogen signal. We perform this decomposition on data grouped into three redshift bins. The double-Gaussian model provides an excellent fit to the pixel histogram data. The derived x_HI values show a clear decreasing trend across the three redshift bins, consistent with a progressing reionization process. And the results are consistent with the provided simulation data. This method offers a powerful, model-independent, and fully interpretable way for measuring x_HI from 21 cm data, demonstrating significant potential for application to future SKA observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13374" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Unusual Velocity Field in a Sunspot Penumbra</a><span class="id">[2511.13374]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The photospheric Evershed flow is normally oriented radially outward, yet sometimes opposite velocities are observed not only in the chromosphere but also in the photospheric layers of the penumbra. We study the velocity field in a special case of an active region with two mature sunspots, where one of them formed several days later than the main one. Between the two spots, flux emergence is still ongoing influencing the velocity pattern. We observed the active region NOAA 12146 on August 24, 2014, with the GREGOR Fabry-Pérot Interferometer (GFPI) and the Blue Imaging Channel (BIC) of the GREGOR solar telescope at Observatorio del Teide on Tenerife. Context data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) complement the high-resolution data. In the penumbra of a newly formed spot, we observe opposite Doppler velocity streams of up to +-2 km/s very close to each other. These velocities extend beyond the outer penumbral boundary and cross also the polarity-inversion line. The properties of the magnetic field do not change significantly between these two streams. Although the magnetic field is almost horizontal, we do not detect large transversal velocities in horizontal flow maps obtained with the local correlation technique. The ongoing emergence of magnetic flux in an active region causes flows of opposite directions intruding the penumbra of a pre-existing sunspot.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Expansion Driven by Gravitational Particle Production: Toward a Complete Cosmological Scenario</a><span class="id">[2511.13392]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A dark-energy-free cosmological model ($\Omega_{DE} \equiv 0$) based on gravitationally induced adiabatic particle creation is proposed.

Building on the kNN statistics, we introduce a new field-level representation of discrete halo catalogues - NN distance maps. We employ this technique on the halo catalogues obtained from Quijote N-body simulation suites. By combining these maps with kNN-based summary statistics, we train a hybrid neural network to infer cosmological parameters, showing that the resulting constraints achieve state-of-the-art, if not the best, accuracy.

These frequency shifts ($\delta\nu$) were determined using a cross-correlation method and using the individual mode frequencies, obtained by fitting power spectra. Three stars were found to exhibit $\delta\nu$ larger than their associated errors ($\sigma_{\delta\nu}$) using both methods, while two more stars exhibited $\delta\nu&gt;\sigma_{\delta\nu}$ when the cross correlation was used and a further two stars exhibited $\delta\nu&gt;\sigma_{\delta\nu}$ when the fitted frequencies were used. When considering the whole sample of 20 stars, the amplitude of $\delta\nu$ showed no dependence on the large frequency separation and metallicity. However, $\delta\nu$ was observed to increase with rotation rate and effective temperature. Our sample contained a number of evolved subgiant stars, allowing us to expand the parameter space usually considered when comparing $\delta\nu$ with stellar parameters. While $\delta\nu$ was small for all of the evolved stars, one was found to have $\delta\nu&gt;\sigma_{\delta\nu}$, raising the possibility that these evolved stars may still exhibit variable magnetic activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic fields in the close neighborhood of LDN 328 core</a><span class="id">[2511.13427]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Linearly polarized dust emission traces the plane-of-sky magnetic field structure, thus allowing us to investigate the role of magnetic fields in the formation and evolution of cloud cores.

Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277–5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The bulk metal content of WASP-80 b from joint interior-atmosphere retrievals: Breaking degeneracies and exploring biases with panchromatic spectra</a><span class="id">[2511.13483]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>WASP-80 b is an unusually low-density exoplanet in tension with the metal-rich composition expected for a planet of its mass. We aim to derive precise constraints on WASP-80 b's bulk metal mass fraction, atmospheric composition, and thermal structure. We conducted a suite of retrievals using three approaches: traditional interior-only, atmosphere-only, and joint interior-atmosphere retrievals. We coupled the open-source models GASTLI and petitRADTRANS, which describe planetary structure and thermal evolution, and atmospheric chemistry and clouds, respectively. Our retrievals combine mass and age with panchromatic spectra from JWST and HST in both transmission (0.5-4 $\mu$m) and emission (1-12 $\mu$m) as observational constraints. We identify two fiducial scenarios. In the first, WASP-80 b has an internal temperature consistent with its age in the absence of external heating sources, and its atmosphere is in chemical equilibrium, with an atmospheric metallicity M/H = 2.75$^{+0.88}_{-0.56}$x solar, a bulk metal mass fraction $Z_{planet}=0.12\pm0.02$, and a core mass $M_{core}=3.49^{+3.49}_{-1.59} \ M_{\oplus}$. In the second scenario, WASP-80 b may be inflated by an additional heat source - possibly induced by magnetic fields - with an atmospheric metallicity M/H = 10.00$^{+8.20}_{-4.75}$x solar, $Z_{planet}=0.28\pm0.11$, and $M_{core}=31.8^{+21.3}_{-17.5} \ M_{\oplus}$. The super-solar M/H and sub-solar C/O ratios in both scenarios suggest late pebble or planetesimal accretion, while additional heating is required to reconcile the data with the more massive core predicted by the core accretion paradigm. In general, joint retrievals are inherently affected by a degeneracy between atmospheric chemistry and internal structure. Together with flexible cloud treatment and an unweighted likelihood, this leads to larger uncertainties in bulk and atmospheric compositions than previously claimed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Precision Multi-Period Analysis of the Ellipsoidal Variable Candidate TIC 470127886 from TESS Photometry</a><span class="id">[2511.13610]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first detailed photometric characterization of TIC 470127886, a previously unstudied multi-periodic variable star discovered in TESS photometry.

Lomb-Scargle analysis identifies three significant periods at 5.545, 5.801, and 8.874 days with amplitudes of 15,702, 12,772, and 12,670 ppm. The phase-folded light curve shows smooth, sinusoidal morphology consistent with ellipsoidal variation from tidal distortion in a close binary, with no eclipse features. A three-component sinusoidal model, appropriate for ellipsoidal variables, provides excellent fit quality. Validation tests confirm signal authenticity and persistence, and systematic checks verify no contamination from nearby stars (&gt;3 mag fainter). We classify TIC 470127886 as an ellipsoidal variable candidate with 0.70 confidence, with multi-period behavior suggesting additional variability mechanisms beyond tidal distortion.

Sample binaries with monotonic period variations are collected from the literature, together with well-determined binary parameters. Assuming the monotonic variations are responsible for any one of the MT, ML, and AML, their rates are calculated with the rates of change of period. After selecting crucial parameters using partial least-squares analysis, a parameter that exhibits the closest correlation with any one of the derived rates is further selected using partial regression plots. Moreover, power-law relationships are found for the discovered correlations. The properties of the sample binaries are also investigated by examining associations between binary parameters. In the systems with negative period variations, it is found that the rate of MT from more- to less-massive stars is a function of the primary radius; the AML rate is a function of the fill-out factor. In addition, the relationships between the mass ratio and stellar masses indicate that the ML rate relative to the MT rate decreases with increasing mass ratio below  0.46. Meanwhile, in the systems with positive variations, it is found that the rate of MT from less- to more-massive stars is a function of the luminosity ratio and/or mass ratio; the ML rate is a function of the secondary temperature. The discussion also addresses possible processes occurring in the sample binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13633" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi Messenger Study of GRB 221009A with VHE Gamma-ray and Neutrino Afterglow from a Gaussian Structured Jet</a><span class="id">[2511.13633]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent detections of very-high-energy (VHE; $\gtrsim 100$ GeV) emission from GRB afterglows, notably the unprecedented brightness of GRB 221009A observed by LHAASO, reveal emission components beyond the standard electron synchrotron model. Multi-TeV photons motivate synchrotron self-Compton and possibly hadronic contributions, while the non-detection of coincident neutrinos by IceCube/KM3NeT/GRAND200k constrains the microphysical parameters, jet kinetic energy and ambient medium density. We model the VHE afterglow of GRB 221009A with an external forward shock from a Gaussian structured jet in a uniform density medium. This angular structure reproduces the extreme TeV output at an off-axis angle but without demanding large energies as in a top-hat jet. We also compute the corresponding $p\gamma$ neutrino flux in the PeV-EeV energies and derive a time-integrated upper limit based on the effective areas of IceCube Gen2 and GRAND200k, providing the contributions of individual GRBs to the neutrino events. The predicted neutrino flux for GRB 221009A with model parameters inferred from multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution lies below the sensitivities of these detectors. Even under highly optimistic microphysical conditions, our correlation analysis infers that the events from this GRB are of order $\sim 0.1$ for upcoming GRAND200k. We also compare neutrino fluxes for on-axis and off-axis viewing geometries and find that jet orientation alone can introduce nearly an order of magnitude variation in the signal. Thus, our studies imply that a GRB both brighter and closer than GRB 221009A would be crucial for any neutrino detections by upcoming neutrino telescopes. Future GRB detections by the CTA will provide important constraints on their geometry, radiation mechanisms, and any potential associated neutrino signals.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A model-independent assessment of the late-time dark energy density evolution</a><span class="id">[2511.13666]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Combined measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), have recently challenged the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm, indicating potential evidence for a dynamical dark energy component. These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $\Lambda$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $\Lambda$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts.

To take advantage of this statistical sample, we implement a scalable hierarchical inference tool which computes the cosmological likelihood for hundreds of strong lenses simultaneously. With this new technique, we investigate the cosmological constraining power from a simulation of the full LSST sample.

We present and analyse the detailed physical properties of six binary stellar systems, originally proposed as possible star-black hole binaries on the basis of radial velocities from Gaia's third data release, but soon recognised as likely post-mass-transfer binary systems with stripped companions. Methods. We used multi-epoch high-resolution FEROS spectra and spectral disentangling paired with stellar templates to derive effective temperatures, $T_\mathrm{eff}$; stellar radii, R*; and projected rotational velocities, v$\sin{i}$ for both components in all systems along with the mass ratio, q = $M_\mathrm{accretor}/M_\mathrm{donor}$ and the components' flux ratio as a function of wavelength. Results. Our analysis directly confirms that all systems are post-mass-transfer binaries with two luminous stars, i.e. no black hole companions. Each system contains an A-type accretor component that is rapidly rotating and a cooler very low-mass donor (  0.25M$\odot$) that is overluminous. Five of the systems show no trace of any emission lines, implying that there is no current mass transfer, consistent with our inferred radii, in all cases within the Roche volume. The data are generally consistent with stable case AB mass transfer with $\beta$ (the fraction of mass lost from the accretor) less than 0.7. While the accretor components rotate rapidly, they rotate well below the critical rotation rate, $v_\mathrm{crit}$, even though there must have been enough mass transfer to spin them up to a significant fraction of $v_\mathrm{crit}$, according to theoretical models of angular momentum transfer. As neither magnetic braking nor tidal synchronisation should have been effective in spinning down the stars, our results suggest that either mass accretion does not increase the angular momentum of the accretors to their critical values or the systems never reached these values in the first place.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13716" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Flares in the TESS Light Curves of Planet-hosting M dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2511.13716]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>M dwarfs are magnetically active stars that frequently produce flares, which have implications for both stellar evolution and exoplanet studies. Flare occurrence rates and activity levels of M dwarfs correlate with stellar characteristics such as age, mass, and rotation period. We search TESS observations of a known active population of M dwarfs as well as a volume-limited sample of M dwarfs within 15 parsecs. We detect flares in the light curves of these stars, including 276 of 538 M dwarfs within 15 pc, and calculate cumulative flare frequency distributions (FFDs) for each star. Based on flaring behavior, we categorize stars into relatively higher and lower activity groups and fit power laws to their FFDs to compare the power law exponent ($\alpha$) across activity levels. We find $\alpha =1.99 \pm 0.07$ for the combined FFD of the lower activity M dwarfs, compared to averages of $\alpha = 1.94 \pm 0.58$ for highly active stars with 10-100 detected flares, and $\alpha = 2.03 \pm 0.43$ for those with &gt; 100 detected flares, suggesting little evolution in the power law distribution of flares as M dwarfs transition from high to low activity states. The uncertainties for the active star groups reflect the standard deviation of $\alpha$ values across individual stars within each subset. Because stellar flares and associated stellar activity complicate exoplanet observations, we also examine the subset of M dwarfs with JWST transmission spectroscopy follow-up observations in Cycles 1-3. The flares we detect for these targets are consistent with the broader 15 pc sample, providing context for interpreting planetary atmosphere retrievals from JWST spectra.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11582" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Bayesian inference considerations and other issues concerning Drake's equation of Astrosociobiology</a><span class="id">[2511.11582]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Speculation about the existence of advanced forms of life in the Universe and in our galaxy, has been since ever a subject of fascination and discussion in fiction, as well as in astrophysics, biology and philosophy. The well-known Fermi's 1950s challenge, &quot;Where are the aliens?&quot; has acquired more substance with the realisation of the potentialities of radioastronomy, which led to the paradigmatic Drake's equation. The emergence of astrobiology, together with the discovery up to now of more than seven thousand exoplanets, has brought increasing support to the discussion about putative life cradles. However, after more than six decades, the only quantitative tool available to estimate how widespread is life and, in particular, advanced forms of life, is, besides direct searches, which so far provided no evidence, still Drake's equation. In the present work we review the current knowledge about this equation and present new arguments of multiple origin in order to evaluate one of its most critical terms, namely the one associated to the time span that a technological civilisation must search for detectable signs of the existence and for how long a search must be extended to bear fruits. We propose that this term should be replaced by a more specific one which involves critical parameters in the enterprise of gathering information, such as energy expenditure, searching area and entropy generation. These terms can be regarded as the capability that any cosmic civilisation must show in order to face the challenge of going beyond the climate and other crises that its development inevitably ensues. Our considerations suggest that a typical time span is about a couple of decades, meaning that a successful and systematic searching programme around about hundred stars might take around a few thousand years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Holes Surrounded by a Cloud of Strings</a><span class="id">[2511.11792]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In a recent study [1], authors introduced a new class of exact space-times in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external uniform magnetic field that is oriented along the rotational axis.

Using a comprehensive parameter-estimation campaign, we benchmark the test against Gaussian noise fluctuations, waveform modeling systematics, and physical effects such as spin precession and orbital eccentricity. When applied to numerical-relativity simulations, the SMA test performs reliably for aligned-spin and mildly precessing systems but exhibits measurable biases for strongly precessing or eccentric binaries. Although designed to detect amplitude deviations, the test also responds coherently to phase perturbations, yielding apparent GR violations when applied to phase-modified waveforms. Applied to recent GW detections, we report the strongest constraint on the hexadecapolar (4,4) mode amplitude deviation, $\delta A_{44} = -0.30^{+1.16}_{-3.45}$, consistent with GR.

While eccentric binaries with aligned spins are well studied, closed form post Newtonian (PN) expressions that simultaneously include eccentricity and precessing spin effects have remained unavailable. Eccentricity complicates orbital evolution because solving the coupled differential equations typically requires numerical integration, which slows down the generation of waveforms. We exploit the separation of timescales between orbital motion, spin precession, and radiation reaction, applying the precession averaging method of Morras et al. (2025) to remove explicit time dependence from the spin orbit and spin spin dynamics through the second PN order. Using this framework, we derive analytic phasing formulae from the evolution equations for orbital frequency and eccentricity, treating eccentricity as a small parameter. Closed form solutions for the eccentricity evolution and GW phase are obtained up to eighth order in the initial eccentricity. We also generalize the TaylorT2 approximant to include spin precession effects and compute the orbital phase in both time and frequency domains. To improve accuracy for moderate to high initial eccentricities, we perform a resummation of the TaylorT2 phasing. These results offer efficient, closed form phasing expressions that capture the coupled dynamics of eccentricity and precession, enabling more accurate and computationally tractable GW waveform modeling for data analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12244" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quintessence: Quadratic potentials</a><span class="id">[2511.12244]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Arguably one can use a canonical scalar field $\varphi$, minimally coupled to gravity, with quadratic potentials $V = \Lambda \pm \frac12 m^2\varphi^2$ to explore some general features of slow-roll and hilltop thawing quintessence, respectively.

In particular, the composition of the matter that composes neutron stars is under theoretical and experimental investigation. Among the theories that have been proposed, apart from the classical one where the composition is dominated by hadrons, the existence or coexistence of deconfined quark matter is a dominant guess. An approach towards this solution is the phenomenological view according to which the existence of quarkyonic matter plays a dominant role in the construction of the equation of state (EOS). According to it the structure of the EOS is based on the existence of the quarkyonic particle which is a hybrid state of a particle that combines properties of hadronic and quark matter with a corresponding representation in momentum space. In this paper we propose a phenomenological model for hot quarkyonic matter, borrowed from corresponding applications in hadronic models, where the interaction in the quarkyonic matter depends not only on the position but also on the momentum of the quarkyonic particles. This consideration, as we demonstrate, can have a remarkable consequence on the shape of the EOS and thus on the properties of neutron stars, especially in those for which the effect of temperature is significant, offering a sufficiently flexible model. Comparison with recent observational data can place constraints on the parameterization of the particular model and help improve its reliability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13051" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chiral Magnetic Effect induced Spectator Process for Leptogenesis</a><span class="id">[2511.13051]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Conventional Leptogenesis mechanism, which provides compelling explanation to the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU), assumes the absence of hypermagnetic field in the early universe, thereby disregard the implications of hyper gauge field helicity, that have been thoroughly studied in the magnetogenesis mechanism.

Notably, CME in the $U(1)_{\mathbf{L}_i-\mathbf{L}_j}$ framework, where $\mathbf{L}_{i,j}$ means specific lepton flavor, explicitly breaks the total lepton number and provides an efficient spectator process, that can wash out pre-existing lepton asymmetries.

We find that the inclusion of higher-order gravitational wave modes is critical; their exclusion may degrade the signal-to-noise ratio by factors of $\sim3-5$ relative to quadrupole-only templates. With optimal mode inclusion, SSM-IMRIs are observable out to luminosity distances of $\sim575$ Mpc ($z\sim0.12$) with Advanced LIGO and $\sim10.5$ Gpc ($z\sim1.4$) with the Einstein Telescope. However, we identify substantial systematic uncertainties in current phenomenological approximants. Matches between \textsc{IMRPhenomX} and the reference surrogate model \textsc{BHPTNRSur1dq1e4} degrade to values as low as 0.2 for edge-on inclinations, and fitting factors consistently fall below 0.9, indicating a significant loss of effectualness in template-bank searches.

In BUG the relative volume element $\nu=\sqrt{1-2BX}$ is fixed, enforcing a kinematic constraint on the biscalar and we derive the &quot;bimodular cosmological constant&quot; $\Lambda=\lambda_1+\nu\lambda_2$. In BHT/BDUG, $\lambda_{1,2}$ are individually constant but $\nu$ (hence $BX$) remains dynamical. Recasting the theory in an Einstein-frame form, we derive the biscalar sound speed and identify a subluminal domain $1+B(V+\lambda_2)&gt;0$. At the background level, BUG admits constant-roll solutions governed by first-order flow, whereas BHT supports solutions with time-dependent roll. These structural differences yield distinct, in-principle testable predictions for the expansion history, the dark-energy equation of state, and the propagation of biscalar perturbations. Finally, we present a diffeomorphism-invariant completion that correlates the two HT volume forms, reproducing the $\Lambda$ of BUG on shell whilst maintaining full covariance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13642" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational–Electromagnetic Coupling on Kerr Spacetime</a><span class="id">[2511.13642]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extend previous metric-based Schwarzschild studies of gravitational–electromagnetic (GEM) coupling to rotating black holes by working directly in a curvature-based Newman–Penrose/Teukolsky framework on Kerr spacetime.

In this paper, we estimate the redshift by the photometric dropout technique for a sample of 64 blazars (59 BL Lacs and five blazar candidates of uncertain type). Two telescopes are utilized to observe the sample. The Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) on board {\it Swift} ({\it Swift}/UVOT) observes sources in $uvw2,\ uvm2,\ uvw1,\ u,\ b,\ v$ filters, while the ground-based telescopes SARA-CT/RM observed sources in $g',\ r,' \ i',\ z'$ filters.

Previous 1D studies predict that when a condensible tracer exceeds a critical mixing ratio in H$_2$-rich atmospheres, convection is inhibited leading to the formation of radiative layers where the temperature decreases faster with height than in convective profiles. We use 3D convection-resolving simulations to test whether convection is inhibited in H$_2$-rich atmospheres when the tracer mixing ratio exceeds the critical threshold, while including processes neglected in 1D, e.g. turbulent mixing and evaporation. We run two sets of simulations. First, we perform simulations initialized on saturated isothermal states and find that compositional gradients can destabilize isothermal atmospheres. Second, we perform simulations initialized on adiabatic profiles which show distinct, stable inhibition layers form when the condensable tracer exceeds the critical threshold. Within the inhibition layer, only a small amount of energy is carried by latent heat flux, and turbulent mixing transports a small amount of tracer upwards, but both are generally too weak to sustain substantial tracer or heat transport. The thermal profile gradually relaxes to a steep radiative state, but radiative relaxation timescales are long. Our results suggest stable layers driven by condensation-induced convective inhibition form in H$_2$-rich atmospheres, including those of sub-Neptune exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultrahigh-Energy Gamma-ray Emission Associated with Black Hole-Jet Systems</a><span class="id">[2410.08988]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Black holes (BH), one of the most intriguing objects in the universe, can manifest themselves through electromagnetic radiation initiated by the accretion flow.

Here we report detection of four microquasars (SS 433, V4641 Sgr, GRS 1915+105, MAXI J1820+070) of spectrum extending to the ultrahigh-energy (UHE; photon energy $E&gt;100$ TeV) band and one microquasar (Cygnus X-1) of spectrum approaching 100 TeV, using the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Notably, the total emission associated with SS 433 cannot be interpreted with a single leptonic component. In the UHE band, its emission is in spatial coincidence with a giant atomic cloud, which is consistent with a hadronic origin. An elongated source is discovered from V4641 Sgr with the spectrum continuing up to 800 TeV.

We need to understand the origin of these results which were not predicted by our early theories of the pulsar magnetosphere. In order to gain new intuition on this problem, we set out to obtain the theoretical steady-state solution of the 3D ideal force-free magnetosphere with zero dissipation along the separatrix and equatorial current sheets. In order to achieve our goal, we needed to develop a novel numerical method. We solve two independent magnetospheric problems without current sheet discontinuities in the domains of open and closed field lines, and adjust the shape of their interface (the separatrix) to satisfy pressure balance between the two regions. The solution is obtained with meshless Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). In this paper we present our first results for an inclined dipole rotator using the new methodology. We are able to zoom-in around the Y-point and inside the closed-line region, and we observe new interesting features. This is the first time the steady-state 3D problem is addressed directly, and not through a time-dependent simulation that eventually relaxes to a steady-state.

However, a statistical set of small planets with measured masses and radii can be used to test the planet formation theory prediction of large water reservoirs on sub-Neptunes. Here, we investigate whether water is included in photoevaporative mass loss and how much can partition into the rocky and metallic interior. We couple the result of a planetary formation model to evolution models which assume perfect mixing of water with H/He in the envelope or a layered structure. For the mixed envelopes, we also include fractionation during photoevaporative mass-loss. Further, the effect of equilibrium dissolution of water into an assumed magma ocean and into the metallic core is studied for the first time in coupled formation-evolution models. Out of the four tested scenarios, the mass-radius relation of exoplanets is relatively well matched by all scenarios except the one with layered H/He above water. The agreement depends on mass, with better consistency for the model without dissolution below 3 Earth masses and hints of the opposite at higher masses. In contrast to the significant effect of water dissolution, fractionation is not found to alter the properties of the planets for our initial conditions due to initially massive envelopes on all planets. For all scenarios, we quantify the radius valley location and scaling with stellar mass and conclude that water-rich sub-Neptunes mass-radius relations are broadly consistent with observations. Statistical surveys in mass and radius are required for distinction of the scenarios. The dissolution of different volatiles into the planetary interior and solidification of the magma ocean are natural next steps toward a comprehensive treatment of atmosphere-interior interaction in planet evolution models.

Numerous methods have been developed to reconstruct the density and velocity fields at $z \lesssim 0.05$, typically constrained by redshift-space galaxy positions or by direct distance tracers such as the Tully-Fisher relation, the fundamental plane, or Type Ia supernovae. We introduce a validation framework to evaluate the accuracy of these reconstructions against catalogues of direct distance tracers. Our framework assesses the goodness-of-fit of each reconstruction using Bayesian evidence, residual redshift discrepancies, velocity scaling, and the need for external bulk flows. Applying this framework to a suite of reconstructions – including those derived from the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm and from linear theory – we find that the non-linear BORG reconstruction consistently outperforms others. We highlight the utility of such a comparative approach for supernova or gravitational wave cosmological studies, where selecting an optimal peculiar velocity model is essential. Additionally, we present calibrated bulk flow curves predicted by the reconstructions and perform a density–velocity cross-correlation using a linear theory reconstruction to constrain the growth factor, yielding $S_8 = 0.793 \pm 0.035$.

The coherent component of the peculiar motion is usually corrected for using velocity field reconstruction based on the observed galaxy distribution, while the random component is treated statistically by inflating the magnitude uncertainty in the quadrature derived using the standard error propagation. The method of velocity field reconstruction requires assuming an underlying cosmology, which can introduce its own bias in the final inference. On the other hand, the statistical treatment of the random component assumes a locally linear approximation for the magnitude-redshift relation and a Gaussian distribution for the peculiar velocities, which can have extended tails in the non-linear regime. In this work, we present a Bayesian estimator for simultaneously correcting for peculiar motion while fitting a cosmological model to the supernova data, relaxing the assumption of linearity of the model and Gaussianity of the random peculiar motion. Our approach is based on considering the problem of fitting the magnitude-redshift relation as a non-linear model with errors in both dependent and independent variables. To this end, we develop a general method for fitting such non-linear errors-in-variables models. We then specialize it to the case of fitting the magnitude-redshift relation, validating it with simulated datasets at the precision of current and upcoming surveys, and testing it on the Pantheon sample. Our method provides an alternative approach for accounting for the peculiar velocity effects, which is a complementary method for the coherent component, as it does not require independent velocity measurements, and generalizes the treatment of the random component. Moreover, our general method is applicable to various other problems in cosmology and astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Precision cross-sections for advancing cosmic-ray physics and other applications: a comprehensive programme for the next decade</a><span class="id">[2503.16173]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic-ray physics in the GeV-to-TeV energy range has entered a precision era thanks to recent data from space-based experiments. However, the poor knowledge of nuclear reactions, in particular for the production of antimatter and secondary nuclei, limits the information that can be extracted from these data, such as source properties, transport in the Galaxy and indirect searches for particle dark matter. The Cross-Section for Cosmic Rays at CERN workshop series has addressed the challenges encountered in the interpretation of high-precision cosmic-ray data, with the goal of strengthening emergent synergies and taking advantage of the complementarity and know-how in different communities, from theoretical and experimental astroparticle physics to high-energy and nuclear physics. In this paper, we present the outcomes of the third edition of the workshop that took place in 2024. We present the current state of cosmic-ray experiments and their perspectives, and provide a detailed road map to close the most urgent gaps in cross-section data, in order to efficiently progress on many open physics cases, which are motivated in the paper. Finally, with the aim of being as exhaustive as possible, this report touches several other fields – such as cosmogenic studies, space radiation protection and hadrontherapy – where overlapping and specific new cross-section measurements, as well as nuclear code improvement and benchmarking efforts, are also needed. We also briefly highlight further synergies between astroparticle and high-energy physics on the question of cross-sections.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A possible correction of the Saha curve for non-equilibrium states</a><span class="id">[2505.08972]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is widely known that the Saha equation is not suitable for describing plasmas out of thermodynamic equilibrium. The primordial hydrogen recombination plasma is an example of this. In this work, we propose a theoretical modification to the standard Saha curve motivated by Tsallis statistics. In particular, we explore the possibility that a time-dependent $q$-parameter may serve as an effective proxy for the evolving thermodynamic conditions during recombination, especially considering that hydrogen recombination occurs from excited states. Within this framework, the $q$-parameter could be interpreted as encoding departures from equilibrium and could play the role of effective time-dependent temperature. This indicates that the time evolution of the $q$-parameter could provide a phenomenological mechanism for incorporating non-equilibrium effects into the recombination history. Our findings suggest that the Tsallis parameterization provides an alternative path to fit the distribution of free electrons by using an effective temperature. The implications of this approach might go beyond its immediate applications, as the Saha equation is widely used in various scientific fields like astrophysics, cosmology, plasma physics, and condensed matter physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Displacement of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray source images by the intergalactic magnetic field: the cases of Cen A and M83</a><span class="id">[2505.14344]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The standard assumption about the influence of the turbulent intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) on the images of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) sources is that the latter are formed in a random walk mode in the deflection angle. As a result, the images are symmetrically broadened to angular scales proportional to the IGMF strength and the square root of its correlation length. We demonstrate that when the size of the emitting region is smaller than the correlation length of the IGMF, a new focusing regime emerges. In this regime, significant deviations from the standard random walk approximation occur even when the distance between the source and the observer exceeds several tens of IGMF correlation lengths. The angular size of the resulting images is typically smaller than predicted by random walk, and the IGMF causes a systematic shift of the entire image away from the true source direction. This introduces additional uncertainty in the search for UHECR sources. We show that the excess observed by Pierre Auger Observatory in the direction of Cen A can be explained by the contribution of M83, provided that the image shift occurs as predicted by some models of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) and that the IGMF plays a minor role due to its low strength and short coherence length. Alternatively, Cen A may indeed be the true source of the excess, as certain realizations of the IGMF can compensate the deflection caused by the GMF.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self-Interacting Dark-Matter Spikes and the Final-Parsec Problem: Bayesian constraints from the NANOGrav 15-Year Gravitational-Wave Background</a><span class="id">[2506.18153]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing ”final-parsec problem”. Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15-year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The fate of Quasi-Exponential inflation in the light of ACT-DR6</a><span class="id">[2506.20744]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have revisited quasi-exponential model of inflation in the light of recent ACT-DR6 and Planck data along with latest constraint on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves.

Not only that, amount of primordial gravitational waves is also within the present observational bound, $r&lt;0.032$. In addition to that, when the combination of ACT-DR6 and Planck joint with BICEP/Keck 2018 data is taken into account inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model are in excellent agreement. The model also yields sublime fit to the result of joint analysis of ACT-DR6, Planck joint with BICEP/Keck 2018 and DESI-Y1 data. The futuristic CMB missions LiteBIRD, Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 are promising to detect primordial gravitational waves if $r\geq0.003$. We have also forecasted inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model of inflation assuming the sensitivities of LiteBIRD, Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 along with combination of LiteBIRD and CMB-S4. We found that in each case quasi-exponential inflation may render excellent fit provided $r\geq10^{-2}$.

To ensure model independence, we adopt three redshift binning schemes (n=3, 4, 5) and three polynomial interpolation schemes with the same number of nodes (n=3, 4, 5). Our main conclusions are as follows: 1) After taking into account DESI data, there is a trend that DE should evolve with redshift (with deviations from the cosmological constant reaching at least a $2.13\sigma$ confidence level), indicating that current observations favor a dynamical DE. 2) In the redshift range $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$, the DE EoS w(z) exhibits a decreasing trend and crosses the phantom divide $w=-1$, suggesting quintom-like behavior. 3) The DE density f(z) first increases at low redshift, reaching a hump around $z\approx 0.5$, and then decreases at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$, with a rapid decrease at $z&gt;1.0$. 4) For $z &gt; 1.5$, current data are insufficient to place strong constraints on the evolution of DE, resulting in large uncertainties in the DE reconstruction. It must be emphasized that, these four main conclusions are independent of specific reconstruction models, and are insensitive to the choice of SN compilations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00753" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asteroids fail to retain cometary impact signatures</a><span class="id">[2507.00753]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A bombardment of comets is thought to have occurred in the inner solar system as a result of a dynamical instability among the giant planets after gas disk dispersal. Vesta, the second largest asteroid in the main asteroid belt, likely differentiated before gas disk dispersal, implying its crust witnessed the cometary bombardment. The composition of HED meteorites, which represent fragments of Vesta's crust, could therefore have been altered by cometary impacts. Here we combine noble gas mass spectrometry measurements, N-body simulations, collision rate calculations, and impact simulations to estimate the cometary contribution to Vesta. While our dynamical simulations indicate that Vesta likely underwent a significant number of collisions with large comets, we find no xenon cometary signature in HED meteorites. This apparent contradiction arises due to the fact that cometary impacts were at high speeds and Vesta's weak gravitational attraction made it incapable of retaining cometary material. Smaller asteroids are even less likely to retain such material. Therefore, if a cometary xenon signature is ever detected in an asteroid belt object, it must have been acquired during formation, within the same source region as comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and have been implanted later into the asteroid belt.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruling Out Dark Energy Model induced by de-Sitter Regions of Non-Singular Black Holes with Planck2018, DESI BAO, and Union3 Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2507.03408]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark energy(DE) remains one of the most important subjects in modern cosmology, and its physical origin is still under intensive discussion. While an astrophysical origin of DE is a highly challenging scenario, black holes stand out the most promising candidates as the astrophysical origin. In this paper, we explore a new model of DE induced by black holes, in which cosmic accelerated expansion caused by de-Sitter like space-time regions around the non-singular black holes. It is difficult to examine such a phenomena by measuring black hole mass because the energy density of the cosmological constant is much smaller than the mass density of a black hole near a black hole. On the other hand, this modification becomes dominant on the cosmological scale. Therefore, we focus on the cosmological probes and perform the MCMC analysis using Planck2018+DESI DR2+Supernovae. Since the total amount of DE density depends on the contributions of all black holes, we use the simulated results for the evolution of the number of black holes. As a result, we obtain the best-fitted total chi-squared value, $\chi_\mathrm{total}^2 = 2871.13$ compared to $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ case $\chi_\mathrm{total, \, \Lambda CDM}^2 = 2819.00$, and $\Delta \chi^2 \sim 50$.

We map the outflows into the FLASH hydrodynamics code to model their expansion in axisymmetry, and study the effects of employing different $r$-process heating rates. Except for the highest heating rate prescription, we find no significant differences with respect to overall ejecta dynamics and morphology compared to the simulation without heating. Once homologous expansion is attained, typically after $\sim$ 2s for these ejecta, we map the outflows to the Sedona radiative transfer code and compute the spectral evolution of the kilonova and broadband light curves in various Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) bands. The kilonova properties depend on the remnant lifetime, with peak luminosities and peak timescales increasing for longer-lived remnants that produce more massive ejecta. For all models, there is a strong dependence of both the bolometric and broadband light curves on the viewing angle. While the short-lived (12ms) remnant produces higher luminosities when viewed from angles closer to the pole, longer-lived remnants (240ms and 2.5s) are more luminous when viewed from angles closer to the equator. Our results highlight the importance of self-consistent, long-term modeling of merger ejecta, and taking viewing-angle dependence into account when interpreting observed kilonova light curves. We find that magnetized outflows from a HMNS – if it survives long enough – could explain blue kilonovae, such as the blue emission seen in AT2017gfo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15435" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Observations of a Candidate Redback Millisecond Pulsar: 1FGL J0523.5-2529</a><span class="id">[2508.15435]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Redback pulsars are a subclass of millisecond pulsar system with a low-mass non-degenerate companion star being ablated by the pulsar. They are of interest due to the insights they can provide for late-stage pulsar evolution during the recycling process. J0523.5-2529 is one such candidate where redback-like emission has been seen at multiple wavelengths except radio. It is a system with a binary orbit of 16.5 hours and a low-mass non-degenerate companion of approximately 0.8 solar masses. The aim of this work was to conduct follow-up radio observations to search for any exhibited radio pulsar emission from J0523.5-2529. This work employs a periodicity and single burst search across 74 percent of the system's orbital phase using a total of 34.5 hours of observations. Observations were carried out using the Murriyang Telescope at Parkes and the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Despite extensive orbital phase coverage, no periodic or single-pulse radio emission was detected above a signal-to-noise threshold of 7. A comprehensive search for radio pulsations from J0523.5-2529 using Parkes and GBT yielded no significant emission, likely due to intrinsic faintness, scattering, or eclipses by the companion's outflow. The results demonstrate the elusiveness of the pulsar component in some redback systems and highlight the need for multi-wavelength follow-up and higher-frequency radio observations to constrain the source nature and binary dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No evidence for local $H_0$ anisotropy from Tully–Fisher or supernova distances</a><span class="id">[2509.14997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Claims of local ($z \lesssim 0.05$) anisotropy in the Hubble constant have been made based on direct distance tracers such as Tully-Fisher galaxies and Type Ia supernovae. We revisit these using the CosmicFlows-4 Tully-Fisher W1 subsample, 2MTF and SFI++ Tully-Fisher catalogues, and the Pantheon+ supernova compilation (all restricted to $z &lt; 0.05$), including a dipole in either the Tully-Fisher zero-point or the standardised supernova absolute magnitude. Our forward-modelling framework jointly calibrates the distance relation, marginalises over distances, and accounts for peculiar velocities using a linear-theory reconstruction. We compare the anisotropic and isotropic model using the Bayesian evidence. In the CosmicFlows-4 sample, we infer a zero-point dipole of amplitude $0.087 \pm 0.019$ mag, or $4.1\pm0.9$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. This is consistent with previous estimates but at higher significance: model comparison yields odds of $877:1$ in favour of including the zero-point dipole. In Pantheon+ we infer zero-point dipole amplitude of $0.049 \pm 0.013$ mag, or $2.3\pm 0.6$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. However, by allowing for a radially varying velocity dipole, we show that the anisotropic zero-point model captures local flow features (or possibly systematics) in the data rather than an actual linearly growing effective bulk flow caused by anisotropy in the zero-point or expansion rate. Crucially, inferring a more general bulk flow curve we find results fully consistent with expectations from the standard cosmological model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17102" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayesian Framework for the E1 and E2 Astrophysical Factors at 300 keV from Subthreshold and Ground-State Asymptotic Normalization Coefficients</a><span class="id">[2509.17102]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction governs the carbon-to-oxygen ratio set during helium burning, shaping white-dwarf structure and Type Ia supernova yields.

In this work, we connected dust drift and coagulation, planetesimal formation, N-body gravity, pebble accretion, planet migration, planetary core accretion, gap opening, and internal photoevaporation in one modeling framework. We demonstrate that multiple classes of minor planets, or planetesimals, can form during disk dissipation and remain afterwards, including a scattered group, a resonant group, and a dynamically cold group. Significant growth by pebble accretion was prevented by both dynamical heating due to the giant planet in the system and rapid dispersal of the disk toward the end of its lifetime. We also conducted a parameter study which showed that this is not a universal case, where the outcome is determined by the competition for dust between planetesimal formation and pebble accretion. Combining this scenario with sequential planet formation, this model provides a promising pathway toward an outer solar system formation model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Evidence for Extragalactic Einstein Probe Transients associated with Long Gamma-ray Bursts</a><span class="id">[2510.10267]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of extragalactic fast X-ray transients (EFXTs) remains a fundamental open question in high-energy astrophysics.

Currently, estimates of the power generated by SPMI primarily rely on analytical scaling laws that relate stellar and planetary parameters to the interaction energetics. The existing scaling laws published in the literature so far do not agree with each other by at least an order of magnitude. Our aim is to quantify an absolute upper limit on the power that a planet can channel back to its host star during such interactions, which in turn lead to the formation of stellar hotspots. By performing a series of 3D MHD simulations with varied parameters known to influence the energetics of SPMI, we derive a numerically supported scaling law that can be used to reliably estimate the energy channeled from the planet back to the star. Our results suggest that existing analytical scaling laws may not fully capture the power transferred from the planet to the star through SPMI. The scaling law derived from our numerical simulations appears to provide a more comprehensive estimate, reflecting dependencies on common stellar and planetary parameters also considered in earlier models. Moreover, our findings indicate that power generation involves not only the planetary obstacle itself but also the extended magnetic structure of the Alfven wings interacting with the streaming stellar wind. This study suggests that care should be taken when applying analogies directly from jovian sub-Alfvenic interactions to SPMI, as the underlying physical conditions (specifically the value of the Alfvenic Mach number) may not be directly comparable. Our numerically derived scaling law offers a potentially improved approach for estimating SPMI power, capturing some of the interaction's complexities exclusive to SPMI.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">94.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01820" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards a unified hadron-quark equation of state for neutron stars within the relativistic mean-field model</a><span class="id">[2511.01820]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The equation of state of dense matter remains a central challenge in astrophysics and high-energy physics, particularly at supra-nuclear densities where exotic degrees of freedom like hyperons or deconfined quarks are expected to appear. Neutron stars provide a unique natural laboratory to probe this regime. In this work, we present EVA–01, a novel equation of state that provides a unified description of dense matter by incorporating both hadron and quark degrees of freedom within a single relativistic mean-field Lagrangian, from which the equation of state is derived at finite temperature. The model extends the density-dependent formalism by introducing a Polyakov-loop-inspired scalar field to dynamically govern the hadron-quark phase transition, following the approach of chiral mean-field models. The resulting model is consistent with a wide range of theoretical and observational constraints, including those from chiral effective field theory, massive pulsars, gravitational-wave events, and NICER data. We analyze its thermodynamic properties by constructing the QCD phase diagram, identifying the deconfinement, chiral, and nuclear liquid-gas transitions.

Our findings establish EVA–01 as a robust and versatile framework for exploring dense matter, bridging the gap between microphysical models and multimessenger astrophysical observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">95.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new multiprobe analysis of modified gravity and evolving dark energy</a><span class="id">[2511.10616]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the $(w_0, \, w_a)$ parametrization of the dark energy (DE) equation of state, with and without the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE) framework to describe the DE perturbations, parametrized here by the braiding parameter $\alpha_B$ and the running of the Planck mass $\alpha_M$. We combine the EFTofLSS full-shape analysis of the power spectrum and bispectrum of BOSS data with the tomographic angular power spectra $C_\ell^{gg}$, $C_\ell^{\kappa g}$, $C_\ell^{Tg}$ and $C_\ell^{T\kappa}$, where $g$, $\kappa$ and $T$ stand for the DESI luminous red galaxy map, Planck PR4 lensing map and Planck PR4 temperature map, respectively. To analyze these angular power spectra, we go beyond the Limber approximation, allowing us to include large-scales data in $C_\ell^{gg}$. The combination of all these probes with Planck PR4, DESI DR2 BAO and DES Y5 improves the constraint on the 2D posterior distribution of $\{w_0, \, w_a\}$ by $\sim 50 \%$ and increases the preference for evolving dark energy over $\Lambda$ from $3.8 \sigma$ to $4.6 \sigma$. When we remove BAO and supernovae data, we obtain a hint for evolving dark energy at $2.3 \sigma$. Regarding the EFTofDE parameters, we improve the constraints on $\alpha_B$ and $\alpha_M$ by $\sim 40 \%$ and $50 \%$ respectively, finding results compatible with general relativity at $\sim 2 \sigma$.

Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) instruments will have a higher sensitivity and a smaller inner working angle than instruments up to now, which should allow more productive searches and detailed characterisation. We study the observability of accreting gas giants with METIS, the first-generation ELT spectrograph. We focus on the accretion-tracing hydrogen recombination lines accessible at a resolution R=1e5, mainly Brackett alpha and Pfund-series lines. Our approach is general but we take as a fiducial case. To calculate high-resolution line profiles, we combine a semianalytical multidimensional description of the flow onto an accreting planet and its circumplanetary disc (CPD) with local non-equilibrium shock-emission models. We assume the limiting scenario of no extinction appropriate for gas giants in gaps and negligible contribution from magnetospheric accretion columns. We use simulated detector sensitivities to compute required observing times. Both the planet surface and the CPD surface shocks contribute to the total line profile, which is non-Gaussian and much narrower than the free-fall velocity. For the adopted baseline accretion rate onto the Bra line peak is equal to the photospheric continuum modulated mostly by water features. However, the rotation of the planet broadens the features, helping the shock excess stand out. At Br a, already the continuum of should yield SNR=12 in 4 h. The peak excess should require only about 15 min to reach SNR=3. Br a is a potent planet formation tracer accessible to METIS in little integration time. Resolved line profiles will place independent constraints especially on the mass and radius of an accreting planet, and help identify the accretion mechanism(s) at work.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">97.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A 34.6-day transiting sub-Neptune in the TOI-1422 planetary system</a><span class="id">[2511.11492]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>TOI-1422 is a G2 V star ($V = 10.6$ mag) known to host a warm Neptune-sized planet, TOI-1422 b, with a mass and radius of about $9M_{\oplus}$ and $4R_{\oplus}$, on a circular orbit with a period of $12.997$ days. An outer planetary candidate in this system had previously been suggested on the basis of a residual signal in the radial velocity (RV) data with a tentative period of $\sim$29 days, along with a possible single transit-like event, although it was not clear at the time whether the two signals belonged to the same companion. In this work, we confirm the presence of a second transiting planet, TOI-1422 c, a sub-Neptune ($R=2.61\pm0.14 R_{\oplus}$) that orbits with a longer period of 34.563 days. This confirmation is based on the detection of three TESS transits, two from newly available sectors, combined with new and archival RV measurements. The sub-Neptune ($\rho_{\rm c}=4.3^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$ g cm$^{-3}$) is more massive than the inner Neptune ($\rho_{\rm b}=0.93^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$ g cm$^{-3}$), having a mass of $M_{\rm c}=14\pm3 M_{\oplus}$, making TOI-1422 a rare anti-ordered system. Furthermore, we detect transit timing variations (TTVs) on the inner planet, with amplitudes of up to 5 hours, suggesting ongoing dynamical interactions. A dynamical analysis that combined TTVs and RVs indicates that planet c alone is unlikely to account for the full TTV amplitude observed on TOI-1422 b. We investigated whether an additional, as yet undetected companion could account for the observed signal, exploring a range of plausible orbital configurations and finding that a low-mass planet located between the two known orbits may be responsible.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">98.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tests of General Relativity with GWTC-3</a><span class="id">[2112.06861]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ever-increasing number of detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binaries by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors allows us to perform ever-more sensitive tests of general relativity (GR) in the dynamical and strong-field regime of gravity. We perform a suite of tests of GR using the compact binary signals observed during the second half of the third observing run of those detectors. We restrict our analysis to the 15 confident signals that have false alarm rates $\leq 10^{-3}\, {\rm yr}^{-1}$. In addition to signals consistent with binary black hole (BH) mergers, the new events include GW200115_042309, a signal consistent with a neutron star–BH merger. We find the residual power, after subtracting the best fit waveform from the data for each event, to be consistent with the detector noise. Additionally, we find all the post-Newtonian deformation coefficients to be consistent with the predictions from GR, with an improvement by a factor of  2 in the -1PN parameter. We also find that the spin-induced quadrupole moments of the binary BH constituents are consistent with those of Kerr BHs in GR. We find no evidence for dispersion of GWs, non-GR modes of polarization, or post-merger echoes in the events that were analyzed. We update the bound on the mass of the graviton, at 90% credibility, to $m_g \leq 2.42 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{eV}/c^2$. The final mass and final spin as inferred from the pre-merger and post-merger parts of the waveform are consistent with each other. The studies of the properties of the remnant BHs, including deviations of the quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times, show consistency with the predictions of GR. In addition to considering signals individually, we also combine results from the catalog of GW signals to calculate more precise population constraints. We find no evidence in support of physics beyond GR.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">99.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complementarity between Cosmic String Gravitational Waves and long-lived particle searches in a laboratory</a><span class="id">[2501.03326]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic strings are powerful witnesses to cosmic events including any period of early matter domination.

In particular, we analyze the effects of quantum corrections on the quadratic potential of the spectator field given by its gravitational coupling to the Ricci scalar and the inflaton energy, so-called the Hubble-induced mass term. These quantum corrections create a minimum around which the potential is flatter and to which the spectator field is attracted. We demonstrate that this attractor dynamics can naturally generate the observed slightly red-tilted spectrum of curvature perturbations. Furthermore, focusing on a curvaton model with a quadratic vacuum potential, we compute the primordial non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ and derive a predictive relationship between $f_{\text{NL}}$ and the running of the scalar spectral index. This relationship serves as a testable signature of the model. Finally, we extend the idea to a broader class of models where the spectator field is an angular component of a complex scalar field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">101.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19880" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-interacting holographic dark energy with Torsion via Hubble Radius</a><span class="id">[2502.19880]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We reconstruct a holographic dark energy model within a Friedmann cosmology incorporating torsion scalar, assuming no interaction between dark energy and dark matter. Setting the Hubble radius as an infrared (IR) cut-off, we focus on a system dominated by contribution of a time-dependent torsion scalar induced by the spin of matter. In this regime, our results show that even very weak torsion causes cosmic acceleration. Specifically, we find that minima of the current equation of state for holographic dark energy, $(\omega_X^{0})_{min}$, lies in the range $-1 &lt; (\omega_X^{0})_{min} &lt; -0.778$ as a free parameter $d$ varies from $1$ to $0.654$. Focusing on the free parameter $d \approx 1$, we find that $(\omega_X^{0})_{min}$ exhibits slightly different behavior from the cosmological constant. Introducing torsion allows the Hubble radius to serve as a viable IR cut-off even without assuming the interaction between them. Moreover, this approach provides a non-interacting limit not found in earlier interacting models that use the Hubble radius as the IR cut-off.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">102.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korteweg-de Vries Integrals for Modified Black Hole Potentials: Instabilities and other Questions</a><span class="id">[2503.09918]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors are some of the most characteristic features of the dynamics of black holes (BHs) and represent the basis for a number of fundamental physics tests with gravitational wave observations.

Instabilities in the QNMs have been recently shown to appear in the BH pseudospectrum under certain circumstances. In this work, we give a novel point of view based on the existence of some recently discovered hidden symmetries in BH dynamics and the associated infinite series of conserved quantities, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals.

Intermediate- and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (I/EMRIs), with mass ratios $q \gtrsim 10^2$, are promising sources for future detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Modelling waveforms for these asymmetric-mass binaries is challenging, entailing the tracking of many harmonic modes over thousands to millions of cycles. The FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) modelling framework addresses this need, leveraging precomputation of mode data and interpolation to rapidly compute adiabatic waveforms for eccentric inspirals into zero-spin black holes. In this work, we extend FEW to model eccentric equatorial inspirals into black holes with spin magnitudes $|a| \leq 0.999$. Our model supports eccentricities $e &lt; 0.9$ and semi-latus recta $p &lt; 200$, enabling the generation of long-duration IMRI waveforms, and produces waveforms in $\sim 100$ ms with hardware acceleration. Characterising systematic errors, we estimate that our model attains mismatches of $\sim 10^{-5}$ (for LISA sensitivity) with respect to error-free adiabatic waveforms over most of parameter space. We find that kludge models introduce errors in signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as great as $^{+60\%}_{-40\%}$ and induce marginal biases of up to $\sim 1\sigma$ in parameter estimation. We show LISA's horizon redshift for I/EMRI signals varies significantly with $a$, reaching a redshift of $3$ ($15$) for EMRIs (IMRIs) with only minor $(\sim10\%)$ dependence on $e$ for an SNR threshold of 20. For signals with SNR $\sim 50$, spin and eccentricity-at-plunge are measured with uncertainties of $\delta a \sim 10^{-7}$ and $\delta e_f \sim 10^{-5}$. This work advances the state-of-the-art in waveform generation for asymmetric-mass binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">107.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modified Black Hole Potentials and Their Korteweg-de Vries Integrals: Instabilities and Beyond</a><span class="id">[2509.01500]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Black Hole (BH) Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) and Greybody Factors (GBFs) are key signatures of BH dynamics that are crucial for testing fundamental physics via gravitational waves.

Several dark energy scenarios are explored, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, and BA parameterizations, along with non-flat cosmologies allowing for spatial curvature ($\Omega_k \neq 0$). Our analysis supports a flat Universe with $\Omega_k \approx 0$. Using MCMC techniques, we constrain these models with observational data from DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, Type Ia supernovae, and compressed CMB likelihoods. The results provide strong statistical evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, favoring dynamical dark-energy behavior consistent with a Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$). We also derive upper bounds on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu$, using CMB + DESI DR2 data: $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.066~\mathrm{eV}$ for $\Lambda$CDM and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.075~\mathrm{eV}$ for $\omega$CDM. In the non-flat extensions, o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM, the limits relax to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.263~\mathrm{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.520~\mathrm{eV}$, respectively. For the other models $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE the constraints range between $&lt;0.043$ and $&lt;0.127~\mathrm{eV}$. The effective number of relativistic species remains consistent with the standard value, $N_{\mathrm{eff}} = 3.044$, across all models. Bayesian evidence further shows that combining DES-SN5Y or Union3 supernova samples with CMB + DESI DR2 produces measurable deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Although no model reaches the $5\sigma$ significance threshold, several exhibit tensions exceeding $3\sigma$, suggesting emerging cracks in the cosmological constant paradigm.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">109.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Importance of being nonminimally coupled: Scalar Hawking radiation from regular black holes</a><span class="id">[2510.12257]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In curved space-time, a scalar field $\phi$ is generically expected to couple to curvature, via a coupling of the form $\xi\phi^2R$. Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case $\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation. We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\xi$, the low-energy emission spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\xi fR&lt;0$ throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">110.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conserved Quantities in Expanding Gödel Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2511.00238]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>At linear order we study perturbations to a Gödel background spacetime which includes expansion in addition to rotation.

Using general relativistic radiative transfer, we compute synchrotron emission and polarization maps under different spins, MOG parameters, inclinations, and observing frequencies. In both models, the photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing $\alpha$, whereas frame dragging produces pronounced brightness asymmetry. The BAAF model predicts a narrower bright ring and distinct polarization morphology near the event horizon. By introducing the net polarization angle $\chi_{\text{net}}$ and the second Fourier mode $\angle\beta_2$, we quantify inclination- and frame-dragging-induced polarization features. Our results reveal that both $\alpha$ and spin significantly influence the near-horizon polarization patterns, suggesting that high-resolution polarimetric imaging could serve as a promising probe of modified gravity in the strong field regime.</p></div></details></article></body>
