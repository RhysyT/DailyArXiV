<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lorentz, Poincare, Einstein, and the Genesis of the Theory of Special Relativity</a><span class="id">[2510.17838]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work offers a historical reading of the genesis of special relativity by placing the contributions of Lorentz, Poincare, and Einstein within their scientific and editorial context. It highlights the importance of the German periodical Beiblatter zu den Annalen der Physik as a key channel for the dissemination of international scientific research. The perspective advanced here is that the true revolution did not lie in special relativity itself, but in Maxwell's electrodynamics. Special relativity thus appears as the necessary expression of a framework already transformed by the universality of the speed of light.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The simplest complexity: The story of the three-body problem</a><span class="id">[2510.18848]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This article offers a broad-brush account of the Newtonian three-body problem, from its origins with Newton to its vibrant present, emphasizing its enduring influence on theoretical physics. It unfolds through a series of self-contained episodes that illuminate the scientific fields and the paradigm shift that have grown out of this problem.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incomplete yet existent objects: a Nuclear Meinongian approach to quantum metaphysical indeterminacy</a><span class="id">[2510.18111]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This article proposes a reading of quantum metaphysical indeterminacy from the perspective of Parsons' Nuclear Meinongianism. In doing so, we identify a fundamental incompatibility between a key feature of Parsons' theory and standard quantum mechanics. Our approach interprets quantum indeterminacy as property incompleteness. However, this move, when combined with Parsons' framework, leads to what we term the “Incompleteness-Entails-Nonexistence Principle” (IENP), which implausibly entails the nonexistence of quantum objects. For Meinongianism to be a suitable tool for the metaphysics of quantum mechanics, this principle must be addressed. We argue for dropping the IENP and discuss the resulting metaphysical and metametaphysical consequences.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Particles before symmetry</a><span class="id">[2509.25276]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The standard model of particle physics is usually cast in symmetry-first terms. Recently, a geometry-first picture has been proposed, in which the relevant symmetries do not appear explicitly at the ground level of ontology. In this paper I extend this approach to two central mechanisms of the standard model: spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Yukawa coupling, both essential for particles to acquire mass. These reformulations offer alternative explanations cast in purely geometric terms. For example, a particle's quantum numbers correspond to the internal space it inhabits and to the geometric type of object it is (e.g. an $(n,m)$-tensor). I argue that a symmetry-first account in terms of principal and associated bundles admits a genuine geometry-first counterpart only when the group's representation coincides with the automorphism group of the fibre – a condition that cuts the slack tolerated by the symmetry-first view.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decoherence and Probability</a><span class="id">[2410.01317]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One cannot justifiably presuppose the physical salience of structures derived via decoherence theory based upon an entirely uninterpreted use of the quantum formalism. Non-probabilistic accounts of the emergence of probability via decoherence are unconvincing. An alternative account of the emergence of probability involves the combination of a partially interpreted decoherence model and an averaging of observables with respect to a positive-definite quasi-probability function and neglect of terms $O(\hbar)$. Our analysis delimits the context in which the combination of decoherence and a semi-classical averaging allows us to recover a classical probability model within an emergent coarse-grained description.</p></div></details></article></body>
