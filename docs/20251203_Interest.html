<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limiting Reduction and Modified Gravity</a><span class="id">[2512.02871]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a framework of theories that adjust Newton's laws of gravity to explain effects such as galactic rotation anomalies, offering an alternative to dark matter. This essay examines the justification of MOND by assessing its inter-theoretical relationship to established theories across relevant scales, in particular its connection to Newtonian gravitation. We argue that MOND fails a key condition for a theory's justification–what we call 'reduction-wise justification'–since it does not adequately reduce to Newtonian gravity in a fully non-arbitrary way. More precisely, despite satisfying the standard formal criteria for successful limiting reduction, MOND does not properly reduce to Newtonian gravitation because of (i) the absence of a fundamental theoretical framework to justify the interpolating function introduced in MOND and (ii) the lack of a unified mathematical structure working across all scales, independent of Newtonian theory. Hence, the case study of MOND provides crucial results for the general debate on inter-theoretic reduction in science: MOND's failure as a case of reduction highlights important limitations in standard accounts of limiting reduction. We respond by proposing a more refined framework for limiting reduction that introduces two additional criteria to better distinguish successful from pathological reductions. More broadly, this case illustrates how analysing reduction-wise justification can serve as a powerful tool for evaluating the validity of novel theories that are not yet empirically established.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Methodological Realism and Quantum Mechanics</a><span class="id">[2512.02169]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I distinguish two senses in which one can take a given physical theory to be `complete'. On the first, a complete physical theory is one that, in principle, completely describes physical reality. On the second, a complete physical theory is one that provides all of the conceptual resources one needs to describe any (in general probabilistic) physical phenomenon to any level of detail one likes, in principle. I argue that while the (neo-)Everettian approach to interpreting quantum mechanics aims to show that it is complete in the first sense, the (neo-)Bohrian approach begins from an understanding of quantum mechanics as being complete in the second sense. I then discuss some of the essential differences between how classical and quantum theory describe phenomena, and the way in which the quantum description can be thought of as a “natural generalisation” (to use Bohr's phrase) of the classical description. Finally, I elaborate upon the two visions of physics from which one can motivate the first and the second sense of completeness, respectively: \emph{metaphysical realism}, on the one hand, and what I will call \emph{methodological realism}, on the other – and discuss what one can say about the significance of the differences between quantum and classical description from each of these points of view. I suggest that there is a sense in which the views of (neo-)Everett and the views of (neo-)Bohr can be understood to be mutually supporting positions, from their respective perspectives, even though they are diametrically opposed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chen Ning Yang Retrospective</a><span class="id">[2512.02673]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Chen-Ning Yang made important contributions to the theory of solvable models in statistical mechanics, including generalizations of the Bethe Ansatz, magnetization in the Ising model, the Lee-Yang circle theorem, and the Yang-Baxter equation. Most famously, Yang made transformative contributions to the current Standard Model of elementary particle interactions. The proposal of Yang and T. D. Lee, that left-right symetry (parity) is violated in weak particle decays, established that the primary currents involved in weak interactions are left handed. The work of Yang and R. L. Mills gave a framework for force carriers coupling to these currents that are non-Abelian generalizations of the electromagnetic photon, which unlike the electrically neutral photon, carry “charges” to which they self-couple . Two decades of work by others on quantization and mass-generation mechanisms then culminated in the Standard Model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two Shades of Quark Color: Parallel Canons across the Cold War Divide</a><span class="id">[2510.23909]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The introduction of the color quantum number is conventionally narrated as a linear progression from the quark-model statistics paradox to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper challenges that teleology by arguing that &quot;color&quot; emerged as two conceptually distinct constructs during the Cold War. The first, originating with Han and Nambu and culminating in QCD, conceived of color as a local gauge charge, the source of a fundamental force mediated by gluons. The second, developed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, treated color as a hidden, three-valued label–a statistical and structural property within a composite, S-matrix-inflected hadron model. We trace these parallel narratives, linking the Dubna approach to a holist epistemology that prioritizes observable amplitudes and global constraints, and the QCD approach to a reductionist program grounded in micro-dynamics. A case study of Fermilab's E-36 experimental chain (1970–78) shows how an observables-first design-tuned to S-matrix and Regge constraints on forward elastic scattering–performed robustly within its natural domain but was ultimately discontinued amid declining theoretical interest and involvement. The subsequent hegemony of QCD retroactively projected its gauge-theoretic conception of color onto history, erasing this epistemic diversity. We conclude that the marginalization of Dubna's structural color was not merely a political outcome of the Cold War but a result of deep ontological and philosophical divergences, advocating for a domain-sensitive pluralism in the historiography of particle physics.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02824" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learning Science and the Illusion of Understanding: Exploring the Effects of Integrating Learning Tasks after Explainer Videos</a><span class="id">[2512.02824]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Explainer videos are increasingly used to support science learning. While prior research has demonstrated their potential, studies have also identified limitations - particularly their tendency to foster an illusion of understanding, where learners overestimate their grasp of a topic despite gaps in their actual knowledge. Pairing explainer videos with cognitively engaging elements may help mitigate this effect. This paper reports two experimental studies examining the immediate and long-term effects of learning tasks following a physics explainer video on learners' illusion of understanding. Study 1 (N = 244 learners) compared high-level learning tasks with watching the video alone. Study 2 (N = 175) compared high-level and low-level tasks. Results show that high-level learning tasks significantly reduce the illusion of understanding immediately after the intervention compared to watching the video alone (t(88) = 6.50, p &lt; .001, d = 0.69). Over the long term, both high-and low-level tasks are similarly effective. Learners with lower prior content knowledge are more susceptible to an illusion of understanding. We conclude that explainer videos should not be used in isolation in science classrooms. To prevent misjudged understanding - particularly among students with limited prior knowledge - they should be combined with cognitively demanding follow-up activities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Critical Analysis of Affirmative Action and Academic Performance: A Response to the Preprint Authored by Matheus et al. (2025)</a><span class="id">[2512.02842]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This article offers a critical response to the preprint by Matheus et al. (2025), which evaluates the academic performance of students admitted through different entry routes at Sao Paulo State University. Although the dataset compiled by the authors is valuable, their analysis contains conceptual, methodological, and historical limitations that undermine the validity of their conclusions. We argue that the preprint misinterprets the purpose of Brazil's affirmative action policy, which is intended to ensure equitable access rather than equalize academic performance at the point of university entry. Early performance differences among universal system, public school, and racial-quota students reflect longstanding inequalities in Brazil's basic education system. Furthermore, the preprint generalizes findings basically from only three undergraduate programs (Physics, Biology, and Pedagogy) to represent entire academic domains (STEM, Biological Sciences, and Humanities), an extrapolation that reduces the reliability of its conclusions. Overall, we contend that early performance differences indicate structural educational inequality, not policy failure. Affirmative action fulfills its mandate by guaranteeing access, while universities bear the responsibility for providing equitable conditions for academic progression.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notes on Quantum Soundscapes and Music</a><span class="id">[2504.04624]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We describe our investigations involving the sonification of data from experiments involving various mesoscopic mechanical oscillator systems cooled to close to their quantum ground states, as well as the sonification of measured data from a single qubit subject to various unitary rotations designed to test the Leggett-Garg inequality. &quot;Listening&quot; to data via their resulting sonifications facilitates the discovery of signals that might otherwise be hard to detect in common graphic (i.e., visual) representations, and for the qubit experiment provides a complementary way to discern when the data violates macroscopic realism with some prior listening training. The resulting soundscapes and music also provide a complementary window into the quantum realm that is accessible to non-experts with open ears.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Hands-On Molecular Communication Testbed for Undergraduate Education</a><span class="id">[2512.01904]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work presents a hands-on molecular communication (MC) testbed developed for the undergraduate Communication Engineering lab course at the Institute for Communications Technology (IfN), TU Braunschweig. The goal of the experiment is to provide students with an intuitive and reproducible introduction to MC concepts using a low-cost and accessible fluidic setup. The system employs a background water flow into which three dye colors are injected and symbols are detected by a multi-wavelength photosensor. A zero-forcing–based estimator is used to separate the spectral components and reliably identify the transmitted colors. The experiment is designed to be completed independently by students within a single laboratory session and requires only basic prior knowledge from introductory communication engineering courses. A detailed script accompanies the experiment, guiding students through channel characterization, color detection, pseudoinverse computation, and simple data transmission using on-off keying. In pilot trials, students successfully reproduced the entire communication chain and achieved stable data rates of up to 0.5 bit/s over a 15 cm channel. The proposed testbed demonstrates that fundamental principles of MC can be taught effectively using a compact and inexpensive experimental setup. The experiment will be integrated into an undergraduate lab course.</p></div></details></article></body>
