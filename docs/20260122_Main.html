Built upon a multi-agent architecture, \textbf{DeepInflation} integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a symbolic regression (SR) engine and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) knowledge base. This framework enables the agent to automatically explore and verify the vast landscape of inflationary potentials while grounding its outputs in established theoretical literature. We demonstrate that \textbf{DeepInflation} can successfully discover simple and viable single-field slow-roll inflationary potentials consistent with the latest observations (here ACT DR6 results as example) or any given $n_s$ and $r$, and provide accurate theoretical context for obscure inflationary scenarios. \textbf{DeepInflation} serves as a prototype for a new generation of autonomous scientific discovery engines in cosmology, which enables researchers and non-experts alike to explore the inflationary landscape using natural language.

The kilonova signal was extensively studied in the spectral and time domains, giving key insights into the chemical composition and physical properties of the ejecta. Here, we report the discovery of a novel correlation between two fundamental observables: the peak energy of the EF_E spectrum, Ep, and the isotropic-equivalent luminosity, Liso. In particular, we show that up to about 2.5 days after the merger, the AT2017gfo spectrum evolves according to: log10[Ep/eV] = -0.13 (+0.02/-0.02) + 0.62 (+0.02/-0.02) * log10[Liso/(1e41 erg/s)] (68% C.L.) while in subsequent epochs, Ep remains almost constant with Liso, flattening around 1 eV. Exploiting simulations from a state-of-the-art radiative transfer code, we demonstrate that our kilonova model inherently predicts this peculiar correlation, suggesting a new diagnostic tool for comparing observables against simulations. Future kilonova observations will provide additional insight into the physics behind the Ep-Liso correlation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14360" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semi-analytical approach to Ly$α$ multiple-scattering in 21-cm signal simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.14360]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A crucial physical quantity in determining the 21-cm signal during cosmic dawn is the inhomogeneous background of Ly$\alpha$ photons originating from the first galaxies. As these photons travel through the intergalactic medium, their scattering cross-section is often approximated as a delta function at resonance due to computational cost. That is, photons with emitted wavelengths between Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ are assumed to travel in straight lines until they redshift into the Ly$\alpha$ resonance. However, due to the damping wing in the Ly$\alpha$ cross-section, this approximation fails as the frequency of the photon approaches the resonant frequency, resulting in multiple scatterings events that could be separated by non-negligible distances. Some previous works studied this effect of Ly$\alpha$ multiple scattering by running computationally heavy radiative-transfer simulations. However, robustly interpreting the cosmic 21cm signal requires exploring a large parameter space of astrophysical uncertainties, motivating more computationally-efficient approaches. Here we incorporate Ly$\alpha$ multiple scatterings in the public, semi-numerical simulation 21cmFAST. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to study the trajectories of Ly$\alpha$ photons on different scales. We find that the distance distributions of Ly$\alpha$ photons with respect to the absorption point can be modeled as analytical functions that are governed by a single parameter. Upon implementing the distance distributions in 21cmFAST, we find that the multiple scattering effect is important (about 50% difference in the 21-cm power spectrum) only at high redshifts before the spin temperature is fully coupled to the kinetic temperature. Furthermore, we find that Ly$\alpha$ multiple scattering does not enhance Ly$\alpha$ heating, and that the combined effect is negligible, especially under realistic X-ray heating scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The era of precision cosmology with voids</a><span class="id">[2601.14362]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic voids, the large underdense regions of our Universe, have emerged over the past decade as powerful cosmological laboratories: their simple dynamics, sensitivity to local gravitational effects and cosmic expansion, and ability to span large volumes, make them uniquely suited to test fundamental physics. Fueled by advances in theory, simulations, and observations, void science has matured into a precision tool for constraining the parameters of the standard cosmological model and its possible extensions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive description of the statistical tools developed to characterize voids, the theoretical models that link them to cosmological parameters, and the methodologies used to extract information from survey data. We highlight the growing synergy between void-based observables and other cosmological probes, and showcase the increasingly stringent constraints derived from voids measured from current survey data and expected from future missions. With the advent of the next generation of galaxy surveys, voids are poised to play a central role in the future of cosmology, turning what was once regarded as emptiness into one of the most promising frontiers of fundamental science.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14367" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Most Hot Jupiters Were Cool Giant Planets for More Than 1 Gyr</a><span class="id">[2601.14367]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of hot Jupiters is the oldest problem in exoplanet astrophysics. Hot Jupiters formed in situ or via disk migration should be in place just a few Myr after the formation of their host stars. On the other hand, hot Jupiters formed via eccentricity excitation and tidal damping as a result of planet–planet scattering or Kozai-Lidov oscillations may take 1 Gyr or more to arrive at their observed locations. We propose that the relative ages of hot Jupiters inside, near, and outside the bias-corrected peak of the observed hot Jupiter period distribution can be used to distinguish between these possibilities. Though the lack of precise and accurate age inferences for isolated hot Jupiter host stars makes this test difficult to implement, comparisons between the Galactic velocity dispersions of the hot Jupiter subpopulations enable this investigation. To transform relative age offsets into absolute age offsets, we calibrate the monotonically increasing solar neighborhood age–velocity dispersion relation using an all-sky sample of subgiants with precise ages and a metallicity distribution matched to that of hot Jupiter hosts. We find that the inside-peak and near-peak subpopulations are older than the outside-peak subpopulation, with the inside-peak subpopulation slightly older than the near-peak subpopulation. We conclude that at least 40\% but not more than 70\% of the hot Jupiter population must have formed via a late-time, peak-populating process like high-eccentricity migration that typically occurs more than 1.5 Gyr after system formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decameter-sized Earth Impactors – II: A Bayesian Inference Approach to Meteoroid Ablation Modeling</a><span class="id">[2601.14371]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Small asteroids and large meteoroids frequently impact the Earth, though their physical and material properties remain poorly understood. When observed as fireballs in Earth's atmosphere, these properties can be inferred from their ablation and fragmentation behavior. The 2022 release of previously classified United States Government (USG) satellite sensor data has provided hundreds of new fireball light curves, allowing for more detailed analysis. Here we present a new Bayesian inference method based on dynamic nested sampling that can robustly estimate these objects' physical parameters from their observed light curves, starting from relatively uninformative, flat priors. We validate our method against seven USG sensor-observed fireballs with independent ground-based observations and demonstrate that our results are consistent with previous estimates. We then apply our technique to $13$ decameter-size Earth impactors to conduct the most detailed population-level study of their structure and material strength to date. We identify three structurally distinct groups within the decameter impactors. The first group are primarily structurally homogeneous, weak objects which catastrophically disrupt below $\sim1.5$ MPa. The second group are heterogeneous objects which progressively fragment starting from $\sim1$ MPa typically up to $\sim3-8$ MPa. The third group are strong aggregates which remain mostly intact until $9-10$ MPa. Our results also suggest that decameter-size asteroids fragment in two distinct phases: an initial phase at $\sim0.04-0.09$ MPa and a second at $\sim1-4$ MPa. While decimeter- to meter-size objects typically lose most of their mass in the initial phase, larger decameter-size objects instead lose most of their mass in the second phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14375" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast X-ray transients in NuSTAR data</a><span class="id">[2601.14375]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are flashes of X-rays that last for a few hundreds of seconds to a few hours. An enigmatic population of these transients that did not have a clear origin has been known for several decades, mostly found serendipitously in soft X-ray imaging observations. Recent progress in this field by Einstein Probe has found that many FXTs are associated with gamma-ray bursts and the collapse of massive stars. Motivated by this, we searched the NuSTAR archive in the harder 3–79 keV band for $\sim1000$ s duration transients. From 204 Ms of exposure we present five candidate FXTs, four of which are spectrally hard, with power-law indices $-3&lt;\Gamma&lt;0$, standing them apart from FXTs discovered in the soft band. Three have potential associations with galaxies at $z=0.1-2$, implying 3–79 keV luminosities of $10^{43}$ to $10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and volumetric event rates of 125–2900 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. The properties of these NuSTAR FXTs most resemble low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts, and would be much more common than their higher-luminosity counterparts in this redshift range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Not-So-Compact Companion: Massive, Oversize White Dwarf in a Post-Common Envelope Eclipsing Binary</a><span class="id">[2601.14378]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We provide a detailed characterization of 2M07515777+1807352, a post-common envelope eclipsing binary system with a 10.3 d, nearly, but not quite, circular orbit (e = 0.02). This system consists of a massive white dwarf (WD) ($1.08$ M$_{\odot}$) and a 4400 K main-sequence companion (0.66 M$_{\odot}$). This WD is among the most massive known within post-common envelope binary systems. We also find, through both spectral energy distribution and $\it{TESS}$ light curve analyses, that the WD has a radius of $1.54 R_{\earth}$, roughly $12\sigma$ larger than the expected value from WD mass-radius relationships. Both the Lomb-Scargle analysis and the $v \sin{i}$ of the system indicate the main-sequence companion to be super-synchronously rotating at a period of $\sim$6 days, which may suggest accretion occurred during the evolution of the system. This binary also shares similar physical characteristics with six other post-common envelope systems hosting massive WDs, which may point to a shared formation pathway. We model the history of this system with COSMIC and find that it likely formed through an episode of common envelope evolution following the onset of mass transfer when the progenitor primary was on either the early or the thermally pulsing stages of the asymptotic giant branch. As a result of its properties, the study of 2M07515777+1807352 can provide new insights regarding many key outstanding questions in our understanding of common envelope evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14388" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutron star cooling implications and magnetic field of the Vela Junior central compact object from all XMM-Newton and Chandra spectra</a><span class="id">[2601.14388]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The central compact object (CCO) in the Vela Junior supernova remnant is a young neutron star whose relatively low X-ray flux and small distance suggest it has a mass high enough to activate fast neutrino cooling processes. Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at  0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B 3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is  5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1. The cool luminosity and temperature imply the Vela Junior CCO is indeed colder than many other young neutron stars and probably has a high mass that triggered fast neutrino cooling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An azimuthally resolved study of sloshing cold fronts in three nearby galaxy clusters</a><span class="id">[2601.14392]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed analysis of sloshing cold fronts in a sample of three nearby galaxy clusters (Abell 496, Abell 2029, and Abell 1644) observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Cold fronts manifest as sharp edges in the X-ray surface brightness of the intracluster medium (ICM) in galaxy clusters. In the residual X-ray surface brightness maps, where the global ICM distribution has been subtracted, cold fronts generated by gas sloshing are observed at the boundaries of the spiral excesses. We perform a systematic and comprehensive study of the surface brightness edges along the spiral excesses. We find the deficit of the thermal pressure radially inward of the brightness edges, in contrast to stripping cold fronts that typically exhibit higher thermal pressure in brightness edges. Assuming that the sharp edges in the X-ray surface brightness distributions are sustained entirely by the gas bulk motions, we estimate the velocity gradients across the edges that are required to compensate for the deficit of the thermal pressure. We do not find statistically significant velocity gradients along the azimuthal direction. Our results suggest that alternative mechanisms such as magnetic fields and viscosity are necessary to maintain the sharpness of sloshing cold fronts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14393" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MeV absorption in gamma-ray bursts as a probe of their progenitor winds</a><span class="id">[2601.14393]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A small fraction of X-ray photons from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), after escaping the relativistic jet, are scattered by electrons in the circumburst medium. Subsequent photon-photon absorption between the incoming MeV $\gamma$-rays and the back-scattered X-rays generate electron-positron pairs, enriching the surrounding medium with leptons. We investigate how these back-scattered photons modify the prompt GRB spectrum through $\gamma-\gamma$ absorption. In a dense and pair-loaded wind environment, the emerging spectra exhibit a broad attenuation structure, whose morphology is sensitive to the low-energy spectral index $\alpha$. In particular, spectra with $\alpha &gt; -1$ develop a pronounced, saddle-shaped absorption between 1 and 100 MeV (rest frame). Such external MeV absorption could account for the spectral curvature seen in some bright GRBs, and may point to enhanced mass loss from their progenitor stars, consistent with early observations of core-collapse supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14403" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultraviolet spectroscopy reveals a hot and luminous companion to the Be star + black hole candidate MWC 656</a><span class="id">[2601.14403]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Galactic Be star binary MWC 656 was long considered the only known Be star + black hole (BH) system, making it a critical benchmark for models of massive binary evolution and for the expected X-ray emission of Be+BH binaries. However, recent dynamical measurements cast doubt on the presence of a BH companion. We present new multi-epoch ultraviolet spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), combined with high-resolution optical spectra, to reassess the nature of the companion. The far-ultraviolet spectra reveal high-ionisation features, including prominent N V and He II lines, which are absent in the spectra of normal Be stars and are indicative of a hot, luminous companion. Spectral modelling shows that these features cannot originate from the Be star or from an accretion disc around a compact object. Instead, we find that the data are best explained by a hot ($T_\mathrm{eff} \approx 85$ kK), compact, hydrogen-deficient star with strong wind signatures, consistent with an intermediate-mass stripped star. Our revised orbital solution and composite spectroscopic modelling yield a companion mass of $M_2 = 1.54^{+0.57}_{-0.46}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, definitively ruling out a BH and disfavouring a white dwarf. MWC 656 thus joins the growing class of Be + stripped star binaries. The system's unusual properties - including a high companion temperature and wind strength - extend the known parameter space of such binaries. The continued absence of confirmed OBe+BH binaries in the Galaxy highlights a growing tension with population synthesis models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erythrohenosis – The crimson chronicles of two giants</a><span class="id">[2601.14408]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate erythrohenosis – the collision and merger of two red giants – establishing an end-to-end model for this fundamental evolutionary channel in dense stellar environments. Combining three-dimensional SPH simulations of a binary with analytical modeling, we characterize the event from initial encounter to terminal explosion. We demonstrate that grazing encounters induce tidal capture and rapid orbital decay, accompanied by large-amplitude, nonlinear stellar oscillations. The subsequent inspiral spins up the common envelope into a stable, non-spherical equilibrium, powering a luminous precursor with quasi-periodic bursts. The terminal explosion, modeled with angular momentum conservation, produces an intrinsically flattened remnant that preserves a geometric memory, or morphomnesia, of its binary origin. The associated gravitational wave signal features a rapid, drag-dominated frequency evolution, identifiable by a unique time-varying apparent chirp mass. These results define a distinctive multi-stage observational fingerprint – linking transient optical precursors, asymmetric nebulae, and anomalous gravitational wave chirps – to guide identification in current and future multi-messenger surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Chandra Observations of the z = 1.16 Relaxed, Cool-core Galaxy Cluster SPT-CL J2215-3537</a><span class="id">[2601.14425]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy clusters serve as a unique and valuable laboratory for probing cosmological models and understanding astrophysics at the high-mass limit of structure formation. Clusters that are dynamically relaxed are especially useful targets of study because of their morphological and dynamical simplicity. However, at redshifts z &gt; 1, very few such clusters have been identified. We present results from new Chandra observations of the cluster SPT-CL J2215-3537 (hereafter SPT J2215), at z = 1.16, the second most distant relaxed, cool-core cluster identified to date. We place constraints on the cluster's total mass profile and investigate its thermodynamic profiles, scaling relations (gas mass, average temperature, and X-ray luminosity), and metal enrichment, resolving the cool core and providing essential context for the massive starburst seen in its central galaxy. We contextualize the thermodynamic and cosmological properties of the cluster within a sample of well-studied, lower-redshift relaxed systems. In this way, SPT J2215 serves as a powerful high-redshift benchmark for understanding the formation of cool cores and the evolution of massive clusters of galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14481" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospects of Prompt Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimetry with POLAR-2</a><span class="id">[2601.14481]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dominant radiation mechanism that powers the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains poorly understood. High quality, time- and energy-resolved linear polarization measurements of prompt $\gamma$-ray photons can distinguish between synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes and provide crucial constraints on the outflow properties. This will be achieved by POLAR-2 that is proposed as a dedicated GRB polarimeter and successor to POLAR. The High-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) is one of the three instruments of POLAR-2 that features significantly improved sensitivity in the $(40-1000)$ keV energy range and a detection area four times larger than that of POLAR. Here we demonstrate the capabilities of the HPD to constrain key physical model parameters by creating and fitting to synthetic sources using a time-resolved spectro-polarimetric theoretical model of prompt GRB emission. The time-resolved spectral and polarization fits are performed using a novel technique featuring maximum likelihood over an unbinned (in time and energy) list of detected events. The constrained model parameters directly relate to the underlying source physics that would reveal an accelerating, coasting or decelerating emission region. For a pulse fluence of $\mathcal{F}=10^{-5}\mathcal{F}_{-5}\,{\rm erg\,cm^{-2}}$ we can constrain the time-integrated polarization degree to an absolute accuracy ($1\,\sigma$) of about $2.5\mathcal{F}_{-5}^{\,-1/2}$ per cent, as long as source photons dominate over the background. In bright GRBs, such unprecedented accuracy at these energies will allow to distinguish between different models for the prompt GRB emission mechanism and constrain the magnetic field geometry, jet angular structure and outflow composition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supermassive black hole mass inference with the optical flares of tidal disruption events</a><span class="id">[2601.14483]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal disruption events (TDEs) represent a truly unique, and potentially very powerful, probe of the quiescent supermassive black hole (SMBH) population. Given current observational survey capabilities the vast majority of the TDEs discovered in the next decade will be observed only across optical-UV wavelengths. A set of questions of broad scientific interest relating to SMBH demographics and SMBH-galaxy correlations could in principal be answered by using TDE emission as an efficient means to constrain SMBH masses. In this paper we argue for using well-understood elements of TDE emission (the thermal X-ray continuum and late-time UV plateau) to derive empirical relationships between the more poorly understood early optical/UV flare and the black hole mass, before using these empirical relationships to measure TDE black hole masses simply and rapidly. We provide a publicly available code TDEFLARE which does this, showing (i) it produces results consistent with disk codes containing far more physics, (ii) it reproduces galactic scaling relationships at high ($&gt;5\sigma$) significance, (iii) it produces reliable mass estimates for both partial and full disruptions, and (iv) it does not require late time data to derive mass constraints. We provide 89 TDE black hole mass constraints, derive the intrinsic black hole mass function implied by the current TDE population, and discuss the Malmquist-Hills bias, an important confounding factor in TDE science.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: MagLim++ Lens Sample Selection and Measurements of Galaxy Clustering</a><span class="id">[2601.14484]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy clustering is a sensitive probe of the expansion history and growth of structure of the universe, and key degeneracies can be broken by combining these data with measurements of cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing (a so-called 3$\times$2pt analysis).

However, selecting clean photometric subsamples for cosmology are crucial for avoiding contamination that can bias cosmological constraints. Here we present the MagLim++ galaxy sample, selected to optimize for cosmological constraining power and incorporating an array of novel quality cuts to identify and remove residual contamination. This sample comes from the full six years of observations from the Dark Energy Survey. We present measurements of the two-point angular clustering ($w(\theta)$) of 9,186,205 galaxies distributed over 4031 sq. degrees and in six tomographic redshift bins centered at $\bar{z}\approx$ [0.31, 0.44, 0.62, 0.78, 0.90, 1.01].

Due to the energy carried by neutrinos from the cooling, collapsing core, gravity decreases, leading to the ejection of a small fraction of the outer envelope, some of which remains bound. The fallback accreted gas possesses large angular-momentum fluctuations due to the pre-collapse envelope convection. The fallback material forms intermittent accretion disks around the black hole that launch jets (or disk wind), which unbind most of the bound material. The failed-supernova scenario for M31-2014-DS1 requires that only &lt;1% of the bound material be accreted by the black hole, but the jets do not shut down the backflow for over 10 years. I find this fine-tuned requirement unlikely. I also find that, due to the rapid radiative cooling of the outflow interaction zone with the outer gas, the expected radiation is about an order of magnitude or more above the observed value. These, as well as earlier challenges raised against the failed-supernova scenario, make the alternative type II intermediate-luminosity optical transient scenario, in which fading is due to dust ejection in a violent binary interaction, more likely. The fading event M31-2014-DS1 does not support the failed-supernova scenario predicted by the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for Isolated Black Hole Candidates within 15 pc of the Solar System in Gaia DR3</a><span class="id">[2601.14499]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Theoretical models predict that the Galaxy hosts $10^8$-$10^9$ black holes formed from the complete gravitational collapse of heavy stars and that most of these black holes are isolated, without any companion. Within 15 pc of the Solar System ($\sim 50$ ly), there may be a few black holes. If located inside one of the Local Interstellar Clouds - which occupy 5-20% of this local volume - an isolated black hole could produce detectable electromagnetic emission via accretion from the interstellar medium, given the capabilities of current or near-future observatories. However, precise predictions remain challenging due to large uncertainties in the expected accretion spectra. Outside these clouds, the accretion rate would be too low in any standard model to yield a detectable electromagnetic signal. While astrometric detection via gravitational perturbation of nearby stars is conceivable, the local stellar density is too low for this method to be realistically successful. We have searched the Gaia DR3 catalog for candidate isolated black holes accreting from the interstellar medium and identified five sources. All candidates lie close to the Galactic plane, making them likely spurious astrometric solutions, for instance caused by unmodelled background sources (crowding) and/or unmodelled binarity; nevertheless, they cannot be definitively ruled out without follow-up observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extra modes in helium-core-burning stars probing an infra core cavity</a><span class="id">[2601.14507]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dipole mixed modes observed in the oscillation pattern of red giant stars probe the radiative regions in the stellar core. Oscillation spectra of helium-core-burning stars sometimes show extra peaks that remain unexplained by the dipole mixed-mode pattern expected from the coupling of a radiative cavity in the stellar core and a pressure cavity in the stellar envelope. We use the asymptotic expansion developed for a multi-cavity star in order to characterize these extra peaks. The analytical resonance condition of the multi-cavity gravito-acoustic modes, with two inner gravity cavities and an outer pressure cavity, helps us explain that the apparent extra peaks are dipole mixed modes that follow the 3-cavity oscillation pattern. The derivation of the two asymptotic period spacings associated with the two distinct regions in the radiative core provides an estimate of the full radiative cavity. Our results provide new constraints for analysing the overshoot or mixing in the core of helium-core-burning stars. An important structure discontinuity inside the radiative core may explain the larger than expected observed period spacings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14539" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral Variability of the Star HD 141569A</a><span class="id">[2601.14539]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The paper presents the results of long-term homogeneous spectroscopic studies of the Herbig Ae/Be star HD 141569A obtained in the optical range.

In contrast, IGR J17091-3624 is less obscured, making it a more accessible target for optical investigations. Due to its weak radio emission, optical and infrared data are essential to probe the jet and outer disc behavior of IGR J17091-3624. This study presents the first long-term optical monitoring of IGR J17091-3624, using data from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) over its 2011, 2016, and 2022 outbursts. We combine these observations with quasi-simultaneous X-ray data from Swift/XRT, RXTE, and NICER, employing light curve and variability analysis, spectral energy distributions, color-magnitude diagrams, and optical/X-ray correlations to investigate optical emission mechanisms. We find that the optical and X-ray fluxes are significantly correlated, following a power-law relation with the index 0.40\pm0.04, suggesting that the optical emission in IGR J17091-3624 is dominated by an X-ray-irradiated accretion disk. Based on optical spectral slope constraints, we estimate the extinction toward IGR J17091-3624 A_V = 4.3 to 6.6 mag. The global optical/X-ray correlation suggests a distance estimate of 8-17 kpc, in line with previous findings. High-cadence optical observations show tentative evidence of optical oscillations that may arise from reprocessed X-ray modulations, although confirming this will require higher time-resolution optical data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRMaGiC: Extending Luminous Red Galaxy Selection into the infrared with joint LSST and Roman HLIS Data</a><span class="id">[2601.14554]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce IRMaGiC, an algorithm built based on RedMaGiC desgined to enhance the selection of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) across the redshift range $1 \leq z \leq 2$.

We model the data in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM cosmologies. The combined analysis yields $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.789^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$ and matter density $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.333^{+0.023}_{-0.028}$ in $\Lambda$CDM (68\% CL), where $\sigma_8$ is the clustering amplitude. These constraints show a (full-space) parameter difference of 1.8$\sigma$ from a combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropy datasets from Planck 2018, ACT-DR6, and SPT-3G DR1. Projected only into $S_8$ the difference is $2.6\sigma$. In $w$CDM the Y6 3$\times$2pt results yield $S_8 = 0.782^{+0.021}_{-0.020}$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.325^{+0.032}_{-0.035}$, and dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w = -1.12^{+0.26}_{-0.20}$. For the first time, we combine all DES dark-energy probes: 3$\times$2pt, SNe Ia, BAO and Clusters. In $\Lambda$CDM this combination yields a $2.8\sigma$ parameter difference from the CMB. When combining DES 3$\times$2pt with other low-redshift datasets (DESI DR2 BAO, DES SNe Ia, SPT clusters), we find a 2.3$\sigma$ parameter difference with CMB.

As the interiors of these objects remain hidden from direct observation, numerical models of convection are an important tool in the study of astrophysical dynamos. In such models, unrealistic large values of the viscous ($\nu$) and thermal ($\kappa$) diffusivity are routinely used as an ad-hoc representation of the effects of subgrid scale turbulence which is otherwise too small-scale to resolve numerically. However, the functional forms of these diffusion coefficients can vary greatly between studies, complicating efforts to compare between results and against observations. We explore this issue by considering a series of non-rotating, non-magnetic, solar-like convection models with varying radial functions for the diffusivities and differing boundary conditions. We find that the bulk kinetic energy scales similarly regardless of the diffusivity parameterization. This scaling is consistent with a free-fall scaling, wherein viscosity plays a subdominant role in the force balance. We do not, however, observe such diffusion-free behavior in the convective heat transport. Our results also indicate that the functional form adopted for the diffusion coefficients can impact the distribution of turbulence within the convective shell. These results suggest that some care should be taken when comparing solar convection models directly against helioseismic observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14588" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A JWST Paschen-alpha Calibration of the Radio Luminosity-Star Formation Rate Relation at z 1.3</a><span class="id">[2601.14588]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As radio emission from normal galaxies is a dust-free tracer of star formation, tracing the star formation history of the Universe is a key goal of the SKA and ngVLA.

In the GOODS-S field, we cross-matched a sample of 506 FRESCO Paschen-alpha emitters with the 1.23 GHz radio continuum data from the MeerKAT MIGHTEE survey finding 47 detections. After filtering for AGN (via X-ray detections, hot mid-infrared dust and extended radio emission), as well as blended sources, we obtained a sample of SFGs comprising: 11 cataloged radio detections, 18 non-cataloged detections (at  3-5sigma) and 298 undetected sources. Stacking the 298 undetected sources we obtain a 3.3sigma detection in the radio. This sample, along with a local sample of Paschen-alpha emitters, lies along previous radio luminosity/SFR relations from local (z&lt;0.2) to high redshift (z 1). Fitting the FRESCO data at 1.0&lt;=z&lt;=1.8 we find log(L_1.4GHz) = (1.31+/-0.17) x log(SFR_Pa-alpha) + (21.36+/-0.17) which is consistent with other literature relations.

Dynamic spectra from all beams and both linear polarisations were searched channel by channel with a fast-folding algorithm sensitive to periods between 1.1 and 300 s. A multi-layer RFI-mitigation pipeline exploits multi-beam occupancy, cross-target bad-channel statistics, XX/YY polarisation coincidence, broad frequency masks, and narrow site-specific RFI exclusion zones, followed by clustering in period-frequency space. The pipeline is validated on FAST observations of PSR B0329+54, where we recover the known 0.714 s spin period and harmonic structure in the expected beam. For the stellar sample, successive cuts reduce the raw FFA hit lists (&gt; 10^6 hits per target) to a small number of cluster-level candidates, all of which exhibit clear radio-frequency interference signatures in phase-time and phase-frequency diagnostics. We therefore report no convincing detections of periodic transmitters in our searched parameter space.

To investigate the impact of varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and Einstein radius ratios of DSPLs (denoted as $\beta^{-1}$ parameters) on cosmographic inference under different CSST survey modes (Wide Field (WF), Deep Field (DF), and Ultra-Deep Field (UDF)), we simulate and model mock lenses with Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid (SIE) mass profiles and Sérsic sources whose image properties are tailored to CSST specifications. Assuming a flat $w$CDM universe with fiducial values $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.30966$ and $w = -1$, and uniform priors of $\Omega_{\rm m} \in [0, 1]$ and $w \in [-2, -1/3$), we find that the constraining power on cosmological parameters for a given DSPL system increases significantly with survey depth. For a representative DSPL system with two prominent arcs and a moderate $\beta^{-1}=1.17$, the constraints on ($w, \Omega_{\rm m}$) improve from ($-1.28_{-1.00}^{+0.64}, 0.50_{-0.32}^{+0.28}$) in the WF to ($-1.59_{-0.32}^{+0.63}, 0.42_{-0.06}^{+0.15}$) in the UDF.

The two primary forms of these outflows are X-ray disk winds-hot, ionized gases ejected from the accretion disk-and relativistic jets, which are collimated streams of particles often expelled along the rotational axis of the black hole. While previous studies have revealed a general association between spectral states and different types of outflows, the physical mechanisms governing wind and jet formation remain debated. Here, using coordinated NICER and MeerKAT observations of the recurrent black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-472, we identify a clear anti-correlation between X-ray disk winds and jets: during three recent outbursts, only one type of outflow is detected at a time. Notably, this apparent exclusivity occurs even as the overall accretion luminosity remains within the range expected for a standard thin disk, characteristic of the canonical soft state. These results suggest a competition between outflow channels that may depend on how the accretion energy is partitioned between the disk and the corona. Our findings provide new observational constraints on jet and wind formation in X-ray binaries and offer a fresh perspective on the interplay between different modes of accretion-driven feedback.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Supernova Remnant G284.3$-$1.8 and Its Relation to the Gamma-ray Binary 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856</a><span class="id">[2601.14801]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>G284.3$-$1.8 is a supernova remnant with a radio shell and thermal X-ray emission.

Our X-ray spectroscopy with Suzaku reveals that G284.3$-$1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 have compatible absorption column densities of $N_\mathrm{H} = 6\textrm{--}7 \times 10^{21}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, indicating that the two systems have similar distances. The actual distance is determined as $3~\mathrm{kpc}$ using $\mathrm{^{12}CO}$ ($J=1\textrm{--}0$) data obtained with NANTEN. The X-ray spectrum of G284.3$-$1.8 shows a strong K-shell emission line of Mg, confirming that the earlier claim that the SNR is one of the few Mg-rich SNRs. Comparing recent stellar models taking into account the &quot;shell merger&quot; processes, we find that the obtained Mg-to-Ne mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{Mg}/M_\mathrm{Ne} = 0.73^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ and Si-to-Mg mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{Si}/M_\mathrm{Mg} = 0.44\pm0.03$ suggest a supernova explosion that would have left a neutron star.

It has an optically thick phase of $100.6 \pm 0.6$ d with a magnitude drop of $\sim$1.7 mag in the {\em V} band during the transition between the plateau and the nebular phases. Weak emission features in the early-time spectra indicate a low-level interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta. The spectral evolution is well sampled and exhibits a prominent P-Cygni profile of H$\alpha$, a defining characteristic of Type IIP SNe. Signatures of metal-line formation (e.g., \ion{Fe}{2}, \ion{Ca}{2} near-infrared triplet) are also evident in the spectra as the SN evolves. Spectral modeling with the radiative-transfer code \texttt{TARDIS} during the early photospheric phase (8.7–35.5 d since explosion) yields photospheric temperatures decreasing from $\sim$9,000 to $\sim$6,000 K and expansion velocities declining from $\sim$10,000 to $\sim$5,400 km s$^{-1}$. A tailored expanding photosphere method (EPM) fit based on the \texttt{TARDIS} models provides a distance estimate of $27.8 \pm 2.0$ Mpc. Nebular-phase spectra and bolometric light-curve modeling suggest a progenitor mass in the range 12–15 M$_\odot$.

Magnification bias is parameterized by a coefficient that describes the response of the number of selected objects per unlensed area element to a change in the lensing convergence. We quantify this coefficient using the Balrog synthetic source injection catalog to account for the complexity of the selection function, and compare these results with simplified estimates. The resulting values of the magnification coefficients for each redshift bin are [3.16 $\pm$ 0.08, 2.76 $\pm$ 0.21, 4.09 $\pm$ 0.15, 4.42 $\pm$ 0.16, 4.90 $\pm$ 0.29, 4.83 $\pm$ 0.25]. Relative to Year 3, this analysis provides more precise and accurate magnification bias estimates through a larger Balrog area and reweighting to better match the data properties. The cosmological results are robust when tested against various magnification parameter prior choices and also when adding cross-clustering between lens redshift bins. Neglecting magnification, however, introduces significant systematic shifts: relative to the fiducial analysis with Gaussian priors centered on the Balrog-derived estimates, we observe shifts of 1.37$\sigma$ in $S_8$ and -0.84$\sigma$ in $\Omega_m$ (with cosmic shear included: -0.61$\sigma$ in $S_8$ and -0.71$\sigma$ in $\Omega_m$), in agreement with findings from simulated data, demonstrating that magnification must be modeled to avoid biases.

As a result, we deliver robust and validated analysis pipelines for cosmic shear, $2 \times 2$pt, and $3 \times 2$pt in $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM scenarios, including a well-defined set of scales suitable for real data analysis, a robust prescription for theoretical systematics, and the theoretical covariance of the signal. This comprehensive methodology also lays the groundwork for future galaxy surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling X-ray reflection spectra from returning radiation: application to 4U 1630$-$47</a><span class="id">[2601.14860]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Returning radiation is thought to play a key role in disk illumination of black hole X-ray binaries in the high-soft state, yet it has not been fully incorporated into XSPEC reflection models. We present a new table model for reflection spectroscopy that, for the first time, self-consistently accounts for the returning radiation. To isolate this effect, we adopt the standard disk-corona configuration but disable the corona, allowing the reflection spectrum to be produced solely by self-irradiation of the disk. Applying our model to the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630$-$47, we report a rapidly spinning black hole ($a_* \sim 0.99$), a disk inclination of $i \sim 53^\circ$, a mass accretion rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm BH} \sim 15\% \, {\rm \dot{M}_{Edd}}$, and an electron density of $n_{\rm e} \sim 10^{21} \,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ to reproduce the observed reflection features. The model also yields a source distance of $D\sim 8.2 \, {\rm kpc}$, slightly below the commonly adopted value of $10 \, {\rm kpc}$ in the literature. Compared to the widely used relxillNS, our model naturally produces a harder high-energy reflection spectrum, fitting the data without invoking a Comptonized component.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Energy Survey: DESI-Independent Angular BAO Measurement</a><span class="id">[2601.14864]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a measurement of the angular Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale from the completed Dark Energy Survey (DES) dataset excluding the area of overlap with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).

We interpret the impact of this measurement in the context of the statistical preference for $w_0w_a$CDM over $\Lambda$CDM when combined with DES Y5 Type Ia supernovae (SN), Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and DESI BAO. Based on our previous work, using the full Y6 DES BAO sample, in combination with SN, CMB and DESI DR1 BAO, added 0.3$\sigma$ in this preference (from 3.7$\sigma$ to 4.0$\sigma$), but this ignored possible correlations between datasets. Using our new DESI-independent DES BAO likelihood instead, we find a smaller increase in the statistical preference for $w_0w_a$CDM, from 3.7$\sigma$ to 3.8$\sigma$ when using DESI DR1 BAO, and from 4.0$\sigma$ to 4.1$\sigma$ when updating to the more recent DESI DR2 BAO. These significances reduce to 3.1$\sigma$ when using the new calibrated DES SN-Dovekie.

Applying the Bayesian block algorithm to the 3-day binned $\gamma$-ray lightcurve, we identify pronounced variability, including four major outbursts marked by significant flux enhancements. The highest flux recorded was $(1.1 \pm 0.2)\times 10^{-6}\,\text{ph}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ on 57868.5 MJD. Each outburst comprises multiple components, and lightcurve profile analysis indicates predominantly symmetric temporal structures. The shortest variability timescale of 4.5 hours constrains the emission region to be located within 0.03 pc of the central engine, likely near the broad-line region (BLR). Additionally, two highest-energy photons were detected with energies of 46.4 GeV (on 57739.6 MJD) and 42.5 GeV (on 59161.9 MJD), observed outside the peak flaring activity. The fractional variability shows an overall increasing trend from UV/optical to $\gamma$-ray bands, with a noticeable dip in the X-ray range, consistent with the shape of the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). The flux distributions during flares exhibit log-normal or double log-normal behavior, suggesting multiplicative variability processes and evolving emission zones. Cross-correlation analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the $\gamma$-ray and X-ray bands, with X-rays lagging by 42.5 days. Broadband SED modeling across different flux states supports a one-zone leptonic scenario, with $\gamma$-ray emission produced via external Compton scattering of IR and BLR photons. High-flux states show harder electron spectra, elevated break energies, and reduced magnetic fields-features consistent with efficient particle acceleration and Compton dominance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AGN in Gaia Alerts: from flares to Changing Look Quasars</a><span class="id">[2601.14932]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Gaia Alerts system is providing alerts on a variety of objects displaying a significant photometric change detected by the Gaia satellite from one passage to the next one over the same region of the sky. Among the over 22000 alerts published until the end of 2022, around 13 percent concern AGN or quasar candidates. We have embarked on a spectroscopic ground-based follow-up of some of those (including some selected by a different method specifically in galactic nuclei), to establish their true nature, and reveal the various phenomena leading to a change in magnitude of those AGN. The present paper deals with radio-quiet objects, while the radio-loud ones will be described in a companion paper. We confirm, on one hand, the AGN/quasar nature of 64 new candidates alerted by Gaia, and, on the other hand, obtained second-epoch spectra of over 200 known AGN also alerted for large photometric variations. The observed phenomena show a large variety: from Flares to Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) and a large number of Changing Look Quasars (CLQs, 56 secure ones, plus 23 probable ones), not forgetting some rarer events like SNe, microlensing events or Extreme Coronal Line Emitters. This sample shows that variability is an excellent tool to detect new quasars, especially radio-quiet ones that otherwise would be undetected, and that a significant fraction of variable AGN/quasars, around 10 percent, presents the CLQ phenomenon. Some of the new CLQs are followed-up to monitor further changes and measure time scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical study of multiple solar flare induced modulation of Very Low Frequency (VLF) diurnal profile</a><span class="id">[2601.14948]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Earth's ionosphere is a perpetual detector of ionizing radiation received from celestial objects, particularly the Sun. Solar ionizing radiation in the form of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-rays during both quiet and active phase of the Sun, and charged particles associated with a solar wind imprint their ionization signatures on the ionosphere. Although due to the bipolar nature of the geomagnetic field, the events, such as the solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and associated solar wind enhancement, usually disturb the polar ionosphere only, the UV and X-rays from the solar flares produce sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) in low-mid-latitude part of the earth's ionosphere. Such ionospheric disturbances are studied with the help of the influence they exert on radio waves propagating through earth- ionosphere waveguide. For the lower part of the ionosphere, called the D region, prominent modification in electron-ion density during solar flares can be observed via deviation in earth bound Very Low Frequency (VLF) wave signal from its ambient diurnal profile. In earlier work, successful model of the deviation in VLF amplitude due to different classes of solar flares was formulated. There, calculation of rate of ionization with Monte Carlo simulation and ion-chemistry evaluation of plasma density enhancement followed by a radio propagation simulation was used. Presently, we attempt to numerically reconstruct the modulation in VLF signal from its diurnal pattern produced by multiple solar flares occurring over a single day. Successful reconstruction of the VLF signal modulation for such a complex flaring scenario points to the accuracy of our understanding of the ionization effect due to solar activity on the lower ionosphere, and strengthen our claim to use earth's ionosphere as a high energy space transient event detector.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How a Close-in Planet Protects its White Dwarf Host from Pollution</a><span class="id">[2601.15005]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Approximately 25-50% of white dwarfs (WDs) exhibit metal absorption lines in their photospheres, which are attributed to accretion from their remnant planetary systems. Although white dwarfs with detected planetary systems are more likely to show photospheric pollution, one notable exception - WD 1856+534 - hosts a close-in giant planet yet exhibits no detectable photospheric metal pollution. Previous studies have proposed that massive, close-in planets can block inward transport of small particles driven by radiative forces (e.g., Poynting-Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect). However, it remains unclear whether the close-in planet can similarly prevent delivery of larger bodies via dynamical interactions. We aim to quantify the protective influence of close-in planets on white-dwarf pollution by asteroids approaching on near-parabolic orbits, and to explore the planetary masses and orbital separations required to provide effective protection. We perform ensembles of short-term N-body integrations, sampling a range of planet masses and orbital separations and initializing asteroids on highly eccentric orbits with periapses near the WD Roche radius, in order to measure scattering, capture, and ejection outcomes and quantify the planet's shielding efficiency. For WD1856+534b-like configurations (a_p = 0.02 au), giant planets with masses greater than 0.5 Jupiter masses are sufficient to clear over 80% of highly eccentric small-body contaminants. The effectiveness of the protective effect diminishes with decreasing planetary mass and increasing semi-major axis. These findings help explain why some white dwarfs that host close-in giant planets do not show the photospheric metal pollution commonly observed in other systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A study of the high-inclination population in the Kuiper belt - V. Mean motion resonances beyond 50 AU</a><span class="id">[2601.15012]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we present the most comprehensive study to date on Neptune's mean-motion resonances (MMRs) in the distant Kuiper belt from 50 to 100 AU. Over 200 resonant Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) have been identified in this region, spanning resonances from the 2nd-order 1:3 MMR to the 22nd-order 7:29 MMR, with inclinations $i&lt;40^\circ$. Building on these diverse distributions, we first analyse the dynamical features of numerous $m$:$n$ MMRs, providing an informative database that includes the possible eccentricity ($e$) range, resonance widths, resonance centres, and permissible $(e,i)$ distributions. We then conduct numerical simulations to explore the long-term stability of these MMRs. Our results show that: (1) resonators can occupy all 1:$n$ to 7:$n$ MMRs, with nearly any $n$ corresponding to the 50-100 AU region, including the farthest-out MMRs of 5:29 (24th-order), 6:35 (29th-order), and 7:40 (33rd-order). This suggests that KBOs could potentially exist in even higher-order MMRs than those currently observed. (2) For each set of $m$:$n$ resonances with the same $m$, resonators consistently exhibit inclinations up to $40^\circ$, while eccentricities remain strictly restricted below 0.7. (3) For the 1:3 and 1:4 MMRs, the leading population is less stable than the trailing population. Most interestingly, we discover a novel phenomenon of number reversal, where the higher-order, weaker 3:8 MMR (at semimajor axis $a\approx57.9$ AU) hosts more resonators, rather than fewer as expected, compared to the lower-order, stronger 3:7 MMR (at $a\approx53.0$ AU). Future observations, whether confirming or challenging this phenomenon, will offer valuable insight into the eccentricity and inclination distributions of primordial KBOs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of jet formation and propagation in self-gravitating collapsing stars</a><span class="id">[2601.15030]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate collapsar models with and without self-gravity under identical initial conditions to directly compare the effects of self-gravity on jet properties, such as opening angle, jet power, terminal Lorentz factor, and its variability. We compute a suite of time-dependent, three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of collapsars in evolving spacetime. We update the Kerr metric components due to the growth of the black hole mass and changes its angular momentum. The self-gravity is considered via perturbative terms. We present for the first time the process of jet formation in self-gravitating collapsars. We find that self-gravity leads to temporary jet quenching, which can explain some features in the gamma-ray burst prompt emission. We find no substantial difference in jet launching times between models with and without self-gravity. We observe that in the absence of self-gravity, the jet can extract more rotational energy from the black hole, while self-gravitating models produce narrower jet opening angles. We show that under certain conditions, self-gravity can interrupt the jet formation process, resulting in a failed burst. Our computations show that self-gravity significantly modifies the process of jet propagation, resulting in notably different jet properties. We show that the timescales, variability, and opening angle of jet depend on whether self-gravity is included or not. We argue that self-gravity can potentially explain certain prompt emission properties due to the jet quenching.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Properties and Possible Physical Origins of $γ$-ray Emission in Extreme Synchrotron Blazars</a><span class="id">[2601.15142]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extreme synchrotron blazars, characterized by a first peak in their broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at frequencies exceeding $10^{17}$ Hz, often exhibit a second peak beyond 1 TeV. These sources serve as ideal laboratories for studying particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in relativistic jets. In this work, we systematically analyze the $\sim$16-year Fermi-LAT observational data for 25 extreme high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs). The results indicate that the majority of these sources display stable or low flux levels in the GeV band, with only 6 sources showing significant variability at a confidence level exceeding 5$\sigma$. The time-averaged spectra over the 16-year period for most EHBLs are well described by a hard power-law model, with photon indices predominantly clustered between 1.7 and 1.8. Using Fermi-LAT data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations compiled from the literature, we construct broadband SEDs for these EHBLs and fit them with a one-zone synchrotron + synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. We find that this simplified theoretical framework is sufficient for modeling the observed SEDs of most of these EHBLs, albeit requiring relatively higher electron energies compared to other $\gamma$-ray emitting HBLs, and at times under-representing the UV emission. Based on the SED fitting results, we investigate the physical properties of the emission regions in these EHBLs and compare them with those of other $\gamma$-ray emitting HBLs. Consistent with other GeV–TeV $\gamma$-ray-emitting BL Lacs, the jets in these EHBLs are marked by low radiation efficiency and low magnetization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Theory of transmission spectroscopy of planetary winds: Spectral-line saturation and limits on mass-loss inference</a><span class="id">[2601.15152]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Transmission spectroscopy is a key technique in the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres and has been widely applied to planets undergoing hydrodynamic escape. While a robust analytic theory exists for transmission spectra of hydrostatic atmospheres, the corresponding interpretation for escaping atmospheres has so far relied on numerical modeling. In this work, we develop a theory of transmission spectroscopy in hydrodynamically escaping atmospheres by coupling the standard transmission geometry to a steady-state, spherically symmetric, isothermal outflow. This approach yields closed-form expressions and allows the optical depth inversion problem to be examined. The analytic solution reveals that transmission spectroscopy of planetary winds naturally separates into two regimes. In an opacity-limited regime, transmission depths retain sensitivity to the atmospheric mass-loss rate. Beyond a critical threshold, however, spectral-line cores become saturated and no longer provide a unique constraint on the mass flux. This transition is marked by a sharp analytic boundary of the form $\sigma(\lambda)\times \dot M \le C_{sat}$, where $C_{sat}$ is a constant set by the thermodynamic and geometric properties of the wind. This condition specifies when the inversion between transmission depth and mass-loss rate admits a real solution. Once it is violated, the effective transit radius is no longer controlled by opacity or mass loss, but by the geometric extent of the absorbing wind. These results demonstrate that spectral-line saturation in transmission spectroscopy corresponds to a fundamental loss of invertibility between absorption and atmospheric mass loss, rather than a gradual weakening of sensitivity. The theory provides a physically transparent explanation for why strong transmission line cores often fail to constrain mass-loss rates, while weaker lines and line wings remain diagnostic.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Galaxy-galaxy lensing</a><span class="id">[2601.15175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present galaxy–galaxy lensing (GGL) measurements from the full six years of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y6), covering $4031\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ and used in the DES Y6 $3\times2$pt cosmological analysis.

In addition, strong magnetic fields have recently been measured through asteroseismology in the radiative interiors of red giant stars, the progenitors of white dwarfs. To investigate the potential connection between these observations, we revisit the fossil field framework by using the asteroseismic detections to constrain the strength of such magnetic fields as they evolve to the white dwarf stage. We assume that the magnetic field was either created during the main sequence core convection or that it fills the radiative interior as the star evolves on the red giant branch. From these, we evolve the magnetic flux, allowing for magnetic diffusion along the evolution of a 1.5Msun modelled star. We find that measured field strengths in red giants attributed to the hydrogen-burning shell are compatible with the field amplitudes and emergence timescales of magnetized white dwarfs. On the contrary, magnetic fields generated solely from a convective-core dynamo on the main-sequence and detectable during the red giant branch would be buried too deep in the star and not match the breakout timescales and the field strengths of magnetic white dwarfs. A broadly magnetized internal radiative zone during the red giant branch is therefore key for the fossil field theory to connect magnetic fields observed along the late evolution of stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transit distances and composition of low-velocity exocomets in the $β$ Pic system</a><span class="id">[2601.15216]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>$\beta$ Pictoris is a young nearby A5V star, about 20 Myr old, embedded in a prominent debris disc. For the past 40 years, variable absorption features have been observed in the stellar spectrum, produced by the gaseous tails of exocomets transiting the star. Yet, despite the large number of observations available, the origin and dynamical evolution of the exocomets remain poorly understood. Here we present new spectroscopic observations of $\beta$ Pic, obtained on April 29, 2025, with the Hubble Space Telescope and the HARPS spectrograph. We report the detection of three strong exocomet signatures at low radial velocities (-7.5, +2.5 and +10 km/s), in a large set of lines from various species and excitation levels. We show that the three exocometary tails have different excitation states, indicating that they are located at different distances from the star. Using a detailed modelling of the excitation state of the transiting gas, which includes both radiative and collisional excitation, we derive the transit distance of the three exocometary gaseous tails to be $0.88 \pm 0.08$, $4.7 \pm 0.3$, and $1.52 \pm 0.15$ au. These values are much larger than previous estimates, which generally placed the transient features within 0.2 au. This reveals that gaseous tails produced by exocomets sublimating close to the star can expand and migrate over large distances, while still remaining detectable in absorption spectroscopy. Our study provides a new method to measure the transit distance of exocomets, based on excitation modelling, complementing the acceleration method only applicable for high-velocity objects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic strings, domain walls and environment-dependent clustering</a><span class="id">[2601.15234]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent cosmological data favour phantom-crossing dark energy, motivating models with non-minimal couplings that induce a fifth force on structure formation. Reconciling these models with local tests often requires strong screening, leading to environment-dependent clustering. We investigate such effects via a late-time structure-induced phase transition driven by a non-minimally coupled scalar field. For this purpose, we introduce norns, a fully relativistic cosmological particle-mesh code that self-consistently evolves a complex scalar field - a generalisation of the symmetron producing global U(1) strings rather than domain walls. Using simulations, we compare string and wall-forming models, quantifying impacts on the matter power spectrum, halo mass function, and defect dynamics. Strong environment-dependent effects can generate significant departures from LCDM in underdense regions while keeping the overall power spectrum changes modest (  4-15% at k 0.3-0.5 h Mpc^-1, sub-percent for z &gt; 0.2). We find that an attractive fifth force can locally suppress structure growth in voids while enhancing it in surrounding overdense regions by driving outflows from the voids. These effects leave distinctive signatures in the matter density probability density function and in marked halo power spectra, which are likely detectable in low-redshift data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15285" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A radially broad collisional cascade in the debris disk of $γ$ Ophiuchi observed by JWST</a><span class="id">[2601.15285]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The A1V star $\gamma$ Oph, at a distance of 29.7 pc, is known from Spitzer imaging to host a debris disk with a large radial extent and from its spectral energy distribution to host inner warm dust. We imaged $\gamma$ Oph with JWST/MIRI at 15 and 25.5 microns, which reveal smooth and radially broad emission that extends to a radius of at least 250 au at 25.5 microns. In contrast to JWST findings of an inner small-grain component with distinct ringed substructures in Fomalhaut and Vega, the mid-infrared radial profile combined with prior ALMA imaging suggests a radially broad steady-state collisional cascade with the same grain size distribution throughout the disk. This further suggests that the system is populated by a radially broad planetesimal belt from tens of au or less to well over 200 au, rather than a narrow planetesimal belt from which the observed dust is displaced to appear broad. The disk is also found to be asymmetric, which could be modelled by a stellocentric offset corresponding to a small eccentricity of $\sim$0.02. Such a disk eccentricity could be induced by a mildly eccentric $&lt;$$10\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$ giant planet outside 10 au, or a more eccentric companion up to stellar mass at a few au, without producing a resolvable radial gap in the disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14303" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scalar Quasi-Normal Modes in Black Hole Gravitational Lensing</a><span class="id">[2601.14303]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the excitation of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in gravitational lensing by a Schwarzschild black hole using a scalar field model. By employing a time-domain mode-sum method, we analyze the complex interplay between an incident burst signal and the black hole spacetime. We find that the incident waves can non-resonantly excite a substantial number of high-$l$ modes, with amplitudes for modes as high as l=20 remaining significant compared to the fundamental l=0 mode. We confirm through QNM template fitting that the late-time behaviors of these excited modes are indeed QNMs. After passing through the black hole, we find that the lensed waves form a highly directional and coherent Gaussian beam whose cross-sectional intensity profile is well-described by a Gaussian profile. Unlike spherical waves, this beam's amplitude does not decrease with distance from the black hole but remains nearly constant in the near-field region. Moreover, due to the superposition of numerous QNMs, oscillations largely cancel each other out. The lensed temporal waves do not exhibit typical oscillatory patterns.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emergent Large Lepton Mixing from Neutrino Refraction in Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2601.14386]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a novel origin for the disparity between quark and lepton flavor mixing based on the refractive nature of neutrino masses.

We discuss the direct Urca and neutrino synchrotron processes in unpaired quark matter, incorporating the effects of Landau-level quantization. For the direct Urca process, the quantization of the electron energy spectrum plays a critical role, whereas quark quantization can often be neglected at sufficiently high baryon densities. The resulting field-dependent neutrino emissivity is anisotropic and exhibits an oscillatory behavior as a function of magnetic-field strength. We explore the implications of these effects for magnetar cooling and for possible anisotropic neutrino emission that could contribute to pulsar kicks. In addition, we review the $\nu\bar{\nu}$ synchrotron emission process, which, although subdominant, provides valuable insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and weak interactions in dense quark matter.

Focusing on free–fall dynamics in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes in the test–particle limit, we employ an effective–potential heuristic approach to isolate the roles of the specific energy $E$, specific angular momentum $L$, and black–hole spin $a$. Within this framework, we identify well–defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black–hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non–rotating case.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the three massive neutrino paradigm: Constraints on Neutrino Properties and Interactions from Recent Experimental Data</a><span class="id">[2601.14851]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutrino physics offers unique insights into phenomena beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This thesis presents phenomenological investigations organized around three pillars: consolidation of the three-flavor oscillation paradigm, exploration of new physics viability, and precise determination of solar neutrino fluxes. The theoretical framework introduces massive neutrinos, leptonic mixing, and flavor transitions, followed by experimental results emphasizing Borexino and NOvA data analyses. The first pillar establishes the three-flavor framework through global analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator data, providing updated determinations of mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$) and mass-squared differences ($\Delta m^2_{21}$, $\Delta m^2_{31}$), while quantifying ambiguities in mass ordering and $\theta_{23}$ octant. The second pillar investigates Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) with electrons and quarks, combining Borexino data with COHERENT's CE$\nu$NS measurements to establish bounds on propagation and detection couplings, excluding viable NSI parameter regions including potential LMA-D solutions. The third pillar advances solar neutrino physics through precision flux determinations, integrating pp-chain and CNO-cycle measurements. Results show preference for high-metallicity Standard Solar Models and incompatibility between $3+1$ mixing parameters favored by Gallium experiments and solar observations. This synthesis guides future experiments toward resolving mass ordering, CP violation, and dark sector interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combined constraints on dark photons from high-energy collisions, cosmology, and astrophysics</a><span class="id">[2601.15066]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a dark sector coupled to the Standard Model (SM) through a kinetically mixed dark photon $U$ associated with a new $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry. Kinetic mixing $\varepsilon$ induces an effective coupling to the electromagnetic current, while $U$ interacts with stable dark matter (DM) $\chi$ via a dark gauge coupling $g_\chi$. Our analysis is based on the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, extended to include dark photon production and decay into dileptons ($U\!\to e^+e^-$). In PHSD, dark photons are produced in high-energy collisions through Dalitz decays of light mesons ($\pi^0,\eta,\eta',\omega$), Delta-resonances ($\Delta\!\to N U$), direct vector meson decays ($\rho,\omega,\phi\!\to U$), kaon decays, and $q\bar q\!\to U$ annihilation. Building on previous PHSD benchmarks against dilepton data, we extract upper limits on $\varepsilon^2(m_U,m_\chi,\alpha_\chi)$ in both the visible regime ($m_U&lt;2m_\chi$), where $U\!\to e^+e^-$ dominates, and the invisible regime ($m_U&gt;2m_\chi$), where $U\!\to\chi\bar\chi$ is kinematically open. Cosmological and astrophysical constraints are incorporated in two complementary ways. First, we compute the velocity-dependent self-interaction cross section $\sigma/m_\chi$ for Yukawa-mediated SIDM and confront it with bounds from dwarf galaxies, galaxy groups, and clusters. Second, we determine thermal relic target curves by computing the relic abundance and requiring $\Omega_{\rm DM}h^2\simeq 0.12$, consistent with \textit{Planck} measurements of the cosmic microwave background. Combining PHSD limits on $\varepsilon^2$ with relic density and self-interaction requirements, we exclude regions of the $(m_\chi,m_U)$ plane for each DM realization (Dirac, Majorana, or complex scalar) and identify benchmark scenarios in which heavy-ion, cosmological, and astrophysical constraints are simultaneously satisfied.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chemical evolution of antimatter domains in early Universe</a><span class="id">[2601.15147]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>According to modern physics, our Universe is baryon-asymmetric.

Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\ln \phi$, $V = V_0 \phi^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/\phi$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B &gt; -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B &gt; -1$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A magnetic avalanche as the central engine powering a solar flare</a><span class="id">[2503.12235]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar flares are the most powerful, magnetically driven, explosions in the heliosphere.

Our results suggest the origin of the complex phenomenology observed across the black hole mass spectrum as the interplay between magnetic and gravitational fields. The magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state, characterized by strong magnetic fields (plasma-$\beta &lt;&lt; 1$), exhibits powerful jets, highly variable accretion, and significant sub-Keplerian motion. On the other hand, weakly magnetized disks (plasma-$\beta &gt;&gt; 1$), known as the standard and normal evolution (SANE) state, show steady accretion with primarily winds. An intermediate state bridges the gap between MAD and SANE regimes, with moderate magnetic support (plasma-$\beta \sim 1$) producing mixed outflow morphologies and complex variability. This unified framework has many implications including its possible connection to extreme variability of GRS 1915+105, particularly in its hard spectral states. It also suggests the possible origin of steady jets of Cyg X-1 and the unusually high luminosities (even super-Eddington based on stellar mass black hole) of HLX-1 without requiring super-Eddington mass accretion rates. Our simulations reveal a hierarchy of timescales that explain the rich variety of variability patterns, with magnetic processes driving transitions between states. Comparing two with three dimensional simulations demonstrates that while quantitative details differ, the qualitative features distinguishing different accretion states remain robust.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring selection biases in FRB dispersion-galaxy cross-correlations with magnetohydrodynamical simulations</a><span class="id">[2506.03258]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in conjunction with their redshifts can be used as powerful probes of the distribution of extragalactic plasma. With a large enough sample, the free-electron–galaxy power spectrum $P_{eg}$ can be measured by cross-correlating FRB DMs with galaxy positions. However, a precise measurement of $P_{eg}$ requires a careful investigation of selection effects: the probability of both observing the FRB DM and obtaining a host galaxy redshift depends on their properties. We ray trace through the magnetohydrodynamic simulation IllustrisTNG to investigate the impact of expected observational selection effects on FRB dispersion–galaxy angular cross-correlations with a sample of 3000 FRBs at $0.3\leq z\leq 0.4$ . Our results show that cross-correlations with such an FRB sample are robust to properties of the FRB host galaxy: this includes DM contributions from the FRB host and optical follow-up selection effects. We also find that such cross-correlations are robust to DM-dependent and scattering selection effects specific to the CHIME/FRB survey. However, a DM-dependent selection effect that cuts off the 10\% most dispersed FRBs at a fixed redshift shell can bias the amplitude of the cross-correlation signal by over 50\% at angular scales of $\sim 0.1^\circ$, corresponding to $\sim$ Mpc physical scales. Our findings highlight the importance of both measuring and accounting for selection effects present in existing FRB surveys, as well as mitigating DM-dependent selection effects in the design of upcoming FRB surveys aiming to probe large-scale structure with FRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05476" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repeating flares, X-ray outbursts and delayed infrared emission: A comprehensive compilation of optical tidal disruption events</a><span class="id">[2506.05476]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>TDEs have been proposed as valuable laboratories for studying dormant black holes. However, progress in this field has been hampered by the limited number of observed events. In this work, we present TDECat, a comprehensive catalogue of 134 confirmed TDEs (131 optical TDEs and three jetted TDEs) discovered up to the end of 2024, accompanied by multi-wavelength photometry (X-ray, UV, optical, and IR) and publicly available spectra. We also study the statistical properties, spectral classifications, and multi-band variability of these events. Using a Bayesian Blocks algorithm, we determined the duration, rise time, decay time, and their ratio for 103 flares in our sample. We find that these timescales follow a log-normal distribution. Furthermore, our spectral analysis shows that most optical TDEs belong to the TDE-H+He class, followed by the TDE-H, TDE-He, and TDE-featureless classes, which is consistent with expectations from main-sequence star disruption. Using archival observations, we identified three new potentially repeating TDEs, namely, AT2024pvu, AT2022exr, and AT2021uvz, increasing the number of known repeating events. In both new and previously known cases, the secondary flares exhibit a similar shape to the primary. We also examined the infrared and X-ray emission from the TDEs in our catalogue, and find that 14 out of the 18 infrared events have associated X-ray emission, strongly suggesting a potential correlation. Finally, we find that for three sub-samples (repeating flares, infrared-emitting events, and X-ray events), the spectral classes are unlikely to be randomly distributed, suggesting a connection between spectral characteristics and multi-wavelength emission. TDEcat enables large-scale population studies across wavelengths and spectral classes, providing essential tools for navigating the data-rich era of upcoming surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHEX-MATE: New detections and properties of the radio diffuse emission in massive clusters with MeerKAT</a><span class="id">[2507.00133]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modern radio telescopes are revolutionising our understanding of non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters, collecting large samples of extended sources with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution.

The presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes is expected to strongly alter the chemistry of their envelopes and observable atmospheres. At the magma ocean-envelope boundary (MEB, $&gt;$10 kbar), gas properties deviate from ideality, yet the effects of real gas behaviour on chemical equilibria remain underexplored. Here, we compute equilibrium between magma-gas and gas-gas reactions using real gas equations of state in the H-He-C-N-O-Si system for TOI-421b, a canonical hot sub-Neptune potentially hosting a magma ocean. We find that H and N are the most soluble in magma, followed by He and C. We fit real gas equations of state to experimental data on SiH$_4$, and show that, for a fully molten mantle, SiH$_4$ dominates at the MEB under accreted gas metallicity of 1$\times$ solar, but is supplanted by CH$_4$ at 100$\times$ solar. Lower mantle melt fractions lower both magma-derived Si abundances in the envelope and the solubility of H and He in magma, yielding H$_2$- and He-rich envelopes. Projecting equilibrium chemistry through the observable atmosphere (1 mbar-100 bar), we find that `clouds' of Si-bearing condensates strongly deplete Si-bearing gases, although SiH$_4$ remains key, especially when a solar gas is accreted. SiH$_4$/CH$_4$ and Si/C ratios increase with mantle melt fraction and decrease with accreted gas metallicity. The competition between SiH$_4$ and CH$_4$ is therefore diagnostic of metallicity and presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes with equilibrium temperatures below 1000 K. The corollary is that H$_2$- and He-rich, SiH$_4$-deficient and CH$_4$-bearing observable atmospheres may indicate a limited role or absence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical tide modified Roche limit in eccentric, asynchronous binaries</a><span class="id">[2508.20183]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Roche limit, or the threshold separation within which a celestial object (the donor) M cannot remain in a stable configuration due to a companion's tidal field, has been well established when M is in hydrostatic equilibrium and has synchronous rotation in a circular orbit. However, limited analyses exist considering corrections to the Roche limit due to hydrodynamical effects. We fill in the gap by providing a general theoretical framework involving nonlinear hydrodynamics. We consider both exact nonlinear equations derived from an affine model describing incompressible ellipsoids and series-expanded ones that can be calculated for realistic stars and planets. Our formulation addresses the Roche problem in generic orbits and synchronization levels of M, and fully accounts for the history-dependent hydrodynamical effects. We show that as the orbital eccentricity increases, fluid instability is more likely to develop at the pericenter due to the increased dynamical tide that accumulates over multiple orbits. When M moves in a highly eccentric orbit (with eccentricity around 0.9) and the damping of the fluid is small, the threshold pericenter separation at which mass loss from M can occur can be at least 30% higher than the value predicted for a circular orbit with hydrostatic equilibrium. If only a single passage is considered, however, the threshold separation is 20% smaller than the static limit. The nonlinear interaction at each pericenter passage can also trigger a chaotic fluid evolution inside M even with moderate eccentricities, complementing previous studies of chaotic tides caused by random propagation phases. Our work has broad implications for interacting binaries in eccentric orbits, including migrating gaseous exoplanets, repeated partial tidal disruption events, and more.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generation of Lognormal Synthetic Lyman-$α$ Forest Spectra for $P_{1D}$ Analysis</a><span class="id">[2509.04405]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The one-dimensional flux power spectrum (P1D) of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest probes small-scale structure in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is therefore sensitive to a variety of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. These include the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum, the thermal history of the IGM, the sum of neutrino masses, and potential small-scale fluctuations due to the nature of dark matter. However, P1D is also highly sensitive to observational and instrumental systematics, making accurate synthetic spectra essential for validating analyses and quantifying these effects, especially in high-volume surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We present an efficient lognormal mock framework for generating one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest spectra tailored for P1D analysis. Our method captures the redshift evolution of the mean transmitted flux and the scale-dependent shape and amplitude of the one-dimensional flux power spectrum by tuning Gaussian field correlations and transformation parameters. Across the DESI Early Data Release (EDR) redshift range ($2.0 \leq z \leq 3.8$), and a wide range of scales ($10^{-4}$ s km$^{-1} \leq k \leq 1.0$ s km$^{-1}$), our mocks recover the mean flux evolution with redshift to sub-percent accuracy, and the P1D at the percent level. Additionally, we discuss potential extensions of this framework, such as the incorporation of astrophysical contaminants, continuum uncertainties, and instrumental effects. Such improvements would expand its utility in ongoing and upcoming surveys and enable a broader range of validation efforts and systematics studies for P1D inference and precision cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physical properties of long-rising type II Supernovae – Bayesian Analytic Modeling and Spectrophotometric Correlations</a><span class="id">[2510.25018]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernova (SN) 1987A, with its long-rising ($\gtrsim$40 days) light curve, defines a rare subclass of type II SNe known as 1987A-like events. Representing only $\sim$1-3\% of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of 1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive 1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i) lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\sim$0.07 M$_\odot$), similar to SN 1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\sim$5 foe) with larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale. An anti-correlation between Ba II line strength and photospheric velocity indicates that stronger Ba II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable and accurate modeling of the growing number of peculiar transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic field generation in mergers of massive main sequence stars</a><span class="id">[2512.13424]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic fields are found in many astrophysical objects, ranging from galaxy clusters to the interstellar medium of galaxies and neutron stars. Strong magnetic fields are also observed in massive stars, but it is still unclear how they are generated. There are different theories for their origin: the magnetic fields could be fossil fields from star formation, they could be generated in dynamo processes during stellar evolution, or they could be generated during a merger of two stars. Here, we show how magnetic fields are generated in simulations of mergers of massive main-sequence stars, conducted with the 3D magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO. In these simulations, a $9\,M_\odot$ and a $8\,M_\odot$ main sequence star merge, whereby the more massive star transfers mass to the less massive one until it is finally disrupted, forming a core-disk structure. During the initial mass transfer, magnetic fields start to be amplified in the accretion stream, saturating after the disruption at an equipartition level. Correspondingly, the magnetic energy starts being present at small scales, growing to larger scales during the merger. During the merger, the magnetic pressure is much smaller than the gas pressure, thus the dynamical impact of the magnetic fields on the merger is small. After the merger, both are similar in some regions, and the magnetic field shows a large-scale structure that is mostly toroidal and that is expected to be stable. Thus, our simulations show that magnetic fields in massive stars can originate from a merger of two main sequence stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding the chemistry of temperate exoplanets atmospheres through experimental and numerical simulations</a><span class="id">[2512.16421]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Characterizing temperate exoplanet atmospheres remains challenging due to their small size and low temperatures. Recent JWST observations provide valuable data, but their interpretation has led to diverging conclusions. Complementary approaches combining laboratory experiments and photochemical modeling are essential for constraining atmospheric chemistry and interpreting observations. We aim to identify chemical pathways governing the formation and evolution of neutral species and to assess their sensitivity to key parameters such as C/O ratio and metallicity. Our approach combines experimental and numerical simulations on H2-rich gas mixtures representative of sub-Neptune atmospheres, spanning a wide range of CH4, CO, and CO2 mixing ratios. A cold plasma reactor simulates out-of-equilibrium upper-atmospheric chemistry. A 0D photochemical model reproduces reactor conditions, guiding interpretation of key pathways and abundance trends. We observe the formation of both reduced and oxidized organic compounds. In CH4-rich mixtures, hydrocarbons form efficiently through methane chemistry, correlating with CH4 concentration and agreeing with models. In more oxidizing environments, particularly CO2-rich mixtures, hydrocarbon formation is inhibited by complex reaction networks and oxidative losses. Oxygen incorporation enhances chemical diversity and promotes formation of oxidized organic compounds of prebiotic interest (H2CO, CH3OH, CH3CHO), especially in atmospheres containing both CH4 and CO2. Atmospheres containing CH4 and CO, which balance carbon and oxygen supply without excessive oxidative destruction, favor efficient production of hydrocarbons and oxidized compounds. Out-of-equilibrium chemistry plays a key role in the diversification and organic complexification of temperate exoplanet atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diffusive or Ballistic? Distributions and Spectra of PeV Cosmic Rays around Microquasars</a><span class="id">[2512.17994]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the standard Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) paradigm, protons are accelerated up to  1 PeV by Galactic sources. While supernova remnants (SNRs) have been traditionally considered as the primary accelerators, recent observations by LHAASO and HAWC have detected very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays exceeding 100 TeV from several microquasars, suggesting that these X-ray binaries can accelerate CRs beyond 1 PeV. We investigate the escape process of CRs from microquasars, focusing on the energy-dependent transport mechanisms. High-energy CRs are likely to have long mean free paths and move ballistically on scales smaller than their mean free path, while lower-energy CRs undergo diffusive propagation. This transition results in a spectral break in the CR distribution around the microquasar. We calculate CR energy spectra within a 10-30 pc radius for various diffusion coefficients and timescales. Our model predicts a spectral break and hardening at E_p  10-100 TeV when the standard diffusion coefficient for the interstellar space is assumed. However, current VHE gamma-ray observations do not show clear spectral breaks, suggesting that the diffusion coefficient may be significantly reduced near microquasars, possibly due to magnetic field amplification by CR-driven turbulence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02028" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disc Winds From Accreting Systems in the 2040s</a><span class="id">[2601.02028]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>What does the temporal evolution of disc winds tell us about accreting systems and the accretion process? Studies of accretion-disc outflows across all mass scales, including accreting white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei, have shown that winds play a key role in regulating both the accretion flow and the surrounding environment. Disc winds therefore provide a common thread linking a broad range of scientific topics, from the microphysics of accretion to galaxy-scale feedback and evolution, as well as binary evolution and the predicted rates of energetic (multi-messenger) transient phenomena. Yet we still lack a comprehensive picture of the accretion-feedback process. Optical spectroscopy has revealed striking similarities across mass scales, hinting at common production mechanisms, and has shown that winds can evolve on timescales of only minutes. Progress, however, has been limited by their transient nature, sparse time coverage, and the lack of simultaneous, high-resolution spectroscopy. Time-domain facilities with high temporal and spectral resolution will allow us to track these events in high accretion-rate systems, constrain their launching mechanisms, and measure the mass, energy, and angular momentum they carry. This will provide crucial input for binary evolution models, wind feedback, and a unified view of accreting systems across mass scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Collider Gravitational Waves sourced by Right-handed Neutrino production from Bubbles: Testing Seesaw, Leptogenesis and Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2601.02458]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study a minimal type-I seesaw framework in which a first-order phase transition (FOPT), driven by a singlet scalar, produces right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) through bubble collisions, realizing a cosmic-scale collider that probes ultra-high energy scales. The resulting RHN distribution sources novel low-frequency gravitational-waves (GWs) in addition to the standard bubble-collision contribution. A stable lightest RHN can account for the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance for masses as low as $M_{1} \equiv m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, with the associated novel GW signal accessible in LISA, ET and upcoming LVK detectors. If the RHNs are unstable, their CP-violating decays generate the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis for $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and phase transition temperatures $T_* \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, for which the novel GW spectrum is detectable in ET, BBO and upcoming LVK. If RHN decays also populate a dark-sector fermion with mass $m_{\chi} \in [10^{-4},10^{4}],\mathrm{GeV}$, successful co-genesis of baryons and asymmetric dark matter occurs for $T_* \gtrsim 10^{7}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, naturally explaining $\Omega_{\rm DM} \simeq 5\Omega_{\rm B}$. The corresponding GW signals are testable with LISA, ET, and BBO. Finally, we analyze a UV-complete multi-Majoron model, based on a global $U(1)_N \times U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ extension, motivated from the hierarchy of lepton masses, which we dub as Mojaron collider. The corresponding FOPT in this model leaves a distinctive GW signature arising from RHN production during $U(1)_N$ symmetry breaking detectable by BBO, ET and upcoming LVK. Successful leptogenesis is realized for heaviest RHN mass $M_3 \sim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and a $U(1)_N$ breaking vev $v_2 \sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$, which sets the seesaw scale.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cluster number counts in dark energy model with energy and momentum coupling to dark matter</a><span class="id">[2601.11270]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The influences on the cluster number counts from the coupling between dark energy and dark matter with momentum transfer are investigated. We find that the extrapolated linear density contrast computed from the spherical collapse model is suppressed when the strength of momentum transfer is increased. Using the Sheth-Tormen mass function, the cluster number counts are computed. The minimum mass limit in the mass integration for each redshift bin is determined by matching the predicted number counts from the $\Lambda$CDM model with the result from eROSITA surveys. We find that the number of clusters is maximal at a higher redshift bin, and the number of clusters in a maximum redshift bin is enhanced when the strength of momentum and energy transfers increases due to the reduction of extrapolated linear density contrast. Setting the parameters of the dark energy model with momentum coupling according to the observational constraints in \cite{bestfit}, the predicted number counts from the coupled dark energy is larger than the result from eROSITA surveys. The statistical analysis yields a $p$-value of 0.189 for the proposed model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Consequently, there is no statistically significant evidence of an improved fit over the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework based on the eROSITA cluster number counts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12501" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational Signatures of Planetary Tidal Disruption Events Around Solar-Mass Stars</a><span class="id">[2601.12501]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The tidal disruption of planets by their host stars represents a growing area of interest in transient astronomy, offering insights into the final stages of planetary system evolution. We model the hydrodynamic evolution and predict the multi-wavelength observational signatures of planetary TDEs around a solar-mass host, focusing on Jupiter-like and Neptune-like progenitors and examining how different eccentricities of the planet's pre-disruption orbit shape the morphology and emission of the tidal debris. We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations using the FARGO3D code to model the formation and viscous evolution of the resulting debris disk. We employ a viscous alpha-disk prescription and include a time-dependent energy equation to compute the disk's effective temperature and subsequently derive the bolometric and multi-band photometric light curves. Our simulations show that planetary TDEs produce a diverse range of luminous transients. A Jupiter-like planet disrupted from a circular orbit at the Roche limit generates a transient peaking at $L_{bol} \approx 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ after a 12-day rise. In contrast, the same planet on an eccentric orbit (e=0.5) produces a transient of comparable peak luminosity but on a much shorter timescale, peaking in only 1 day and followed by a highly volatile light curve. We find that the effect of eccentricity is not universal, as it accelerates the event for Jupiter but delays it for Neptune. A robust &quot;bluer-when-brighter&quot; colour evolution is a common feature as the disk cools over its multi-year lifetime. The strong dependence of light curve morphology on the initial orbit and progenitor mass makes these events powerful diagnostics. This framework is crucial for identifying planetary TDEs in time-domain surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A multi-wavelength study of the 2025 low state of the intermediate polar BG CMi</a><span class="id">[2601.14156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present multi-wavelength observations of the first recorded low state of the intermediate polar BG CMi. Optical monitoring of the source by members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers reveals a decrease of  0.5 mag that lasted  50 d in early 2025. During the low state the optical timing properties imply that BG CMi underwent a change in the accretion mode, as power at the spin frequency $\omega$ dramatically dropped. An XMM-Newton observation revealed a substantial decrease in intrinsic absorption and a slight increase in intrinsic X-ray luminosity, compared to archival Suzaku data. Timing analysis of the X-ray light curves shows that power shifted from the orbital frequency $\Omega$ (prominent in Suzaku data) to $2\Omega$ in the low state XMM-Newton data, along with the strengthening of certain orbital sidebands. We suggest that BG CMi transitioned to disk-overflow accretion, where the white dwarf accreted matter via both a disk and a stream, the latter becoming more dominant during the low state due to a decrease in the mass and size of the disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scalar and vector dark matter admixed neutron stars with linear and quadratic couplings</a><span class="id">[2407.16386]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the effects of dark scalar- and vector-mediated interactions on dark matter admixed neutron stars, employing the two-fluid formalism. We adopt three different nuclear equations of state – BSk22, MPA1 and APR4 – to describe the baryonic sector, while the dark component consists of fermionic particles within a relativistic mean field framework. We consider both linear and quadratic scalar interactions with the dark fermion, including a quartic self-interaction in the latter case. The parameters of the dark matter models are inferred via a Bayesian analysis that incorporates data from NICER observations and binary neutron star merger detections. The neutron star configurations obtained from the selected model parameters develop dark matter cores, leading to more compact objects with smaller masses and radii. Our findings suggest that scalar interactions generally have a weaker impact on the stellar structure compared to vector-mediated ones, though quantitative differences arise. In particular, quadratic scalar couplings suppress the net attractive interaction, allowing for larger dark matter fractions to be accreted. We also compute the sound speed of DM, finding that the scalar and quadratic interactions modify the stiffness of the dark equation of state while respecting causality: vector repulsion enhances the sound speed, whereas scalar attraction tends to soften it. We compare our results with GW1708017, GW190425 and NICER data and constrain DM couplings and mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studying Ionospheric Phase Structure Functions Using Wide-Band uGMRT (Band-4) Interferometric Data</a><span class="id">[2507.08823]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interferometric observations of the low-frequency radio sky ($&lt;$ 1 GHz) are largely limited by systematic effects introduced by the ionosphere. In this study, we use a ten-hour nighttime observation of the bright radio source 3C48, carried out with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), to examine how ionospheric conditions affect radio signals. We focus on measuring phase fluctuations caused by the ionosphere and analyse how these variations change with antenna separation using the spatial phase structure function. Our results, based on data from three sub-bands between 575 and 725 MHz, show a clear power-law trend consistent with turbulent behaviour. We introduce the diffractive scale as a scalar measure of ionospheric conditions, which could guide future calibration strategies. Furthermore, we find that the turbulence is anisotropic, with properties that vary by direction. The smallest diffractive scales do not always align with Earth's magnetic field, suggesting the influence of medium-scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs). The contribution of these wave-like MSTIDs to the structure function follows a power-law with a slope close to 2.0, indicating their dominant role in shaping the observed anisotropic phase fluctuations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speed of sound peak in isospin QCD: a natural prediction of the Medium Separation Scheme</a><span class="id">[2507.14343]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present predictions for the zero-temperature equation of state at finite isospin density using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model within the medium separation scheme (MSS) – a scheme that explicitly disentangles medium effects from the ultraviolet divergent vacuum terms.

These findings have attracted significant theoretical interest, as established models – including the NJL model – failed to anticipate this behavior prior to lattice simulations.

Here we search for signals associated with a Vela glitch on 29 April 2024 in data of the two LIGO detectors from the fourth LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA observing run. We search both for seconds-scale burst-like emission, primarily from fundamental (f-)mode oscillations, and for longer quasi-monochromatic transients up to four months in duration, primarily from quasi-static quadrupolar deformations. We find no significant detection candidates, but for the first time we set direct observational upper limits on gravitational strain amplitude that are stricter than what can be indirectly inferred from the overall glitch energy scale.
