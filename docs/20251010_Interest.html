<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Quantum Formalism Revisited</a><span class="id">[2506.16480]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For the simple system of a point-like particle confined to a straight line, I compile, initially in a concise table, the structural elements of quantum mechanics and contrast them with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences, resulting from the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal structure. The latter was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify their quantifications by the variance and entropic indeterminacy inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and others.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effectiveness of Quota Policies Across STEM, Biological, and Humanities Programs</a><span class="id">[2510.08261]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine more than a decade of quota policy at Unesp, analyzing Physics, Biology, and Pedagogy as representative programs of distinct assessment styles. Quotas show little impact in Physics, where the admission barrier is low, and in Pedagogy, where high pass rates make it difficult to differentiate students, but they reveal systematic differences in Biology. Focusing the analysis on Calculus I - an introductory course in Physics and other Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs - for which much larger statistics are available, a clear hierarchy emerges: students admitted through open competition perform best, those from public schools achieve intermediate results, and students from racial quotas perform worst. When students are divided directly by the admittance exam grade, the performance difference is even clearer. Statistical analysis also shows that, contrary to expectation, the probability of passing decreases as the number of attempts increases, indicating that initial educational gaps are difficult to overcome within higher education.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chained computerized adaptive testing for the Force Concept Inventory</a><span class="id">[2410.18531]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although conceptual assessment tests are commonly administered at the beginning and end of a semester, this pre-post approach has inherent limitations. Specifically, education researchers and instructors have limited ability to observe the progression of student conceptual understanding throughout the course. Furthermore, instructors are limited in the usefulness of the feedback they can give to the students involved. To address these challenges, we propose an alternative approach that leverages computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and increasing the frequency of CAT-based assessments during the course, while reducing the test length per administration, thus keeping or decreasing the total number of test items administered throughout the course. The feasibility of this idea depends on how far the test length per administration can be reduced without compromising the test accuracy and precision. Specifically, the overall test length is desired to be shorter than when the full assessment is administered as a pretest and subsequent post-test. To achieve this goal, we developed a CAT algorithm that we call Chain-CAT. This algorithm sequentially links the results of each CAT administration using collateral information. We developed the Chain-CAT algorithm using the items of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and analyzed the efficiency by numerical simulations. We found that collateral information significantly improved the test efficiency, and the overall test length could be shorter than the pre-post method. Without constraints for item balancing and exposure control, simulation results indicated that the efficiency of Chain-CAT is comparable to that of the pre-post method even if the length of each CAT administration is only 5 items and the CAT is administered 9 times throughout the semester.
