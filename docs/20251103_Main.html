A leading explanation invokes perturbations from distant companions, i.e., the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism, which can excite the eccentricities of initially wide-orbiting planets to values of order unity. The resulting tidal dissipation at periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbits to their observed configurations. While observations of orbital misalignment and distant companions support this scenario, theoretical models have struggled to reproduce the observed hot Jupiter occurrence rate. Population synthesis studies often predict that many source &quot;cold Jupiters&quot; are destroyed by tidal disruption during highly eccentric passages. We revisit this question with improved treatments of the mass loss and angular momentum return experienced by tidally perturbed planets. Numerical studies are performed by combining secular dynamical evolution with planetary structural evolution using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). We also use an analytical approach to estimate rates of tidal disruption and hot Jupiter survival. Our new population synthesis studies of giant planets in stellar binaries show that improved treatment of tidal mass loss enhances hot Jupiter survival by a factor of $\sim2-3$, yielding occurrence rates ($\gtrsim 0.5\%$ around FGK stars) consistent with observations. Angular momentum return from mass accreted onto the star may also produce a pileup of hot Jupiters near three-day orbital periods that is in statistical agreement with observations. These results suggest that EKL-driven high-eccentricity migration, when combined with realistic planetary mass loss, may be a dominant channel for hot Jupiter formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GW241011 and GW241110: Exploring Binary Formation and Fundamental Physics with Asymmetric, High-Spin Black Hole Coalescence</a><span class="id">[2510.26931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the observation of gravitational waves from two binary black hole coalescences during the fourth observing run of the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA detector network, GW241011 and GW241110. The sources of these two signals are characterized by rapid and precisely measured primary spins, non-negligible spin–orbit misalignment, and unequal mass ratios between their constituent black holes. These properties are characteristic of binaries in which the more massive object was itself formed from a previous binary black hole merger, and suggest that the sources of GW241011 and GW241110 may have formed in dense stellar environments in which repeated mergers can take place. As the third loudest gravitational-wave event published to date, with a median network signal-to-noise ratio of $36.0$, GW241011 furthermore yields stringent constraints on the Kerr nature of black holes, the multipolar structure of gravitational-wave generation, and the existence of ultralight bosons within the mass range $10^{-13}$–$10^{-12}$ eV.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observation and Modeling of Shear Evolution of Post-reconnection Flare Loops</a><span class="id">[2510.26943]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A solar flare releases magnetic energy by reconnecting field lines across a current sheet, thereby allowing their relaxation to a lower energy state. The maximum possible energy is released if all field lines relax to a current-free (potential) state. The progress of a flare's reconnection is often measured as the angle-complement between the observed post-reconnection flare loops and the polarity inversion line of the photospheric magnetic field: shear angle. Many observations have shown strong-to-weak shear evolution over the course of a flare. A field line's shear angle is, however, an imperfect measure of its relaxation. We develop a new technique for observationally inferring the three-dimensional structure of post-reconnection field lines, including their local twist, $\alpha$, which will vanish for potential fields. Our method fits loops in EUV images to extrapolations subject to constraints such as matching the feet of model field lines to observed flare ribbons. We apply the new method to an eruptive two-ribbon flare (SOL2014-12-18T22) which exhibits strong-to-weak shear-angle evolution. We find that, as the flare progresses, $\alpha$ decreases in post reconnection loops anchored to newly brightened ribbons. Our study demonstrates that post-reconnection magnetic field is neither potential nor linear force-free. The method quantifies, for the first time, the time-history of a flare's energetic relaxation. It also quantifies the increasing height of subsequently reconnected field, and the time delay between reconnection forming a flare loop and its appearance in EUV passbands. These results promise to enable improvements in both magnetic modeling and hydrodynamic modeling of flares.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zeeman Doppler mapping deconstructed</a><span class="id">[2510.26973]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aims. Magnetic and abundance maps of chemically peculiar (CP) stars, derived with the help of Zeeman Doppler mapping, have invariably been used as arguments against theories, in particular atomic diffusion theory. We intend to expose the fallacy of these claims. Methods. We have identified in the literature those (5) CP stars for which multiple maps have been published, all based on the same Zeeman Doppler mapping strategy. For each of these stars we have then carried out inter comparisons between the recovered distributions of magnetic field and of abundances. Results. Agreement between maps often turns out to be quite poor in regard to both abundances, field topology and absolute field strengths. Maps based on the same set of observations can differ considerably, even when they are coming from the same authors. Conclusions. It becomes clear that Zeeman Doppler mapping cannot be guaranteed to yield unique results. When a number of physically impossible magnetic geometries all provide good fits to the observed Stokes $IQUV$ profiles, these solutions must necessarily be spurious and cannot be used as constraints to diffusion theory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the unification of tidal disruption events with polarimetry</a><span class="id">[2510.27007]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes produce multi-wavelength emission, of which the optical emission is of ambiguous origin. A unification scenario of tidal disruption events (TDEs) has been proposed to explain the different classes of X-ray and optically selected events by introducing a dependence on the viewing angle and geometry. This work aims to test the unification scenario among optically bright TDEs using polarimetry. By studying the optical linear polarisation of 19 TDEs (of which 9 newly analysed in this work), we place constraints on their photosphere geometry, inclination, and the emission process responsible for the optical radiation. We study how these properties correlate with the relative X-ray brightness. We find that 14/16 non-relativistic events can be accommodated by the unification model. Continuum polarisation levels of optical TDEs lie most often in the range P   1-2% (13 events), and for all except one event, remain below 6%. For those optical TDEs that have multi-epoch polarimetry, the continuum polarisation decreases after peak light for 5/10 events, increases for 3/10 events, and stays nearly constant for 2/10 events. When observed after +70 days (7/16 events), they become consistent with P = 0% within uncertainties (5/7 events). This implies the photosphere geometries of TDEs are at least initially asymmetric and evolve rapidly which, if tracing the formation of the accretion disk, suggests efficient circularisation. The polarisation signatures of emission lines of 7 TDEs directly support a scenario in which optical light is reprocessed in an electron-scattering photosphere. [...] However, a subset of events deviates from the unification model to some extent, suggesting this model may not fully capture the diverse behaviour of TDEs. Multi-epoch polarimetry plays a key role in understanding the evolution and emission mechanisms of TDEs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direct multi-model dark-matter search with gravitational-wave interferometers using data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run</a><span class="id">[2510.27022]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational-wave detectors can probe the existence of dark matter with exquisite sensitivity. Here, we perform a search for three kinds of dark matter – dilatons (spin-0), dark photons (spin-1) and tensor bosons (spin-2) – using three independent methods on the first part of the most recent data from the fourth observing run of LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA. Each form of dark matter could have interacted with different standard-model particles in the instruments, causing unique differential strains on the interferometers. While we do not find any evidence for a signal, we place the most stringent upper limits to-date on each of these models. For scalars with masses between $[4\times 10^{-14},1.5\times 10^{-13}]$ eV that couple to photons or electrons, our constraints improve upon those from the third observing run by one order of magnitude, with the tightest limit of $\sim 10^{-20}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ at a mass of $\sim2\times 10^{-13}\text{ eV}$. For vectors with masses between $[7\times 10^{-13},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV that couple to baryons, our constraints supersede those from MICROSCOPE and Eöt-Wash by one to two orders of magnitude, reaching a minimum of $\sim 5\times 10^{-24}$ at a mass of $\sim 10^{-12}$ eV. For tensors with masses of $[4\times 10^{-14},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV (the full mass range analyzed) that couple via a Yukawa interaction, our constraints surpass those from fifth-force experiments by four to five orders of magnitude, achieving a limit as low as $\sim 8\times 10^{-9}$ at $\sim2\times 10^{-13}$ eV. Our results show that gravitational-wave interferometers have become frontiers for new physics and laboratories for direct multi-model dark-matter detection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">When Magnetic Field Lines Stretch, Snap, and Expand: A New Look at Solar Flares with L-maps</a><span class="id">[2510.27024]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during solar flares remains challenging due to the lack of direct coronal field measurements. Here we combine data-driven MHD simulations of NOAA AR 11158 (Fan et al., 2024) with flare-ribbon and coronal-dimming observations to investigate realistic coronal magnetic-field evolution during an X-class flare. We introduce L-maps, maps of the logarithm of magnetic field line lengths, as a diagnostic tool to track the dynamics of simulated coronal magnetic structures. Variations in L-maps identify flare ribbons through field-line shortening and coronal dimmings through field-line lengthening. Comparison with SDO/AIA observations demonstrates strong morphological and temporal agreement, validating the simulated field evolution. Applying K-means clustering to the L-map temporal profiles, we distinguish three stages of coronal evolution: (1) slow pre-flare rise phase, (2) flare reconnection accompanied by CME rise, and (3) post-reconnection CME expansion. We detect a slow pre-flare rise phase of magnetic field lines rooted in ribbon footpoints and identify a new phenomenon, reconnection dimming, a rapid expansion of reconnected inner flux-rope field lines during the impulsive phase. Our results show that L-maps provide a powerful and physically intuitive framework for bridging simulations and observations and for tracking the full three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during flares.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27059" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The He I D3 Line as a Proxy for Magnetic Activity using EXPRES Solar Observations</a><span class="id">[2510.27059]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar activity remains one of the primary challenges in the detection and characterization of low-mass exoplanets, as it can induce radial velocity (RV) variations that mask or mimic planetary signals. Identifying reliable activity proxies is essential in order to distinguish stellar variability from genuine planetary signatures. In this study, we examine the variability of the chromospheric He I D3 line in high-resolution solar spectra and assess its potential as an activity indicator. We find a strong correlation between the He I D3 line intensity variation and the Sun's unsigned magnetic flux derived from SDO HMI data as well as with the solar RVs. Our results suggest that the He I D3 line offers a promising and straightforward proxy for magnetic activity, which may complement existing stellar activity indicators. Its inclusion could help disentangle stellar signals in RV measurements and ultimately improve the detection of Earth-like exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27092" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micrometeoroid Impacts: Dual Pathways for Iron Reduction and Oxidation on Lunar and Asteroidal Surfaces</a><span class="id">[2510.27092]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nanophase metallic iron ( $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ ) is a key indicator of space weathering on the lunar surface, primarily attributed to solar wind irradiation and micrometeoroid impacts. Recent discoveries of hematite ( $\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{O}_3$ ), a highly oxidized form of iron, in the lunar polar regions challenge the prevailing understanding of the Moon's reducing environment. This study, using ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations of micrometeoroid impacts on fayalite ( $\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{SiO}_4$ ), investigates the atomistic mechanisms leading to both reduced and oxidized iron species. Our simulations reveals that the high-temperature and pressure conditions at the impact crater surface produces a reduced iron environment while providing a transient oxygen-rich environment in the expanding plume. Our findings bridge previously disparate observations-linking impact-driven $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ formation to the puzzling presence of oxidized iron phases on the Moon, completing the observed strong dichotomous distribution of hematite between the nearside and farside of the Moon. These findings highlight that micrometeoroid impacts, by simultaneously generating spatially distinct redox environments, provide a formation mechanism that reconciles the ubiquitous identification of nanophase metallic iron ( $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ ) in returned lunar samples with $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ signatures detected by remote sensing. This underscores the dynamic nature of space weathering processes. For a more nuanced understanding of regolith evolution, we should also consider the presence of different generations or types of $\mathrm{npFe}{ }^0$, such as those formed from solar wind reduction versus impact disproportionation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Physical Origin of Periodic Density Structures in the Solar Wind: Coronal Streamers as Magnetohydrodynamic Resonators</a><span class="id">[2510.27149]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive physical model explaining the origin of Periodic Density Structures (PDS) observed in white-light coronagraphs with characteristic periods of approximately 45, 80, and 120 minutes. Through systematic investigation of potential resonant cavities in the solar atmosphere, we demonstrate that traditional large-scale cavities yield fundamentally incompatible periods: photosphere-transition region (3.3 minutes), transition region-sonic point (10.3 hours), and transition region-heliopause (7.7 years). We establish that coronal streamers act as natural magnetohydrodynamic resonators, with calculated harmonic periods of 122, 61, and 41 minutes that precisely match observations. The physical mechanism involves slow magnetoacoustic standing waves that create periodic density enhancements through wave compression, with the streamer resonator having quality factor Q   10-100, enabling natural amplification of broadband coronal noise. At streamer cusps, these density enhancements trigger magnetic reconnection, releasing plasma blobs into the solar wind at resonant periods. The model provides complete energy budget calculations, wave amplitude estimates, and explains all key observational features including spatial localization, period coherence, and the relationship between remote sensing and in situ measurements. This work establishes streamer resonators as fundamental structures shaping solar wind variability and provides a new framework for understanding the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent astrophysical plasmas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27162" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two-Stage Nature of a Solar Flare with Parallel and Semi-Circular Ribbons</a><span class="id">[2510.27162]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Flare ribbons with parallel and circular morphologies are typically associated with different magnetic reconnection models, and the simultaneous observation of both types in a single event remains rare. Using multi-wavelength observations from a tandem of instruments, we present an M8.2-class flare that occurred on 2023 September 20, which produced quasi-parallel and semi-circular ribbons. The complex evolution of the flare includes two distinct brightening episodes in the quasi-parallel ribbons, corresponding to the two major peaks in the hard X-ray (HXR) light curve. In contrast, the brightening of semi-circular ribbons temporally coincides with the local minimum between the two peaks. Using potential field extrapolation, we reconstruct an incomplete dome-like magnetic structure with a negative polarity embedded within the northwestern part of the semi-circular positive polarity. Consequently, the magnetic configuration comprises two sets of field lines with distinct magnetic connectivities. We suggest that the standard flare reconnection accounts for the two-stage brightening of quasi-parallel ribbons associated with the two HXR peaks. Between the two stages, this process is constrained by the interaction of eruptive structures with the dome. The interaction drives the quasi-separatrix layer reconnection, leading to the brightening of semi-circular ribbons. It also suppresses the standard flare reconnection, resulting in a delayed second HXR peak.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dense Circumstellar Medium around Pulsating Massive Stars Powering Interacting Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2510.27189]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between $12-20~M_\odot$ focusing on the effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning.

As a complementary probe to the galaxy density power spectrum, we incorporate the pairwise kSZ power spectrum detected with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N $\sim 7$) to derive constraints on cosmological parameters ($H_0 = 71.16^{+5.09}_{-5.50}$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.276^{+0.086}_{-0.067}$, $w_0 = -0.971^{+0.236}_{-0.380}$) and the average optical depth of the galaxy sample ($\lg\bar{\tau} = -4.22 \pm +0.09$). Compared to the GC-only analysis, the joint analysis yields tighter constraints on these cosmological parameters: the Figures of Merits (FoMs) improve by 29.3%, 32.3% and 21.5% for the $H_0$–$\Omega_{\rm m}$, $H_0$–$w_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$–$w_0$ contours. For the first time, we demonstrate the complementary applicability of the kSZ effect in constrain cosmological parameters from real observational data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of stellar magnetic activity: probing planet engulfment by red giants</a><span class="id">[2510.27295]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fraction of low-mass (LM) stars (M &lt;= 1.5 Msun) showing photospheric activity in their light curve is larger on the horizontal branch (HB) than during the previous red giant branch (RGB) phase, while the opposite trend has been observed for intermediate-mass (IM) stars (M &gt; 1.5 Msun). One hypothesis is that LM red giants (RGs) engulf more planets than IM RGs, which results in a faster surface rotation and a higher magnetic activity. Indeed, LM stars reach a maximum radius at the RGB tip that is much larger than for IM stars, making them more likely to engulf planets. However, we need to study the evolution of the active star fraction along the RGB to firmly check this hypothesis. I use independent indicators tracing the activity level in the chromosphere based on the Ca II H&amp;K, Halpha, Mg I and infrared Ca II spectral lines from LAMOST data for about 3000 RGs whose evolutionary stage has been identified by asteroseismology with the Kepler mission. I find that the fraction of active stars decreases for IM stars along the RGB but unexpectedly increases for LM stars. Such an increase is not explained by models of single-star evolution and is consistent with the fact that LM stars are more susceptible than IM stars of engulfing planets. Indeed, data shows that IM main-sequence stars exhibit a dearth of planets, consistently with predictions from planet formation theory. I also observe that the fraction of active stars tends to increase for both LM and IM stars on the HB, in partial contrast with previous findings. Finally, I discover that the IM RGB star KIC 9780154 may have engulfed one or more planet(s) as its surface rotation from photometry is twice faster than its envelope rotation from asteroseismology. Characterizing planet engulfment by RGs provides insights into the evolution and fate of most planetary systems, since about 97 % of stars pass through the RG evolution stage.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27373" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assessing the metal and rare earth element mining potential of undifferentiated asteroids through the study of carbonaceous chondrites</a><span class="id">[2510.27373]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Undifferentiated asteroids, particularly the parent bodies of carbon-rich chondrite groups, might be promising candidates for future space resource utilization due to their primitive composition and potential to host valuable metals and rare earth elements. However, our understanding of their bulk elemental composition remains limited, as most data are derived from reflectance spectra with low mineralogical resolution. Sample return missions have started to change that, as returned materials are already available to study. Still the available meteorites provide a valuable source of information about the diversity of undifferentiated asteroids in the interplanetary space. To improve compositional insights, we conducted Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and ICP-AES (Inductively coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy) analyses on a representative suite of carbonaceous chondrites. These meteorites, considered analogs of undifferentiated asteroids, preserve materials from the early solar system and provide a geochemical record of their parent bodies. Our results highlight the abundance and distribution of transition metals, siderophile elements, and rare earth elements across several chondrite groups.

It has been observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite in 41 sectors, yielding a total of 664,809 high-quality flux measurements. We model these data and published radial velocities to determine the physical properties of the system to high precision. The masses of the stars are 1.291 +/- 0.012 Msun and 1.193 +/- 0.009 Msun, and their radii are 1.278 +/- 0.004 Rsun and 1.122 +/- 0.003 Rsun. The high precision of the radius measurements is made possible by the (previously unrecorded) total eclipses and the extraordinary amount of data available. The light curves show spot modulation at the orbital period, and both stars rotate synchronously. Our determination of the distance to the system, 185.7 +/- 2.4 pc, agrees very well with the parallax distance of 185.39 +/- 0.39 pc from Gaia DR3. The properties of the system are consistent with theoretical predictions for an age of 600 +/- 200 Myr and a slightly super-solar metallicity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brightness variability in polar circumbinary disks</a><span class="id">[2510.27390]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In binary systems with a strongly misaligned disk, the central binary stars can travel a significant vertical distance above and below the disk's orbital plane.

We use both analytic and radiative transfer models to examine the effect of changes in stellar illumination on the appearance of the disk, particularly in the case of the polar disk HD 98800B. We find that the observed flux from the disk can vary significantly over the binary orbital period, producing a periodically varying lightcurve which peaks twice each binary orbit. The amount of flux variation is strongly influenced by the disk geometry. We suggest that these flux variations produce several observable signatures, and that these observables may provide constraints on different properties of the disk such as its vertical structure, geometry, and cooling rate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Penrose Process: Images of Split Hotspots and Their Observational Signatures</a><span class="id">[2510.27409]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While theoretically established for decades, the Penrose process - energy extraction from rotating black holes - still lacks clear observational evidence. A promising theoretical framework posits magnetic reconnection in the ergosphere as a trigger, causing a plasmoid to separate into an escaping positive-energy fragment and an infalling negative-energy one. In this work, we investigate the observational imprints of this scenario. We treat the energized plasmoid as a hotspot and calculate its light curves for a realistic plasma magnetization. In particular, we further compare with the scenario in which the plasmoid, after fragmentation, falls into the black hole with positive energy, while all other conditions remain unchanged. Our results reveal that the process of fragmentation generates distinct flares, whose characteristics depend heavily on whether the infalling fragment carries negative or positive energy. We propose that these differences serve as identifiable signatures of the Penrose process.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Earth-lens telescope for distant axion-like particle sources with stimulated backward reflection</a><span class="id">[2510.27416]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a novel telescope concept based on Earth's gravitational lensing effect, optimized for the detection of distant dark matter sources, particularly axion-like particles (ALPs). When a unidirectional flux of dark matter passes through Earth at sufficiently high velocity, gravitational lensing can concentrate the flux at a distant focal region in space. Our method combines this lensing effect with stimulated backward reflection (SBR), arising from ALP decays that are induced by directing a coherent electromagnetic beam toward the focal point. The aim of this work is to numerically analyze the structure of the focal region and to develop a framework for estimating the sensitivity to ALP-photon coupling via this mechanism. Numerical calculations show that, assuming an average ALP velocity of 520,km/s – as suggested by the observed stellar stream S1 – the focal region extends from $9 \times 10^9$,m to $1.4 \times 10^{10}$,m, with peak density near $9.6 \times 10^9$,m. For a conservative point-like ALP source located approximately 8,kpc from the solar system, based on the S1 stream, the estimated sensitivity in the eV mass range reaches $g/M = \mathcal{O}(10^{-22}),\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. This concept thus opens a path toward a general-purpose, space-based ALP observatory that could, in principle, detect more distant sources – well beyond $\mathcal{O}(10),\mathrm{kpc}$ – provided that ALP-photon coupling is sufficiently strong, that is, $M \ll M_\mathrm{Planck}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Shock to Synchrotron: a mini-review on magnetic turbulence in Supernova Remnants</a><span class="id">[2510.27431]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic turbulence plays a crucial role in confining charged particles near the shock front of Supernova Remnants, enabling them to reach energies up to hundreds of TeV through a process known as Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA). These high-energy electrons spiral along magnetic field lines, emitting X-ray synchrotron radiation. The launch of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) has opened a new window into the study of magnetic fields in SNRs through X-ray polarization measurements. For the first time, IXPE allows us to resolve the polarization degree (PD) and angle (PA) in the X-ray band across different areas of SNRs, offering direct insight into the geometry and coherence of magnetic fields on different scales. In this mini-review, I summarize the key observational results on SNRs obtained with IXPE over the past four years and discuss their implications for our understanding of magnetic turbulence in synchrotron-emitting regions. I also show how we can combine polarization parameters and standard X-ray spectral/imaging analysis to better constrain the structure and scale of magnetic turbulence immediately downstream of the shock and understand the particle acceleration occurring in SNRs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar Polar Field Reversals as the Result of the Global Magnetic field Meridional Flows</a><span class="id">[2510.27441]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Based on data obtained from Wilcox Solar Observatiry the solar polar magnetic fields reversals in cycles 21 – 25 were considered. The results indicate that the polarity reversal occurs at the maximum of sunspot activity of each cycle, but the beginning, end, and duration of the reversals did not demonstrate any association with the Wolf numbers, which are characteristics of local magnetic fields. Moreover, during the periods of polarity reversal, the correlation between global magnetic field (GMF) parameters and Wolf numbers decreased and even moved into anti-correlation mode. The polar field reversals are determined by the GMF flows of positive- and negative-polarity magnetic fields, which cyclically migrate from one pole to the opposite pole. The new polarity magnetic fields are delivered to the poles by a certain flow, and then carried away by the same flow to the opposite pole. The increase in the polar magnetic field strength to its maximal values at the solar activity minimum and following decrees to the next cycle maximum coincides with the latitudinal changes in corresponding magnetic field flow. Formulas for calculating the meridional circulation of positive- and negative-polarity magnetic field flows were proposed. They allow predict the time of polarity reversals, and since polarity reversals occur at the maxima of cycles, then also the time of maxima of both the future and past cycles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27468" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dust and Water in V883 Ori: Relics of a Retreating Snowline</a><span class="id">[2510.27468]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>V883 Ori is an FU-Orionis-type outburst system characterized by a shoulder at 50-70 au in its ALMA band 6 and 7 intensity profiles. Previously, this feature was attributed to dust pile-up from pebble disintegration at the water snowline. However, recent multi-wavelength observations show continuity in the spectral index across the expected snowline region, disfavoring abrupt changes in grain properties. Moreover, extended water emission is detected beyond 80 au, pointing to a snowline further out. This Letter aims to explain both features with a model in which the snowline is receding. We construct a 2D disk model that solves the cooling and subsequent vapor recondensation during the post-outburst dimming phase. Our results show that both the intensity shoulder and the extended water emission are natural relics of a retreating snowline: the shoulder arises from excess surface density generated by vapor recondensation at the moving condensation front, while the outer water vapor reservoir persists due to the long recondensation timescales of $10^{2}-10^{3}$ yr at the disk atmosphere. As V883 Ori continues to fade, we predict that the intensity shoulder will migrate inward by an observationally significant amount of 10 au over about 25 years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">52 Eclipsing Quadruple Star Candidates Discovered in TESS Full Frame Images</a><span class="id">[2510.27470]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the discovery of 52 eclipsing quadruple star candidates detected in TESS Full Frame Image eleanor data by machine learning and citizen scientists.

Detailed photocenter measurements confirmed that both sets of eclipses originate within  0.1-0.2 pixels ( 2-4 arcsec) of the corresponding target, and ruled out resolved nearby field stars. The catalog includes a number of systems producing prominent eclipse timing variations and/or apsidal motion, a quadruple with an outer period of  1,400 days, and even a 2+2 quadruple in a likely wide quintuple with a resolved co-moving star.

One possibility is to use parametric fits calibrated against $N$-body simulations, that capture the cosmological parameter dependence of the halo mass function. Several studies have shown that this can be obtained through a calibration against haloes with spherical masses defined at the virial overdensity. In contrast, if different mass definitions are used for the HMF and the scaling relation, a mapping between them is required. Here, we investigate the impact of such a mapping on the cosmological parameter constraints inferred from galaxy cluster number counts. Using synthetic data from $N$-body simulations, we show that the standard approach, which relies on assuming a concentration-mass relation, can introduce significant systematic bias. In particular, depending on the mass definition and the relation assumed, this can lead to biased constraints at more than 2$\sigma$ level. In contrast, we find that in all the cases we have considered, the mass conversion based on the halo sparsity statistics result in a systematic bias smaller than the statistical error.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27549" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing cosmological fluctuations in 21cm intensity maps with MeerKLASS: from maps to power spectra</a><span class="id">[2510.27549]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mapping the integrated 21cm emission line from dark matter-tracing neutral hydrogen gas is the primary science goal for MeerKLASS (MeerKAT's Large Area Synoptic Survey).

The 64-dish MeerKAT array, precursor to the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), can scan the sky in auto-correlation mode and perform intensity mapping across large sky areas, presenting the exciting potential for a wide-sky (${\gtrsim}\,10{,}000\,{\rm deg}^2$) spectroscopic survey across redshift $0.4\,{&lt;}\,z\,{&lt;}\,1.45$. Validating the auto-correlation (or single-dish) mode of observation for a multi-dish array and developing the analysis pipeline with which to make unbiased measurements has presented major challenges to this endeavour. In this work, we overview the advances in the field that have facilitated a robust analysis framework for single-dish intensity mapping, and review some results that showcase its success using early MeerKLASS surveys. We demonstrate our control of foreground cleaning, signal loss and map regridding to deliver detections of cosmological clustering within the intensity maps through cross-correlation power spectrum measurements with overlapping galaxy surveys.

While AWSoM-type models (Alfvén Wave Solar Model) have proven highly successful in reproducing the large-scale structure of the solar corona, they inherently neglect contributions from additional wave modes that arise when the effects of transverse structuring is fully incorporated into the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. In this paper, we compare the roles of kink wave- and Alfvén wave-driven heating in sustaining a region of the solar atmosphere, using newly developed physics and radiative cooling modules within MPI-AMRVAC. We extend the existing MHD physics module in MPI-AMRVAC by incorporating additional Alfvén and kink wave energy contributions to the MHD equations. We examine their roles in heating the solar atmosphere and driving the solar wind. To validate our approach, we compare numerical results from Python-based simulations with those obtained using the UAWSoM module in MPI-AMRVAC. Furthermore, we assess the heating efficiency of kink waves relative to that of pure Alfvén waves through two parameter studies: (1) exploring how different Alfvén wave reflection rates impact the simulated atmosphere, and (2) varying the relative magnitudes of Alfvén and kink wave energy injections. Finally, we present results from a larger-scale domain, sustained entirely by kink wave-driven heating. Our results show that kink wave-driven (UAWSoM) models are able to sustain a stable atmosphere without requiring any artificial background heating terms, unlike traditional Alfvén-only models. We attribute this to the increased heating rate associated with kink waves compared with Alfvén waves, given the same energy injection. Kink waves can sustain a model plasma with temperature and density values representative of coronal conditions without resorting to ad hoc heating terms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27579" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">String-induced vacuum decay</a><span class="id">[2510.27579]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>False vacuum decay typically proceeds via the nucleation of spherical bubbles of true vacuum, described by $O(4)$ symmetric field configurations in Euclidean time.

Assuming a non-trivial vacuum manifold, realizable for example in a simple sextic potential, we derive relativistic bounce solutions with $O(2) \times O(2)$ symmetry, corresponding to elongated bubbles seeded by a cosmic string of the same scalar field. Building up on earlier results in the literature, we identify the region of parameter space where vacuum decay predominantly proceeds via this alternative channel, thereby providing an explicit mechanism for the quantum decay of cosmic strings. Finally, we present an initial discussion of the gravitational wave signal associated with this type of vacuum decay and its possible connection to the recently observed stochastic signal in pulsar timing arrays.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27586" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Production of Gravitational Waves from Preheating and Tachyonic Instabilities</a><span class="id">[2510.27586]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze GW production during preheating for an $\alpha$-attractor potential terminating in the positive-curvature regime, with energy transfer via $\phi\chi^{2}$.

The $E_G$ statistic is a discriminating tool for modified gravity theories, which leave imprints in lensing observables and peculiar velocities. Existing $E_G$ measurements rely on redshift space distortions (RSD) to infer the velocity field. Here, we employ kSZ velocity-reconstruction instead of RSD, a complementary technique that constrains the largest-scale modes better than the galaxy survey it uses. We construct a novel $\widehat{V}_G$ estimator that involves a ratio between cross-correlations of a galaxy sample with a CMB convergence map and that with a 3D kSZ-reconstructed velocity field. We forecast for current and upcoming CMB maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Simons Observatory (SO), respectively, in combination with three spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We find cumulative detection significances in the range $S/N \sim 20-55$, which can robustly test the scale-independent $E_G$ prediction under general relativity (GR) at different effective redshifts of the galaxy samples ($z\approx 0.73, 1.33, 1.84$). In particular, the SO$\times$DESI LRG measurement would be able to distinguish between GR and certain modified gravity models, including Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ and Chameleon theories, with high confidence.

To date, PPM and EOS inference have been carried out as two separate steps, with the former using EOS-agnostic priors. This approach has several drawbacks. Ideally, one would perform a fully hierarchical Bayesian inference where the pulse profile and EOS model parameters are jointly fit, but implementing such a framework is complex and computationally demanding. Here, we present an intermediate solution introducing an EOS-informed prior on mass-radius into the existing PPM pipeline using normalizing flows. By focusing on the parameter space consistent with certain EOSs, this approach both tightens constraints on neutron star parameters while reducing computational costs and requiring minimal additional implementation effort. We test this approach on two pulsars, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715, and with two EOS model families: a model based on the speed of sound inside the neutron star interior (CS) and a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model. Both EOS models implement constraints from chiral effective field theory calculations of dense matter. For both pulsar datasets, the inferred radius credible intervals are narrower than in the EOS-agnostic case, with CS favoring smaller radii and PP favoring larger radii. For PSR J0437-4715, the EOS-informed priors reveal a new, more extreme geometric mode that is statistically favored but physically questionable. Including the PPM posteriors in the subsequent EOS inference further tightens the mass-radius posteriors through the chiral effective field theory constraints. However, there is also a sensitivity to the high-density extensions, where the PP (CS) model produces a shift towards larger (smaller) radii and corresponding stiffening (softening) of the pressure-energy density relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2024cld: unveiling the complex mass-loss histories of evolved supergiant progenitors to core collapse supernovae</a><span class="id">[2510.27631]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pre-explosion mass loss in supernova (SN) progenitors is a crucial unknown factor in stellar evolution, yet has been illuminated recently by the diverse zoo of interacting transients. We present SN2024cld, a transitional core-collapse SN at a distance of 39 Mpc, straddling the boundary between SN II and SN IIn, showing persistent interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) similar to H-rich SN1998S and PTF11iqb. The SN was discovered and classified just 12h post-explosion via the GOTO-FAST high-cadence program. Optical spectroscopy, photometry, and polarimetry over 220d chart the complex, long-lived interaction in this transient. Early evolution is dominated by CSM interaction, showing a 14d rise to a peak absolute magnitude of g=-17.6 mag, with clear flash-ionisation signatures. SN2024cld also shows a marked double-plateau light curve powered by CSM interaction, with high-velocity (6000 km/s) shoulders on a strong multi-component H-alpha profile. Dense polarimetric coverage reveals marked evolution in the photospheric geometry – peaking at p=2% 10 days post-explosion, and rotating approx. 60 deg as the ejecta sweep more distant CSM. We observe a narrow 60 km/s H-alpha P Cygni feature throughout, associated with pre-shock CSM. SN2024cld represents among the best-observed 98S-like SNe to date, revealing a multi-component CSM structure: a dense, inner aspherical envelope, CSM disk/torus, and tenuous, extended wind. We propose this SN arose from an evolved supergiant progenitor experiencing multiple mass loss episodes in its terminal years, with binary interaction plausibly generating the CSM disk. SN2024cld constrains the progenitors and mass-loss paradigms of 98S-like SNe, unveiling the chaotic ends of evolved supergiant stars from afar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27635" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Decade of Solar High-Fidelity Spectroscopy and Precise Radial Velocities from HARPS-N</a><span class="id">[2510.27635]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We recently released 10 years of HARPS-N solar telescope and the goal of this manuscript is to present the different optimisations made to the data reduction, to describe data curation, and to perform some analyses that demonstrate the extreme RV precision of those data.

After correction, we demonstrate a peak-to-peak precision on the HARPS-N wavelength solution better than 0.75 m/s over 13 years. We then carefully curate the decade of HARPS-N re-reduced solar observations by rejecting 30% of the data affected either by clouds, bad atmospheric conditions or well-understood instrumental systematics. Finally, we correct the curated data for spurious sub-m/s RV effects caused by erroneous instrumental drift measurements and by changes in the spectral blaze function over time. After curation and correction, a total of 109,466 HARPS-N solar spectra and respective RVs over a decade are available. The median photon-noise precision of the RV data is 0.28 m/s and, on daily timescales, the median RV rms is 0.49 m/s, similar to the level imposed by stellar granulation signals. On 10-year timescales, the large RV rms of 2.95 m/s results from the RV signature of the Sun's magnetic cycle. When modelling this long-term effect using the Magnesium II activity index, we demonstrate a long-term RV precision of 0.41 m/s. We also analysed contemporaneous HARPS-N and NEID solar RVs and found the data from both instruments to be of similar quality and precision, with an overall RV differece rms of 0.79 m/s. This decade of high-cadence HARPS-N solar observations with short- and long-term precision below 1 m/s represents a crucial dataset to further understand stellar activity signals in solar-type stars , and to advance other science cases requiring such an extreme precision.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray and UV Observations of the Young Sun HIP 67522: Evidence of Lyman-alpha Absorption Within the Planetary System</a><span class="id">[2510.27639]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy of the 17 Myr, G0V star, HIP 67522. The UV spectrum is characterized by strong chromospheric and transition region emission lines. There was moderate spectral variability during the observations consisting of 15% stochastic fluctuation and two small flares releasing $E_{UV} \simeq 2-4\times10^{32}$ ergs in each event. We compare the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED; 4.7 A - 13.0 $\mu$m) of the star first presented in Thao et al. (2024) to the solar SED and show that X-ray/UV (XUV) flux density at 1 AU is $10^{2}-10^{5}$ stronger (from 1000 A down to 5 A) in the young star compared to the present-day Sun. Attempts to reconstruct the intrinsic Ly-alpha emission of the star failed to return physically realistic results. The discrepancy appears to arise from a population of neutral hydrogen within the system itself, extending to $&gt; \pm500$ km/s. The absorption could be due to outflow from exoplanet atmospheric loss or from a stellar component; such a picture would require high spectral resolution observations and/or UV transit spectroscopy to confirm. Finally, we examine the evolution of the XUV emission from solar-type stars from ages of 17 Myr to 9.4 Gyr and derive a scaling relation between FUV Ly-alpha and EUV emission as a function of stellar age. X-ray (1–100 A) and EUV (100–900 A) contributions to high energy emission are 329 and 672 ergs/cm^2/s at 1 AU, respectively, suggesting that both may contribute to exoplanet heating at this epoch. The XUV emission levels at 17 Myr combined with the low density of the planet HIP67522b are consistent with models that predict that solar type stars born with high rotation and activity levels will drive substantial heating and escape on close-in, gaseous planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing cosmic isotropy with Gamma-ray bursts: A dipole and quadrupole analysis of BATSE and Fermi GBM data</a><span class="id">[2510.27644]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmological principle, asserting large-scale homogeneity and isotropy, underpins the standard model of cosmology. Testing its validity using independent astronomical probes remains crucial for understanding the global structure of the Universe. We investigate the angular distribution of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) using two of the most comprehensive all-sky datasets available, the BATSE (CGRO) and Fermi GBM catalog to test the isotropy of the GRB sky at large angular scales. We perform spherical harmonic decomposition of the GRB sky maps and estimate the dipole and quadrupole amplitudes. Statistical significance is evaluated by comparing the observed multipole amplitudes against distributions derived from 500 Monte Carlo realizations of isotropic skies. Our results show that the observed dipole amplitudes for both BATSE and Fermi GBM datasets lie within $1\sigma$ region of their respective null distributions. However, the quadrupole amplitude in the raw BATSE and Fermi skies appears elevated at $3.7\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ respectively. After incorporating the BATSE sky exposure function, this apparent quadrupole anisotropy vanishes, indicating that instrumental non-uniformities fully account for the signal. Our method's reliability is validated through controlled simulations, which show it can detect the injected dipoles in BATSE-sized isotropic skies. These findings reinforce the statistical isotropy of the GRB sky and underscore the importance of accurate exposure corrections in cosmological anisotropy analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breaking Eternal Inflation: Empirical Viability of a Spontaneous Collapse Scenario</a><span class="id">[2510.26378]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit an inflationary scenario in which primordial inhomogeneities arise from a quantum collapse, a stochastic mechanism described in the context of quantum collapse theories in its continuous version and within semiclassical gravity.

Furthermore, this model can contribute to accounting for the lack of power anomaly in the low $l$ angular power spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

However, since it is difficult to reproduce astrophysical conditions in laboratories, PDR was previously observed only in $J = 1$ spin states. Here we report the first experimental observation of $J &gt; 1$ components of PDR, identified in the $\beta$-delayed $\gamma$ decay of the J$^{\pi}$ = 3$^{-}$ spin-parity isomer of $^{80}$Ga. The data analysis, combined with decay information and theoretical calculations allows the identification of resonant structures below the neutron emission threshold of the neutron-rich germanium $^{80}$Ge as J$^{\pi} = (2,3)^-$ components of the PDR built on the low-lying J$^{\pi}$ = 2$^+$ quadrupole state. Our findings extend the concept of PDR beyond dipole states, with implications for nuclear structure theory and experiment, as well as the element production in the cosmos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ionospheric responses over the Antarctic region to Intense Space Weather events: Plasma Convection vs. Auroral Precipitation</a><span class="id">[2510.27372]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The present investigation is directed at exploring southern polar ionospheric responses to intense space weather events and their correlations with plasma convection and auroral precipitation. The main phases of six geomagnetic storms occurring in the year 2023 (ascending phase of the present solar cycle) are considered for this study. The ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements derived from GPS receivers covering the Antarctic region are used for probing the electron density perturbations during these events. Auroral precipitation maps are shown to illustrate the locations of the GPS stations relative to particle precipitation. SuperDARN maps are shown to understand the effects of plasma convection over these locations. Correlation between the enhanced TEC observations with the auroral precipitation (R $\sim$ 0.31) and the plasma convection (R $\sim$ 0.88) reveals that the latter is more responsible for causing significant enhancements in the diurnal maximum values of TEC over the Antarctic region in comparison to the former. Therefore, this work shows correlation studies between two physical processes and ionospheric density enhancements over the under-explored south polar region under strong levels of geomagnetic activity during 2023.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geometric acceleration in $f(Q,C)$ theories</a><span class="id">[2510.27415]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $f(Q,C)$ framework of gravity enables the depiction of an effective dark energy fluid that emerges from geometry itself, thus leading to modifications in the cosmological phenomenology of General Relativity.

It is applied to several classes of $\alpha$-attractor models as an illustrative example. In the first step, all independent parameters of the inflationary potential are expressed in terms of the CMB observables (the three parameters - by the scalar spectral index $n_s$, scalar amplitude $A_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio $r$). For a standard reheating mechanism characterized by the inflaton equation of state parameter $w$ and its effective dissipation rate $\Gamma$ the reheating temperature is uniquely fixed in terms of the CMB observables measured for some pivot scale $k_*$. There are striking consequences of this fact. The model independent bounds on the reheating temperature, the BBN lower bound and the upper bound of the order of the GUT/Planck scale, translate themselves for each class of models into very narrow ranges of the allowed values of the spectral index $n_s(k_*)$, providing their strong tests by the present and future CMB data. The recent tension between Planck and DESI-ACT results has strong impact on our conclusions. Furthermore, given a class of inflaton models satisfying those tests, the reheating temperature is an interesting portal to link the CMB observables to the particle physics scenarios that are sensitive to it. As an example, non-thermal dark matter (DM) production mechanisms are discussed. One obtains then a consistency check between theories of inflation and DM production. If the future precision of the CMB data will constrain the reheating temperature beyond the model independent bounds, further constraints on the DM production will follow.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WallGo investigates: Theoretical uncertainties in the bubble wall velocity</a><span class="id">[2510.27691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine theoretical uncertainties in state-of-the-art calculations of the bubble wall velocity during first-order cosmological phase transitions.

By being based on a realistically placed observer within a data-informed cosmic environment, the results underscore that convergence must be a central concern when applying the general cosmographic expansion. By showing all-sky maps of kinematic parameters, the study also highlights the substantial information we lose when relying solely on standard FLRW-based cosmography. Poor convergence does not necessarily render the information extracted by fitting data to the general cosmographic expansion meaningless.

In this work, we investigate the clustering properties of SDSS blue galaxies, which are excellent tracers of dark matter, along two distinct epochs of the Universe, utilizing estimators like the two-point angular correlation function (2PACF), the angular power spectra, among others. Considering a model-independent approach, we perform analyses in two disjoint redshift shells, $0 \leq z &lt; 0.06$ and $0.06 \leq z &lt; 0.12$, to investigate the distribution of large cosmic structures. Using Bayesian inference methods, we constrain the parameter that quantifies the galaxy clustering in the 2PACF, enabling us to perform comparisons among different regions on the sky and between different epochs in the Universe regarding the gravitational action on matter structures. Our analyses complement previous efforts to map large-scale structures in the Local Universe. In addition, this study reveals differences regarding the clustering of large cosmic structures comparing two epochs of the Universe, analyses done with diverse estimators. Results reveal, clearly, distinct evolutionary signatures between the two redshift shells. Moreover, we had the opportunity to test the concordance cosmological model under extreme conditions in the highly non-linear Local Universe, computing the amplitude of the angular power spectrum at very small scales. Ultimately, all our analyses serve as a set of consistency tests of the concordance cosmological model, the $\Lambda$CDM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On DESI's DR2 exclusion of $Λ$CDM</a><span class="id">[2504.15336]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The DESI collaboration, combining their Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data with cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy and supernovae data, have found significant indication against the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

The approach recognizes that $H_0$ encodes the orientation of the FLRW observational plane defined by $(z, H(z), \dot{z})$ coordinates, enabling direct algebraic determination without parametric assumptions or interpolation schemes. Validation using available CC measurements and forecasted redshift drift data from FAST, CHIME, SKA, and ELT demonstrates 1.9\% precision for optimal data combinations, yielding $H_0 = 66.26 \pm 1.26$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ while maintaining complete cosmological model independence. While no actual SL measurements currently exist, requiring us to rely on simulations for validation, our geometric constraints show superior resilience against sparse redshift coverage compared to Gaussian Process (GP) methods, which exhibit systematic biases and large uncertainties when datasets lack substantial overlap.

Any mis-modeling of this complex noise can bias the reconstruction of the lensing potential and the measurement of the lensing power spectrum from the observed CMB maps. We introduce a new CMB lensing estimator based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction that is minimally sensitive to these instrumental noise biases. By modifying the likelihood to rely exclusively on correlations between CMB map splits with independent noise realizations, we minimize auto-correlations that contribute to biases. In the regime of many independent splits, this maximum closely approximates the optimal MAP reconstruction of the lensing potential. In simulations, we demonstrate that this method is able to determine lensing observables that are immune to any noise mis-modeling with a negligible cost in signal-to-noise ratio.

These pulsations provide a powerful means of inferring stellar properties, particularly ages, for young $\delta$ Scuti stars for which traditional age-dating methods are poorly constrained. Realising this potential requires theoretical models that capture the complexities of stellar structure and evolution. We present a comprehensive grid of 25 million stellar pulsation models, computed using the mesa stellar evolution code and the gyre stellar oscillation code, tailored to $\delta$ Scuti stars. The grid spans a wide range of masses, metallicities and rotation velocities, and covers evolutionary phases from the early pre-main-sequence through the main sequence and into the post-main sequence contraction phase. For each model, we computed adiabatic pulsation frequencies for degrees $\ell$ = 0 to 3, capturing p modes, g modes, f modes and their interactions through avoided crossings. We find that f and low-order g modes have mode inertias comparable to or lower than the fundamental radial mode during the late pre-MS and early MS, implying that these modes should be observable. We revisit $\delta$ Scuti scaling relations and map asteroseismic observables, including the large frequency separation ($\Delta\nu$) and phase offset parameter ($\varepsilon$), across age, mass, metallicity, and rotation. This new model grid, which is publicly available, improves upon previous such model grids by facilitating interpretation of $\delta$ Scuti pulsations, allowing for more reliable age estimates and tighter constraints on stellar evolutionary pathways, and planet formation in A- and F-type stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflationary Models with Gauss-Bonnet Coupling in Light of ACT Observations</a><span class="id">[2508.09707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent analyses combining Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data with other cosmological datasets report a higher scalar spectral index $n_s$, creating tension with a wide range of inflationary models.

Applying this mechanism to chaotic inflation, E-models, T-models, and hilltop inflation, we find that broad regions of parameter space become consistent with the latest ACT-based CMB constraints.

Whereas most long GRBs are thought to originate in the core collapse of massive stars, the presence of kilonova suggests GRB 211211A was instead produced by a merger of a compact object binary. Building on the interpretation put forward by \citet{Yang2022Natur.612..232Y}–who argue that GRB 211211A was powered by a massive white-dwarf + neutron-star (WD-NS) merger–we adopt this WD-NS scenario as our observationally supported starting point. If the burst truly originates from that channel, its rarity must mirror the formation and merger rate of WD-NS binaries–a rate still largely unexplored in conventional massive-binary population studies. In this letter, we present a qualitative analysis based on binary evolution physics in order to understand the fraction of GRB 211211A in short GRBs (NS-WD/NS-NS fraction). Since the progenitors of massive WD-NS binaries occupy the initial mass function-preferred regime, where the zero-age main-sequence mass range of the assumed WD mass range (1.2-1.4$\,M_\odot$) is comparable to that of NSs, the NS-WD/NS-NS fraction emerging from our standard evolutionary path is expected to be $\sim$14–37\%, far higher than the observed fraction ($\sim5$\%). This discrepancy might imply a large, still-unidentified population of GRB 211211A-like events or an unusual origin of the NS-such as being hypernova-born or accretion-induced-collapse-born. Placing these results in a broader compact-binary context, implications for black-hole systems are also discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new photometric ephemeris for the 2M1510 AB double brown dwarf eclipsing binary system</a><span class="id">[2510.14801]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Eclipsing brown dwarfs are important calibrators of sub-stellar evolution models used to infer the characteristics of directly imaged brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets.

This comprehensive dataset should yield stringent constraints on cosmological parameters. In this work, we explore its potential to address the Hubble tension by forecasting constraints from temperature, polarization, and CMB lensing on Early Dark Energy (EDE) and the variation in electron mass in spatially flat and curved universes. For this purpose, we investigate first whether analyzing the distinct SPT-3G observation fields independently, as opposed to as a single, unified region, results in a loss of information relevant to cosmological parameter estimation. We develop a realistic temperature and polarization likelihood pipeline capable of analyzing these fields in these two ways, and subsequently forecast constraints on cosmological parameters. Our findings indicate that any loss of constraining power from analyzing the fields separately is primarily concentrated at low multipoles ($\ell$ &lt; 50) and the overall impact on the relative uncertainty on standard $\Lambda$CDM parameters is minimal (&lt; 3%). Our forecasts suggest that SPT-3G data should improve by more than a factor of 300 and 3000 the Figure of Merit (FoM) of the EDE and the varying electron mass models, respectively, when combined with Planck data.

While several candidates have been suggested, definitive confirmation of these events remains elusive. We report the discovery of AT2023uqm, a nuclear transient that has exhibited at least five periodic optical flares, making it only the second confirmed case of periodicity after ASASSN-14ko. Uniquely, the flares from AT2023uqm show a nearly exponential increase in energy–a &quot;runaway&quot; phenomenon signaling the star's progressive destruction. This behavior is consistent with rpTDEs of low-mass, main-sequence stars or evolved giant stars. Multiwavelength observations and spectroscopic analysis of the two most recent flares reinforce its interpretation as an rpTDE. Intriguingly, each flare displays a similar double-peaked structure, potentially originating from a double-peaked mass fallback rate or two discrete collisions per orbit. The extreme ratio of peak separation to orbital period draws attention to the possibility of a giant star being disrupted, which could be distinguished from a low-mass main-sequence star by its future mass-loss evolution. Our analysis demonstrates the power of rpTDEs to probe the properties of disrupted stars and the physical processes of tidal disruption, though it is currently limited by our knowledge of these events. AT2023uqm emerges as the most compelling rpTDE thus far, serving as a crucial framework for modeling and understanding these phenomena.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 2024 July 16 Solar Event: A Challenge To The Coronal Mass Ejection Origin Of Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Flares</a><span class="id">[2510.26666]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a multi-spacecraft analysis of the 2024 July 16 Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Flare (LDGRF) detected by the Large Area Telescope on the Fermi satellite. The measured &gt;100 MeV $\gamma$-ray emission persisted for over seven hours after the flare impulsive phase, and was characterized by photon energies exceeding 1 GeV and a remarkably-hard parent-proton spectrum. In contrast, the phenomena related to the coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock linked to this eruption were modest, suggesting an inefficient proton acceleration unlikely to achieve the energies well-above the 300 MeV pion-production threshold to account for the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. Specifically, the CME was relatively slow ( 600 km/s) and the accompanying interplanetary type-II/III radio bursts were faint and short-duration, unlike those typically detected during large events. In particular, the type-II emission did not extend to kHz frequencies and disappeared  5.5 hours prior to the LDGRF end time. Furthermore, the associated solar energetic particle (SEP) event was very weak, short-duration, and limited to a few tens of MeV, even at magnetically well-connected spacecraft. These findings demonstrate that a very-fast CME resulting in a high-energy SEP event is not a necessary condition for the occurrence of LDGRFs, challenging the idea that the high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission is produced by the back-precipitation of shock-accelerated ions into the solar surface. The alternative origin scenario based on local particle trapping and acceleration in large-scale coronal loops is instead favored by the observation of giant arch-like structures of hot plasma over the source region persisting for the entire duration of this LDGRF.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unbiased Primordial Gravitational Wave Inference from the CMB with SMICA</a><span class="id">[2510.26767]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of primordial gravitational waves in Cosmic Microwave Background B-mode polarization observations requires accurate and robust subtraction of astrophysical contamination.

To faithfully represent the uncertainty in this breakdown scale, we develop a hybrid representation of the dense-matter equation of state, which assumes the form of a relativistic mean-field theory at low densities, while remaining agnostic to any nuclear theory at high densities. To achieve this, we use a nonparametric equation of state model to incorporate the correlations of the underlying relativistic mean-field theory equation of state at low pressures and transition to more flexible correlations above some chosen pressure scale. We perform astrophysical inference under various choices of the transition pressure between the theory-informed and theory-agnostic models. We further study whether the chosen relativistic mean-field theory breaks down above some particular pressure and find no such evidence. Using simulated data for future astrophysical observations at about two-to-three times the precision of current constraints, we show that our method can identify the breakdown pressure associated with a potential strong phase transition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Systems and Superstring Phases in the Early Universe</a><span class="id">[2505.14187]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the string theory dynamics of the volume scalar rolling down an exponential potential during the period between inflation and reheating, in a background of cosmic superstring loops. In the context of the LVS potential, we demonstrate the existence of a novel string loop attractor tracker solution, in which 75% of the energy density of the universe is in the form of a gas of fundamental cosmic superstring loops (a configuration preferred over the standard radiation tracker). On this tracker, it is the continual reduction in the string tension as the volume scalar evolves that makes the loops stable against decay. For more general non-LVS potentials, mixed radiation-loop trackers can also occur.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An independent search for Jovian neutrinos using BOREXINO data</a><span class="id">[2506.14506]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In a recent study, arXiv:2401.13043 found evidence for a 6% flux contribution from Jupiter to the total flux rate time series data from the BOREXINO solar neutrino experiment, specifically during the time intervals 2019-2021 and 2011-2013. The significance of this detection was estimated to be around $2\sigma$. We reanalyze the BOREXINO data and independently confirm the Jovian signal with the same amplitude and significance as that obtained in arXiv:2401.13043 . However, using the same technique, we also find a spurious flux contribution from Venus and Saturn (at $\sim 2\sigma$ significance), whereas prima facie one should not expect any signal from any other planet. We then implement Bayesian model comparison to ascertain whether the BOREXINO data contain an additional contribution from Jupiter, Venus or Saturn. We find Bayes factors of less than five for an additional contribution from Jupiter, and less than or close to one for Venus and Saturn. This implies that the evidence for an additional contribution from Jupiter is very marginal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALPy Cogenesis</a><span class="id">[2506.18970]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a novel cogenesis scenario by utilising the two-body decay of heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN) via an effective operator involving an axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter (DM) and a light chiral fermion $\nu_R$. This allows the two-body decay of heavy RHN into $\nu_R$ and ALP thereby generating a lepton asymmetry in $\nu_R$ which later gets transferred to left-handed leptons via sizeable Yukawa coupling with a neutrinophilic Higgs doublet. The asymmetry in left-handed leptons is then converted into baryon asymmetry via electroweak sphalerons. The lepton number violation by heavy RHN also induces a one-loop Majorana mass of $\nu_R$ rendering the light neutrinos to be Majorana fermions. Successful leptogenesis constrain the parameter space in terms of RHN mass and axion decay constant. This has interesting consequences for both ALP and QCD axion DM parameter space within reach of several ongoing and near future experiments. We also propose a Dirac version of this scenario without any total lepton number violation. This leads to a long-lived asymmetric Dirac fermion contributing partially to DM thereby opening up more parameter space for ALP. In addition to axion search experiments, the proposed scenarios can have observable signatures at cosmic microwave background (CMB), DM search as well as terrestrial particle physics experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Love numbers of black holes: Theory and gravitational waveforms</a><span class="id">[2507.22994]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In General Relativity, the static tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish identically. Whether this remains true for time-dependent tidal fields – i.e., in the case of dynamical tidal Love numbers – is an open question, complicated by subtle issues in the definition and computation of the tidal response at finite frequency. In this work, we analyze the dynamical tidal perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole to quadratic order in the tidal frequency. By employing the Teukolsky formalism in advanced null coordinates, which are regular at the horizon, we obtain a particularly clean perturbative scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a response function based on the full solution of the perturbation equation which does not depend on any arbitrary constant. Our analysis recovers known results for the dissipative response at linear order and the logarithmic running at quadratic order, associated with scale dependence in the effective theory. In addition, we find a finite, nonvanishing conservative correction at second order in frequency, thereby possibly demonstrating a genuine dynamical deformation of the black hole geometry. Although removing any ambiguity in the dynamical tidal response would require a matching with some gauge-invariant coefficient, we assess the impact of these effects on the gravitational-wave phase. These contributions enter at eighth post-Newtonian order, and can be expressed in terms of generic $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients, which have to be matched to the perturbative result. Regardless of the matching ambiguities, we argue that such corrections are too small to be observable even with future-generation gravitational wave detectors. Moreover, the corresponding phase shifts are degenerate with unknown point-particle contributions entering at the same post-Newtonian order.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial black holes formation in inflationary $F(R)$ models with scalar fields</a><span class="id">[2509.21220]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We construct $F(R)$ gravity models with scalar fields to describe cosmological inflation and formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By adding the induced gravity term and the fourth-order polynomial potential for the scalar field to the known $F(R)$ gravity model, and using a conformal transformation of the metric, we obtain a two-field chiral cosmological model. For some values of the model parameters, we get that the inflationary parameters of this model are in good agreement with the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation obtained by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The estimation of PBH masses suggests that PBHs could be dark matter candidates.</p></div></details></article></body>
