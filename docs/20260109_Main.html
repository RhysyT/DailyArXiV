We use direct and accurate inversion approximations to map mass-radius relations to the underlying EOS. We systematically compare its EOS inferences with those inferred from traditional EOS parameterizations, taking care to quantify the systematic prior uncertainties of both. Our results show that prior uncertainties should be included in all Bayesian approaches. The more natural alternative framework provides broader coverage of the physically allowed mass-radius space, especially small radius configurations, and yields enhanced computational efficiency and substantially reduced dependence on prior choices. Our results demonstrate that direct parameterization in observed space offers a robust and efficient alternative to traditional methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disk-to-Corona State Transition and Extreme X-ray Variability in the Tidal Disruption Event AT2019teq</a><span class="id">[2601.04311]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a five-year X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the optically selected Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) AT2019teq, which displays extreme variability, including order-of-magnitude changes in flux on minute-to-day timescales, and a rare late-time emergence of hard X-ray emission leading to the longest-lived corona in a known TDE. In one epoch, we detect sub-mHz quasi-periodic oscillations with significance tested via MCMC-based red-noise simulations (p $\leq 0.03$). AT2019teq exhibits a clear spectral evolution from a soft (blackbody-dominated) state to a hard (power-law-dominated) state, with a late-time radio brightening that may be associated with the state transition. We identify similarities between AT2019teq's evolution and X-ray binary soft-to-hard state transitions, albeit at higher luminosity and much faster timescales. We use the presence of both a disk-dominated and a corona-dominated state to apply multiple mass estimators from X-ray spectral and variability properties. These techniques are mutually consistent within $2\sigma$ and systematically yield a lower black hole mass ($\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) = 5.67 \pm 0.09$) than inferred from host galaxy scaling ($\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot})=6.14 \pm 0.19$).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension</a><span class="id">[2601.04312]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A new tension is emerging between the tight cosmological upper bounds on the total neutrino mass ($\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06 \, \rm{eV}$) and the lower limits from oscillation experiments, with potentially far-reaching implications for cosmology and particle physics. Neutrinos decaying into massless BSM particles with lifetimes $\tau_\nu \sim 0.01-1\, \rm{Gyr}$ represent a theoretically well-motivated mechanism to reconcile such measurements. Using DESI DR2 and CMB datasets, we show that such decays relax the bound on the total neutrino mass up to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.23 \, \rm{eV}$ (95%), restoring full agreement with oscillation data. We also present the first late-time cosmological analysis of neutrino decays into lighter neutrinos in a manner consistent with the measured mass splittings. In contrast to the decays into massless BSM particles, we find that this scenario only marginally alleviates - or even tightens - the cosmological neutrino mass bounds, depending on the mass ordering.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KL Dra as a Benchmark Laboratory for Accretion-Disk Physics: Constraints from TESS and Ground-Based Surveys</a><span class="id">[2601.04323]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the longest-term optical analysis of the AM CVn system KL Dra using $\sim11$ years of monitoring from TESS and wide-field ground-based surveys. The continuous TESS coverage allows us to characterise its frequent outbursts with unprecedented detail, providing the first comprehensive study of an AM CVn during outbursts and enabling detailed modelling of these systems. The superoutbursts in KL Dra generally include a precursor, and are followed by a series of rebrightenings after which a sequence of 3-4 large amplitude normal outbursts is observed. We fit parametric profiles to each superoutburst component (precursor, rise to plateau, plateau, decay), to rebrightenings, and to normal outbursts, which let us quantify every high state feature and investigate correlations with the system's long term supercyle evolution. Our continuous coverage reveals an average value for the supercycles, superoutbursts and normal outbursts of $60.4 \pm 0.1$ d, $5.67\pm0.03$ d and $1.17 \pm0.01$ d, respectively. The supercycle duration may be correlated with the rebrightenings duration and superoutburst amplitude, and anticorrelated with the plateau length. Within a supercycle, normal outbursts grow in amplitude and duration, and the first normal outburst is usually highly asymmetric, while subsequent normal outbursts are more symmetric. We detected superhumps in TESS superoutbursts but not in the rebrightenings or normal outbursts. We interpret the results within the disk instability model, considering additional effects, such as changes in the donor mass transfer rate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarization of decayless kink oscillations in a 3D MHD coronal loop model</a><span class="id">[2601.04331]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Decayless kink oscillations are frequently observed in solar coronal loops and are considered potential contributors to coronal heating. Despite the ubiquity of this wave phenomenon, its driving mechanism remains unclear. Studies to derive the polarization state of these oscillations, which would be a key to identifying the drivers, have been limited due to observational constraints. We analyze a 3D MHD simulation of coronal loops using the MURaM code. Synthetic extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission maps, combined with velocity diagnostics, are used to identify and characterize transverse wave motions in the simulated loop structures. This is the first demonstration of decayless kink waves emerging self-consistently in a 3D MHD loop-in-a-box model. The simulation produces persistent, low-amplitude, decayless kink oscillations that closely match observed properties. These oscillations arise spontaneously, without any imposed periodic driver, and exhibit clear linear polarization with oscillation planes not aligned to the principal axes. The observed coherency of linear polarization with oscillation cycles favors a self-sustained or quasi-steady type wave driver over a stochastic or broadband source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04340" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diluting the Dark Sector: A Common Origin for the PTA Signal and Inelastic SIDM</a><span class="id">[2601.04340]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recent detection of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) challenges conventional astrophysics by observed signal amplitude exceeds predictions from standard SMBHB populations without implausible accretion histories. To resolve this amplitude tension, we introduce the Radiative SIDM Dilution this http URL explain the observed spectrum emerges as a hybrid signal by an astrophysical floor, dynamically suppressed by the cored halos of Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM),and a dominant cosmological peak generated during a supercooled phase transition in the dark sector. By performing a free spectral reconstruction and Bayesian model comparison, we demonstrate that a transition defined by a nucleation temperature $T_* \approx 1.24$ MeV and inverse duration $\beta/H_* \approx 150$ not only fills the spectral gap left by stalled binaries but yields statistical evidence($\Delta \text{BIC} \approx 15$) over purely standard astrophysical interpretations. The thermodynamics required to reproduce this SGWB signature also resolves the thermal overproduction of resonant SIDM. The entropy injected by the transition naturally provides the specific dilution factor $D \approx 100$ needed to reset the dark matter relic density to observation. This mechanism also has broader cosmological this http URL residual dark radiation alleviates the Hubble tension $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \sim 0.3$ while bubble collisions generate magnetohydrodynamic turbulence sufficient to seed primordial magnetic fields $B_0 \sim 10^{-13}$ G.

Using grids of detailed MESA simulations, we show that for donor masses of $2-8\,M_{\odot}$, mass transfer may be dynamically unstable, leading to a common envelope (CE) phase. By adopting CE ejection efficiencies in the range $\alpha_{\rm CE} = 0.3-3.0$, we find that post-CE binaries frequently experience a CE decoupling phase (CEDP), which plays a critical role in determining their final orbital and compositional properties. Systems with initial donor masses $\gtrsim 3.5\,M_{\odot}$ predominantly evolve into NS binaries with carbon-oxygen or oxygen-neon white dwarfs (WDs) with masses between $0.5\,M_{\odot}$ and $1.4\,M_{\odot}$. Comparison with the observed population of binary pulsars with a WD companion shows better agreement with higher CE ejection efficiencies ($\alpha_{\rm CE} = 3.0$). Furthermore, we demonstrate that NSs can accrete a sufficient amount of matter ($\gtrsim 0.01\,M_{\odot}$) during the CEDP and subsequent Case BA/BB/BC mass transfer phases to be effectively recycled into millisecond pulsars. We identify two distinct evolutionary channels capable of reproducing the observed characteristics of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1928+1815 with a helium-star companion. Our results highlight the importance of the CEDP in the formation of recycled pulsars and provide constraints on the CE ejection efficiency during binary evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04464" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Propagating Uncertainties from Nuclear Physics to Gamma-rays in Core Collapse Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2601.04464]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nuclear yields are powerful probes of supernova explosions, their engines and their progenitors. In addition, as we improve our understanding of these explosions, we can use nuclear yields to probe dense matter and neutrino physics, both of which play a critical role in the central supernova engine. Especially with upcoming gamma-ray detectors that can directly detect radioactive isotopes out to increasing distances from gamma-rays emitted during their decay, nuclear yields have the potential to provide some of the most direct probes of supernova engines and stellar burning. To utilize these probes, we must understand and limit the uncertainties in their production. Uncertainties in the nuclear physics can be minimized by combining both laboratory experiments and nuclear theory. Similarly, astrophysical uncertainties caused by simplified explosion trajectories can be minimized by higher-fidelity stellar-evolution and supernova-engine models. This paper reviews the physics and astrophysics uncertainties in modeling nucleosynthetic yields, identifying the key areas of study needed to maximize the potential of supernova yields as probes of astrophysical transients and dense-matter physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04468" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identifying the poynting-flux-dominated outflow of Fermi GRBs with non-thermal spectrum and its energy-resolved light curve fitting</a><span class="id">[2601.04468]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The jet compositions of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are very important to understand the energy dissipation and radiation mechanisms, but it remains an open question in GRB physics. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis to search for 88 bright GRBs that include a total of 129 pulses observed by Fermi/GBM with redshift measured, and extract the spectra of each pulse with Band function (Band), cutoff power-law (CPL), blackbody (BB), non-dissipative photospheric (NDP), Band+BB, as well as CPL+BB. We find that 80 pulses, 35 pulses, and 14 pulses present purely non-thermal, hybrid, and thermal spectra, respectively. By focusing on those 80 pulses with purely non-thermal spectra, one can estimate the lower limits of magnetization factor ($\sigma$) via suppressing the pseudo-thermal component. It is found that 30 pulses in 21 GRBs are the lower limit of $\sigma&gt;5$ at the photosphere by adopting $R_{0}=10^{10}$ cm. It suggests that at least the outflow of those GRB jets with high $\sigma$ is dominated by Poynting-flux. On the other hand, we also perform the light curve fitting with a fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) model for 15 bright GRBs with a high magnetization factor in our sample, and find that a correlation between pulse width ($w$) and energy of 13 GRBs really exists in their energy-resolved light curves. It is also a piece of independent evidence for those GRBs with a high value $\sigma$ to support the origin of the Poynting flux outflow.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transit Photometry and Ephemeris Refinement of WASP-12 b Using TESS Data</a><span class="id">[2601.04484]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed transit photometric analysis of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-12 b using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The study is based on publicly available calibrated light curves and target pixel files accessed through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) cloud infrastructure. After extracting and normalizing the photometric time series, the light curve was phase-folded using an initial ephemeris and modeled with a physical transit model to determine the system's geometric parameters. From the transit modeling, we measure the planet-to-star radius ratio, orbital inclination, impact parameter, and transit duration. Adopting stellar parameters from the literature, we derive the planetary radius and transit depth, confirming the highly inflated nature of WASP-12 b. Individual mid-transit times were measured and used to refine the orbital ephemeris through a weighted linear fit. The resulting refined orbital period and reference epoch improve the predictive accuracy of future transit times over the TESS observational baseline. An observed-minus-calculated (O-C) analysis reveals no statistically significant transit timing variations, indicating that the timing data are consistent with a linear ephemeris within the measurement uncertainties. This work demonstrates the capability of TESS photometry to provide precise transit characterization and ephemeris refinement for well-studied exoplanet systems, and provides updated parameters that are relevant for future atmospheric and dynamical investigations of WASP-12 b.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral connection between far UV and soft X-ray emission from active galactic nuclei using AstroSat</a><span class="id">[2601.04522]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the UV/X-ray joint spectral analyses of four Seyfert 1 galaxies (PG 0804+761, NGC 7469, SWIFT J1921.1-5842, and SWIFT J1835.0+3240) using the data acquired with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope and Soft X-ray Telescope onboard AstroSat. We model the intrinsic UV/X-ray continuum with the accretion disk, warm and hot Comptonization using the OPTXAGNF and FAGNSED models, where the disk seed photons are Comptonized in the warm and hot corona. The Eddington ratio of the four Seyferts ranges from 0.01 to 1. In the case of SWIFT J1835.0$+$3240, we infer a compact warm corona ($ R_{warm} - R_{hot} \lesssim 18 r_{g}$) while, PG 0804+761, NGC 7469, and SWIFT J1921.1-5842 may exhibit a larger warm Comptonizing region ($\gtrsim 32r_{g}$). We could constrain the spin parameter in PG 0804+761, $a^{\star} = 0.76_{-0.20}^{+0.08}$ (1$\sigma$ error), with the FAGNSED model. In SWIFT J1835.0+3240 and SWIFT J1921.1-5842, the UV/X-ray spectral variability may be driven by the thermal Comptonization of the disk seed photons in the hot corona. Furthermore, the observed spectral hardening with the decrease in disk temperature and accretion rate compared to earlier observations may indicate a state transition in SWIFT J1835.0+3240 from a high/soft to a low/hard state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Empirical Evidence of Planetary Group Configurations Modulating Solar Activity</a><span class="id">[2601.04669]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Our prior research found that a $90^{\circ}$ configuration of two planetary groups were temporally associated with significant changes in global electromagnetic standing waves (Schumann resonances) during and after the three $90^{\circ}$ configuration events occurring in late 2017 and early 2018. Specifically noted were reductions in variability moving into an event and level changes immediately after a event. Because global standing-wave data have a short history and no $90^{\circ}$ events have occurred since that period, we examine here whether these geometric configuration events correspond to similar signatures in the long sunspot count record. Using daily sunspot data from January 1935 through December 2024, we conducted empirical studies assessing variance changes, post-event level shifts, and potential intrinsic oscillatory structure. In Study A, a variance-ratio test showed that sunspot variability was systematically lower during the events than in the preceding period, with 21 of 26 events since 1935 exhibiting reduced variance (binomial $p=0.0025$). In Study B, solar activity level declined roughly 21 days after events ended, with 21 of 26 events showing negative changes (binomial $p=0.0025$). In Study C, wavelet and filtering analyses revealed no internal solar oscillations at comparable timescales. These findings provide empirical evidence that the configuration events are associated with shifts in solar activity. The next three configuration events in mid- and late-2026 offer an opportunity to assess these patterns in real time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04683" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectroscopy of a sample of RV Tauri stars without IR excess</a><span class="id">[2601.04683]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We observed high-resolution optical spectra of 11 RV Tauri stars without IR excess, with the primary goal of searching for chemical depletion patterns. Using equivalent widths of absorption lines, we calculated photospheric parameters and chemical element abundances for five stars in the sample: HD 172810, V399 Cyg, AA Ari, V457 Cyg, and V894 Per. Only the abundance pattern of V457 Cyg suggests depletion. In the spectrum of this star, TiO lines are also observed in emission in addition to metal emissions. V457 Cyg is likely a binary system that was once surrounded by a circumbinary disc. In the spectrum of V894 Per, we find a set of spectral lines that appear to belong to another star, corroborating that it is an eclipsing variable rather than an RV Tauri star. The high overabundance of sodium may result from mass transfer within the binary system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Trans-Planckian Signatures in the Early Universe: A Bayesian Analysis of the Generalized Sasaki-Mukhanov Equation</a><span class="id">[2601.04760]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a rigorous and comprehensive investigation of a generalized inflationary perturbation theory designed to address persistent large-scale anomalies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Motivated by the Trans-Planckian problem and potential non-canonical dynamics in the early Universe, we introduce a generalized Sasaki-Mukhanov equation characterized by a time-dependent correction term, parameterized by a coupling constant f. Unlike the standard slow-roll approximation, we derive the exact analytical solutions for the mode functions in terms of Whittaker functions, ensuring a precise treatment of the mode evolution across the horizon. We compute the resulting primordial scalar power spectrum, which exhibits scale-dependent oscillatory modulations and a distinct suppression of power at low multipoles. We numerically implement this modified framework within the Cobaya Bayesian inference engine. Utilizing the latest Planck 2018 temperature and polarization likelihoods combined with high-resolution data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6, we perform a robust Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis. Our results place stringent constraints on the modification parameter, |f| &lt;= 10^-4, at a 95% confidence level. However, we find intriguing hints that the generalized model provides a better fit to the low-l CMB spectrum compared to the standard LambdaCDM model, effectively alleviating the low-quadrupole anomaly without compromising the fit at smaller scales. We discuss the implications of these findings for the energy scale of inflation and the validity of the effective field theory description during the inflationary epoch.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First measurement of the Hubble constant from a combined weak lensing and gravitational-wave standard siren analysis</a><span class="id">[2601.04774]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) resulting from the first joint analysis of standard sirens with weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering observables comprising three two-point correlation functions (3$\times$2pt). For the 3$\times$2pt component of the analysis, we use data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 release. For the standard sirens component, we use data from the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0 released by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration. For GW170817, the only standard siren for which extensive electromagnetic follow-up observations exist, we also use measurements of the host galaxy redshift and inclination angle estimates derived from observations of a superluminal jet from its remnant. Our joint analysis yields $H_0 = 67.9^{+4.4}_{-4.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, a $6.4\%$ measurement, while improving the DES constraint on the total abundance of matter $\Omega_m$ by $22\%$. Removing the jet information degrades the $H_0$ precision to $9.9\%$. The measurement of $H_0$ remains a central problem in cosmology with a multitude of approaches being vigorously pursued in the community aiming to reconcile significantly discrepant measurements at the percent-level. In light of the impending new data releases from DES and LVK, and anticipating much more constraining power from 3$\times$2pt observables using newly commissioned survey instruments, we demonstrate that incorporating standard sirens into the cosmology framework of large cosmic surveys is a viable route towards that goal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation. Galaxy 2-point correlation function modelling in redshift space</a><span class="id">[2601.04780]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Euclid satellite will measure spectroscopic redshifts for tens of millions of emission-line galaxies. In the context of Stage-IV surveys, the 3-dimensional clustering of galaxies plays a key role in providing cosmological constraints. In this paper, we conduct a model comparison for the multipole moments of the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2PCF) in redshift space. We test state-of-the-art models, in particular the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFT), one based on the velocity difference generating function (VDG$_{\infty}$), and different variants of Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) models, such as convolutional LPT (CLPT) and its effective-field-theory extension (CLEFT). We analyse the first three even multipoles of the 2PCF in the Flagship 1 simulation, which consists of four snapshots at $z\in\{0.9,1.2,1.5,1.8\}$. We study both template-fitting and full-shape approaches and find that with the template-fitting approach, only the VDG$_{\infty}$ model is able to reach a minimum fitting scale of $s_{\rm min}=20\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=0.9$ without biasing the recovered parameters. Indeed, the EFT model becomes inaccurate already at $s_{\rm min}=30\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. Conversely, in the full-shape analysis, the CLEFT and VDG$_{\infty}$ models perform similarly well, but only the CLEFT model can reach $s_{\rm min}=20\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$ while the VDG$_{\infty}$ model is unbiased down to $s_{\rm min}=25\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$ at the lowest redshift. Overall, in order to achieve the accuracy required by Euclid, non-perturbative modelling such as in the VDG$_{\infty}$ or CLEFT models should be considered. At $z=1.8$, the CLPT model is sufficient to describe the data with high figure of merit. This comparison selects baseline models that perform best in ideal conditions and sets the stage for an optimal analysis of Euclid data in configuration space.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04793" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A change of the rotation period of asteroid (65803) Didymos caused by the DART impact</a><span class="id">[2601.04793]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>On 26 September 2022, the NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft impacted Dimorphos, the secondary component of the binary asteroid (65803) Didymos. This experiment tested the Kinetic Impactor technology for diverting dangerous asteroids. Due to the impact, the binary system's angular momentum has changed, resulting in a significant change in the orbital period of Dimorphos. Precise values of the pre- and post-impact orbital periods were derived from a large set of photometric light curves measured for the Didymos-Dimorphos system during six apparitions from 2003 to 2023. We used these data to detect a possible change in the rotation period of the primary as a consequence of the impact. We analyzed the binary system's light curves using the binary asteroid light curve decomposition method. We selected parts of the light curves covering orbital phases outside mutual events, which represent the primary rotational light curves. We applied the light curve inversion method to construct a convex shape model of Didymos and determine its rotation period before and after the impact. These two periods were treated as independent free parameters of the modeling. We found a value of 2.2603891 +/- 0.0000002 h for the pre-impact period and 2.260440 +/- 0.000008 h for the post-impact period. Their difference 0.18 +/- 0.03 s is small yet significant, indicating that the rotation of Didymos became slower after the DART impact. The most plausible physical explanation is Didymos's post-impact reshaping, making its shape more oblate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long-term evolution of cyclotron resonant scattering features in the accreting pulsar Vela X-1: A pulse-to-pulse approach</a><span class="id">[2601.04851]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigated the long-term evolution of the cyclotron line energy, as well as the relationship between cyclotron line energy and luminosity in the high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1, based on archival Swift/BAT monitoring from 2005 to 2024 and pulse-to-pulse analysis of nine NuSTAR observations from 2012 to 2024.

Here we consider such encounters between an intermediate mass spinning black hole and a close identical white dwarf binary system whose center of mass follows a parabolic trajectory. After studying a corresponding three-body problem in the point particle approximation, we perform a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics based numerical simulations of such scenarios. For this, we integrate the geodesic equations for the spinning black hole, while considering the hydrodynamics and the self and mutual gravitational interactions of the stars in a Newtonian approximation, an approach justified by the choice of parameters in the theory. We consider various initial configurations of the binary center of mass leading to equatorial and off-equatorial orbits, as also various initial inclinations between the binary's initial spin angular momentum and its initial orbital angular momentum. We find that the effects of black hole spin manifest clearly in the tidal dynamics of the binary components, while the observables of tidal encounters such as mass fallback rates are strongly dependent on the initial inclination angle. We show that the influence of the black hole spin emerges in distinct ways for different initial configurations of the binary's spin alignment. We establish that within the ambits of the Hills mechanism, in certain cases, the fallback rate may show a three-hump structure, due to interactions between tidal debris of the individual stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporal Variations in Pulsar Spectro-Polarimetry: Findings from millisecond pulsar J2144-5237 using Parkes UWL receiver</a><span class="id">[2601.04877]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While the temporal variations of the spectro-polarimetric nature of pulsars remains unexplored, this investigation offers significant potential for uncovering key insights into pulsar emission mechanisms, magnetic field geometry, and propagation effects within the magnetosphere. We developed a package for investigating time-varying spectral behavior for full Stokes parameters and demonstrate it on a millisecond pulsar (MSP) J2144-5237 in a binary system (orbital period  10 days) using the Parkes UWL receiver. In this study we report rotation measure (RM) variation with orbital phase. We find that the temporal variations in the spectra of Stokes I, Q, and V are generally correlated throughout the orbit, while Stokes U exhibits intervals of both correlation and anticorrelation with Stokes I, depending on the orbital phase. We also provide a Poincare sphere representation of the polarization properties of J2144-5237, demonstrating a systematic temporal change of Poincare sphere location for the main component with orbital phase. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of time-varying properties of the spectro-polarimetric nature of any pulsars or MSPs. Extending this study to probe the spectro-temporal nature of full Stokes data on a larger sample of MSPs or pulsars has the potential to provide vital information on emission mechanisms inside the magnetosphere, interstellar propagation effects, and binary interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three-equation turbulent convection models in classical variables</a><span class="id">[2601.04931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Turbulent convection models in nonlinear radial stellar pulsation models rely on an extra equation for turbulent kinetic energy and fail to adequately explain mode-selection problems. Since multidimensional calculations are computationally expensive, it is reasonable to search for generalizations of physically grounded 1D models that approximate multidimensional results with sufficient accuracy, at least in a given parameter range. A natural way of progressing from one-equation models is to use additional nonlocal equations. While these types of models also exist in the literature, they have not been adopted for this type of object. Aims. We aim to adapt the three-equation turbulent convection model from Kuhfuss to radial stellar pulsation modeling. Methods. We use a Reynolds-stress one-point closure approach to derive our extensions alongside the model, while using additional models from the literature to close the anisotropy and dissipation terms. Results. We provide five extensions to the original model. These include an enhanced dissipation correction to the mixing length, a local anisotropy model replacing eddy viscosity, a second-order correction for turbulent ion transport in the atmosphere (alongside opacity effects), and turbulent damping of entropy fluctuations and convective flux.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04953" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Triaxial Magnetars as Sources of Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2601.04953]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I suggest that some of the mysterious temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) may be explained if they are produced by dynamically triaxial magnetars.

Apparently non-repeating FRB may be triaxial with the direction of open field lines and radiation wandering across the sky, reducing their duty factors by several orders of magnitude. A slightly triaxial moment tensor in repeaters moves the line of sight into or out of the radiation pattern or within it, explaining periods of greater or lesser (or absent) activity, and making the probability of detecting a burst vary aperiodically.

Though certainly a black hole (BH) in the cases of the most massive BNSs, X-ray lightcurves from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows suggest a neutron star (NS) as a viable candidate for both the merger remnant as well as the central engine of these transients. When jointly observed with gravitational waves (GWs), X-ray lightcurves from BNS merger events could provide critical constraints on the remnant's nature. We aim to assess the current and future capabilities to detect a NS remnant through X-ray observations following GW detections. To this end, we simulate GW signals from BNS mergers and the subsequent X-ray emission from newborn millisecond magnetars. The GW detectability is modeled for both current and next-generation interferometers, while the X-ray emission is reproduced using a dedicated numerical code that models magnetar spin-down and ejecta dynamics informed by numerical-relativity simulations. In our simulations, 2% - 16% of BNS mergers form millisecond magnetars. Among these, up to 70% could be detectable, amounting to up to 1 millisecond magnetar detection per year with SVOM/MXT-like instruments during the LIGO Virgo KAGRA LIGO India (LVKI) O5 run, with optimal detectability occurring about 2 hours post-merger. For next-generation GW interferometers, this rate could increase by up to three orders of magnitude, with peak detectability 3 to 4 hours post-merger. We also explore how the magnetar's magnetic field strength and observer viewing angle affect detectability and discuss optimized observational strategies. Although more likely with upcoming GW interferometers, detecting the spin-down emission of a millisecond magnetar may already be within reach, warranting sustained theoretical and observational efforts given the profound implications for mergers, GRBs, and NS physics of a single detection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jet launching from the Kerr black hole magnetosphere: An electrogeodesic approach</a><span class="id">[2601.05048]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The launch of relativistic jets of plasma on astrophysical to cosmological scales are observed in a variety of astrophysical sources, from active galactic nuclei to X-rays binaries. While these jets can be reproduced by the general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) and particle-in-cells (GRPIC) simulations of the dynamical Kerr magnetosphere, the development of analytic models to describe the physics of the jets has remained limited. A key challenge is to analytically describe the individual trajectories of accelerated charged particles which ultimately build up the jet and emit radiation. In this work, we provide a first simple but fully analytical model of jet launching from the Kerr magnetosphere based on the motion of charged particles. To that end, we use the integrability of electrogeodesic motion in the Kerr monopole magnetosphere to study the ejection of charged particles near the poles. This enables us to derive (i) a criterion for the rotation axis to constitute a stable latitunal equilibrium position, thereby representing an idealized jet, (ii) the expression for the magnetic frame-dragging effect, and (iii) the condition for an asymptotic observer to measure blueshifted particles emanating from the black hole surroundings. Our study reveals that particles can be accelerated only in a specific region whose maximal radius depends on the spin and magnetization of the black hole. Alongside these results, we provide a detailed review of the construction of test magnetospheres from (explicit and hidden) symmetries of the Kerr geometry and the condition for the separability of the electrogeodesic motion in a test magnetosphere, which serves as a basis for the model we study in this work.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energetic particles accelerated via turbulent magnetic reconnection in protoplanetary discs – I: ionisation rates</a><span class="id">[2601.05060]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ionisation controls the chemistry, thermal balance, and magnetic coupling in protoplanetary discs. However, standard ionisation vectors such as stellar UV, X-rays, Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) might not be efficient enough, as UV/X-rays are attenuated rapidly with depth, while GCRs are modulated. Turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection in disc atmospheric layers offers a physically motivated, in-situ source of energetic particles (EPs) that has never been considered. We quantify the ionisation and heating produced by EPs accelerated by turbulent reconnection, identify where they dominate over X-rays and GCRs, and determine energetic thresholds for their relevance. We provide scalable diagnostics tied to the local energy budget. We adopt a Fermi-like acceleration model with parameters linked to a turbulent reconnection geometry trigger by the magneto-rotational instability, yielding a steady-state energy distribution of the EP forming a power-law of index $p=2.5$. We propagate electrons and protons through the disc and compute primary and secondary ionisation and associated heating on a fiducial T Tauri disc model background. The non-thermal normalisation is set by the fraction of local viscous accretion energy dissipation channelled to EPs, parametrised by $\kappa$. For $\kappa\gtrsim 0.4\%$, EPs ionisation overpass standard sources like X-rays and GCRs in the disc atmosphere and intermediate/deep layers out to radii of a few tens of AU. Even at $\kappa\sim 0.025\%$, EPs contribute at the few-percent level, thus are chemically and dynamically relevant. EP-induced heating complements UV/X-ray heating in the atmosphere and persists deeper. These results identify EPs accelerated by turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection as a rather robust, disc-internal ionisation channel that should be included in thermo-chemical and dynamical models of protoplanetary discs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Primoridal Black Hole Abundance with Space-Based Detectors</a><span class="id">[2601.05069]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Overdense regions can collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe, which are a compelling candidate for dark matter.

We aim to constrain the vertical and meridional distribution of stratospheric CO and assess the relative contributions of these potential sources. Here, we analysed high-spectral-resolution ALMA observations of the CO (J=3-2) line obtained on 25 May 2018, sampling Saturn's limb from 20°S to 69°N. CO vertical profiles were retrieved using a line-by-line radiative transfer model combined with spectral inversion techniques, testing multiple prior scenarios representative of different source hypotheses. CO is confined to a narrow layer between 0.1 and 1 mbar, with a robust negative vertical gradient and mean abundances of (3.7+/- 0.8) x 10$^{-8}$ at 0.1 mbar and (7.2 +/- 0.9) x 10$^{-8}$ at 1 mbar. The meridional distribution is statistically homogeneous, with a marginal enhancement near 60° N plausibly related to Enceladus. No significant equatorial enhancement is detected. The absence of a strong equatorial enhancement rules out a long-lived steady source associated with ring infall. The observations are most consistent with a relatively recent ($\approx$200-year-old or younger) cometary impact whose material has since been horizontally mixed, while any Cassini Grand Finale ring influx was either too recent or inefficient to affect CO abundances at the probed pressure levels.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multigroup Radiation Diffusion on a Moving Mesh: Implementation in RICH and Application to Tidal Disruption Events</a><span class="id">[2601.05120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) determines the bulk evolution and observable emission in a wide variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena.

We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells. Finally, we apply multigroup RICH in a pilot study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How deep can a cosmic void be?

To address this shortcoming, we develop a &quot;4pi&quot; full-heliosphere event forecasting framework and evaluate its statistical classification ability against this specific challenge. A magnetic surface flux transport model is used to generate full-sun maps of the photospheric radial magnetic field from which active regions (ARs) are identified and tracked using a new labeling scheme that is observer-location agnostic and allows for post-facto modifications. Flare-relevant magnetic parameters couple to a &quot;visibility&quot; index that specifies AR location relative to the visible solar limb and expected flare detection. Flare labels are assigned according to peak Soft X-ray flux, and a statistical classification is performed using nonparametric discriminant analysis. A version where new or emerging ARs on the far (&quot;invisible&quot; side of the Sun are incorporated into the model by way of far-side helioseismology, is also tested. We evaluate the new framework by its performance specifically including the limb areas using Brier Skill Score and ROC Skill Score, finding improvement at the 2-sigma level or less. However, we do find that the number of False Negatives, or &quot;missed&quot; forecasts decreases, and find strong evidence that the additional information provided by the far-side helioseismology can help predict near- and just-beyond-limb flares, particularly for East-limb events. While individual components of this framework could be improved, we demonstrate that a known failure mode for solar flare forecasting can be mitigated with available resources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitigating Simulator Dependence in AI Parameter Inference for the Epoch of Reionization: The Importance of Simulation Diversity</a><span class="id">[2601.05229]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 21cm signal of neutral hydrogen contains a wealth of information about the poorly constrained era of cosmological history, the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Recently, AI models trained on EoR simulations have gained significant attention as a powerful and flexible option for inferring parameters from 21cm observations. However, previous works show that AI models trained on data from one simulator fail to generalize to data from another, raising doubts about AI models' ability to accurately infer parameters from observation. We develop a new strategy for training AI models on cosmological simulations based on the principle that increasing the diversity of the training dataset improves model robustness by averaging out spurious and contradictory information. We train AI models on data from different combinations of four simulators, then compare the models' performance when predicting on data from held-out simulators acting as proxies for the real universe. We find that models trained on data from multiple simulators perform better on data from a held-out simulator than models trained on data from a single simulator, indicating that increasing the diversity of the training dataset improves a model's ability to generalize. This result suggests that future EoR parameter inference methods can mitigate simulator-specific bias by incorporating multiple simulation approaches into their analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mimicking Phantom Dark Energy with Evolving Dark Matter Mass</a><span class="id">[2601.05235]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a general method to reproduce a given cosmological background through energy exchange between dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM). This can be simply realized with a standard quintessence scalar field that controls the DM mass. In particular a background with phantom crossing can be effectively realized without introducing ghosts or other pathologies. For example one can reproduce exactly the background that gives the best fit to the recent DESI+CMB+DESY5 data, within the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of DE. Although the background evolution is identical, the perturbations differ, leading to modified growth of structures. If the DM mass varies at late times, early-time observables are not modified and can reproduce the main predictions of the target model, but late-time observables are affected. We discuss in particular the effects on the matter power spectrum, CMB lensing and ISW effect. When reproducing the best fit CPL background model, this scenario generically predicts $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ deviations in such observables. However, for suitable choices of parameters, effects on the matter power spectrum can be smaller, motivating a detailed study. In general, energy exchange between DE and DM generates a mismatch between the matter power spectrum and the gravitational potential amplitudes compared to the decoupled case, that can lead to deviations observable in future experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Color-Singlet and Color-Octet Quark Matters</a><span class="id">[2601.01879]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quarks and antiquarks carry color and electric charges and belong to the color-triplet $3$ group and the color-antitriplet $\bar 3$ group respectively.

We start our investigation with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff, i.e., $L=(\gamma H^{2}+\delta\dot{H})^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, and highlight the range of allowed $\alpha$ (Lévy's index) values for which big, little and pseudo rip can occur. In particular, we highlight the occurrence of a big rip for fractional values of the Lévy's index in the allowed range $1&lt;\alpha\leq2$. Moreover, we conclude that the occurrence of a pseudo-rip requires Lévy's index to be $\alpha&gt;2$. Therefore, we reject the possibility of pseudo-rip within the GO cutoff. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the occurrence of the little rip in FHDE equipped with a GO cutoff is rather contrived and requires a specific functional form of the IR cutoff $L\sim(\gamma H^{2}+g(H))^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, which belongs to a larger class of Nojiri-Odintsov (NO) cutoffs. To extend our perspective beyond the GO cutoff, we investigate the interacting FHDE framework equipped with the Hubble cutoff, i.e., $L=H^{-1}$, in developing an ansatz-based approach to the little and pseudo-rip singularities as they fail to appear in the GO cutoff. Within this approach, we invoke the expression of the Hubble parameter, $H(t)$, which corresponds to the little and pseudo-rip, into the cosmological parameters such as the Equation of State (EoS) and Squared Sound Speed (SSS) as a function of cosmic time $t$. We produce numerical plots of these parameters in both linear and non-linear $Q$ regimes, which supplement our theoretical findings. In summary, our results highlight the occurrence of little and pseudo-rip singularities within a Hubble cutoff for a non-linear $Q$ term within the FHDE framework.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for Ultralight Axion Dark Matter with a Levitated Ferromagnetic Torsional Oscillator</a><span class="id">[2601.04576]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a search for ultralight axion dark matter coupled to electron spins using a levitated ferromagnetic torsional oscillator (FMTO).

Although this mechanism generates baryon number efficiently only after the quark-hadron transition, by incorporating a realistic stochastic PMF within a semi-analytical framework, we find that matching the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry robustly requires PMF strengths of order $10^{10}$ T right after the transition, in agreement with causal QCD-era magnetogenesis. We further reveal that magnetic fluctuations drive the baryon-density spectrum to white noise on large scales, yielding an isocurvature component compatible with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) bounds.

These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the “inflaton”). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $\Lambda$). In the FLRW epoch, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $\Lambda\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(m_{\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help to cure the cosmological tensions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09367" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Environmental Decoupling: Reconciling SNe Ia Time Dilation with Null Variations of $α$</a><span class="id">[2305.09367]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Generalized Cosmological Time (GCT) framework interprets the observed time dilation in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as a manifestation of a generalized lapse function in the background metric, favoring a parameter value b \approx 0.04. However, precision spectroscopic measurements of the fine-structure constant \alpha via the alkali doublet (AD) and many-multiplet (MM) methods predominantly yield null results. In this work, I demonstrate that this discrepancy is not a sensitivity limitation but a fundamental physical consequence of distinguishing between global coordinate time and local proper time. By inverting the GCT scaling relations, I establish that spectroscopic data constrain the effective parameter to |b_{\text{local}}| \lesssim 10^{-5}, revealing a tension of three orders of magnitude against the background value. I resolve this by invoking the principle of environmental shielding. I argue that dense, virialized gas clouds maintain a static local metric that is dynamically decoupled from the background cosmological time flow, strictly analogous to the detachment of bound systems from the Hubble expansion. Consequently, atomic spectra probe a shielded local frame where physical constants remain invariant, whereas SNe Ia observations measure the accumulated geometric time dilation of photons traversing the expanding background. This framework reconciles the positive dilation signals in geometric probes with the stability of fundamental constants in local bound systems without modifying local physical laws.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14750" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme Solar Flare Prediction Using Residual Networks with HMI Magnetograms and Intensitygrams</a><span class="id">[2405.14750]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar flares, especially C, M, and X class, pose significant risks to satellite operations, communication systems, and power grids.

During the inflationary period all dimensions (compact and non-compact) expand exponentially in terms of the 5D proper time. This set-up requires about 40 $e$-folds to expand the fifth dimension from the fundamental length to the micron size. At the end of 5D inflation (or at any given moment during the inflationary phase) one can interpret the solution in terms of 4D fields using 4D Planck units from the relation $M_p^2 = 2 \pi R M_*^3$, which amounts going to the 4D Einstein frame. This implies that if the compactification radius $R$ expands $N$ $e$-folds, then the 3D space would expand $3N/2$ $e$-folds as a result of a uniform 5D inflation. We reexamine the primordial power spectrum predicted by this model and show that it is consistent with Planck's measurements of the comic microwave background. The best-fit to Planck data corresponds to $R \sim 10~\mu$m. A departure of the angular power spectrum predicted by 4D cosmology is visible at multipole moment $\ell \sim 7$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulations of Global Solar Convection with a Fully Compressible CHORUS++ Code</a><span class="id">[2503.21043]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fluid-dynamics simulations of global solar convection are a critically important tool for assessing the dynamics of the solar interior. However, simulation studies with a fully compressible hydrodynamics code are not yet common. The CHORUS++ code solves robustly and efficiently the fully compressible hydrodynamics equations using a compact local spectral method and semi-unstructured grid system. Using the CHORUS++ code, we simulate the solar interior plasma flows from 0.7 to 0.99 of the solar radius using the values of the solar total luminosity and the sidereal rotation rate. In this paper, we analyze the simulated global flow structures before the statistically stable state to assess the compressibility of the plasma flows obtained with the fully compressible hydrodynamic code. The divergence of mass flux with the compressible model is overall small in the examined state before reaching the equilibrium state of the convection, which implies that the differences between the fully compressible flows and those obtained with the anelastic, incompressible, or linear-equation models are small in the simulated inner part of the convection zone. Although a fully-relaxed stationary convection has not been achieved yet in the examined state, the model qualitatively reproduces the solar-type differential rotation. Simulations for longer periods are needed to achieve the system relaxation state. This work, assessing the early phase of the hydrodynamic evolution of solar convection, is our first step toward a better understanding of the nature of solar convection and the dynamo processes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Purely gravitational dark matter production in warm inflation</a><span class="id">[2504.13147]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider an appealing scenario for the production of purely gravitational dark matter in the background of warm inflation, a mechanism that maintains stable thermal bath during inflation. Through systematic investigation of various gravitational production channels, we reveal distinctive features compared to the standard inflation scenario. Notably, the inflaton annihilation channel in warm inflation exhibits markedly different thermodynamics from the standard inflation paradigm, leading to a suppression on the production of sub-inflaton-mass dark matter. For the production channel of inflationary vacuum fluctuations, we find an abundance-mass correlation of $\rho_\chi\propto m_\chi^{1/2}(m_\chi^{5/2})$ for the sub-Hubble-mass dark matter with minimal(conformal) coupling. Our results also indicate that a minimum temperature threshold of $10^{-6}M_P$ is necessary for warm inflation, which allows adequate dark matter production. With observational constraints, our results provide stringent limits on the mass range of purely gravitational dark matter with sufficient density: $10^{-8}-10^{-2}M_P$ for minimal coupling and $10^{-14}-10^{-2}M_P$ for conformal coupling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-messenger standard-siren cosmology for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors: forecasts considering observations of gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae</a><span class="id">[2504.17741]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, GW multi-messenger observations for binary neutron star merger events can exert great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history.

During an assumed 10-year observation, we predict that the number of detectable GW-kilonova events is $\sim 4900$ with redshifts below $\sim 0.4$ under GW network and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in the $i$ band, which is three times more than that of GW-GRB detections. For the cosmological analysis, we find that with the inclusion of GW-kilonova detections, the constraints on cosmological parameters from GW-EM detections are significantly improved compared to those from GW-GRB detections. In particular, GW-EM detections can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with a precision ranging from $0.076\%$ to $0.034\%$. Moreover, GW multi-messenger observations could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). The combination of CBS and GW-EM can tightly constrain the equation of state parameters of dark energy $w$ in the $w$CDM model and $w_0$ in the $w_0w_a$CDM model with precisions of $0.72\%$ and $0.99\%$, respectively, meeting the standard of precision cosmology. In conclusion, GW multi-messenger observations could play a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probing the fundamental nature of dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04739" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimization of Transfers linking Ballistic Captures to Earth-Moon Periodic Orbit Families</a><span class="id">[2507.04739]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The design of transfers to periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon system has regained prominence with NASA's Artemis and CNSA's Chang'e programs. This work addresses the problem of linking ballistic capture trajectories - exploiting multi-body dynamics for temporary lunar orbit insertion - with bounded periodic motion described in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). A unified framework is developed for optimizing bi-impulsive transfers to families of periodic orbits via a high-order polynomial expansion of the CR3BP dynamics. That same expansion underlies a continuous parameterization of periodic orbit families, enabling rapid targeting and analytic sensitivity. Transfers to planar periodic orbit families - such as Lyapunov L1/L2 and distant retrograde orbits (DROs) - are addressed first, followed by extension to spatial families - such as butterfly and halo L1/L2 orbits - with an emphasis towards near-rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs). Numerical results demonstrate low-{\Delta}v solutions and validate the method's adaptability for designing lunar missions. The optimized trajectories can inform an established low-energy transfer database, enriching it with detailed cost profiles that reflect both transfer feasibility and underlying dynamical relationships to specific periodic orbit families. Finally, the proposed transfers provide reliable estimates for rapid refinement, making them readily adaptable for further optimization across mission-specific needs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07411" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating non-Keplerian motion in flare events with astrometric data</a><span class="id">[2507.07411]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The GRAVITY interferometer has achieved microarcsecond precision in near-infrared interferometry, enabling the tracking of flare centroid motion in the strong gravitational field near the Sgr A*. It might be promising to serve as a unique laboratory for exploring the accretion matter near black holes or testing Einstein's gravity. Recent studies debated whether there is a non-Keplerian motion of the flares in the GRAVITY dataset. This motivates us to present a comprehensive analysis based on error estimation under the Bayesian framework. This study uses astrometric flare data to investigate the possibility that the flares exhibit deviations from the circular Keplerian motion. We analyze both averaged and individual flare data, modeling the hotspot with either circular orbits parameterized by a non-Keplerian correction or planar geodesic orbits. It is confirmed that the astrometric data favor the circular orbits over non-circular ones, with the orbital circularity parameter of $\gamma = 0.99_{-0.10}^{+0.07}$. Our results show that the joint posteriors for black hole mass and non-Keplerian parameter are negatively correlated. Fixing the mass to be its established value yields a non-Keplerian parameter of $\omega/\omega_k = 1.45^{+0.35}_{-0.38}$, at approximately the 1$\sigma$ level. The statistical significance is insufficiently high, and the conclusion is found to be sensitive to the presence of correlations in the astrometric data, which might originate from the non-uniform $u$-$v$ coverage in interferometer measurements. In this sense, the current data might be insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the presence of non-Keplerian motion. Future improvements in astrometry precision might enable stronger constraints on the kinematical behavior of the flares.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biasing from galaxy trough and peak profiles with the DES Y3 redMaGiC galaxies and the weak lensing mass map</a><span class="id">[2509.18967]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We measure the correspondence between the distribution of galaxies and matter around troughs and peaks in the projected galaxy density, by comparing \texttt{redMaGiC} galaxies ($0.15&lt;z&lt;0.65$) to weak lensing mass maps from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data release. We obtain stacked profiles, as a function of angle $\theta$, of the galaxy density contrast $\delta_{\rm g}$ and the weak lensing convergence $\kappa$, in the vicinity of these identified troughs and peaks, referred to as `void' and `cluster' superstructures. The ratio of the profiles depend mildly on $\theta$, indicating good consistency between the profile shapes. We model the amplitude of this ratio using a function $F(\eta, \theta)$ that depends on cosmological parameters $\eta$, scaled by the galaxy bias. We construct templates of $F(\eta, \theta)$ using a suite of $N$-body (`Gower Street') simulations forward-modelled with DES Y3-like noise and systematics. We discuss and quantify the caveats of using a linear bias model to create galaxy maps from the simulation dark matter shells. We measure the galaxy bias in three lens tomographic bins (near to far): $2.32^{+0.86}_{-0.27}, 2.18^{+0.86}_{-0.23}, 1.86^{+0.82}_{-0.23}$ for voids, and $2.46^{+0.73}_{-0.27}, 3.55^{+0.96}_{-0.55}, 4.27^{+0.36}_{-1.14}$ for clusters, assuming the best-fit \textit{Planck} cosmology. Similar values with $\sim0.1\sigma$ shifts are obtained assuming the mean DES Y3 cosmology. The biases from troughs and peaks are broadly consistent, although a larger bias is derived for peaks, which is also larger than those measured from the DES Y3 $3\times2$-point analysis. This method shows an interesting avenue for measuring field-level bias that can be applied to future lensing surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06154" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Possibility of Melting Water Ice during the Recent Past of Mars: Application to the Formation of Gullies</a><span class="id">[2510.06154]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formation of gullies on Mars has often been attributed to the melting of (sub)surface water ice. However, melting-based hypotheses generally overlook key processes: (1) sublimation cooling by latent heat absorption, (2) the non-stability of ice where melting conditions can be reached, and (3) the particular microclimates of gullied slopes. Using state-of-the-art climate simulations, we reassess ice melting scenarios over the past four million years (obliquity &lt;= 35°), beyond the estimated period of gully formation. We find that the melting of opaque water snow or ice at the surface of Mars is unlikely anywhere due to sublimation cooling, while (quasi-) stable subsurface ice is typically too deep to reach melting temperatures. We propose an alternative mechanism in which seasonal CO2 frost sublimation destabilizes the regolith and brings the underlying water ice close to the surface, allowing rapid heating. Even under these optimal conditions, melting requires unrealistic assumptions. Ice containing a small amount of dust could melt via a solid-state greenhouse effect, but both its possibility and frequency in Mars' recent past remain uncertain.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling the formation of N2 and CH4 frost on Pluto's slopes</a><span class="id">[2510.07003]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. The equatorial region of Cthulhu as revealed by New Horizons appears to be generally dark and largely devoid of volatiles because its surface albedo is low. Localized bright patches, however, which are interpreted as CH4 frost, are observed on crater rims and slopes. Aims. Previous studies suggested that these frosts might result from the peculiar insolation driven by the geometry of these slopes, but this has never been tested quantitatively. We investigated the origin, stability, and potential role of these localized frost deposits in the volatile cycle of Pluto. Methods. We implemented a new subgrid-scale slope parameterization in the volatile transport model for Pluto, which accounts for the specific solar irradiation and the resulting surface and subsurface temperatures on sloped terrains. This parameterization also allows the condensation and sublimation of volatiles (either N2 or CH4) on slopes, including the effect of large-scale transport of these species. This is key to determining the amount of frost that forms or disappears. Results. Our simulations reproduce the observed CH4 frost on north-facing slopes as seasonal deposits that currently sublimate, predict perennial CH4 frost on south-facing slopes, and show that the slope microclimates are not expected to alter global volatile cycles. Conclusions. Seasonal and perennial N2 and CH4 frosts can form on the Pluto slopes, even in its darkest and warmest regions, because the locally sunlight received on inclined terrain is reduced. Despite the abundance of sloped surfaces on Pluto, the slope microclimates still only appear to have a minor effect on the global volatile cycles of the planet.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating Circumstellar Atomic Radiation-driven Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2512.01474]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The interactions between stars and their orbiting planets, driven by forces such as stellar radiation and gravity, play an essential role in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres and gas-rich debris discs.

Introducing modulation artificially shows that an amplitude of 0.15 would have been detected robustly.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Simultaneous Stellar Modeling Uncertainties on the Tip of the Red Giant Branch for Axion-Election Coupling</a><span class="id">[2305.03113]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel method for incorporating the effects of stellar modeling uncertainties into constraints on the axion-electron coupling constant found using the observed calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) I band magnitude $M_I$. We simulate grids of models with varying initial stellar mass, helium abundance, metallicity, and axion-electron coupling $\alpha_{26}= 10^{26} g^2_{ae}/4\pi$ but different (fixed) mixing lengths and mass loss efficiencies. We then train separate machine learning emulators to predict $M_I$ as a function of the varying parameters for each grid. Our emulators enable the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations where $\alpha_{26}$ is varied simultaneously with the stellar parameters. One of our grids yields a bound $\alpha_{26}\leq 0.75$ at the 95\% confidence limit, a factor of $\sim3.7$ weaker than previous bounds; while the other grid yields $\alpha_{26}\leq1.58$ at the 95\% confidence limit, a factor $\sim7.8$ weaker than previous bounds. We demonstrate that the different values we find are due to covariances between stellar and axion physics that are not accounted for by single parameter variations. Our results suggest that the bound on $\alpha_{26}$ derived using empirical calibrations of the TRGB I band magnitude need to be reevaluated using simultaneous parameter variation. Alternative methods that use the bolometric luminosity instead of $M_I$ are more robust because they are not reliant upon theoretical predictions of the effective temperature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit: a perspective from local geometrical invariants and matter distributions</a><span class="id">[2503.02320]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, the deflection angle of photons in the strong deflection limit exhibits a logarithmic divergence. We introduce an analytical framework that clarifies the physical origin of this divergence by employing local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities alongside the properties of the matter distribution. In contrast to conventional formulations – where the divergence rate $\bar{a}$ is expressed via coordinate-dependent metric functions – our approach relates $\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal basis adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By applying the Einstein equations, we derive the expression \begin{align*} \bar{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-8\pi R_{\mathrm{m}}^2\left(\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}}, \end{align*} where $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}$ denote the local energy density and tangential pressure evaluated at the photon sphere of areal radius $R_{\mathrm{m}}$. This result reveals that $\bar{a}$ is intrinsically governed by the local matter distribution, with the universal value $\bar{a}=1$ emerging when $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}=0$. Notably, this finding resolves the long-standing puzzle of obtaining $\bar{a}=1$ in a class of spacetimes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21078" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alternative to Axions</a><span class="id">[2504.21078]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $U(1)$ CP-violating phase which arises below chiral symmetry breaking in a non-Abelian gauge theory is “secretly&quot; the magnetic dual of the flux of a $U(1)$ $4$-form gauge field.

Given its low-lying excited state at 14.4 keV, $^{57}$Fe can be efficiently excited in the hot cores of supergiant stars, possibly leading to axions emission. The conversion of these axions into photons in the Galactic magnetic field results in a characteristic 14.4 keV line, potentially detectable by hard X-ray telescopes such as NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). In this work, we present the first constraints on axion-nucleon couplings derived from \textsc{NuSTAR} observations of Betelgeuse and discuss the potential insights that could be gained from detecting this line in other nearby supergiants. Our results establish significantly more stringent bounds than those obtained from solar observations, setting a limit of $|g_{a\gamma} g_{aN}^{\mathrm{eff}}| &lt; (1.2 - 2.7) \times 10^{-20}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17820" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Asymptotic Nature of Cosmological Effective Theories</a><span class="id">[2505.17820]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Much of our intuition about Effective Field Theories (EFTs) stems from their formulation in flat spacetime, yet EFTs have become indispensable tools in cosmology, where time-dependent backgrounds are the norm. In this work, we demonstrate that in spacetimes undergoing significant expansion-such as accelerated FLRW and de Sitter backgrounds-the contributions of operators with mass dimension $\Delta$ to physical observables grow factorially with $\Delta$ at fixed couplings. This behavior stands in stark contrast to static flat spacetime. As a result, the cosmological EFT expansion is generally asymptotic rather than convergent, even at tree level. To illustrate this phenomenon, we analyze simple toy models involving a massless or conformally coupled scalar field interacting with a heavy scalar with zero or infinite sound speed. We demonstrate that meaningful EFT predictions can still be extracted via appropriate resummation techniques, performed in both Fourier and Mellin-momentum space. In the infinite sound speed limit, where the heavy field is effectively non-dynamical, the resummed EFT reproduces the exact result of the full theory. In other cases, the EFT captures only the local part of the dynamics, omitting nonlocal terms, which are exponentially suppressed in the large-mass limit for the Bunch-Davies state. Our results provide detailed and quantitative expectations for more general cosmological EFTs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational waves from a dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition</a><span class="id">[2507.01191]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that a `QCD dilaton' field, whose vacuum expectation value sets the strong coupling, can render the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) confinement transition first-order. The QCD dilaton is cosmologically attracted to a false vacuum at weak coupling in the early universe. Quantum tunnelling towards the true vacuum triggers prompt chiral symmetry breaking and confinement of QCD, leading to detonating bubbles of the hadronic phase. We find that plasma sound waves produced by this dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition generate a stochastic gravitational wave signal strikingly similar to the recently detected gravitational wave background from Pulsar Timing Arrays. We briefly comment on how this theory can be probed through collider experiments and cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black hole spectroscopy of collapsing and merging neutron stars</a><span class="id">[2508.15534]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Black hole spectroscopy is an important pillar when studying gravitational waves from black holes and enables tests of general relativity. Most of the gravitational-wave signals observed over the last decade originate from binary black hole systems. Binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star systems are rarer but of particular interest for the next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. These events offer the exciting possibility of studying matter effects on the ringdown of &quot;dirty black holes&quot;. In this work, we ask the question: Does matter matter? Using numerical-relativity, we simulate a wide range of collapsing neutron stars producing matter environments, both in isolated scenarios and in binary mergers. Qualitatively, the resulting ringdown signals can be classified into &quot;clean&quot;, &quot;modified&quot;, and &quot;distorted&quot; cases, depending on the amount of matter that is present. We apply standard strategies for extracting quasinormal modes of clean signals, using both theory-agnostic and theory-specific assumptions. Even in the presence of matter, possible modifications of quasinormal modes seem to be dominated by ringdown modeling systematics. We find that incorporating multiple quasinormal modes allows one to drastically reduce mismatches and errors in estimating the final black hole mass at early times. If not treated carefully, deviations in the fundamental quasinormal mode might artificially be overestimated and falsely attributed to the presence of matter or violations of general relativity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic-ray cooling by dark matter in astrophysical jets</a><span class="id">[2509.18850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Astrophysical jets from powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN) have recently been proposed as promising probes of dark matter (DM) in the sub-GeV mass range. AGN launch relativistic jets that accelerate cosmic rays (CRs) to very high energies, which can then interact with their surroundings and produce multiwavelength (MW) emission spanning from radio frequencies to TeV $\gamma$ rays. If DM consists of light particles, their interactions with CRs could lead to an additional cooling mechanism that modifies the expected MW emission. In this work, we analyse the MW spectrum of Markarian 421, a well-studied AGN, using a multizone leptonic jet model that includes the interactions between CR electrons and DM particles. For the first time, we account for the uncertainties in the astrophysical jet dynamics, which have been previously neglected when constraining the CR-DM interactions. By fitting simultaneously jet parameters and DM-electrons interactions, we use the MW data from \mkn to set constraints on the DM-induced CR cooling. We obtain 5$\sigma$ upper limit $\sigma_\text{DM-e} \lesssim 1 \times 10^{-34}~\text{cm}^2$ for a DM mass of $1~{\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that this is about a factor of 2–10 stronger than traditional approaches depending on DM mass. This improvement originates from having indeed considered the full multi-wavelength emission from the source, instead if a simplified approach. Properly accounting for degeneracies between jet dynamics and DM interactions is also key to deriving robust constraints on DM interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21652" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A User-Friendly Python Interface for Numerical Relativity Program AMSS-NCKU</a><span class="id">[2509.21652]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Numerical relativity has brought about profound and wide-ranging influences on modern astrophysics and gravitational-wave astronomy.

Such overlaps can bias parameter estimation (PE) and mimic signatures of other physical effects, such as gravitational lensing. In this work, we investigate how overlapping signals can be degenerate with gravitational lensing by focusing on two scenarios: Type-II strong lensing and microlensing by an isolated point-mass lens. We simulate quasicircular binary black-hole pairs with chirp-mass ratios $\mathscr{M}_{\rm B}/\mathscr{M}_{\rm A}\in\{0.5,\,1,\,2\}$, SNR ratios $\mathrm{SNR}_{\rm B}/\mathrm{SNR}_{\rm A}\in\{0.5,\,1\}$, and coalescence-time offsets $\Delta t_{\rm c}\in[-0.1,\,0.1]~\mathrm{s}$. Bayesian PE and fitting-factor studies show that the Type-II lensing hypothesis is favored over the unlensed quasicircular hypothesis ($\log_{10}\mathscr{B}^{\rm L}_{\rm U}&gt;1$) only in a small region of the overlapping parameter space with $\mathscr{M}_{\rm B}/\mathscr{M}_{\rm A}\gtrsim1$ and $|\Delta t_{\rm c}|\leq0.03~\rm{s}$.. Meanwhile, false evidence for microlensing signatures can arise because, to a reasonable approximation, the model produces two superimposed images whose time delay can closely match $|\Delta t_{\rm c}|$. Overall, the inferred Bayes factor depends on relative chirp-mass ratios, relative loudness, difference in coalescence times, and also the absolute SNRs of the overlapping signals. Cumulatively, our results indicate that overlapping black-hole binaries with nearly equal chirp masses and comparable loudness are likely to be falsely identified as lensed. Such misidentifications are expected to become more common as detector sensitivities improve. While our study focuses on ground-based detectors using appropriate detectability thresholds, the findings naturally extend to next-generation GW observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15797" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scattering perspective on gravitational lensing</a><span class="id">[2511.15797]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves propagating across gravitational potentials undergo lensing effects that, in the wave-optics regime, manifest as frequency-dependent amplitude and phase modulations. In this work, we revisit the diffraction integral formalism of gravitational lensing and demonstrate that it admits a natural and transparent interpretation within the framework of scattering theory. We establish a direct correspondence between the lensing amplification factor and the scattering amplitude of waves propagating in curved spacetime, clarifying how familiar lensing limits map onto distinct scattering regimes. In particular, we show that the diffraction integral matches exactly the eikonal limit of the scattering amplitude at lowest post-Minkowskian order, after a change in coordinates and the inclusion of finite-distance effects. We further extend the standard formalism by including subleading corrections to the post-Minkowskian and eikonal approximations. Our results provide a unified theoretical framework for the interpretation of lensed gravitational-wave signals and open the way to more accurate waveform modeling for future lensed observations.</p></div></details></article></body>
