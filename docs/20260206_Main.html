For a Neptune radius solar system the answer is, rarely. For an Oort cloud sized system the answer is different. Simulations of bombardment of the Oort cloud by dark matter suggest that dislodgement of protocomets and their entry into the inner solar system can match the observed frequency of comets, if that PBH fraction is high enough. Comets were traditionally considered as messengers, usually omens. After 50 years of puzzlement regarding dark matter, we need a hint from the dark universe about the size and nature of dark matter particles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04980" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing black hole space-times with the S2 star orbit: a Bayesian comparison</a><span class="id">[2602.04980]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We implement a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to obtain posterior probability distributions for the parameters of the S2 star orbit around Sagittarius A*, for seven representative non-rotating black hole space-time solutions. In particular, we consider the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, Janis-Newman-Winicour, and Bardeen black hole space-times from General Relativity, as well as a black hole solution from Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, a hairy black hole solution from Horndeski theory, and a Yukawa-like black hole from $f(\mathscr{R})$ gravity. To constrain model parameters, we use the most recent publicly available observational data of the S2 star orbit, namely astrometric measurements, spectroscopic data, and the pericentre advance measured by the GRAVITY Collaboration. We further perform a consistent Bayesian comparison of models, calculating the log-Bayes factor of each space-time with respect to the Schwarzschild solution. Our results show that the currently available data indicate no statistically significant preference among the space-times considered. The Bardeen and Yukawa-like models are indistinguishable from Schwarzschild within current uncertainties, while the Reissner-Nordström, Janis-Newman-Winicour, Horndeski and Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton geometries show at most weak and non-decisive strength of evidence under the adopted priors and likelihood choices.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wide sdB binaries. I. Orbital and atmospheric parameters</a><span class="id">[2602.05008]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long-period binary systems containing a B-type hot subdwarf (sdB) and a main-sequence companion are thought to originate from binary interactions involving stable mass transfer from the red giant, the progenitor of the sdB, to the MS companion. However, despite the recent progress in modelling their population, some of their observed properties are not entirely understood. Because determining their orbits requires extended campaigns of high-resolution spectroscopic observations, only a limited number of long-period sdB binaries have been studied with completely determined orbital parameters. A sample of 32 wide binary systems containing sdB stars was selected for the analysis of the radial velocity curves of both companions. The dataset consisted of high-resolution spectra obtained with the HERMES and UVES spectrographs. The orbital parameters were derived by simultaneously fitting Keplerian orbits to the radial velocities of the sdB and its companion. The atmospheric parameters of the cool companions were determined using the GSSP code, which analyses the master spectra of the systems with a grid of LTE atmospheric models. An additional sample of wide sdB binaries was built up by cross-matching the Gaia NSS catalogue with catalogues of sdB candidates and spectroscopically confirmed systems reported by Culpan2022A&amp;A catalogues. The outcomes from both samples were compared with existing theoretical models to assess their consistency with current formation and evolutionary scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamics of the coronal magnetic field in the 2022-10-02 X-class flare</a><span class="id">[2602.05024]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar flares are driven by release of free magnetic energy and often associated with restructurization of the magnetic field topology. Yet, observations of evolving magnetic field in the flaring volume are limited to very few cases including the 2017-09-10 X8.2 limb flare; thus, a verification of whether a similar evolution takes place in other solar flares is needed. Here we report one more, 2022-10-02, X1.1 class solar flare but seen on disk, whose microwave data permit mapping the magnetic field over the flaring source and tracking magnetic field evolution over the course of the flare. We found that the coronal magnetic field shows a prominent decay with the rate up to 10 G s$^{-1}$ in several (above) loop-top locations. The magnetic field is also confidently measured at the loop legs and the bottom part of the erupting filament. Prominent acceleration of electrons is detected where the magnetic field decays. We developed 3D models of the flare, whose magnetic field shows resemblance and also deviation from the magnetic field inferred from the microwave data. This study confirms that the coronal magnetic field decays during the rise phase of the solar flare. The amount of released magnetic energy is sufficient to support other components of the flare energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detailed TESS-Based Light Curve Modeling and Fundamental Parameter Estimation of 27 W UMa-Type Contact Binaries</a><span class="id">[2602.05038]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We performed a comprehensive analysis of 27 short period contact binary systems for which no light curve analysis had previously been reported. Photometric time-series data from the TESS mission were used in this analysis. The observational results were validated using additional TESS sectors, along with complementary photometric observations from the ASAS-SN survey. The photometric light curves of the 27 contact binary systems were analyzed with the BSN application. Model solutions were obtained through iterative fitting followed by MCMC-based refinement to derive reliable system parameters, and starspot configurations were incorporated for seven targets exhibiting O'Connell effect asymmetries. The absolute parameters of the target systems were derived using the empirical parameter relationship between orbital period and semi-major axis. Based on the results of the light curve solutions and the estimated absolute parameters, five of the analyzed systems are identified as A-subtype, while the remaining targets belong to the W-subtype. We analyzed a sample of 484 W UMa contact binaries to identify the physical and orbital parameters that most effectively distinguish A-subtype from W-subtype systems using t-statistics. Three targets exhibited extremely low mass ratios, and their orbital analysis confirmed that they are dynamically stable. The evolutionary states of the systems were examined, showing that lower-mass companions are generally more evolved, while more massive components remain less evolved. The positions of the systems and their stellar components were compared across four diagrams derived from empirical parameter relationship studies, showing good agreement with the linear fits.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the forced orbital plane of the Hilda asteroids</a><span class="id">[2602.05044]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hilda-group asteroids librate in Jupiter's interior 3:2 mean motion resonance. We estimate that the Hilda group is observationally complete up to absolute magnitude $H\leq16.3$. This provides a statistically useful sample of thousands of resonant objects, all within a narrow range of semimajor axes, to compare with theoretical expectaitons of their orbital distribution from dynamical theory. We use von Mises-Fisher statistics to calculate the sample mean planes and mean plane uncertainties for the Hilda group and its Hilda, Schubart, and Potomac collisional subfamilies. Although Laplace-Lagrange linear secular theory is considered inapplicable within mean motion resonances, we find that the Laplace plane and the orbital plane of Jupiter are both statistically indistinguishable from the sample mean plane of the Hildas. In future work, we intend to extend this investigation to resonant populations in the Kuiper belt so as to further test the validity of Laplace-Lagrange linear secular theory for the mean planes of resonant populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05050" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICM-SHOX III. The case of MACS J0018.5+1626, a radio relic that looks like a radio halo?</a><span class="id">[2602.05050]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first detailed numerical modeling of the radio emission from MACS J0018.5+1626 as part of the Improved Constraints on Mergers with SZ, Hydrodynamical simulations, Optical, and X-ray (ICM-SHOX) project. By matching X-ray, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev–Zel'dovich, optical and lensing observables to simulations, the ICM-SHOX pipeline indicates that MACS J0018.5+1626 is undergoing a binary merger close to pericenter passage and is observed along a line of sight nearly aligned with the merger axis. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary cluster mergers coupled to tracer particles and a Fokker–Planck solver to model the radio emission. Exploring variations in the most likely initial conditions within the ICM-SHOX parameter space, such as the relative cluster velocity and impact parameter, we find that the resulting merger configuration consistently produces two merger-driven shocks with typical average Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}_s \sim 2$–$3$ with corresponding standard deviations of $\sigma_{\mathcal{M}} \sim 0.5$–$1.5$. Within this framework, we examine the cluster conditions under which standard diffusive shock acceleration can reproduce LOFAR observations. In particular, we discuss the possibility that the apparent radio halo seen by LOFAR arises from the superposition of two radio relics viewed nearly face-on.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wising up to CatWISE: using simulation-based inference to interpret the ecliptic bias and confirm the cosmic dipole excess</a><span class="id">[2602.05070]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We apply Simulation-Based Inference ('SBI') to the cosmic dipole problem for the first time, measuring the distribution of quasar counts over the sky in the CatWISE2020 ('CatWISE') sample. We show that the quadrupole anisotropy in CatWISE can be attributed to the correlation between WISE's scanning law and photometric uncertainty in the $W1$ and $W2$ magnitudes, inducing an Eddington bias which varies with sky position. After explicitly modelling this with SBI, we use a neural likelihood estimator to find the posterior distribution for CatWISE's dipole, confirming the presence of a dipole twice as large as the CMB expectation but more seriously misaligned with the CMB direction ($\approx 3 \sigma$). We also use our learned likelihood to infer the Bayesian evidence, learning that models which increase the scale of CatWISE's photometric errors are most favoured. This is strong evidence that the sample's errors are underestimated or that there is an additional, unresolved systematic producing the same effect as Eddington bias. While our results indicate that the cosmic dipole excess is a persistent issue for $\Lambda$CDM, we showcase that SBI can untangle the subtle and complex systematic issues affecting any sample derived from real astronomical data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermal Eclipse Observation of the Young Hot Neptune AU Mic b with Spitzer</a><span class="id">[2602.05168]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the observation of a secondary eclipse of the young hot Neptune, AU Mic b, in the infrared using the Spitzer Space Telescope. Using a primary transit from Spitzer to constrain the system parameters, we tentatively detect an eclipse centered at $BJD=2458740.848893^{+0.00010}_{-0.000099}$ with an observed depth of $171\pm{29}$ ppm given an uninformed prior. This corresponds to a dayside brightness temperature of $T=1031\pm{58}$ K, which exceeds the calculated equilibrium temperature of $606\pm{19}$ K. We explore some possible explanations for these results, including inefficient heat redistribution, gravitational contraction, stellar pulsations, instrument systematics and choice of eclipse depth prior, but find none of these to be likely explanations for the observed eclipse parameters. We also explore the impact of correlated noise in the systematic trends, and we find that splitting the systematics into low-pass (smoothing) and high-pass trends is required to reach an optimal minimization of the low-frequency systematics in the resulting detrended light curve. Future observations with JWST are needed to confirm our eclipse detection with Spitzer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for gravitational waves from compact binary mergers powering long gamma-ray bursts during LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's O3 run</a><span class="id">[2602.05169]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutron star binary mergers are often associated with short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but the recent detection of kilonovae coincident with long GRBs suggest that some mergers may produce long GRBs. Motivated by these developments, we perform a search for binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole gravitational-wave signals coincident with long GRBs using data from the third LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA (LVK) observing run. We analyze LVK data coincident with long GRBs detected by Fermi's GRB Monitor and Swift's Burst Alert Telescope when at least two gravitational-wave observatories were running. We find no evidence of a coincident gravitational-wave signal and set limits on the luminosity distance to each of these long GRBs under the assumption that they were powered by binary mergers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotating strange dwarfs and their indistinguishability from white dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2602.05177]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the structure of strange dwarfs, modeled as hybrid compact stars composed of a self bound strange quark matter core surrounded by a white dwarf like crust, within a fully relativistic framework. Static configurations are constructed by solving the Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff equations, and uniformly rotating configurations are modeled within the Hartle Thorne slow rotation expansion (to ${\cal O}(\Omega^2)$). We therefore interpret results at large fractional spins conservatively, and use the Kepler frequency mainly as a reference scale for comparing different masses and models. The stellar matter is described using a hybrid equation of state, in which the crust is modeled by a degenerate electron ion system and the core by the MIT Bag Model. By comparing strange dwarfs with conventional white dwarfs across a range of rotation rates, we show that rotation inflates the radius and can reduce (in a quantifiable way) the separation between the two families in the $(M,R)$ plane, potentially masking structural signatures associated with the presence of a quark core. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for rotational effects when interpreting mass radius measurements and other global observables in the context of searches for exotic compact objects in current and future high precision surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMA 873 $μ$m Polarization Observations of the PDS 70 Disk</a><span class="id">[2602.05247]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>At a 112.4 pc distance, the PDS70 protoplanetary disk is a rare case that has been confirmed to host two accreting planets. This makes it the most important laboratory for studying dust growth in the context of planet formation. Here we present the first deep, full polarization observations at 873 $\mu$m wavelength. We detected $\sim$1%-2.5% linear polarization over the bulk of the $\sim$55-100 AU (sub)millimeter ring. The polarization position angles align preferentially with the projected minor axis of the disk. The standard interpretation is that the observed polarization is caused by dust self-scattering, with a maximum dust grain size of $\sim$100 $\mu$m. On $\gtrsim$10 AU scales, which can be resolved by the presented 873-3075 $\mu$m observations, the ring is marginally optical thick at 873 $\mu$m wavelength. Using Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, we found that an azimuthally asymmetric, marginally optically thick ring with a maximum dust grain size of $\sim$87 $\mu$m can reproduce the observed 873 $\mu$m polarization position angles and percentages. This study indicates that the coagulation of ice-coated dust in the protoplanetary disk may be limited by fragmentation or bouncing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of cataclysmic variables under different magnetic braking prescriptions</a><span class="id">[2602.05260]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. The evolution of cataclysmic variables (CVs) - interacting binaries where a low-mass donor transfers matter to a white dwarf via an accretion disk - is critically controlled by magnetic braking (MB). Significant uncertainties persist regarding how distinct MB formalisms influence CV evolutionary pathways. Aims. We performed systematic simulations of CV evolution under five MB prescriptions using the MESA code: the classical Skumanich law and the Matt, Reiners &amp; Mohanty (RM12), intermediate, and convection-boosted formalisms. Primary objectives included investigating their impact on orbital period distributions, mass-transfer rates, donor star evolution, and period gap characteristics. Methods. Evolutionary sequences were computed across all MB frameworks. We analyzed their effects on key observables: orbital period evolution, accretion rates, and period gap morphology. Results. Magnetic braking prescription selection fundamentally determines whether CV systems develop the characteristic period gap. The intermediate prescription provides optimal consistency with observations of nonmagnetic CVs, simultaneously reproducing the gap location and donor properties. Strong braking models (e.g., Skumanich) produce clear detachment phases, while self-consistent regulation models (Matt12 and RM12) maintain weak angular momentum loss and fail to form a gap, making them more prone to magnetic CVs. Conclusions. The presence or absence of the period gap is primarily governed by the strength and behavior of MB before the donor becomes fully convective. Future studies must further incorporate the regulatory effects of magnetic fields on donor structure to accurately predict the period distribution characteristics of magnetic CVs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Accretion-Modulated Internal Shock Model for Long GRBs</a><span class="id">[2602.05278]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce the Accretion-Modulated Internal Shock model (AMIS) as a possible framework for explaining the observational properties of long gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission. In this scenario, the envelope of the prompt light curve follows the time-dependent mass-supply history to the central engine, associated with stellar collapse and, where applicable, fallback accretion, whose early-time onset can be approximated by $\dot{M}\propto t^{0-1/2}$ and which subsequently may decay as $\dot{M}\propto t^{-5/3}$, producing a photon count rate with a single fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED)-like profile. In general, the prompt-emission envelope is regulated by a time-dependent mass supply to the central engine, while internal shocks produce the rapid variability. Since we only aim to introduce this framework here, we focus on the simplest single-FRED shape of the prompt emission profiles, while more complex cases involving multiple episodes and interacting shocks will be explored in forthcoming studies. The model indicates correlations between spectral evolution, FRED-pulse narrowing at high energies, and the mass-supply-controlled envelope. Stochastic Lorentz factor variations of ejected mass- or rate-driven shells, superimposed on the Accretion-Modulated envelope, explain the coexistence of smooth global trends and irregular short-timescale features, such as the widths of individual pulses in long GRB light curves, offering diagnostic tools for probing the inner engine activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Detailed MeerKAT Imaging Spectroscopy of a Solar Flare</a><span class="id">[2602.05282]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radio observations provide powerful diagnostics of energy release, particle acceleration, and transport processes in solar flares. However, despite recent progress in radio interferometric imaging spectroscopy, current instruments still face limitations in image fidelity and resolution, restricting detailed spectroscopic studies of flaring regions. Here we present high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy of a M1.3 GOES class flare with MeerKAT, a precursor to the future-generation array SKA-Mid. Radio emissions at the observed frequencies typically originate in the low corona, offering valuable insights into magnetic reconnection and primary energy-release sites. The obtained images achieve an unprecedented dynamic range exceeding 10^3, enabling simultaneous analysis of bright coherent bursts and faint incoherent emission from the active region. Multiple spatially distinct coherent sources are identified, implying contributions from different populations of accelerated electrons. The incoherent emission extends beyond AIA structures, highlighting MeerKAT's ability to detect dilute but hot plasma invisible to Extreme Ultraviolet instruments. Combined with co-temporal Hard X-ray images and magnetic field extrapolations, the radio sources are located within distinct magnetic structures, further revealing their association with different populations of accelerated electrons. These results demonstrate MeerKAT imaging spectroscopy as powerful diagnostics of solar flares and pave the way for future solar flare studies with SKA-Mid.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sulfur Enrichment in Close-in Exoplanet Atmospheres Induced by Pebble Drift across the Salt Line</a><span class="id">[2602.05300]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of JWST have revealed that several close-in exoplanets have sulfur-rich atmospheres through SO$_2$ detections. Atmospheric sulfur is often thought to originate from solid accretion during planet formation, whereas recent simultaneous detections of SO$_2$ and NH$_3$ challenge this conventional scenario. In this study, we propose that ammonium salts, such as NH$_4$SH tentatively detected in comets and molecular clouds, play a significant role in producing sulfur-rich disk gases, which serve as the ingredient of giant planet atmospheres. We simulated the radial transport of dust containing volatile ices and ammonium salts, along with the dissociation, sublimation, and recondensation of these materials, thereby predicting the atmospheric chemical structures and transmission spectra of planets inheriting these compositions. Assuming that ammonium salts sequester 20% of the elemental nitrogen and sulfur budgets, our results reveal that they enhance sulfur and nitrogen abundances in disk gases to 2-10 times the solar values near the salt dissociation line. Photochemical simulations demonstrate that SO$_2$, NS, H$_2$S, NO, and NH$_3$ become the dominant N and S chemical species in the atmospheres on planets that inherited the gas compositions inside H$_2$O snowline. SO$_2$ features clearly appear in the infrared transmission spectra when the salt-bearing grains enhance the sulfur abundance of disk gas by pebble drift. Our model provides a novel scenario that explains the SO$_2$ detected in some exoplanet atmospheres solely from disk gas accretion. Volatile-element ratios, particularly N/S and C/O, would provide a key to disentangle our scenario from the conventional solid-accretion scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05309" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fractal dimension of the cosmic web with different galaxy types</a><span class="id">[2602.05309]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fractal dimension $D$ is used to map the large-scale galaxy distribution in the Universe by color types: blue, green and red.

We found a general gradient $D_{\mathrm{blue}}&gt; D_{\mathrm{red}}&gt;D_{\mathrm{green}}$ with $D=1.40-2.03$ for $z&lt;1$. For $1&lt;z\leq4$, the gradient changes to $D_{\mathrm{blue}}&gt;D_{\mathrm{green}}D_{\mathrm{red}}$, and the fractal dimension values are lower, $D=0.03-0.44$.

DESI DR2 delivers percent-level BAO distance ratios over $0\lesssim z\lesssim2.5$, including a Ly$\alpha$-forest anchor at $z_{\rm eff}=2.33$. In CMB-calibrated combinations, flat $\Lambda$CDM exhibits a mild parameter mismatch, while allowing evolving dark energy (e.g.\ CPL $w_0$–$w_a$) can improve the fit; the preference is dataset-dependent and is particularly sensitive to redshift-dependent SN calibration/selection residuals at the few$\times10^{-2}$ mag level. To sharpen likelihood-level interpretation, we provide two diagnostics: (i) an $r_d$-independent BAO-shape observable, $F_{\rm AP}(z)\equiv D_{\rm M}(z)/D_{\rm H}(z)$, constructed directly from published $(D_{\rm M}/r_d,\,D_{\rm H}/r_d)$ with covariance propagation; and (ii) a linear-response map from SN Hubble-diagram systematics $\delta\mu(z)$ to induced biases in $(w_0,w_a)$, yielding an explicit calibration requirement for DESI-era claims of evolving $w(z)$.

Such ejections can increase their orbital eccentricity, providing significant tidal heating in the absence of any stellar energy source. Previous studies suggested that liquid water could exist on such moons under thick CO$_2$-dominated atmospheres, but these models faced challenges with CO$_2$ condensation and atmospheric collapse, particularly in the high-pressure regimes that favoured long-term habitability. To address this, we employ a self-consistent model, including radiative transfer and equilibrium chemistry with condensation, to simulate a more stable hydrogen-dominated atmosphere for a range of initial chemical compositions, including C, O, and N. We find that such atmospheres can effectively trap heat via collision-induced absorption of H$_2$, maintaining surface temperatures suitable for liquid water for time-scales of up to 4.3 Gyr, depending on the surface pressure, while not prone to condensation-induced collapse. Wet-dry cycling caused by the strong tides together with the alkalinity of dissolved NH$_3$ could create favourable conditions for RNA polymerisation and thus support the emergence of life.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Double-Burst Nature and Early Afterglow Evolution of Long GRB 110801A</a><span class="id">[2602.05404]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 110801A, utilizing multi-band data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and ground-based telescopes. The $\gamma$-ray emission exhibits a distinct two-episode (“double-burst”) structure. Rapid follow-up observations in the optical and X-ray bands provide full coverage of the second burst. The optical light curve begins to rise approximately 135 s after the trigger, significantly preceding the second emission episode observed in X-rays and $\gamma$-rays at $\sim 320$ s. This chromatic behavior suggests different physical origins for the optical and high-energy emissions. Joint broadband spectral fitting (optical to $\gamma$-rays) during the second episode reveals that a two-component model, consisting of a power-law plus a Band function, provides a superior fit compared to single-component models. We interpret the power-law component as the afterglow of the first burst (dominating the optical band), while the Band component is attributed to the prompt emission of the second burst (dominating the high-energy bands). A physical synchrotron model is also found to be a viable candidate to explain the high-energy emission. Regarding the afterglow, the early optical light curve displays a sharp transition from a rise of $\sim t^{2.5}$ to $\sim t^{6.5}$, which is well-explained by a scenario involving both reverse shock (RS) and forward shock (FS) components. We constrain the key physical parameters of the burst, deriving an initial Lorentz factor $\Gamma_0 \sim 60$, a jet half-opening angle $\theta_j \sim 0.09$, and an isotropic kinetic energy $E_{\rm k,iso} \sim 10^{54.8}$ erg.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Compact Objects in Wide-Orbit Binaries with Joint LAMOST LRS and MRS</a><span class="id">[2602.05421]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Wide-orbit binaries serve as crucial laboratories for understanding stellar evolution and identifying quiescent compact objects. In this work, we search for compact objects in wide-orbit binaries by merging the LAMOST multi-epoch catalogs from LRS and MRS in the 12th data release. We specifically focus on sources with at least 20 observation epochs that clearly exhibit long-term radial velocity (RV) variations while remaining stable over short time scales. By constraining the mass function with Lomb-Scargle periods and RV ranges, we identified 76 single-lined spectroscopic binary candidates harboring potential compact objects with robust orbital solutions. These systems exhibit orbital periods ranging from 10 to 1000 days, with semi-amplitudes of velocity $K_1 \lesssim 50$ km/s and mass functions $f(M_2)$ between 0.05 and 0.6 $M_{\odot}$. Combining $f(M_2)$ with SED-derived stellar parameters, we identify 6 strong compact object candidates with main-sequence companions (Class A), 24 systems likely consisting of either compact objects with giant/subgiant companions or mass-inverted Algol-type binaries (Class B), and 46 candidates with relatively lower mass ratios (Class C). Cross-matching with the Gaia DR3 nss_two_star_orbit catalog yields 16 sources, all of which exhibit orbital solutions consistent with our results. This study demonstrates the essential role of long-term spectroscopic monitoring in searching for compact objects in wide-orbit binaries and validating orbital solutions. The strategy of leveraging extended time baselines will be increasingly effective as spectroscopic databases continue to grow, enabling the systematic discovery of compact objects in wide orbits across the Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05450" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Correlation Length of Turbulence in Magnetic Clouds</a><span class="id">[2602.05450]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The large-scale limit or outer scale of turbulence in the solar wind is associated with the correlation length of the magnetic field. Determining correlation lengths from magnetic field time series in magnetic clouds is complicated by the presence of the global flux rope: without removal of the flux rope trend, correlation length measurements will be sensitive to the flux rope as well as the turbulence, and give overestimates of the outer scale when turbulence amplitudes at the outer scale are small relative to the flux rope amplitude. We have used force-free flux rope fits to detrend magnetic field time series measured by Parker Solar Probe in two magnetic clouds and calculated the turbulence correlation length in the clouds using the detrended data. The detrended correlation length in terms of the proton inertial length, $d_p$, was $2.7\times10^{4} d_p$ in one cloud (observed at 0.77 au) and $1.6\times10^{4}d_p$ in the other (observed at 0.39 au), significantly smaller than the values obtained without detrending. Increments in the flux rope fits scaled equivalently to a $k^{-3}$ wavenumber power spectrum; this contribution from the flux rope considerably steepened the total spectrum at the largest scales but had a negligible effect in the inertial range, where scaling in both clouds equivalent to $\sim$$k^{-5/3}$ was observed. Finally, we discuss the possible relation of turbulence correlation lengths to mesoscale structure in magnetic clouds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05529" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effects of Dynamo-Generated Large-Scale Magnetic Fields on the Surface Gravity ($f$) Mode</a><span class="id">[2602.05529]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>By modelling the upper layers of the Sun in terms of a two-layer setup where a free-surface exists within the computational domain, we numerically study the interaction between the surface gravity, or the fundamental ($f$) mode, and the magnetic fields. Earlier such works were idealized in the sense that the static magnetic fields were imposed below the photosphere, i.e., the free-surface, to detect signatures of sub-surface magnetic fields and flows on the $f$-mode. In this work, we perform three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations where the interior fluid below the photosphere is stirred helically at small scales, thus facilitating an $\alpha^2$-dynamo. This allows us to investigate how these self-consistently generated large-scale magnetic fields influence the properties of the $f$-mode. We find that when the magnetic fields saturate near the equipartition values with the turbulent kinetic energy of the flow, the $f$-mode is significantly perturbed. Compared to the non-magnetic case, or the kinematic phase of the dynamo when fields are too weak, we note that the frequencies and the strengths of the $f$-mode are enhanced in presence of saturated magnetic fields, with these effects being larger at larger wavenumbers. This qualitatively confirms the earlier findings from observational and numerical works which reported the $f$-mode strengthening due to strong sub-surface magnetic fields.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forecast on $f(R)$ Gravity with HI 21cm Intensity Mapping Surveys</a><span class="id">[2602.05575]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modified gravity theories offer a well-motivated extension of General Relativity and provide a possible explanation for the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. Among them, $f(R)$ gravity represents a minimal and theoretically appealing class, characterized by the Compton wavelength parameter $B_0$, which quantifies deviations from General Relativity. In this work, we explore the capability of future neutral hydrogen (HI) 21 cm intensity mapping (IM) observations to constrain $f(R)$ gravity at low redshifts. We perform Fisher-matrix forecasts for $B_0$ and standard cosmological parameters using upcoming 21 cm IM experiments, including BINGO and SKA1-MID (Band 1 and Band 2), both individually and in combination with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors. We find that even near-term experiments such as BINGO are able to place nontrivial bounds on $B_0$, $\sigma(B_0)\simeq 2.27\times 10^{-6}$, while SKA1-MID yields substantially tighter constraints, with SKA Band 2 providing the strongest sensitivity among the considered configurations, $\sigma(B_0)\simeq 6.37\times 10^{-8}$. We further demonstrate that the combination of low-redshift 21 cm IM data with CMB observations efficiently breaks degeneracies with background cosmological parameters and leads to a significant improvement in the constraints on $B_0$. These results highlight the potential of future HI intensity mapping surveys, in combination with CMB measurements, to provide stringent tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the central engines of gamma-ray bursts from prompt light curves</a><span class="id">[2602.05587]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hyperaccreting stellar-mass black hole systems are leading candidates for the central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Their jets are thought to be powered by either the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process or neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs), but discriminating between these mechanisms remains challenging. To address this, we propose using the luminosity decay slope (parameter d) of GRB light curves to distinguish between the BZ and NDAF mechanisms, thereby linking the light-curve morphology to the central engine physics. By analysing 85 single-peaked GRBs with fast-rise, exponential-decay (FRED) profiles observed by Swift/BAT using 64 ms background-subtracted light curves, we fit the decay slope (parameter d) with the empirical Kocevski-Ryde-Liang (KRL) function and compare the results with theoretical predictions for the BZ (d approximately 1.67) and the NDAF (d approximately 3.7 to 7.8) mechanisms. We find that the decay slope (parameter d) can differentiate central engine mechanisms, with 15 GRBs consistent with the BZ mechanism and 22 supporting the NDAF mechanism. However, most events exhibit slopes within the range between 2 and 4, suggesting a hybrid of mechanisms, with NDAF being dominant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Particle acceleration signatures in the time-dependent one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model of blazar flares</a><span class="id">[2602.05601]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The study of multiwavelength flux and spectral variations during rapid flares from blazars provides strong constraints on the physical parameters of the compact emission regions responsible for these still poorly understood events. Although a full description of the continuous and transient emission from blazars seems to require more sophisticated scenarios, particle acceleration and loss mechanisms can be approximately described within the simple leptonic one-zone framework, enabling a systematic study of their impact on the observable properties of multiwavelength flare light curves. Our goal is to identify characteristic signatures in these light curve profiles that permit one to discriminate between the main physical processes situated inside the relativistic jet and commonly invoked to explain blazar flares. The present study exclusively focuses on modeling rapid flares from BL Lac type objects, which can be described within the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission scenario. Combinations of several commonly employed mechanisms to describe the gain and loss of energetic particles in onezone models during flaring events are studied in a systematic way: particle injection; diffusive shock and stochastic acceleration and reacceleration; particle escape; adiabatic losses; radiative losses through synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation. The current study is limited to the case of &quot;hard-sphere&quot; scattering. A large variety of light curve shapes arises from the different scenarios under study. Characteristic signatures, in particular energy-dependent time delays and differences in the shapes of the rising part of the flare, should allow the distinction to be made between different injection and acceleration scenarios, given the availability of sufficiently high-quality multiwavelength data sets. This is illustrated with a simplified application to a flare event from the blazar Mrk 421.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05645" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coalescence Forensics: Weighing the Hosts of Hierarchical Binary Black Hole Mergers</a><span class="id">[2602.05645]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel framework to infer the mass of clusters that host hierarchical binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected with gravitational-waves (GWs), on a single event basis.

Using a Plummer model as a readily interpretable baseline, we derive analytic scaling relations between the peak of the inferred host mass posterior, the GW-driven recoil velocity of the remnant, and the parameters that determine the structure of the host. We then perform exact numerical marginalization over thermal and recoil velocities, angles, and cluster structure parameters, to infer the host-mass posterior. We apply our framework to putative hierarchical mergers GW241011 and GW241110, and infer the masses of their hosts on a single-event basis.

In this work, we demonstrate that this relation can be generalized to arbitrary luminosity distributions and spectral profiles. We derive the corresponding expression for the effective spectral index and apply it to a sample of quasars observed in the W1 band of the CatWISE survey.

In this case, the geometric properties of the metric and their dynamical consequences for particle trajectories are systematically studied, with a specific focus on circular orbits together with their existence criteria and stability constraints. Also, the effective potential and the corresponding effective force are constructed to quantify the influence of rotation and embedding parameters on the attractive and repulsive sectors of the gravitational interaction. Closed-form expressions for orbital frequencies as measured by a distant observer are derived, enabling a quantitative analysis of relativistic precession phenomena, including periastron advance and Lense-Thirring precession. Furthermore, we conduct general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of BHL accretion onto rotating embedded BHs. In addition, within the framework of the BHL accretion mechanism, the numerical solution of the GRH equations shows that the embedding parameter \alpha systematically modifies the morphology of the shock cone formed around embedded BHs compared to the Kerr model. In particular, a wider opening angle of the cone is produced, the compression of matter in the post-shock region is weakened, and the dynamical variability of the flow is enhanced. The time-dependent mass accretion rate exhibits increasing oscillation amplitudes and long-term variations with increasing \alpha, while these amplitudes are found to be suppressed by the frame-dragging effect associated with the BH spin parameter. At the same time, increasing values of $\alpha$ lead to a strengthening of the QPO frequencies formed around embedded BHs in the LFQPO regime, enhancing their observability and increasing the likelihood of detecting commensurate frequency ratios such as 3:2.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05820" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photometric variability of nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars in Magellanic Clouds with OGLE</a><span class="id">[2602.05820]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of the photometric variability of (presumably single) nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet (WN) stars in the Magellanic Clouds, using long-term observations from the OGLE survey.

To validate our findings, we also compare the OGLE light curves with data from the MACHO and TESS missions. Variability is ubiquitous in our WR sample: about one third of stars display high variability, or four fifths if we include cases with moderate variations. The observed changes are found to be periodic in 11 cases, with timescales of 2-56 d. Such periodic variations originate in corotating wind structures, binary effects, or pulsations, thereby increasing the number of systems known to show these phenomena. Surprisingly, nine targets display (quasi-periodic) outbursts, making such changes a new type of WR variability. The variability shows a transient character, in about 30$\%$ of the sample, with changing amplitudes for periodic signals or for outbursts (they even sometimes completely disappear from view).

We use a point-lens finite-source model for the microlensing light curve model and employ multi-stage selection procedures to identify microlensing candidates. From more than 25,000 variable candidates detected across all nights, we identify 12 microlensing candidates with light-curve timescales shorter than 5 hours, and among them, 4 secure candidates with high-significance detections. We estimate detection efficiencies using light-curve-level simulations that account for observational conditions and finite-source effects. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework that combines the light-curve fitting information for each candidate with the Poisson statistics of the number of candidates, we derive constraints on parameters that characterize the abundance and mass scale of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter. First, we derive upper limits on the PBH abundance under the null hypothesis that all events are assumed to be false detections. Next, employing the PBH hypothesis in which all (or only secure) candidates are assumed to be due to PBH microlensing, we derive the allowed region of the PBH parameters; the inferred mass scale is $M_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{-7}$–$10^{-6}M_\odot$, and the PBH abundance to the total dark matter is $f_{\rm PBH}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-2}{\rm -}10^{-1})$.

Capturing these interactions is key to understanding the chemical evolution and present-day diversity of sub-Neptunes, super-Earths, and terrestrial planets, particularly in light of new JWST observations and upcoming missions. Recent advances in both geochemistry and astrophysics now allow the integration of experimental constraints and thermodynamic models across melt, metal, and gas phases. Here we extend a global chemical equilibrium model to include non-ideal behavior in all three phases. Our framework combines fugacity corrections for gas species with activity coefficients for silicate and metal species, enabling a fully coupled description of volatile partitioning. We show that for planetary embryos (0.5 M$_\oplus$ at 2350 K), non-ideality introduces only modest corrections to atmosphere-magma ocean interface (AMOI) pressures, volatile inventories, and interior compositions. In contrast, for sub-Neptunes with higher temperatures ($\approx$ 3000 K) and pressures, non-ideal effects are more pronounced, though still modest in absolute terms$-$typically within 20% and at most a factor of two. Including activity and fugacity coefficients simultaneously increases the AMOI pressure, enhances water retention in the mantle and the envelope. Our results demonstrate that non-ideality must be treated globally: applying corrections to only one phase leads to incomplete or even misleading trends. These findings highlight the importance of self-consistent global thermodynamic treatments for interpreting atmospheric spectra and interior structures of sub-Neptunes and super-Earths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long-term timing of the relativistic binary PSR J1906+0746</a><span class="id">[2602.05947]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We conducted a timing analysis of over 18 years of data on the young ($\tau_{\rm c} = 112$ kyr, $P = 114$ ms) relativistic binary PSR J1906+0746, using six radio telescopes: Arecibo, FAST, Green Bank, Lovell, MeerKAT, and Nançay.

Finally, we estimate the impact of a coupling of the type $y\phi\sigma^2$ to the inflaton, in the realization of perturbative reheating, directly impacting the predictions of the model, as lower values of $M$ are consistent with both the entire allowed temperature range, and the limits imposed by BICEP/Keck Array+Planck+ACT.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13550" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relic of quadrupole deformation produced in a hot neutron star era</a><span class="id">[2601.13550]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A newly born neutron star is expected to exhibit significant deviations from spherical symmetry, which decay with time. Determining how much deformation remains at present is crucial for gravitational-wave astronomy. This study is the first investigation into the evolution of quadrupole deformation during the solid crust formation phase to obtain a plausible value at present. The equilibrium structure before solidification is modeled using a fluid description, and the deformation is introduced through an assumed driving force. As the star cools, this force weakens, leading to a gradual decay of the deformation. Eventually, the deformation vanishes in the fluid region but partially remains in the crust, sustained by elastic forces, after solidification. By comparing the equilibrium models before and after solidification, we estimate the residual ellipticity and demonstrate that the spatial profile of the elastic shear is imprinted in the crust. The relic ellipticity is only a few percent of the original value, with its absolute magnitude depending on the deformation mechanism during the hot era, which cannot be specified owing to the lack of elaborate models. This work provides a first step toward linking early neutron star deformation with future gravitational-wave observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04951" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact on Inferred Neutron Star Equation of State due to Nonlinear Hydrodynamics, Background Spin, and Relativity</a><span class="id">[2602.04951]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal interaction is a unique, detectable signature in gravitational wave signals from inspiraling binary neutron stars (BNSs), which can be used to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS). The tidal interaction is resonantly amplified as the orbital frequency approaches the NS fundamental mode (f-mode) frequency. It has been shown that the exclusion of tidal resonance in parameter estimation leads to a significant bias in the inferred NS tidal deformability and hence the NS EoS [Pratten et al. PRL 129, 081102 (2022)]. The strength and location of tidal resonance depend sensitively on the f-mode frequency, which is typically modeled using its universal relation with the tidal deformability that is derived for an isolated, non-spinning NS assuming only linear fluid perturbations. In a BNS inspiral, the f-mode frequency can be corrected by at least three known effects: nonlinear hydrodynamics, background spin, and relativity. We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the systematic bias on tidal deformability when each frequency correction is ignored. Our study considers both loud, individual events and the stacking of a population of detections. Both scenarios are expected when the next-generation detectors are available with a sensitivity level increased by about an order of magnitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suppression of Gravitational-Wave Echoes in Diffeomorphism-Invariant Nonlocal Gravity</a><span class="id">[2602.04996]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Searches for late–time gravitational–wave echoes following compact binary mergers are often interpreted as probes of exotic near–horizon or horizonless physics. We show that a well–motivated class of ultraviolet–finite quantum gravity and modified gravity theories, those based on diffeomorphism–invariant, analytic, entire–function nonlocality, generically suppress observable echo signals. The suppression follows from Paley–Wiener bounds associated with the analyticity of the nonlocal regulator, which enforce exponential damping of high–frequency reflection amplitudes and smear sharp effective potentials in the black–hole interior. We demonstrate that for regular black holes with horizons, the standard ingoing boundary condition eliminates the cavity required for echoes, while for regular horizonless compact objects the nonlocal kernel strongly attenuates both inner and photon–sphere reflections. As a result, repeated reflections during the ringdown phase are exponentially suppressed in frequency space and washed out in the time domain. Our results imply that the absence of echoes in current gravitational–wave data is consistent with covariant nonlocal gravity theories and does not, by itself, favor classical horizons over regular or horizonless ultraviolet completions. The analyticity and Paley–Wiener bounds that enforce echo suppression are required to ensure unitarity, ghost freedom, and ultraviolet finiteness of the underlying quantum theory. As a result, the classical ringdown phenomenology already encodes quantum–gravity consistency conditions. We emphasize that the absence of echoes in such theories does not rely on quantum decoherence or stochastic effects, but instead reflects the analytic structure imposed by quantum gravity on the classical limit.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05501" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulating first-order phase transition during inflation</a><span class="id">[2602.05501]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ending the inflation by vacuum decay is considered infeasible due to the graceful exit problem. Even if considering an alternative field other than the inflaton to realize a first-order phase transition (FoPT) during inflation, it is usually challenging for concrete model building, as bubble nucleations might not be fast and dense enough to successfully end the inflation. In this work, we propose a FoPT at the grand-unification-theory (GUT) scale within the Starobinsky inflation. The key construction is an exponentially evolving potential barrier dynamically controlled by the rolling inflaton, so that almost no bubble is nucleated during the early inflationary era, but with massive bubble nucleations near the end of inflation. With lattice numerical simulations, we have successfully tested this GUT-FoPT during Starobinsky inflation, and the resulting gravitational-wave energy density spectrum reproduces previous analytical estimation with a distinctive oscillation feature at high frequencies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05623" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Induced-Gravity Higgs Inflation in Palatini Supergravity Confronts ACT DR6</a><span class="id">[2602.05623]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We formulate within Palatini Supergravity a model of induced-gravity inflation excellently consistent with ACT DR6. The inflaton belongs in the decomposition of a conjugate pair of Higgs superfields which lead to the spontaneous breaking of a U(1)B-L symmetry at a scale close to the range (0.102-5.85)x10^16 GeV. The inflaton field is canonically normalized thanks to a real and shift-symmetric contribution into the Kaehler potential. It also includes two separate holomorphic and antiholomorphic logarithmic terms, the argument of which can be interpreted as the coupling of the inflaton to the Ricci scalar. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and energy scales below the cut-off scale of the corresponding effective theory. Embedding the model in a B-L extension of the MSSM we show how the mu parameter can be generated and non-thermal leptogenesis can be successfully realized. An outcome of our scheme is split SUSY with gravitino mass in the range (40-60) PeV, which is consistent with the results of LHC on the Higgs boson mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the stability of viscous Riemann ellipsoids</a><span class="id">[2602.05658]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The present study investigates the linear stability of Riemann ellipsoids in both the inviscid limit and in the presence of weak viscosity.

Varying $m_e$ shifts the decoupling epoch and the entropy transfer from $e^\pm$ annihilation, thereby modifying the neutrino energy density and the inferred effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$. Independently, during BBN the rates of charged-current weak processes, and hence the neutron-to-proton ratio, depend on $m_e$. By confronting BBN predictions for the primordial light-element abundances with observations and imposing cosmological constraints on $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, we obtain a bound on $m_e$ in the early Universe of $m_e = 0.504^{+0.007}_{-0.006}$ MeV or $m_e=0.510\pm0.007$ MeV ($1\sigma$), depending on the considered nuclear reaction network (NACRE II or PRIMAT, respectively).

These are discrete finite-difference response functions – local slopes of the strong-interaction energy landscape – not equilibrium grand-canonical chemical potentials. The nuclear chart itself supplies an &quot;ensemble of nearby droplets&quot;: finite differences across neighboring nuclei suppress shell- and pairing-scale oscillations while retaining the smooth bulk trend, producing robust slopes without a macroscopic limit.

To incorporate the effects of this interaction in cosmological analysis, we develop a parameterization for the growth rate based on a second-order approximation for the growth index $\gamma$ that explicitly includes the coupling constant $\alpha$. This formalism reveals a theoretical degeneracy: the coupling induces a correction $\Delta\gamma \simeq 1.1\alpha$, allowing an interacting dark energy model to mimic the growth index predicted by certain modified gravity theories. We confront the model with the latest multi-probe observations, including the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the second data release (DR2) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements, Hubble parameter $H(z)$ data, and redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements, to simultaneously constrain the coupling strength $\alpha$ and the dark energy equation of state $w$. Our analysis finds $\alpha$ consistent with zero and $w$ with $-1$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, showing no statistical evidence for a departure from the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The observational constraints effectively break the theoretical degeneracy with modified gravity, limiting the possible interaction-induced shift in the growth index to $|\Delta\gamma|\lesssim 0.03$ ($3\sigma$). This establishes the growth index as a robust diagnostic for distinguishing between a non-minimal interaction in the dark sector and a genuine modification of gravity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15393" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital eccentricity in a neutron star - black hole binary merger</a><span class="id">[2503.15393]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The observation of gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars provides a unique opportunity to discern information about their astrophysical environment. Two signatures that are considered powerful tracers to distinguish between different binary formation channels are general-relativistic spin-induced orbital precession and orbital eccentricity. Both effects leave characteristic imprints in the gravitational-wave signal that can be extracted from observations. To date, neither precession nor eccentricity have been confidently discerned in merging neutron star – black hole binaries. Here we report the measurement of orbital eccentricity in a neutron star – black hole merger. Using, for the first time, a waveform model that incorporates precession and eccentricity, we perform Bayesian inference on the gravitational-wave event GW200105 (R. Abbott et al. 2021a) and infer a median orbital eccentricity of $e_{20}\sim 0.145$ at an orbital period of 0.1s, ruling out eccentricities smaller than 0.028 with 99.5% confidence. We find inconclusive evidence for the presence of precession, consistent with previous, non-eccentric results, but a more unequal mass ratio. Our result implies a fraction of these binaries will exhibit orbital eccentricity even at small separations, suggesting formation through mechanisms involving dynamical interactions beyond isolated binary evolution. Future observations will reveal the contribution of eccentric neutron star – black hole binaries to the total merger rate across cosmic time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00623" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spins of Black Holes in X-ray Binaries and the Tension with the Gravitational Wave Measurements</a><span class="id">[2506.00623]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We review current challenges in understanding the values and origin of the spins of black holes in binaries. Thanks to recent advances in astrophysical instrumentation, the spins can now be measured using both gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes and electromagnetic radiation from accreting X-ray binaries containing black holes. A key finding of the gravitational-wave observatories is that premerger black holes in binaries have low spin values, with an average dimensionless spin parameter of $a_*\sim$0.1–0.2, with 90\% having $a_*\lesssim 0.6$. This implies that the natal spins of black holes are generally low, and the angular momentum transport in massive stars is efficient. On the other hand, most of the published spins in X-ray binaries are very high. In particular, this is the case for binaries with high-mass donors (potential progenitors of mergers), where their published spins range from 0.8 to 1.0. At the same time, their short lifetimes prevent significant spin-up by accretion. Those with low-mass donors could be spun-up to $a_*\gtrsim 0.7$ by accretion only if the donor initial masses were more than several solar masses, which remains unproven. However, the existing methods of spin measurements suffer from significant systematic errors. The method relying on relativistic X-ray line broadening is based on the separation of the observed spectra into incident and reflected ones, which is highly uncertain. The method relying on spectral fitting of accretion disk continua uses models that predict the disk to be highly unstable, while stability is observed. Improved stable models predict lower spins. The published spin measurements in X-ray binaries are uncertain. The spins of the binaries with high-mass donors may be low, while those with low-mass donors have a broader spin distribution, ranging from low to high.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital Eccentricity and Spin-Orbit Misalignment Are Evidence that Neutron Star-Black Hole Mergers Form through Triple Star Evolution</a><span class="id">[2506.09121]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There is growing evidence that a substantial fraction of the neutron star-black holes (NSBHs) detected through gravitational waves merge with non-zero eccentricity or large BH spin-orbit misalignment. This is in tension with the leading formation scenarios to date. Residual eccentricity rules out formation through isolated binary star evolution, while NS natal kicks and the unequal masses of NSBHs inhibit efficient pairing in dense stellar environments. Here, we report that all observed properties-NSBH merger rate, eccentricity, and spin-orbit misalignment-are explained by the high prevalence of massive stellar triples in the field. Modelling their evolution from the ZAMS, we investigate NSBH mergers caused by gravitational perturbations from a tertiary companion. We show that the formation of the NS decisively impacts the triple stability, preferentially leaving behind surviving NSBHs in compact triple architectures. The rich three-body dynamics of compact, unequal-mass triples enables mergers across a wide range of orbital parameters without requiring fine-tuned highly inclined tertiary orbits and provides a natural explanation for an abundance of residual eccentricity and spin-orbit misalignment. We infer a total NSBH merger rate of $R\sim1-23\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$, with more than a few 10% exhibiting eccentricity $e_{20}&gt;0.1$ or large spin-orbit misalignment $\cos\theta_{\rm BH}&lt;0$, consistent with current observations. Tertiary-driven NSBH mergers closely track the cosmic star formation rate due to their short delay times, include a substantial fraction of burst-like highly eccentric systems ($e_{20} &gt; 0.9$), and almost universally retain eccentricities $e_{20}&gt;10^{-3}$, potentially detectable by next-generation detectors. If evidence for eccentric and misaligned events solidifies, our results suggest that triple dynamics is the dominant formation channel of NSBH mergers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stabilizing simulation-based cosmological Fisher forecasts: a case study using the Voronoi volume function</a><span class="id">[2506.16408]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Forecasting cosmological constraints from halo-based statistics often suffers from instability in derivative estimates, especially when the number of simulations is limited.

Since phantom dark energy in general relativity is unphysical, we investigate the possibility that the phantom behaviour is not intrinsic, but effective – due to a non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and non-phantom dark energy. To this end, we assume a physically motivated thawing quintessence-like form of the intrinsic dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$. Then we use a $w_0, w_a$ model for the \emph{effective} equation of state of dark energy. We find that the data favours a phantom crossing for the effective dark energy, but only at low significance. The intrinsic equation of state of dark energy is non-phantom, without imposing any non-phantom priors. A nonzero interaction is favoured at more than $3\sigma$ at $z\sim0.3$.

Therefore, these astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy electron–positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron–positron annihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the resonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of the FSRQ 3C 279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the cosmological population of FSRQs. We incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function and its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across cosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a pronounced peak at redshift $z \sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well below the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as IceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the flux from $Z$ boson production within the jet blob is many orders of magnitude smaller than the total diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of Standard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments, highlighting the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, and illustrating that even extremely rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle, theoretically meaningful imprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrino background.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Wave Spectral Shapes as a probe of Long Lived Right-handed Neutrinos, Leptogenesis and Dark Matter: Global versus Local B-L Cosmic Strings</a><span class="id">[2511.01779]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The scale of the seesaw mechanism is typically much larger than the electroweak scale. This hierarchy can be naturally explained by $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, which after spontaneous symmetry breaking, simultaneously generates Majorana masses for neutrinos and produces a network of cosmic strings. Such strings generate a gravitational wave (GW) spectrum which is expected to be almost uniform in frequency unless there is a departure from the usual early radiation domination. We explore this possibility in Type I, II and III seesaw frameworks, finding that only for Type-I, long-lived right-handed neutrinos (RHN) may provide a period of early matter domination for parts of the parameter space, even if they are thermally produced. Such a period leaves distinctive imprints in the GW spectrum in the form of characteristic breaks and a knee feature, arising due to the end and start of the periods of RHN domination. These features, if detected, directly determine the mass $M$, and effective neutrino mass $\tilde m$ of the dominating RHN. We find that GW detectors like LISA and ET could probe RHN masses in the range $M\in[0.1,10^{9}]$ GeV and effective neutrino masses in the $\tilde m\in[10^{-10},10^{-8}]$ eV range. We investigate the phenomenological implications of long-lived right-handed neutrinos for both local and global $U(1)_{B-L}$ strings, focusing on dark matter production and leptogenesis. We map the viable and detectable parameter space for successful baryogenesis and asymmetric dark matter production from right-handed neutrino decays. We derive analytical and semi-analytical relations correlating the characteristic gravitational-wave frequencies to the neutrino parameters $\tilde m$ and $M$, as well as to the relic abundances of dark matter and baryons.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interacting binaries on the Main Sequence as in-situ tracers of mass transfer efficiency and stability</a><span class="id">[2511.15347]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the transfer of mass and angular momentum in binary interactions is crucial for modelling the evolution of any interacting binary after the first mass transfer phase. Mass transfer physics assumptions shape the predictions for later stages of binary evolution, such as the immediate progenitors of stripped-envelope supernovae and gravitational wave mergers. We constrain the efficiency and stability of thermal timescale mass transfer in massive binary evolution using the observed population of 62 massive interacting binaries on the Main Sequence (`Algols') in the Milky Way, Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. We find that purely conservative or non-conservative mass transfer cannot explain the current mass ratio and orbital period of all massive Algols. Angular momentum conservation rules out conservative mass transfer in $\sim$28 \% of massive Algols in the SMC. About three-quarters of all massive Algols are consistent with having undergone inefficient mass transfer ($\lesssim$ 50 \%), while the remaining systems, mostly residing in the LMC and Milky Way, require mass transfer to have been more efficient than 25\%. For our fiducial assumption on the extent of envelope stripping, the current sample of massive Algols does not require mass transfer to be efficient at the shortest orbital periods ($\sim$2 d) at any metallicity. We find evidence that mass transfer on the Main Sequence needs to be stable for initial accretor-to-donor mass ratios as unequal as $\sim 0.6$.

Specifically, we measure the conditional average density, defined as the average density of galaxies observed around a typical galaxy in the sample. To minimize boundary effects, we adopt a conservative criterion: only galaxies for which a spherical volume of radius $r$, centered on them, is fully contained within the survey footprint are included in the computation. For the BGS, we construct four volume-limited subsamples in order to eliminate biases arising from luminosity-dependent selection effects. By contrast, the LRGS is approximately volume-limited by design. The resulting samples span different depths, providing an opportunity to test the stability of statistical measurements across survey volumes of increasing size. Our results show that the conditional average density follows a power-law decay, $\langle n(r) \rangle \propto r^{-0.8}$, without exhibiting any transition to homogeneity within the survey volume. The large statistics of the DESI samples also allow us to demonstrate that finite-size effects become significant as $r$ approaches the boundaries of the sample volumes. Consistently, we find that the distribution of density fluctuations follows a Gumbel distribution - characteristic of extreme-value statistics - rather than a Gaussian distribution, which would be expected for a spatially homogeneous field. These findings confirm and extend the trends previously observed in smaller redshift surveys, supporting the conclusion that the galaxy distribution does not undergo a transition to spatial homogeneity within the probed scales, up to $r \sim 400$ \text{Mpc}/$h$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The spectrum of $n_s$ constraints from DESI and CMB data</a><span class="id">[2512.05108]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the spectrum of $n_s$ constraints from current CMB data (Planck, ACT, SPT-3G) combined with DESI BAO data, and highlight the interplay of $n_s$ with the optical depth to reionization $\tau$. The spectral index $n_s$ of the primordial power spectrum provides a window into early universe, and constraints on $n_s$ play an important role in discriminating early universe models such as models of cosmic inflation. Historically constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, the constraints on $n_s$ shift upward when CMB data is combined with the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Recent work explained the origin of this and the relation to the BAO-CMB tension between CMB experiments and DESI BAO, and as a case study presented constraints on $n_s$ from the combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data and DESI DR2 data. Here we present constraints from Planck (PR3 and PR4), ACT, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the combination of all three CMB experiments, CMB-SPA, with and without DESI DR2 BAO data, and with and without CMB lensing data. In all cases the constraint on $n_s$ is shifted upwards when DESI is included, with the largest shift exhibited by ACT. This is accompanied by a commensurate shift in the constraint on the optical depth to reionization $\tau$, which is again greatest for ACT. When CMB data are combined into CMB-SPA and combined with DESI the $n_s$ constraint disfavors at more than $2\sigma$ the inflation models preferred by Planck alone, such as Higgs, Starobinsky, and exponential $\alpha$-attractors, in favor of other models, such as polynomial $\alpha$-attractors. This work motivates the further study of the tension between CMB and DESI BAO data, and of the rich interplay between $n_s$ and $\tau$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distinct Rotational Evolution of Giant Planets and Brown Dwarf Companions</a><span class="id">[2601.05976]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a rotational velocity (vsini) survey of 32 stellar/substellar objects and giant planets using Keck/KPIC high-resolution spectroscopy, including 6 giant planets (2-7 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) and 25 substellar/stellar companions (12-88 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$). Adding companions with spin measurements from the literature, we construct a curated spin sample for 43 benchmark stellar/substellar companions and giant planets and 54 free-floating brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects. We compare their spins, parameterized as fractional breakup velocities at 10 Myr, assuming constant angular momentum evolution. We find the first clear evidence that giant planets exhibit distinct spins versus low-mass brown dwarf companions (10 to 40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) at 4-4.5 $\sigma$ significance assuming inclinations aligned with their orbits, while under randomly oriented inclinations the significance is at 1.6-2.1 $\sigma$. Our findings hold when considering various assumptions about planets, and the mass ratio below 0.8% gives a clean cut for rotation between giant planets and brown dwarf companions. The higher fractional breakup velocities of planets can be interpreted as less angular momentum loss through circumplanetary disk braking during the planet formation phase. Brown dwarf companions exhibit evidence of slower rotation compared to isolated brown dwarfs, while planets and planetary mass objects show similar spins. Finally, our analysis of specific angular momentum versus age of 221 stellar/substellar objects below 0.1 M$_{\odot}$ with spin measurements in the literature indicates that the substellar objects of 5-40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ retain much higher angular momenta compared to stellar and substellar objects of 40-100 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ after 10 Myr, when their initial angular momenta were set.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Magnetoacoustic Wave Behavior within Gravitationally Stratified, Magnetically Inhomogeneous Media</a><span class="id">[2601.16920]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nature of MHD waves within inhomogeneous media is fundamental to understanding and interpreting wave behavior in the solar atmosphere. We investigate fast magnetoacoustic wave behavior within gravitationally stratified, magnetically inhomogeneous media, by studying a magnetic environment containing a simple 2D X-type magnetic null point. The addition of gravitational stratification fundamentally changes the nature of the system, including breaking the symmetry. There are two main governing effects: the stratified density profile acts in combination with the inhomogeneous magnetic field, creating a large gradient in the Alfven speed and hence a system replete with refraction. The system is investigated using both numerical simulations and a semianalytical WKB solution (via Charpit's method and a fourth-order Runge-Kutta solver) and we find strong agreement between both. The results show a fundamental difference between the stratification-free and stratified cases, including the formation of caustic surfaces and cusps, and we contextualize these results in the theoretical understanding of fast magnetoacoustic waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An emulator for the ionizing photon mean free path in ultra-high resolution simulations: the implications of mean free path measurements for the reionization history</a><span class="id">[2602.03923]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Measurements of the mean free path of ionizing photons from high-redshift quasar spectra at $z \sim 5$-$6$ constrain the reionization history, but interpreting them requires modeling the kiloparsec-scale clumping that large-volume reionization simulations cannot resolve. We present a deep learning emulator for the mean free path (MFP) trained on high-resolution cosmological radiative transfer simulations of ionization fronts sweeping through small 2 comoving Mpc/h volumes. Using a residual multi-layer perceptron neural network, we predict the MFP at a given redshift as a function of the reionization redshift, photoionization rate, wavelength, and box-scale density, achieving a median relative error of 1.6\% across nearly four orders of magnitude in MFP. Integrating its predictions over box-scale overdensity and an extended reionization history allows the emulator to predict the global MFP. We apply the emulator to extended reionization histories constrained by observed photoionization rates, finding that models prefer late reionization with substantial neutral fractions persisting at $z \lesssim 6$. Fitting a parametric ionization history yields a midpoint of reionization of $z_{\rm re} = 6.8\pm 1.2$ for reionization durations consistent with Planck and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich constraints, and the universe being $10\%$ neutral still at $z_{\rm re} &lt; 5.8 ~(6.3)$ at 1 (2)$\sigma$. Global ionizing emissivity inferences using measurements of the photoionization rate and MFP plus our emulator, which avoids common power-law assumptions, suggest a factor of $2-3$ decline between $z = 6$ and $4.8$, in agreement with previous studies. Our method provides an efficient (and more converged) alternative to large-volume radiative-hydrodynamic simulations of reionization for interpreting MFP measurements, and can also serve as a subgrid prescription for the ionizing opacity within such simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Waves from Feebly Interacting Particles in a First Order Phase Transition</a><span class="id">[2211.06405]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>First order phase transitions are well-motivated and extensively studied sources of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. The vacuum energy released during such transitions is assumed to be transferred primarily either to the expanding bubble walls, whose collisions source GWs, or to the surrounding plasma, producing sound waves and turbulence, which source GWs. In this Letter, we study an alternative possibility that has not yet been considered: the released energy gets transferred primarily to feebly interacting particles that do not form a coherent interacting plasma but simply free-stream individually. We develop the formalism to study the production of GWs from such configurations, and demonstrate that such GW signals have qualitatively distinct characteristics compared to conventional sources and are potentially observable with near-future GW detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twisted magnetar magnetospheres: a class of semi-analytical force-free non-rotating solutions</a><span class="id">[2504.00680]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetospheric twists, that is magnetospheres with a toroidal component, are under scrutiny due to the key role the twist is believed to play in the behaviour of neutron stars. Notably, its dissipation is believed to power magnetar activity, and is an important element of the evolution of these stars. We exhibit a new class of twisted axi-symmetric force-free magnetospheric solutions. We solve the Grad-Shafranov equation by introducing an ansatz akin to a multipolar expansion. We obtain a hierarchical system of ordinary differential equations where lower-order multipoles source the higher-order ones. We show that analytical approximations can be obtained, and that in general solutions can be numerically computed using standard ODE solvers. We obtain a class of solutions with a great flexibility in initial conditions, and show that a subset of these asymptotically tend to vacuum. The twist is not confined to a subset of field lines. The solutions are symmetric about the equator, with a toroidal component that can be reversed. This symmetry is supported by an equatorial current sheet. We provide a first-order approximation of a particular solution that consists in the superposition of a vacuum dipole and a toroidal magnetic field sourced by the dipole, where the toroidal component decays as $1/r^4$. As an example of strongly multipolar solution, we also exhibit cases with an additional octupole component.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21034" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark-Matter-Enhanced Probe of Relic Neutrino Clustering</a><span class="id">[2508.21034]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose heavy decaying dark matter (DM) as a new probe of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). Heavy DM, with mass $\gtrsim 10^9$ GeV, decaying into neutrinos can be a new source of ultrahigh-energy (UHE) neutrinos. Including this contribution along with the measured astrophysical and predicted cosmogenic neutrino fluxes, we study the scattering of UHE neutrinos with the C$\nu$B via standard weak interactions mediated by the $Z$ boson. We solve the complete neutrino transport equation, taking into account both absorption and reinjection effects, to calculate the expected spectrum of UHE neutrino flux at future neutrino telescopes, such as the IceCube-Gen2 radio. We argue that such observations can be used to probe the C$\nu$B properties and, in particular, local C$\nu$B clustering. We find that, depending on the absolute neutrino mass and the DM mass and lifetime, a local C$\nu$B overdensity $\gtrsim 10^6$ can be probed at the IceCube-Gen2 radio within ten years of data taking.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gauge Dependence of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature Perturbations: Analytical Results</a><span class="id">[2510.07252]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analytically study the gauge dependence of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) sourced by primordial isocurvature perturbations during radiation domination (RD), working across nine gauges. Through analytical integrations of the kernels supported by graphical comparison we identify a clear dichotomy. We find that in some gauges viz. the uniform-density (UD), total-matter (TM), uniform-curvature (UC), comoving-orthogonal (CO) and transverse-traceless (TT) gauges the energy density grows polynomially in conformal time $\eta^n$, where $n$ varies from $2$ to $8$. While in rest of the gauges viz. the longitudinal (Long.), uniform-expansion (UE), Newtonian-motion (Nm), and N-body (Nb) gauges the late-time energy spectrum converges, and SIGWs behave as radiation. For subhorizon modes ($ k\eta \gg 1 $), the divergence becomes severe, showing that SIGWs are gauge-dependent observables in this regime. We resolve it through a kernel projection that isolates the luminal, freely propagating gravitational wave components (oscillating as $\sin(k\eta)$ and $\cos(k\eta)$), eliminating spurious contributions. The resulting kernel decays as $ (k\eta)^{-1} $ and yields a finite, gauge-independent late-time spectrum, confirming that only luminal modes represent physical SIGWs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16487" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WIMP Freeze-out dynamics under Tsallis statistics</a><span class="id">[2511.16487]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We generalize thermal WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) freeze-out within Tsallis nonextensive statistics. Using Curado-Tsallis $q$-distributions $f_q(E;\mu,T)$ we compute $q$-deformed number and energy densities, pressure, entropy density and Hubble rate, $\{n_q,\rho_q,P_q,s_q,H_q\}$. The Boltzmann equation is generalized accordingly to obtain the comoving abundance $Y_{\chi,q}(x)$ and relic density $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$ for a dark-matter candidate $\chi$ in a model-independent setup. The thermally averaged cross section is expanded as $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q \approx a + b\,\langle v_{\rm rel}^2\rangle_q$ up to $p$-wave. The freeze-out parameter $x_f(q)$ is determined from $\Gamma_{{\rm ann},q}(T_f)\simeq H_q(T_f)$ using a $q$-logarithmic inversion, with the expansion rate modified through ultra-relativistic rescalings $R_\rho(q)$ of the effective relativistic degrees of freedom $g_*$ and $g_{*s}$. We show that $x_f$ increases with $q$ and that QCD-threshold features propagate into $Y_{\chi,q}(x)$ and $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$. We then perform two $q$-grid scans: fixing $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q$ while varying the dark-matter mass $m_\chi$, and fixing $m_\chi$ while varying the $s$-wave coefficient $a$. For an $s$-wave dominated scenario we construct $\chi^2$ profiles in these planes by comparing $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$ with the Planck benchmark $\Omega_c h^2 = 0.120\pm 0.001$. In both cases we find a clear degeneracy in the preferred nonextensive parameter $q_{\rm best}$ along valleys in parameter space. However, fixed-mass scans (varying $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q$) are significantly more constraining than fixed-cross-section scans, reflecting that $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$ is mainly controlled by $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q$, so that for realistic cross sections the best-fit $q_{\rm best}$ remains close to the extensive limit $q\to 1$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22465" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Misalignment dynamics of Scalar Condensates with Yukawa coupling: Particle and Entropy Production</a><span class="id">[2511.22465]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Misalignment dynamics, the non-equilibrium evolution of a scalar (or pseudoscalar) condensate in a potential landscape, broadly describes a solution to the strong CP problem, a mechanism for cold dark matter production and (pre) reheating post inflation. Often, radiative corrections are included phenomenologically by replacing the potential by the effective potential which is a \emph{static quantity}, its usefulness is restricted to (near) equilibrium situations. We study the misalignment dynamics of a scalar condensate Yukawa coupled to $N_f$ fermions in a manifestly energy conserving, fully renormalized Hamiltonian framework. A large $N_f$ limit allows us to focus on the fermion degrees of freedom, which yield a negative contribution to the effective potential, a radiatively induced instability and ultraviolet divergent field renormalization. We introduce an adiabatic basis and an adiabatic expansion that embodies the derivative expansion in the effective action, the zeroth order is identified with the effective potential, higher orders account for the derivative expansion including field renormalization and describe profuse particle production. Energy conserving dynamics leads to the conjecture of emergent asymptotic highly excited stationary states with a distribution function $n_k(\infty)\propto 1/k^6$ and an extensive entropy which is identified with an entanglement entropy. Subtle aspects of renormalization associated with the initial value problem are analyzed and resolved. Possible new manifestations of asymptotic spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) as a consequence of the dynamics even in absence of tree level (SSB), and cosmological inferences are discussed.</p></div></details></article></body>
