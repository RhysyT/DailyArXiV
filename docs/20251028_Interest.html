<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Krisenmanagement in Kerntechnischen Notfällen - Eine Evaluaierung Am Beispiel der Nuklearkatastrophe von Fukushima</a><span class="id">[2510.22666]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The objective of this pre-scientific paper is to analyze the crisis management during the Fukushima nuclear accident in the year of 2011 and to derive lessons for a safer operation of reactors along with a more resilient crisis management framework. In addition to official reports and subject literature, the conducted methods included interviews with an IAEA safeguard and a political scientist. The central findings were that the accident pointed out deficiencies regarding the independence of the regulatory body and that mismanagement of the available technical resources in conjunction with insufficient communication led to evitable evacuations.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22552" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UC2-ESP: A General-Purpose Framework for Open-Source Microscopy Control</a><span class="id">[2510.22552]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Building the optical setup for investigating biological questions comes with challenges. A major such challenge is setting up and synchronizing the control of multiple hardware components such as stages, cameras and lasers. With UC2-ESP we present a compact electronics system powered by the ESP32 microcontroller, designed to provide general-purpose control for various components in microscopy setups. Our system can interface with stepper motors, directed current (DC) motors, lasers (transistor-transistor logics, TTL or pulse width modulation, PWM), light emitting diodes (LEDs), and analog voltage outputs (galvo mirrors, led current control), allowing precise control over microscopy hardware. The platform is highly flexible, supporting custom pin configurations and multiple communication interfaces such as Bluetooth, universal serial bus (USB-serial), and HTTP via a built-in Webserver. A PlayStation controller can be used for haptic hardware manipulation, while commands are transmitted in a human-readable JSON format to ensure modularity and extensibility. The firmware is designed to receive parameters and execute actions dynamically, supporting complex control loops such as motor homing, stage scanning and temperature regulation via integrated controllers. Furthermore, the system integrates seamlessly with ImSwitch as well as MicroManager and offers a browser-based control tool using Web Serial. This open-source firmware enables microscopy research groups to develop custom setups and expand functionality efficiently, at low cost and high flexibility.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creating a customisable Socratic AI physics tutor</a><span class="id">[2507.05795]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper explores role engineering as an effective paradigm for customizing Large Language Models (LLMs) into specialized AI tutors for physics education. We demonstrate this methodology by designing a Socratic physics problem-solving tutor using Google's Gemini Gems feature, defining its pedagogical behavior through a detailed 'script' that specifies its role and persona. We present two illustrative use cases: the first demonstrates the Gem's multimodal ability to analyze a student's hand-drawn force diagram and apply notational rules from a 'Knowledge' file; the second showcases its capacity to guide conceptual reasoning in electromagnetism using its pre-trained knowledge without using specific documents provided by the instructor. Our findings show that the 'role-engineered' Gem successfully facilitates a Socratic dialogue, in stark contrast to a standard Gemini model, which tends to immediately provide direct solutions. We conclude that role engineering is a pivotal and accessible method for educators to transform a general-purpose 'solution provider' into a reliable pedagogical tutor capable of engaging students in an active reflection process. This approach offers a powerful tool for both instructors and students, while also highlighting the importance of addressing the technology's inherent limitations, such as the potential for occasional inaccuracies.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Propellantless space exploration</a><span class="id">[2510.21743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Propellantless propulsion refers to methods of space travel that do not require onboard propellant, instead relying on natural forces or external energy sources. In this paper, I review different approaches that have been explored and discuss the pros and cons of each method for interstellar space exploration. Gravitational assist uses planetary gravity to change a spacecraft's speed and direction without fuel. It is effective but limited to specific alignments. Solar sails harness radiation pressure from sunlight for continuous, fuel-free acceleration. While effective over time, they require large, reflective materials that degrade in space. Speed can be enhanced by thermal desorption triggered by solar radiation. Magnetic sails generate thrust by interacting with the solar wind through superconducting loops that produce a magnetic field. They provide lower acceleration compared to solar sails, and their performance depends on the available power and the variability of solar wind conditions. Electric sails utilize charged tethers to repel solar wind protons, producing gradual acceleration. Their effectiveness depends on the successful deployment of very long, lightweight conductive wires. They can achieve higher acceleration than solar sails, and their performance is influenced by available power and solar wind conditions. Lastly, quantum effects, such as the Casimir force, offer a speculative but intriguing route to propellantless propulsion based on the vacuum energy of space.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The origin of the dark bands found in the Solar Spectra and its consequences</a><span class="id">[2510.21747]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper discusses the history of Fraunhofer's puzzling discovery of the fixed lines in various spectra (most notably of the sun) and the implications of these spectral &quot;imperfections&quot;. Moreover, the developments in spectroscopy by Kirchhoff, Bunsen, et al. in the 19th century and its effects on our understanding of the atomic structure are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wind Power as a Technosignature on M-dwarf Planets</a><span class="id">[2510.21777]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We suggest that the large-scale deployment of wind turbines on an M-dwarf planet could produce observable technosignatures. Motivated by observations of hypersonic wind velocities on WASP-127 b, we note that the atmospheres of such planets could serve as vast reservoirs of energy for an extraterrestrial civilization. A large-scale deployment of wind turbines in a hypersonic environment would produce heated shock waves in the hypersonic stream, cause strong frictional heating from the rotation of the blades, and be a source of infrared radiation. We mention possible scenarios that could lead to the deployment of wind turbines on a gas giant and also note that similar features could exist on terrestrial M-dwarf planets. The idea that aerodynamic peculiarities could be a technosignature is worth keeping in mind as ground- and space-based exoplanet observations continue to improve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21790" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawking in a thousand words</a><span class="id">[2510.21790]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>British physicist Stephen Hawkings most important discovery was that black holes are not so black, as they possess a temperature and emit thermal radiation. In his popular science texts, Hawking offered a detailed explanation of this phenomenon. The aim of this work is to translate that explanation into mathematical language accessible to an advanced high school student, all within a thousand words.</p></div></details></article></body>
