<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Provability vs. Execution: A Comment on &quot;Consequences of Undecidability in Physics on the Theory of Everything&quot;</a><span class="id">[2512.11807]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent work by Faizal et al. (2025) claims that Gödelian undecidability of non-algorithmic truths in our universe imply the impossibility of a formal, algorithmic simulation of the universe. This paper clarifies the distinction between epistemic incompleteness: limits on what can be proven within a formal system, and ontological incompleteness: limits on what can exist or be computed by that system. Using Conway's Game of Life as a Turing-complete example, I demonstrate that undecidability constrains provability but not computability or execution. Unless physical phenomena require the resolution of undecidable propositions, incompleteness alone does not imply a guaranteed failure in execution. Thus, the claim that the universe cannot be simulated lacks empirical and logical justification without evidence of hypercomputation in nature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayesian Unification in the History of Dark Matter: Confirmation by Restructuring Old Evidence</a><span class="id">[2512.12926]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The history of dark matter is often glossed as a linear progression of accumulating evidence confirming its existence. The actual history, however, is far more complex and philosophically nuanced. In this paper, I revisit key moments in the establishment and justification of dark matter as a viable hypothesis and offer a Bayesian representation of the core inferences made at those moments. I argue, contrary to the textbook narrative, that certain evidential reclassifications played a pivotal confirmatory role even in the absence of new data. In particular, I show how unifying previously separate anomalous phenomena under a single modeling framework provided novel support for the dark matter hypothesis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Einstein Was Not a Flat Physicalist: Principle Theories, Constructive Theories, and the Direction of Constraint</a><span class="id">[2512.13463]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Einstein's distinction between principle theories and constructive theories is methodological rather than metaphysical. Principle theories such as thermodynamics and relativity articulate empirically distilled constraints that delimit admissible microphysical models, while constructive theories remain provisional and revisable. This paper reconstructs Einstein's framework from primary sources and argues that recent appeals to it by Meir Hemmo and Orly Shenker (under the banner of &quot;Flat Physicalism&quot;) invert its functional hierarchy. What is presented as an Einsteinian template instead supports a reductionist metaphysics foreign to Einstein's methodology and increasingly misaligned with the structural commitments of contemporary physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13277" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Challenging historical novae: AT Cnc (1645), Te-11 (483), and M22 (BC 48) revisited</a><span class="id">[2512.13277]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Connections between novae with shells and historical observations are crucial for astrophysical understanding of long-term evolution of shells and cataclysmic variables. Three of five previously considered links are revisited here: extended features in M22 in BC48, Te-11 in 483, and AT Cnc in 1645. We aim to develop a procedure to check whether these links are credible. Literal translations of the Chinese texts, historically based arguments, and close readings are combined with astrophysics, (peak brightness, decay time estimate, shell age expansion model calculation, etc.). (a) Nandou's second star, near which the BC48 `guest star' was reported, is identified as tau Sgr, not lambda Sgr, far from the M22 location. A nova in M22 would peak at only m=6.4 \pm 1.4 mag, and thus a description as a `blue-white' `melon' does not fit; it was likely a comet. (b) The imprecise position (`Shen['s] east') of the `guest star' in 483, its extended (dipper-like) radiance, and the context speak for a bolide. Considering the new (larger) Gaia distance and small extinction towards Te-11 (outside a cloud), its bi-polar morphology and current expansion velocity point to a planetary nebula; as a nova, the shell expansion age is 1100-2000 yr from detailed supersonic expansion calculations. (c) Most certainly, Mars was meant when the source for 1645 reported `a large star entered Yugui'; the verb implies motion. AT Cnc lies neither in Yugui's asterism box nor in the eponymous lunar mansion range. The fluid drag expansion age of AT Cancri's ejecta is 128-631 yr. All three exact ages are unsubstantiated. True novae or nova shells can be connected to historical records only if the position and object type are plausible. Duration, brightness (light curve), and color (evolution) should fit and could provide more astrophysical insight ...</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A demonstration that classical gravity does not produce entanglement</a><span class="id">[2511.19242]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Once again, dispute has arisen over the interpretation of proposed quantum information theory experiments to probe the quantum nature of gravity by testing for gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) between two spatially separated massive particles ([1] vs. [11,12]; further contributions in [7,9]). The confusion appears to reside in interpreting applications of a Hamiltonian formalism. But classical gravity cannot mediate entanglement on independent grounds. A Newton-Cartan analysis shows that if gravity is classical, a mediator, and entanglement is observed as an outcome of performing a GIE experiment, something other than gravity must have supplied the (virtual) force needed during the experiment to produce the effect.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Fourier methods with beer bottles</a><span class="id">[2512.12312]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As anyone who has blown across the mouth of a beer bottle knows, beer bottles have a well-defined fundamental frequency. This paper shows how a beer bottle's acoustical resonance can be modeled as a one-dimensional driven-damped oscillator and includes enough detail to be useful in undergraduate laboratory experiments. While the frequency-domain Green's function of the bottle can be extracted through sequential pure-tone measurements, sufficient data to fit the model's parameters can be collected in just a few seconds when Fourier methods are used.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formative experience for intensive instruction physics courses: Evaluation and results in an Electromagnetism course</a><span class="id">[2512.12404]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Currently, the increase in demand for higher education has motivated universities to offer courses in various formats, including Intensive Instruction Courses (CII), in order to adapt to the needs of an increasingly diverse student body. In this context, although active methodologies have been shown to improve conceptual understanding of physics in regular courses, little research has been done on their effectiveness in CII. This research explored the most efficient methodologies for promoting meaningful learning in intensive physics courses. To this end, an integrated pedagogical proposal was designed based on the opinions gathered from a focus group of teachers with previous experience teaching these courses, as well as on existing literature, highlighting methodologies, types of assessment, and characteristics of intensive courses. To evaluate its efficiency, a quasi-experiment was conducted in which students were divided into two groups: an experimental group (EG), which followed the teaching proposal, and a control group (CG), which received non-innovated lessons. Results were measured using the BEMA electromagnetism concepts inventory before and after the intervention. Statistical analysis revealed that Hake's gain was greater in the EG, both in general terms and in each thematic unit of the course. The intervention in the EG shows that the use of active methodologies proved to be more efficient than that of the CG in the context of CII. The results obtained suggest the need to continue investigating other factors involved in the teaching-learning process of CII.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13028" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On emerging paradigm of teaching measurement science and technology in times of ubiquitous use of AI tools</a><span class="id">[2512.13028]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ubiquitous use of the tools of artificial intelligence (AI) in techno-science, in higher education and in other existing and potential fields of measurement application generates new challenges for teaching measurement science and technology (MST). The aim of this article is to encourage its readers to modernize their approach to teaching MST in a way as to meet these challenges, in particular - to profit from new technological opportunities, and to respond to the needs of our civilization, identified within a humanistic reflection over its development. First, the state of the art in applications of AI in higher education is briefly characterized. Next, a methodology for using AI tools in MST, referring to the author's meta-model of measurement, is outlined. Finally, conclusions concerning an emerging paradigm of teaching MST are summarized. The most important of them are as follows. The challenges implied by the ubiquitous use of AI tools cannot be effectively faced without enhancing, in the corresponding curricula, of the contents related to mathematical modelling of material entities, on the one hand, and of the contents related to ethics of research and engineering, on the other. Knowledge and skills related to the art of mathematical modelling are indispensable for extensively profiting from the convergence of various technologies around IT tools, including AI tools. The knowledge and skills related to ethics of research and engineering are indispensable for developing safe applications of measurement in such domains as autonomous vehicles, social robots, biomedical engineering or automated manufacturing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13050" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The SIREN Program: A Scalable Model for Short-Term Undergraduate Research Experiences at Community Colleges</a><span class="id">[2512.13050]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Providing meaningful research experiences for undergraduate students is a well-recognized challenge, particularly at community colleges and teaching-focused institutions where resources are limited and faculty time is dedicated to instruction. To address this, the Summer Introduction to Research and Experimentation in Nuclear physics (SIREN) was developed as a three-week, intensive summer program that engaged 24 students working in six teams on original research projects centered around cosmic detection. Each team was supported by an advisor and a peer mentor, combining structured guidance with near-peer learning. After developing a range of technical skills, students built cosmic detectors and used them to explore a variety of projects. The program also included multiple workshops on research skills and seminars led by guest speakers, giving students access to broader STEM pathways. The evaluation of the program was based on advisor and student surveys, as well as peer mentor observations. The findings suggest that the short-term team-based model promoted engagement, collaboration, and skill development while leading to the completion of advanced projects. The advisors highlighted the effectiveness of the program structure and the excitement generated by the direct application of newly acquired skills to research. Data showed that students were able to significantly develop transferable skills through hands-on activities. Post-program surveys indicated that participants experienced an increased sense of belonging in their majors and greater confidence in pursuing careers in STEM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21508" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visualization enhances Problem Solving in multi-Qubit Systems</a><span class="id">[2505.21508]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quantum Information Science (QIS) is a vast, diverse, and abstract field. In consequence, learners face many challenges. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education research has found that visualizations are valuable to aid learners in complex matters. The conditions under which visualizations pose benefits are largely unexplored in QIS education. In this eye-tracking study, we examine the conditions under which the visualization of multi-qubit systems with the Dimensional Circle Notation (DCN) in addition to the mathematical symbolic Dirac Notation (DN) is associated with a benefit for solving problems on the ubiquitously used Hadamard gate operation in terms of performance, Extraneous Cognitive Load (ECL) and Intrinsic Cognitive Load (ICL). We find that DCN increases performance and reduces cognitive load for participants with little experience in quantum physics. In addition, representational competence is able to predict reductions in ECL with DCN, but not performance or ICL. Analysis of the eye-tracking results indicates that task solvers with more transitions between DN and DCN benefit less from the visualization. We discuss the generalizability of the results and practical implications.</p></div></details></article></body>
