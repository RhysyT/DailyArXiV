From Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images processed with a Larson Sekanina rotational gradient filter, we measure the PAs of three main persistent jet like features between November 30 and December 27, 2025 and fit a weighted Fourier model in a period scan. The dominant jet PA wobble yields Pjet = 7.20 +/- 0.05 h. An independent Gr (R band) time-series photometry data set, using two different apertures from MPC station L92, analyzed with nightly offsets and 30 minute binning, gives Pphot = 7.136 +/- 0.001 h (formal 1sigma), with a semiamplitude A about 0.311 mag and scatter sigmajit about 0.089 mag. The close agreement beetwen the periods supports a characteristic post-perihelion period of about 7.1 h. We interpret this period as an attitude precession/nutation (non principal axis rotation) traced by jet orientation and coma flux redistribution. The jet structure precesses about the rotation axis with a characteristic angular excursion of order about 20 degs, and the rotation axis is aligned with the sunward direction to within about 20 degs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18552" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Chemical Homogeneity of Single-Lined Spectroscopic Binaries in Open Clusters</a><span class="id">[2602.18552]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using SDSS-V DR19 Milky Way Mapper APOGEE data, we measure the impact that close binarity has on surface chemistry across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in a broad set of abundances by studying single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1s) in open clusters. We derive binary membership and orbital parameters for 103 SB1s by analysing APOGEE radial velocities with The Joker and UltraNest. We perform a detailed abundance analysis with BACCHUS to derive abundances in fourteen chemical species: Si, Fe, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Ce, and Nd. Leveraging the assumptions of chemical homogeneity in open clusters, we compare the surface abundances of SB1s to non-binary stars at similar evolutionary states. We find that a subset of binaries with significant UV excess have a $\Delta$[C/N] that is 0.2–0.5 dex higher than expected, resulting in overestimated [C/N]-based ages for those stars. This points to pollution from an evolved companion and has implications for [C/N]-based age studies of the broader Milky Way. At the population level, we find that SB1s in our sample can be treated as statistically chemically homogeneous with their single-star counterparts, and we find no connection between orbital separation and chemical enrichment or depletion. We show that at separations up to  5 pc, co-eval stars can be considered chemically homogeneous with one another within current abundance precisions, regardless of multiplicity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 5. Cosmological Constraints with Simulation-Based Priors</a><span class="id">[2602.18554]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the public DESI full-shape clustering data using simulation-based priors (SBPs). Our priors are obtained by fitting normalizing flows to the distribution of EFT parameters measured from field-level simulations, themselves generated using tailored halo occupation distribution (HOD) models for each tracer. Incorporating SBPs in a power spectrum analysis significantly enhances $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameter constraints; in combination with BAO information from DESI DR2 and a BBN prior on the baryon density, we find the matter density parameter $\Omega_m=0.2987\pm 0.0066$, the Hubble constant $H_0=68.80\pm 0.35\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.766\pm 0.015$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8=0.764\pm 0.018$), which are $1\%$, $40\%$ and $50\%$ stronger than the baseline results, though with a notable downwards shift in $\sigma_8$. The SBPs also have a significant impact in extended models, with the dark energy figure-of-merit improving by $70\%$ ($20\%$) in a $w_0w_a$CDM analysis when combining with the CMB (and supernovae). In the SBP analysis, we do not find statistically significant evidence for dynamical dark energy: the equation of state parameters are consistent with a cosmological constant within $2.2\sigma$ ($1.4\sigma$) in analyses without (with) supernovae. The neutrino mass constraints are also enhanced, with the $95\%$ limits $M_\nu&lt;0.073\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $M_\nu&lt;0.090\,\mathrm{eV}$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM respectively. The latter is the strongest constraint obtained to date and reinforces the preference for the normal neutrino mass hierarchy, regardless of the background dynamics. While our results are sensitive to HOD modeling assumptions, they clearly demonstrate that the inclusion of small-scale information can significantly sharpen cosmological parameter constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Monsters and Dusty Descendants: Reconciling UV and IR Emission from Galaxies from z=7, up to z= 14</a><span class="id">[2602.18556]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent JWST observations reveal massive, UV-bright galaxies at $z &gt; 10$ with little apparent dust attenuation, whereas ALMA detections at $z \simeq 7$ show similarly massive systems that are already dust-rich and IR-luminous. This raises a fundamental question: can a single physical model of star formation and dust production explain both populations across cosmic time? We address this using a minimal framework with only two free parameters–the instantaneous star formation efficiency ($\epsilon_\star$) and the dust yield per Type II supernova ($y_d$)–and predict the rest-frame UV and IR luminosity functions (LFs) from $z \simeq 14$ to 7. For a uniform ISM, we find a UV-IR tension at the bright end of the LFs at $z \ge 7$. The UV LF requires low dust yields ($y_d \lesssim 0.01\,M_\odot$), whereas the $z=7$ IR LF requires higher yields ($y_d \sim 0.1\,M_\odot$) unless the star formation efficiency is boosted above $\epsilon_\star \approx 5$-10%. We show that incorporating a porous, turbulent ISM largely resolves this tension: turbulence opens low-column-density sightlines that enhance the UV escape fraction while leaving the total absorbed energy–and thus the IR luminosity–nearly unchanged once radiative-transfer–induced flattening of the attenuation curve is included. Large-grain dust distributions, while reducing UV opacity, play a secondary role once ISM porosity and radiative transfer are taken into account. At $z &gt; 10$, however, even strong turbulence cannot reproduce the bright end of the UV LF at high dust yield. This could be resolved either by efficient dust removal in early massive systems or by substantial ISM dust growth by $z \simeq 7$. Our results highlight dust physics as a key lever for interpreting the rapidly growing UV and IR constraints within the broader context of early galaxy formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18558" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ionised interstellar medium of DSFGs revealed by JWST/NIRSpec and ALMA: Super-solar metallicity, low ionisation parameters and, typical electron densities</a><span class="id">[2602.18558]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed study of near-infrared (2-4$\rm \mu$m) JWST/NIRSpec spectra of 48 high-redshift ($z=2.53^{+1.32}_{-0.70}$) galaxies detected with ALMA at $&gt;3\sigma$. From a multi-wavelength SED analysis we establish the sample has a a median stellar mass of $\rm\log_{10}(M_\ast/M_\odot)=10.8\pm0.1$ and dust mass of $\rm\log_{10}(M_{\rm d}/M_\odot)=8.7\pm0.1$, covering a broad range of far-infrared luminosity $\rm (\log_{10}(L_{FIR}/L_\odot)=10.9-12.7)$. The majority of sources show no signs of AGN activity, with 40% having either X-ray counterparts $(\rm L_{Xc}&gt;10^{42}erg/s)$, elevated optical line ratios, or broad (FWHM&gt;800 km/s) H$\alpha$ profiles, although we note this is a lower limit due to the stochastic placement of NIRSpec slits. We establish the sample has a median gas-phase metallicity of $12+\log({\rm O/H})=8.71\pm0.02$, as derived from the [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratio, with the most FIR-luminous galaxies ($\rm\log_{10}(L_{\rm FIR}/L_\odot)&gt;12$) falling $0.15\pm0.03$dex above the fundamental metallicity relation. From the [SII] emission-line doublet ratio, we measure a median electron density of $\log_{10}(n_{\rm e}/{\rm cm}^{-3})=2.53\pm0.07$ consistent with less-massive, star-forming, galaxies at the same epoch. For nine galaxies with [OII] and H$\beta$ detections (median $\rm\log_{10}(L_{\rm FIR}/L_\odot)=11.81\pm0.15$), we derive a median observed (dust-uncorrected) ionisation parameter of $\rm\log_{10}(U)=-2.84\pm0.06$. Our results indicate that luminous far-infrared galaxies are massive, chemically evolved systems that appear to deviate from the standard dust and metal production equilibrium observed in less obscured galaxies. This study demonstrates the synergy of JWST and ALMA in unveiling the nature of DSFGs, and highlights the need for a NIRSpec survey of uniformly selected, massive, dust-obscured, galaxies to fully characterise their interstellar medium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One Halo, Two Boundaries: Relating Accretion Shocks and Splashback Radii in Galaxy Clusters</a><span class="id">[2602.18609]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The boundaries of dark matter and gas in clusters are delineated by the splashback radius and the accretion shock, respectively. Theoretically, both of these boundaries are expected to coincide at the outskirts of halos. However, hydrodynamic cosmological simulations have highlighted significant displacement between them. In this study, we utilise the IllustrisTNG simulation suite to investigate the statistical relationship between the splashback and shock surfaces in a sample of 812 cluster-mass halos. We compute the full angular distribution of both boundaries and examine their relationship, also considering how different moments of this distribution correlate with halo properties. We employ a dispersion-based measure for the splashback boundary and the maximum entropy distance for the shock location. Despite examining various boundary definitions, we consistently observe an offset between the splashback and shock boundaries, with $R_{\rm sh}/R_{\rm sp} \sim 1.3-2$, depending on specific methodological choices. This offset predominantly occurs along void directions. We analyse the redshift evolution of these boundaries for a subset of halos and find that splashback and shock boundaries are not necessarily distinct at earlier times. During mergers, gas dissipates energy and resists contraction via pressure, unlike collisionless dark matter, leading to the observed boundary offset. We also find that the feature in pressure profiles arising from the outer accretion shock is sensitive to the exact method of stacking, which has important implications for observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assessing Zeeman Measurements of Magnetic Fields in Synthetic HI Observations</a><span class="id">[2602.18713]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Zeeman observations provide the only direct probe of line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic fields in the interstellar medium. To evaluate their accuracy and limitations, we generate synthetic HI Zeeman spectra from magnetohydrodynamic simulations and idealized cloud models, and analyze the resulting Stokes I and V profiles using two complementary methods. Approach I uses the classical relation between Stokes V and dI/d{\nu} to estimate LOS-averaged magnetic fields, achieving an upper-limit relative error of 16% (half-width of 68.27% confidence interval) for a representative noise level of 0.014 K. Approach II applies Gaussian decomposition to Stokes I and V to estimate component-level magnetic fields, yielding a 13% relative error quantifying the same confidence range, reflecting the intrinsic uncertainty of such Zeeman estimates. Both approaches recover the original fields under uniform-field conditions and remain robust in turbulent environments. Approach I provides a simple and reliable LOS-averaged field estimate, while Approach II, although more complex, offers statistical insight into magnetic field variations along the LOS. We further show that joint fitting of Stokes I and V generally outperforms sequential fitting, particularly in the presence of attenuation. Increasing noise eight-fold produces a more modest rise in uncertainty, doubling to a 26% relative error, while substantial optical depth introduces only a minor additional contribution to the overall uncertainty. Applying these methods to FAST observations of the L1544 star-forming region, we confirm the previously reported LOS magnetic field strength, demonstrating the validity of Zeeman analysis in this benchmark core.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18738" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Massive Black Hole formation in proto-stellar clusters via early gas accretion</a><span class="id">[2602.18738]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We review our semi-analytic model of stellar black hole (BH) mass growth by gas accretion in gas-rich stellar clusters during their birthstage within the first $\sim 10\,{\rm Myr}$ after the first stellar formation event.

In this study, we investigate the application of deep learning (DL) frameworks to characterize different galactic substructures hosted within parametric light-profile subtracted “residual” images of a large sample galaxies from the CANDELS survey. We develop a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and unsupervised Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CvAE) and train it on the single-Sérsic profile fitting based residual images of $10,046$ bright and massive galaxies ($H&lt;24.5\,{\rm mag}$ and $M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^{9.5}\,M_{\odot}$) spanning $1&lt;z&lt;3$, in conjunction with their visual-based classification labels indicating the nature of residual substructures hosted within them. Using our unique data preprocessing approach, we prepare our residual images such that the inputs to our DL networks comprise only “galaxy of interest”, and augment them such that our sample span uniformly across different residual characteristics. We assess the latent space of the CNN and CvAE using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) along with independently quantified metrics of residual strength (significant pixel flux $SPF$, Bumpiness, and Residual Flux Fraction). We also employ an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) based clustering scheme with Support Vector Classification (SVC) to identify groupings in PCA space that correspond to similar residual substructure. We find that our supervised CNN latent features in PCA space correlate with the $SPF$ values and distinguish between qualitatively strong and weak residual substructures. While our unsupervised CvAE latent space also correlates with visual and quantitative residual characteristics, but lacks clear discriminatory power when characterizing different residual substructures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variational views for self-supervised learning in radio astronomy</a><span class="id">[2602.18923]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modern astronomical surveys are producing progressively larger and more complex datasets, making traditional supervised approaches that rely on extensive labelled catalogues increasingly difficult. Consequently, pre-training using self-supervised learning (SSL), which offers a scalable route by extracting structure directly from unlabelled images, is becoming attractive for many downstream applications. In this work we consider the use of coupled self-supervised representation learning approaches for radio galaxy morphology pre-training. In order to account for the more nuanced variations in radio galaxy morphology than are typically included in the augmented views of view-based SSL algorithms, we use a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate views for training a larger view-based self-supervised model. To do this, a $\beta$-VAE was trained on the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset, where moderate regularization ($\beta = 2.3$) was found to provide a good balance between reconstruction quality and disentanglement of generative factors such as source multiplicity and lobe asymmetry. An analysis of the $\beta$-VAE reveals that Fanaroff-Riley class identity manifests as a continuous transition across the latent space, rather than being associated to a single discrete dimension. $\beta$-VAE reconstructions were then incorporated as generative augmentations within a view-based SSL pipeline. Our experiments show that combining these generative views with standard image augmentations improves downstream classification performance, and we present ablation studies clarifying the relative contribution of each augmentation type. These results indicate that generative and contrastive approaches are complementary, and point toward disentanglement-aware self-supervised learning as a promising direction for future radio astronomy surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19050" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Optical Properties of Host Galaxies of Radio Sources in the Coma Cluster</a><span class="id">[2602.19050]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive study of host galaxies of radio sources within the 1.35$R_{200}$ of the Coma cluster by combining deep 144MHz observations from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2) with optical spectroscopy and photometry from DESI and SDSS. We identify 79 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members with reliable radio emission and classify them into compact, extended, and tailed subsamples according to their radio morphologies. By combining their radio and optical properties, we find compact radio sources are predominantly associated with massive, quiescent galaxies driven by AGN activity, while tailed sources are largely hosted by star-forming galaxies, tracing ongoing ram pressure stripping (RPS). Using phase-space analysis and a projected infall time proxy ($d_R$), we find that extended sources are preferentially located in the cluster outskirts ($d_R &gt; 1$), while tailed sources are concentrated in the intermediate infall region ($0.4 &lt; d_R &lt; 1.0$), highlighting the influence of the dense intracluster medium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19227" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feedback shaped the galaxy morphological sequence in presence of mergers</a><span class="id">[2602.19227]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bulges and disks are major structural components that define galaxy morphology. The mass ratios of bulges and disks increase statistically with the galaxy mass, with the high-mass end occupied by elliptical galaxies. Although previous theoretical studies have succeeded in reproducing this morphological sequence, it is not yet fully understood why and how this morphological sequence emerged. Galaxy mergers accompanying dark matter halo mergers have been proposed as the major route for bulge formation. On the other hand, it is observationally known that the mass fraction of galaxies (stars plus cold gas) in dark matter halos attains the peak value at $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12} {\rm M}_\odot$ throughout the cosmic time. Using a simple galaxy evolution model including mergers, we show that this feature is the fundamental cause of the morphological sequence. Halos hosting massive galaxies, which stay more massive than this peak mass for long periods during their growth, merge mostly with satellite halos having larger galaxy mass fractions than themselves. Such mergers increase the bulge mass fraction efficiently. In contrast, host halos of low-mass galaxies evolve under unfavorable condition for bulge growth because they stay below the peak mass and merge with satellite halos with smaller galaxy mass fractions. Previous studies suggest that the peak in galaxy mass fraction is created by feedback processes from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and young massive stars including supernovae (SN), which are considered to suppress star formation in high-mass and low-mass galaxies, respectively. This study thus points to a close relationship between the galaxy morphology and feedback processes which have hitherto been considered unrelated and suggests the importance of further investigation into their causal relationship.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BayeSED-GALAXIES II. Bayesian full spectrum analysis of galaxies and application in the CSST wide-field slitless spectroscopy survey</a><span class="id">[2602.19451]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) will conduct wide-field multiband photometric imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys, advancing cosmology and galaxy evolution studies. Achieving CSST's cosmological goals requires precise redshifts ($\sigma_{\rm NMAD}\lesssim 0.002-0.005$) from low-resolution ($R\sim200$) and potentially blended slitless spectra. We present BayeSED3, extended for Bayesian full-spectrum analysis, including nebular emission modeling (via \textsc{Cloudy}) and a Bayesian treatment of the model scaling factor, improving reliability over optimization methods for low SNR spectra. Validated on realistic mock data generated with the CESS emulator (median SNR=1.65, including instrumental and self-blending effects), our method achieves excellent redshift precision with three-band (GU+GV+GI) spectroscopy: $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}=0.0008$ ($\sim$80% success) for star-forming and $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}=0.0015$ ($\sim$50% success) for quiescent galaxies. Stellar mass ($\sigma_{\rm NMAD}\approx0.015$ dex for SF, $\approx0.016$ dex for quiescent) and SFR ($\sigma_{\rm NMAD}\approx0.05$ dex for SF, especially at SNR&gt;1) are reliably recovered. Self-blending increases scatter by $\gtrsim30%$, but combining spectroscopy with CSST's seven-band photometry significantly improves accuracy, especially for quiescent galaxies and data-limited cases. Single-band spectroscopy plus photometry yields reasonable redshifts: GU+photometry is limited, GI+photometry gives &gt;60% (SF) and &gt;40% (quiescent) success at $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}\lesssim0.002$, GV+photometry gives &gt;35% (SF) and $\sim$40% (quiescent) at similar precision. The Bayesian framework offers a powerful method for accurate galaxy characterization, enhancing CSST's scientific outcomes despite the challenges of slitless spectroscopy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19524" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SMMAN: quasi-Simultaneous Multi-wavelength Monitoring of gamma-ray-loud AGNs with the Nanshan 26-m radio telescope</a><span class="id">[2602.19524]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are characterized by strong temporal flux density variability across the electromagnetic spectrum, offering insights into the complex physical processes governing accretion and plasma outflows. To systematically investigate AGNs flux density variability in radio bands, a long-term program was initiated in late 2016: quasi-Simultaneous Multiwavelength Monitoring of gamma-ray-loud AGNs with the Nanshan 26-m radio telescope (SMMAN). This work presents the first data release of the SMMAN program, spanning over eight years from 2016 to 2024 with observations at 4.8 and 23.6 GHz. The SMMAN sample includes 131 northern ($\delta &gt;\sim0^{\circ}$) sources selected from the Fermi Large Area Telescope third source catalog. The characteristics of variability, spectral index, luminosity, and $\gamma$-ray loudness factor are examined for different AGN classes within the sample. Target sources exhibit stronger variability at 23.6 GHz compared to 4.8 GHz, with BL Lac objects being more variable than flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). BL Lacs generally have flatter radio spectra, while FSRQs, blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs), and radio galaxies (RDGs) span a wider range from flat to steep. FSRQs are more radio-luminous than BL Lacs and other classes, with BCUs intermediate and RDGs generally fainter. FSRQs and BL Lacs have higher $\gamma$-ray loudness factors than RDGs, while BCUs have intermediate values. The SMMAN dataset, incorporated with other historical and ongoing monitoring programs, will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of spectral energy distributions, search for quasi-periodic oscillations, and analyze supermassive black hole binary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing dark matter distributions with the pericentre precession of the stellar orbits near the Galactic Centre black hole</a><span class="id">[2602.19553]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Galactic Centre black hole provides a naive environment for understanding unknown matter distribution and new gravitational physics. For this stellar orbits in the nuclear star cluster are reliable probes. We investigate different dark matter mass profiles through pericentre shift of stellar orbits near the black hole. We also study capability of existing and upcoming astrometric facilities to detect dark matter induced precession and to distinguish between several dark matter profiles. Parameters of different dark matter density profiles are estimated by using the most recent upper bound on dark mass near the black hole. These profiles are then used for calculating the gravitational potential and hence the relativistic pericentre shift of both low and high eccentricity orbits of 13 S-stars. We use the recently measured deviation parameter $f_{sp}$ for investigating competition between dark matter and gravitational physics within S2's orbit. The astrometric shift of the pericentres has been calculated and compared with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of large and extremely large telescopes. The orbit of S2 is found to be insensitive to dark matter induced precession. Low eccentricity and wider orbits are prominent probes for measuring dark matter induced precession which is accessible to present and upcoming astrometric facilities such as Keck, GRAVITY and TMT. The existing and upcoming facilities can distinguish between different dark matter profiles for some stars and hence they posses the capability to distinguish between possible formation histories of the central region of our Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MEDUSA I.

By analysing the radio continuum spectra and polarisation of the dwarf-dwarf galaxy merger NGC 1487 from the MEDUSA sample, we aim to determine its magnetic field strength and to characterise the large-scale and turbulent components of its magnetic field.

We analysed the magnetic field configuration using polarisation and rotation measure (RM) synthesis. The integrated spectral energy distribution has a non-thermal spectral index of $\alpha_{\rm nth} = -0.678\pm0.085$. Synchrotron and inverse Compton losses cause a spectral break at $\nu_{\rm b} = 6.2\pm1.3$ GHz. In star-forming regions, the magnetic field exhibits strong small-scale fluctuations in RM, suggesting the action of a small-scale dynamo. Conversely, the field becomes more ordered, aligning with the tidal arms toward the galaxy's outskirts, showing a large-scale magnetic field over $\approx3$ kpc. Observations of the dwarf-dwarf merger NGC 1487 show that even low-mass galaxy mergers, likely the building blocks of larger galaxies in the early Universe, can rapidly amplify and produce coherent large-scale magnetic field structures, highlighting their key contribution in the early magnetisation of galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for and characterizing halo substructures with the GALAH DR4 survey</a><span class="id">[2602.19647]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent studies show that the Milky Way stellar halo is composed of populations of different origins, shaped by multiple accretion events. To better understand the formation of the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies, we characterize the chemical and kinematic properties of halo substructures using GALAH DR4 and Gaia data. We apply wavelet transforms in the space of sqrt(J_r) and azimuthal action (L_z) to identify kinematic overdensities. Stars in the detected structures are analyzed in elemental abundance space to determine their origin. We further assess contamination using the unsupervised machine-learning algorithm t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), performing chemical tagging with 15 elemental abundances. We recover five structures: the Galactic disk, the Splash, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Thamnos1, and Thamnos2. GSE shows two peaks; one at sqrt(J_r)   25 kpc km s^-1 is due to disk contamination, while the other above sqrt(J_r)   40 kpc km s^-1 represents the cleanest GSE population. Thamnos exhibits three peaks linked to Thamnos1 and Thamnos2. Thamnos2 shows higher [alpha/Fe], iron-peak elements are enhanced in the Splash, and halo groups retain a stronger r-process signature. The multiply peaked structures suggest that the splashed disk extends beyond prograde orbits. The distinct chemo-dynamical properties of the halo groups support their extragalactic origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chemodynamical properties of gas-rich galaxies: a comparison of observations and simulations</a><span class="id">[2602.19707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform a comprehensive analysis of the chemical and dynamical properties of quasar-damped Lyman-{\alpha} (DLA) galaxies and compare these to the GEAR chemodynamical simulations. Specifically, we aim to constrain the behavior of {\alpha}-element enhancements with metallicity, the dependence of [{\alpha}/Fe] on the specific star formation rate (sSFR), and the absorption-line velocity widths ({\Delta}v90) vs. stellar mass, {\Delta}v90 vs. metallicity, and mass-metallicity relations. For the comparison, we select five galaxies simulated with the chemodynamical Tree-SPH code GEAR with stellar masses in the range of log(M*/Msol) between 6.1 and 10.8, and at six different redshifts between 0.33 and 4.12. We find that the abundance ratios [{\alpha}/Fe] and [M/H] observed in the interstellar medium (ISM) of DLA galaxies overlap with the abundance trends in gas of the simulated galaxies. Our findings corroborate a picture in which DLAs with {\Delta}v90 below and above 100 km/s trace galaxies with masses in the ranges of log M* 6 - 8 and 8 - 11 solar masses, respectively. We suggest that observations should be used with caution when constraining the theoretical [{\alpha}/Fe] vs. sSFR relations because of systematics (if abundances are obtained from emission lines) or differences in the gas properties as probed by a DLA and its counterpart. So far, only the observations in absorption of inner gas of the LMC and SMC are in agreement with the simulated data. We confirm that DLAs detected at large impact parameters most likely probe the gas of satellite or other halo galaxies which are adjacent to the central galaxy. We further find that the velocity widths vs. stellar masses and mass-metallicity relations agree well with observations, while GEAR should be calibrated more carefully to reproduce the {\Delta}v90 vs. metallicity relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19729" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIGHTEE: Discovery of a triple-double radio galaxy</a><span class="id">[2602.19729]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Triple-double radio galaxies (TDRGs) are amongst the rarest subpopulations of radio galaxies (RGs). They are characterised by three pairs of radio lobes, where each pair of lobes represents an episode of nuclear activity. Such a feature makes them key objects that can be used to constrain the duty cycle of RGs. In this paper, we report the discovery of J022248\m060934, a new TDRG, hosted by a galaxy at a spectroscopic redshift of $z \approx$ 0.94. We have used the MIGHTEE-DR1 data set and MIGHTEE sub-band images as our main data. In total intensity, J022248\m060934 has a bright core and triple-double, edge-brightened-like peaks of radio emission. The polarimetry of the source reveals an inhomogeneous density of the hosting environment which is consistent with the more pronounced bending in its eastern lobes. The spectral index and curvature maps suggest an inverted core and an ultra-steepening of the spectrum towards the outer lobes which reinforce a recurrent nuclear activity. We perform individual spectral age fitting of the components of the source using the JP model and we found a lower limit total age of $\sim$16 Myr. We also derive a short inactive period between the active phases and a rapid duty cycle of 90 per cent for the first cycle of activity. Our spectral ageing analysis suggests that the triple-double structure in TDRGs is not the product of long quiescent periods, as deduced by previous works based on kinematic ages.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The morphological stability of open clusters: a new 2D perspective</a><span class="id">[2602.19746]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Open clusters (OCs) usually evolve gradually as the number of their members changes, which can be manifested in their morphological characteristics. We aim to investigate the morphological stability of 1,490 OCs and further explore the potential change of morphological stability of the OCs at different spatial positions, using the OC catalog from the literature. We define for the first time a new morphological stability parameter Ncore/Nouter, a ratio of member numbers between cluster core and outer areas within tidal radii, which has a significant positive correlation against N, with a slope of 1.140\pm0.039, significantly steeper than the 0.720\pm0.026 measured for Score/Souter. This demonstrates that the stellar density in the core is a more sensitive tracer for morphological stability than geometry. Spatially, the radial sample OCs have larger slopes of Ncore/Nouter and Score/Souter against N, with 1.083\pm0.116 and 0.733\pm0.080, respectively, whereas those in the tangential direction 1.013\pm0.110 and 0.529\pm0.075, respectively, which means that the impact on sample OCs from tidal forces directed toward the Galactic center is possibly stronger than that from the shear force caused by the differential rotation of the Galactic disk. Besides, the sample OCs younger than 30 Myr display a shallow slope of 0.751\pm0.166, with those older than 800 Myr (1.442\pm0.128), reflecting that young OCs likely endure both internal disruptions, such as early dynamical heating weakening core binding and more severe external disturbances, compared to older OCs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19858" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Milky Way Halo with RR Lyrae Stars from Gaia Data Release 3</a><span class="id">[2602.19858]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Milky Way (MW) stellar halo, containing debris from past accretion events, serves as a fossil record of hierarchical mass assembly. Due to their distinct properties, RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) serve as excellent tracers for identifying and characterising the halo's substructures. We analysed a sample of 4933 RRLs, for which we calculated the integrals of motion and orbital parameters. We applied the domain-informed novelty detection CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries (CLiMB) framework to identify RRL membership in the MW substructures. We analysed the metallicity distributions of RRLs in major accreted system remnants as a snapshot of their chemical evolutionary status during early epochs. We calculated the weighted mean metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the corresponding standard deviation for Gaia Sausage/Enceladus ([Fe/H] = $-1.57 \pm 0.25$ dex), Sequoia ([Fe/H] =$ -1.64\pm0.26$ dex), and the Helmi streams ([Fe/H] = $-1.66\pm0.19$ dex). The metallicity distribution of RRLs in Thamnos was found to be bimodal, with the metal-poor peak likely representing the genuine accreted Thamnos population ([Fe/H] = $-1.94\pm0.20$ dex), in agreement with recent works based on spectroscopic abundances. Our analysis shows that the substructures ED-1 and L-RL3 are highly contaminated by thick disc stars. However, the metal-poor tails in their metallicity distributions may be signatures of remnants from small accreted systems. We also identify over-densities of RRLs in correspondence with the recently reported substructures Shiva and Shakti, which we suggest are of in-situ origin. Finally, we applied the RRL-based mass-metallicity relation of galaxies to test the nature of the identified dynamical substructures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19897" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winds of Change: XRISM Resolve X-ray spectroscopy of NGC 4051</a><span class="id">[2602.19897]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>NGC 4051 is a nearby (16.7 Mpc), Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1), which has a low black hole mass of $10^6$ M$_{\odot}$. It is also known for its rapid X-ray variability, on timescales of kilo-seconds and has a complex, multi component wind in both the soft X-ray and Fe K bands. Here we present the first high resolution XRISM Resolve spectrum of NGC 4051, which was captured in a historically bright state for a 150 ks exposure. XRISM resolves two blue-shifted Fe K shell absorption troughs in the mean spectrum, which can be ascribed to H-like iron and arises from two outflow components with outflow velocities of 0.025c and 0.04c. A time dependent spectral analysis shows that the iron K absorption is variable on timescales of less than a day, increasing in velocity over the duration of the observation. The velocity changes may be explained either by the passage of two separate transiting absorbers, of different velocities, or by a single accelerating outflow of approximately constant column density. In the latter case, the wind acceleration is likely to be too large to be caused by radiation pressure and instead magnetic driving is favored to accelerate the wind up to 0.04c. The outflow can originate from an accretion disk wind, whose kinetic power is sub-Eddington in contrast to recent examples of winds from powerful, luminous quasars observed by XRISM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bar Formation During a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus-like Merger Event</a><span class="id">[2602.19995]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bars are among the most prominent galactic structures, yet their formation mechanisms remain incompletely understood. They can form either internally, via dynamical instabilities, or externally, triggered by interactions with other galaxies. The impact of mergers on bar formation and survival, however, has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore the influence of mergers on bars, we construct a suite of \textit{N}-body merger pairs where a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus-like radially biased satellite disk galaxy merges with a central disk galaxy during its bar formation. With the central galaxy fixed, the satellite varies in merger parameters: the mass ratio $m/M$ relative to the central galaxy, the impact parameter $b$, and the orbital inclination angle $\theta_i$ relative to the central disk. We find that the bar survival probability decreases with increasing $m/M$. Mergers with $m/M\lesssim1/10$ generally preserve the forming bar, whereas those with ${m/M}\geq1/2$ tend to destroy it, producing more early-type-like remnants. For intermediate mass ratios ($1/5 \leq m/M \leq 1/3$), several models yield “weakening bars”, in which the bar survives the merger but gradually decays during subsequent secular evolution, possibly due to interactions between nested double bars formed from merger debris. In contrast to $m/M$, $b$ and $\theta_i$ have only secondary and stochastic effects on bar survival. The different influences of these three merger parameters can be naturally explained by the tidal force exerted by the satellite on the forming bar, which tends to weaken the bar when the satellite crosses it nearly perpendicular to its major axis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulation of proton radiolysis of H2O and O2 ices with the Nautilus code</a><span class="id">[2602.19996]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The radiolysis effect of cosmic rays (CRs) plays an important role in the chemistry in molecular clouds. CRs can dissociate the molecules on dust grains, producing reactive suprathermal species and radicals which facilitate the formation of large molecules. We add the radiolysis process and some relevant reactions into the Nautilus astrochemical code. By adjusting some parameters, we investigate the sensitivity of the simulation results of the H2O ice on the removal of reaction-diffusion competition, the removal of non-diffusive chemistry, and the desorption energies of the suprathermal species. We find the model, with a few adjustments of the chemistry, can reproduce the steady-state [H2O2]/[H2O] and [O3]/[O2]_0 abundance ratios in the H2O and O2 radiolysis experiments at any CR flux in the experiments. These adjustments in the model do not fully reproduce the fluence required to reach the steady state. It tends also to overestimate the destruction of H2O as measured in H2O radiolysis experiments. We show that reducing the G-values of H2O radiolysis, which implies an increase in the efficiency of immediate reformation of water locally after ion impact, leads to simulated H2O destruction rates closer to the experiments. The effect of reaction-diffusion competition on the simulation results of H2O ice is significant at $\zeta \lesssim 10^{-14}\ \rm s^{-1}$. The non-diffusive chemistry affects the simulation results at 16 K but not 77K, while the results are sensitive to the desorption energies of suprathermal H, O, O3 and OH at 77 K. Our results show that the steady-state [H2O2]/[H2O] and [O3]/[O2]_0 in experiments can be reproduced by fine-tuning the chemical model, but still call for more constraints on the intermediate pathways in the radiolysis processes, especially the ion chemistry in the ice bulk, as well as activation barriers and branching ratios of the reactions in the network.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The major merger-active galactic nucleus connection up to the cosmic noon</a><span class="id">[2602.19997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy major mergers are a potential mechanism for triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, but their role remains debated, particularly beyond the local Universe. We aim to shed light on the merger-AGN connection at $z=0.5$-$2$, exploiting the multi-wavelength datasets and {\it James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) observations in the COSMOS field. We construct a stellar mass-limited sample and identify AGN via mid-infrared (MIR) colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We train convolutional neural networks to identify mergers with mock JWST observations. We create non-AGN and non-merger control samples matching the redshift, stellar mass, and star-formation rate distributions of the AGN and mergers. We find AGN to be moderately more frequent in mergers than in non-mergers, with excess ratios ranging from $\sim2.5$ (X-ray AGN) to $\sim1.3$ (MIR) and $\sim 1.1$-1.2 (SED AGN). Similarly, AGN galaxies show a higher merger fraction ($f_{merg}$) than non-AGN controls. We then study $f_{merg}$ as a function of relative and absolute AGN power, utilising the AGN fraction ($f_{AGN}$) and accretion disc luminosity (L$_{disc}$) parameters. We uncover a $f_{merg}$-$f_{AGN}$ relation with two regimes: $f_{merg}$ stays roughly flat for less-dominant AGN ($f_{AGN}&lt;0.8$) but increases at $f_{AGN}&gt;0.8$ for the MIR and X-ray AGN, and more gently for SED AGN, where mergers appear to be the main triggering mechanism. Additionally, $f_{merg}$ increases monotonically as a function of L$_{disc}$, for all AGN types, reaching $f_{merg}&gt;50\%$ for the most luminous AGN (L$_{disc} \gtrsim 10^{46}\,{erg\,s^{-1}}$). Overall, our results suggest that major mergers can trigger AGN out to the cosmic noon at $z\sim2$. Furthermore, the role of major mergers shows a clear dependence on AGN luminosity and remains the principal mechanism for fuelling the most powerful AGN.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20096" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">21,864 Unresolved, Low-mass Binaries Identified via their Overluminosity in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and a Catalog of 347,440 Systems within 100 pc of the Sun</a><span class="id">[2602.20096]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fundamental parameters of a low-mass star can potentially be determined from its photometry and astrometry. This is complicated by the fact that 10-20 percent of low-mass stars are predicted to be equal-mass binaries. These unresolved systems appear more luminous compared to single stars with the same fundamental parameters. We present a method to differentiate binary stars from single-star main sequence K and M dwarfs using their \textit{Gaia} DR3 XP spectra. We assemble a training set of stars which have pristine astrometry and photometry, are located within 100pc of the Sun, and exclude stars with \textit{Gaia} DR3 flags suggesting they may be unequal mass systems, thereby leaving stars that are predominantly either single- or equal-mass binaries. We then iteratively train Random Forest Regression (RFR) models to predict absolute magnitude and color given the RP spectral coefficients of a star. After each model, we remove the stars that have absolute magnitudes significantly brighter than their predicted values. This method converges on a model trained only on single stars. We then use this model to identify the “overluminous” K and M stars in \textit{Gaia} DR3 within 100 parsecs, with some quality cuts. We find that $\sim13\%$ of the sample is significantly overluminous and assume these to be unresolved binaries. We aggregate several multiplicity surveys across different projected separations and incorporate our overluminous binaries to create a general \textit{Catalog of Systems} within 100 pc. We use this \textit{Catalog} to provide lower limits on the multiplicity fraction for stars between $0.1$ and $0.7~M_{\odot}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IceCube's convex all-sky neutrino spectrum consistent with the magnetically powered corona scenario for active galactic nuclei</a><span class="id">[2602.20145]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-energy multimessenger background analyses over the past decade have provided evidence for a population of hidden neutrino sources that are opaque to GeV-TeV gamma rays, a picture bolstered by recent observations of the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068.

The degree of uncertainty for other elements is unknown. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of O$^{++}$ and N$^+$ ion abundances using optical and far-infrared spectra of a star-forming region within the nearby dwarf galaxy Haro 3, which exhibits a typical ADF. Assuming homogeneous conditions, the far-IR emission indicates an O abundance which is higher than the $T_e$ method and consistent with the RL value, as would be expected from temperature fluctuations, whereas the far-IR N abundance is too large to be explained by temperature fluctuations. A two-phase analytical model reveals that differential dust obscuration associated with temperature inhomogeneity is likely required to explain all the emission line ratios, and that the total oxygen metallicity of two phases is consistent with the RL metallicity. Our findings underscore the critical importance of resolving the cause of abundance discrepancies and understanding the biases between different metallicity methods.

Strong gravitational lensing offers a unique probe of the SHMR at sub-galactic scales and cosmological distances, as the masses of subhalos within the main lens can be inferred from the perturbations they imprint on lensed images. Anticipating the discovery of $\sim10^5$ galaxy–galaxy strong lenses by forthcoming facilities such as \textit{Euclid}, we perform an end-to-end simulation to forecast \textit{Euclid}'s constraints on the SHMR at the halo mass scale of $\sim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We generate mock \textit{Euclid} VIS images of lens systems hosting a fiducial $3\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ subhalo and vary its properties to assess the robustness of mass inference. We find that \textit{Euclid}'s angular resolution cannot break the intrinsic mass–concentration degeneracy of subhaloes, nor deblend the light of satellite galaxies (when present) associated with them, leading to biased inferred halo masses. These limitations are overcome with high-resolution follow-up imaging from facilities such as the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope}, enabling accurate halo-mass measurements. We forecast that a statistical sample of $\sim100$ such systems, combining lensing-derived halo masses with stellar masses from photometric SED fitting, can constrain the SHMR at dwarf-galaxy scales with a precision of $\sim0.05$ dex in halo mass and $\sim0.03$ dex in stellar mass, enabling powerful tests of galaxy formation theories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chemical Signatures of Population III Stars in Damped Lyman-$α$ Absorption Systems at $z \approx 6$</a><span class="id">[2506.14482]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, Sodini et al.

These Pop III DLA predictions are the first to include a number of important physical effects such as Lyman-Werner (LW) feedback, reionization, and external metal enrichment (all of which account for three-dimensional spatial fluctuations caused by halo clustering). We predict the abundance of DLAs as a function of their carbon-to-oxygen ratios ([C/O]). We find that our fiducial model is strongly ruled out by the data as it contains too few high-[C/O] DLAs, which have metals primarily from Pop III stars. However, increasing the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation due to supernovae feedback leads to better agreement with the data. Our results suggest that DLA analogs at $z\sim6$ are a promising probe of Pop III star formation for two key reasons. First, for reasonable parameter choices there are significant numbers of DLAs with metals primarily originating from Pop III stars. Second, we find that the number of DLAs with substantial Pop III contributions depends strongly on the Pop III star formation efficiency and the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Low Mass Dwarf Host Galaxy of Non-Repeating FRB 20230708A</a><span class="id">[2506.20774]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Very Large Telescope/X-Shooter spectroscopy for the host galaxies of 12 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) observed through the ESO Large Programme &quot;FURBY&quot;, which imposes strict selection criteria on the included FRBs and their host galaxies to produce a homogeneous and well-defined sample. We describe the data reduction and analysis of these spectra and report their redshifts, line-emission fluxes, and derived host properties. From the present sample, this paper focuses on the faint host of FRB ($m_R = 22.53 \pm 0.02$) identified at low redshift ($z=0.1050$). This indicates an intrinsically very low-luminosity galaxy ($L \approx 10^8 L_\odot$), making it the lowest-luminosity non-repeating FRB host to date by a factor of $\sim 3$, and slightly dimmer than the lowest-luminosity host for repeating FRBs. Our SED fitting analysis reveals a low stellar mass ($M_* \approx 10^{8.0} M_\odot$), low star formation rate (${\rm SFR} \approx 0.04 M_\odot \rm yr^{-1}$), and very low metallicity ($12+\log(\text{O}/\text{H})\sim(8.0-8.3)$), distinct from the more massive galaxies ($\log(M/M_\odot) \sim 10$) that are commonly identified for non-repeating FRBs. Its discovery demonstrates that FRBs can arise in among the faintest, metal-poor galaxies of the universe. In turn, this suggests that at least one FRB progenitor channel must include stars (or their remnants) created in very low metallicity environments. This indicates better prospects for detecting FRBs from the high-$z$ universe where young, low-mass galaxies proliferate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17447" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C-MetaLL) survey: IX.

Our goal is to derive updated period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relations using the largest and most homogeneous metallicity sample ever used for such analyses, covering a range of $-1.3&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;+0.3$ dex. We computed several optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitudes using 275 DCEPs with reliable parallaxes, by applying a robust photometric parallax technique, which simultaneously fits all parameters – including the global Gaia parallax counter-correction – and handles outliers without data rejection. We find a stronger metallicity dependence ($\gamma \approx -0.5$ mag/dex in optical, $-0.4$ mag/dex in NIR) than recent literature reports. Gaia parallax zero-point conter-corrections ($\epsilon$) vary smoothly across bands, with an average value of $\sim$10 $\mu$as, aligning with previous determinations. Applying our PWZ relations to LMC Cepheids yields distances generally consistent within $1\sigma$ with geometric estimates. The choice of reddening law has a negligible impact, while using only fundamental-mode pulsators significantly increases the uncertainties. Including $\alpha$-element corrections increases $|\gamma|$ and reduces $\epsilon$. However, we find statistically consistent $\gamma$ values with the literature, particularly for the key Wesenheit magnitude in the HST bands, by restricting the sample to the brighter (i.e. closer) objects, or by including only pulsators with $-0.7&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;$0.2 dex. Our results hint at a large $\gamma$ or a non-linear dependence on metallicity of DCEP luminosities at the metal-poor end, which is difficult to quantify with the precision of parallaxes of the present dataset.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The COLIBRE project: cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution</a><span class="id">[2508.21126]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the COLIBRE galaxy formation model and the COLIBRE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. COLIBRE includes new models for radiative cooling, dust grains, star formation, stellar mass loss, turbulent diffusion, pre-supernova stellar feedback, supernova feedback, supermassive black holes and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The multiphase interstellar medium is explicitly modelled without a pressure floor. Hydrogen and helium are tracked in non-equilibrium, with their contributions to the free electron density included in metal-line cooling calculations. The chemical network is coupled to a dust model that tracks three grain species and two grain sizes. In addition to the fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback, a subset of simulations uses black hole spin-dependent hybrid jet/thermal AGN feedback. To suppress spurious transfer of energy from dark matter to stars, dark matter is supersampled by a factor 4, yielding similar dark matter and baryonic particle masses. The subgrid feedback model is calibrated to match the observed $z \approx 0$ galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes, and black hole masses in massive galaxies. The COLIBRE suite includes three resolutions, with particle masses of $\sim 10^5$, $10^6$, and $10^7\,\text{M}_\odot$ in cubic volumes of up to 100, 200, and 400 cMpc on a side, respectively. The largest runs use 136 billion ($5 \times 3008^3$) particles. We describe the model, assess its strengths and limitations, and present both visual impressions and quantitative results. Comparisons with various low-redshift galaxy observations generally show very good numerical convergence and excellent agreement with the data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Hernquist dark matter with black hole shadows: A comprehensive study of various accretions</a><span class="id">[2509.11245]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The shadow of a black hole is critically dependent on the surrounding accreting matter. We investigate the observational signatures of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo under three distinct accretion scenarios: a geometrically thin disk, a static spherical flow, and an infalling spherical flow. For the thin disk model, we find that direct emission dominates the total observed intensity, while the size and brightness of the lensing and photon rings serve as sensitive probes of the Hernquist DM parameters. Under spherical accretion, the Hernquist DM halo significantly enlarges the photon sphere. This results in an observable shadow that is approximately $2\%$ to $30\%$ larger than in the vacuum case, though this increase in size is accompanied by a considerable decrease in overall image brightness. Furthermore, the Doppler de-boosting effect in the infalling scenario produces a markedly darker image than its static counterpart. Our results demonstrate that the size and brightness profile of a black hole shadow provide a powerful observational tool to probe and constrain the distribution of dark matter in galactic centers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Metallicity Dependence of PAH Emission in Galaxies II: Insights from JWST/NIRCam Imaging of the Smallest Dust Grains in M101</a><span class="id">[2509.18347]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the physical origins of the observed deficit of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at sub-solar metallicity using JWST/NIRCam imaging of the nearby galaxy M101, covering regions from solar metallicity (Z$_{\odot}$) down to 0.4 Z$_{\odot}$. These maps are used to trace the radial evolution of the shortest-wavelength PAH feature at 3.3 $\mu$m, which is emitted preferentially by the smallest PAHs ($&lt;100$ carbon atoms). The fractional contribution of PAH 3.3 $\mu$m to the total PAH luminosity ($\Sigma$PAH) increases by 3x as metallicity declines, rising from $\sim$1$\%$ to $\sim$3$\%$ over the observed range, consistent with prior predictions from the inhibited grain growth model based on Spitzer spectroscopy. We explore model refinements including photon effects and alternative size evolution prescriptions, and find that a modest amount of small grain photo-destruction remains possible, provided the grain size cutoff does not exceed $\sim55$ carbon atoms. The best-fit models predict 3.3 $\mu$m/$\Sigma$PAH will rise to $\sim5.6-7.7\%$ at 10$\%$ Z$_{\odot}$. Surprisingly, even as $\Sigma$PAH drops significantly relative to the total infrared luminosity (TIR) as metallicity declines, 3.3 $\mu$m/TIR alone rises, potentially indicating the mass fraction of the smallest PAH grains increases as the total dust content in galaxies drops. The current model cannot fully reproduce this trend even if the unusually strong effects of changing radiation field hardness on 3.3 $\mu$m/TIR are included. This may be evidence that the smallest PAHs are uniquely robust against destruction and inhibited growth effects. These results highlight the pivotal role that short-wavelength PAH emission can play in studies of low-metallicity and high-redshift galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CROCODILE-DWARF: Assembly and Kinematics of Field Dwarf Galaxies with GADGET4-OSAKA</a><span class="id">[2510.26513]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from CROCODILE-DWARF, a new suite of cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of isolated field dwarf galaxies with halo masses of $\sim10^{10}\,M_\odot$ at $z=0$, performed with the GADGET4-Osaka code. The simulations include detailed modeling of star formation, chemical enrichment, and supernova feedback using the CELib and Grackle libraries, achieving baryonic resolutions of $\sim2\times10^3\,M_\odot$. Our study focuses on how assembly history governs the structural and kinematic diversity of dwarf galaxies within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. The simulated galaxies reproduce the observed stellar-to-halo mass, mass–metallicity, and size–mass relations for nearby dwarf galaxies, including those of the Local Group, yielding stellar masses of $\sim10^7\,M_\odot$. The galaxies display a broad range of rotational support, where gas is generally more rotationally supported than stars. Differences in morphology and kinematics primarily reflect variations in halo assembly timescales and merger activity. Early-assembling, high-concentration halos form stars efficiently and become gas-poor by $z=0$, while late-assembling, low-concentration halos remain gas-rich due to delayed star formation and rejuvenated gas accretion. We find a trend between rotational support and the cumulative merger mass fraction, providing tentative evidence that dynamical heating induced by mergers plays a role in shaping the kinematic diversity. In some cases, late-time mergers induce the formation of extended gas disks by delivering fresh gas and angular momentum. These results demonstrate that it is assembly history, rather than halo mass alone, that shapes the present-day kinematic and morphological diversity of dwarf galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06123" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Damping of dynamical friction force in self-interacting ultralight dark matter and Fornax timing problem</a><span class="id">[2511.06123]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dynamics of globular clusters in the Fornax dwarf galaxy poses a challenge for the standard cold dark matter and can be used to test other models of dark matter. We study this dynamics in the context of ultralight bosonic dark matter model, accounting for the damping term in a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Employing analytic formulas for the dynamical friction force, the infall time and evolution of globular clusters are compared in the cases with and without the damping term. It is argued that the damping term plays an important role for the Fornax timing problem in ultralight dark matter (ULDM) models. In particular, the infall time of globular cluster GC3 can attain the required value, provided that ULDM is non-interacting or has a very small repulsive self-interaction. In the strongly-interacting ULDM, there is no solution for the required infall time for GC3 if its starting position is $r_0\lesssim 1.5$ kpc.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining properties of dust formed in Wolf-Rayet binary WR 112 using mid-infrared and millimeter observations</a><span class="id">[2511.19572]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binaries that host a carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC) star and an OB-type companion can be copious dust producers.

We present Band 6 observations of WR 112 by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope (ALMA), which are the first millimeter observations of a WC binary system capable of resolving its dust emission. By combining ALMA observations with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images, we were able to analyze the spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) of WR 112. We found that the SEDs are consistent with emissions from hydrogen-poor amorphous carbon grains. Notably, our results also suggest that the majority of grains in the system have radii below one micrometer, and the extended dust structures are dominated by nanometer-sized grains. Among four parameterizations of the grain radius distribution that we tested, a bimodal distribution, with abundant nanometer-sized grains and a secondary population of 0.1-micron grains, best reproduces the observed SED. This bimodal distribution helps to reconcile the previously conflicting grain size estimates reported for WR 112 and for other WC systems. We hypothesize that dust destruction mechanisms such as radiative torque disruption and radiative-driven sublimation are responsible for driving the system to the bimodal grain size distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metal-loaded outflows in sub-Milky Way galaxies in the CIELO simulations</a><span class="id">[2511.19630]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernova (SN) feedback-driven galactic outflows are a key physical process that contributes to the baryon cycle by regulating the star formation activity, reducing the amount of metals in low-mass galaxies and enriching the circumgalactic (CGM) and intergalactic media (IGM).

We studied 15 simulated central sub-MW galaxies (M* &lt;= 10^10 Msun) and intermediate-mass galaxies (M* \sim 10^10 Msun) from the CIELO-P7 high-resolution simulations. We followed the evolution of the progenitor galaxies, their properties and the characteristics of the outflows within the redshift range z = [0, 7]. We used two dynamically-motivated outflow definitions, unbound outflows and expelled mass rates, to quantify the impact of SN feedback. At z \sim 0, sub-MW galaxies have a larger fraction of their current oxygen mass in the gas phase but have expelled a greater portion beyond the virial radius, compared to their higher-mass counterparts. Galaxies with M* &lt;\sim 10^9 Msun have 10-40 per cent of their total oxygen mass within R200 in the CGM, and an equivalent to 10-60 per cent expelled into the IGM. In contrast, more massive galaxies have most of the oxygen mass locked by the stellar populations. The CGM of low-mass galaxies predominantly contains oxygen low-temperature gas, acting as a metal reservoir. We find that the outflows are more oxygen-rich for sub-MW galaxies, Zout/ZISM \sim 1.5, than for higher-mass galaxies, Zout/ZISM &lt;= 0.5, particularly for z &lt; 2.

Using wide-field imaging data from the DESI Legacy Survey combined with a color-magnitude matched-filter technique, we perform a systematic analysis of extra-tidal features in 28 Galactic globular clusters of likely extragalactic origin, representing the largest homogeneous sample examined in this context to date. The clusters display diverse morphologies: 12 exhibit tidal tails, 9 show diffuse envelopes, and 7 reveal no clear extra-tidal features. Notably, we report the first detection of an extended tidal structure around the Sagittarius-associated cluster Terzan 7. To explore the underlying drivers, we compare intrinsic properties, orbital dynamics, and possible accretion associations across morphological groups. From the parameter distributions, complemented by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we find that total mass, escape velocity, concentration, tidal filling factor, pericentric radius, eccentricity and radial angle in action-angle coordinates are all likely group-sensitive parameters. These results suggest that both internal cluster properties and orbital configurations play important roles in shaping extra-tidal morphologies. In addition, the cluster's accretion history shows no clear correlation with the presence of tidal features, indicating that it is not a direct driver of outer structure formation. Overall, the diversity of tidal structures is unlikely to be governed by a single factor, but instead reflects the interplay between internal dynamical evolution and the external Galactic environment. This study provides the most comprehensive constraints so far on the physical processes driving extra-tidal structures in accreted globular clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fading into darkness: A weak mass ejection and low-efficiency fallback accompanying black hole formation in M31-2014-DS1</a><span class="id">[2601.05774]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can form from the near-complete collapse of massive stars, causing them to abruptly disappear.

We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the remnant obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2024. The JWST MIRI/NIRSpec data reveal an extremely red source, showing strong blueshifted absorption from molecular gas (CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, SO$_2$) and deep silicate dust features. Modeling the dust continuum confirms continued bolometric fading of the central source to $\log(L/L_\odot)\approx3.88$ ($\approx7-8$% of the progenitor luminosity), surrounded by a dust shell spanning $\approx40-200$ au. Modeling of the molecular gas indicates $\sim 0.1$ M$_\odot$ of gas expanding at $\approx 100$ km s$^{-1}$ near the inner edge of the dust shell. No X-ray source is detected down to a luminosity limit of $L_X\lesssim1.5\times10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We show that the panchromatic observations are explained by (i) a low-energy ($\approx10^{46}$ erg) ejection of the outer H-rich progenitor envelope and (ii) a fading central BH powered by inefficient ($\sim0.1$% in mass) accretion of loosely bound fallback material.

We confirm that the PPC of 3I/ATLAS differs significantly from those of typical Solar System comets, showing an unusually large polarization amplitude. This PPC shows no significant change in the RC band across perihelion passage, despite the perihelion lying within the water snow line. This indicates that the unusual polarimetric behavior of 3I/ATLAS is unlikely to be driven by transient volatile activity, but instead reflects intrinsic optical properties of refractory dust particles. The PCC increases with wavelength over 0.6-1.2 {\mu}m and peaks at 1.5-2.0 {\mu}m, suggesting that the dominant scattering units are dust aggregates composed of submicron-sized monomers, broadly consistent with interstellar dust and solar-system cometary aggregates. Taken together, our results indicate that 3I/ATLAS preserves polarimetric properties characteristic of a primitive cometary planetesimal formed in another planetary system, with a refractory dust composition that differs from that typically observed among Solar System comets, despite sharing a similar size scale of the aggregate building blocks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Characteristic Mass and Energy Conversion Efficiency in the Cusp-Core Transition of Dark Matter Haloes: Implications for Scaling Relations and Supernova feedbacks</a><span class="id">[2601.13868]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxies in the nearby Universe, particularly dwarf systems, exhibit inner mass profiles of dark matter haloes that systematically depart from canonical cold dark matter expectations, signalling an interplay between baryonic feedback and the collisionless halo. We update an analytical cusp-core transition model by incorporating the effect of supernova-driven mass loss. Adapting this model to SPARC galaxies, we measure the energy conversion efficiency epsilon, defined as the fraction of supernova feedback energy that is used to change the central dark-matter potential. We find epsilon   0.01 for nearby SPARC galaxies. Building on these measurements, we compare the dynamical energy required for a cusp-core transformation with the feedback energy available over burst cycles and identify a cusp-core transition forbidden region on the halo-stellar mass plane where transformation cannot occur. Galaxies with halo masses from 10^8 to 10^11 M_sun lie outside the forbidden region, whereas ultra-faint dwarf galaxies &lt; 10^8 M_sun, galaxy groups and clusters &gt; 10^11 M_sun fall within it, consistent with their high central densities and the inefficiency of core formation at very low and very high masses. This approach also explains the observed diversity of inner density profiles in low-mass systems, showing that both the star formation rate and the energy conversion efficiency govern them, with the latter emerging as a key parameter setting the strength of the cusp-core transition. Beyond the cusp-core problem, our observationally inferred energy conversion efficiency provides a model independent benchmark that strongly constrains galaxy formation models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12355" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Precursors in tidal disruption events: repeating, fast, and AGN-hosted TDEs</a><span class="id">[2602.12355]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context.

We aim to build and study the first sample of precursor TDEs in order to improve our understanding of these features, which could be key to revealing the origin of the optical emission in TDEs. Methods. We compiled all known precursor TDEs from the literature, searched for additional candidates, and analyzed them as a sample. Results. We find that precursor TDEs predominantly fall within the repeating TDE, fast TDE, and TDE in active galactic nucleus (AGN) subclasses. We reveal a positive correlation between the occurrence time of the precursors relative to the main peak and the central black hole mass. Conclusions. We suggest that the precursors appear due to interactions between the incoming stellar debris and the disk or leftover material from an earlier disruption (repeating and fast TDEs) or a stable pre-existing disk (TDEs in AGNs). Precursors are therefore potentially key signatures of repeating partial TDEs in previously quiescent galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infrared spectra of methane-containing ice mixtures for JWST data analyses</a><span class="id">[2602.14604]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Solid methane (CH$_4$) is an important molecule in interstellar and planetary environments, serving as a precursor to complex organic compounds, and it is a potential biosignature in exoplanetary studies. Despite its significance, laboratory data on the low temperature phase of methane below 10 K remain limited. Aims. We obtained spectra of methane in binary mixtures at 10 K and compared them to the spectra obtained at 6.7 K. These temperatures correspond to phases II and II* of pure methane and are representative of dark molecular clouds and protostars in early stages. We also tested whether the data we obtained can be applied to interpret JWST data. Methods. Laboratory reference spectra were obtained with the ISEAge setup via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in transmission mode. A weighted $\chi^2$ minimization was used for the fitting. Results. We present infrared spectra with corresponding band strengths of pure methane and binary mixtures with methane: CH$_4$:H$_2$O, CH$_4$:CO$_2$, CH$_4$:CH$_3$OH, and CH$_4$:NH$_3$ at 6.7 K and 10 K. They show an increase of 20% in mixtures compared to the commonly used 10 K band strength value of pure methane. We also tested whether the spectra can be used on open JWST data by probing the spatial distribution of methane in B335. We also present additional experiments concerning the phase transition of methane between phase II* and phase II. Conclusions. Our results reveal distinct spectral features for methane in non-H$_2$O environments that enable a more accurate interpretation of JWST observations.

Here, we explore the possibility that these sources are globular clusters in formation, with rest-frame UV arising from a very young stellar population and rest-frame optical from a short-lived supermassive ($&gt;10^4$ M$_\odot$) star. The spectral profiles of LRDs are broadly consistent with this scenario, though the observed temperatures and bolometric luminosities favor emission reprocessed by optically thick, continuum-driven winds not fully captured by current models. The LRD $z\sim5-7$ UV luminosity function naturally evolves, under standard evolutionary and mass-loss prescriptions, into a present-day mass function with a turnover at $\log_{10}(M_\ast$/$M_\odot)=5.3$ and an exponential cutoff at high masses, consistent with local globular-cluster populations. We estimate the total present-day number density of LRDs formed across all redshifts to be $\approx0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, similar to local globular clusters. The observed LRD redshift range matches the age distribution of metal-poor globular clusters, without current LRD counterparts to the metal-rich population. If LRDs are globular clusters in formation, we predict chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations, including enhanced He and N, and potential Na-O and Al-Mg anti-correlations. These results offer a local perspective to explore this surprisingly abundant population of distant sources, and a potential new window into extreme stellar astrophysics in the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The measurable impact of the 2pN spin-dependent accelerations on the jet precession of M87$^\ast$</a><span class="id">[2602.10311]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Motivated by recent accurate measurements of disk/jet coprecessions around some galactic supermassive black holes, the accelerations experienced by an uncharged, spinless object in the Kerr metric, written in harmonic coordinates, are analytically calculated up to the formal second post-Newtonian order. To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable. Allowed domains in the parameter space of the jet precession around M87$^\ast$ are displayed.</p></div></details></article>

This protection allows them to survive long enough for autocatalytic replication of amphiphiles and for mutation and selection of assemblies that maximize membrane stability. For liposomes to fuse, grow, exchange contents and membranes, and divide, they need to establish a population, which means forming a dense conglomerate that enables close physical contact.

Extracting this information with standard hierarchical methods is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the problem and the computational cost of global-fit analyses. We present a simulation-based inference framework to measure the population properties of galactic binaries directly from the reconstructed foreground. Adopting an astrophysically agnostic parametrization in the observable space – defined by signal amplitude, frequency, and frequency derivative – we generate synthetic catalogs and foreground spectra using a global-fit-inspired subtraction algorithm. We then train a neural posterior estimator to map spectra to population parameters. We validate our method on simulated data and recover population parameters with good accuracy, including the total number of binaries. As a by-product, we present a GPU-accelerated version of the subtraction algorithm, which delivers a  100X speed-up compared to previous implementations in the literature. Our results demonstrate that LISA's stochastic foreground alone carries significant information about the Galactic binary population and provide a practical step toward joint inference from resolved and unresolved sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Impact of Degraded Charge Transfer Efficiency on Extended Sources in ACS/WFC</a><span class="id">[2602.18605]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using repeat imaging of a galaxy cluster taken over a seventeen-year baseline, we examine the impact that degraded Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) has on photometric measurements of extended sources using the ACS/WFC on HST. We examine how measured brightnesses depend on time since ACS installation, source location on the WFC detectors, source brightness, and local background level in individual exposures. We find that global brightness measurements using large apertures are generally reliable within $\sim$0.05 magnitudes across the WFC detectors if exposure backgrounds are above $20e^-/{pixel}$ and sources are brighter than $\sim300e^-$ in a single exposure. However, brightness measurements on smaller scales can suffer deficiencies in excess of 0.1 mags (sometimes, significantly more) in recent data unless sources are very close to the CCD serial registers ($\lesssim 512$ pixels), or brighter than $\sim3000\,e^-$ in a single exposure. We also show how degraded CTE can result in artificial asymmetries in galaxy light distributions, which are largely mitigated if backgrounds are $&gt;20e^-/{pixel}$ and targets are not far ($&gt;1536$ pixels) from the serial registers. As expected, brightness measurements in later epoch data are best when using CTE-corrected images (FLC/DRC), but our results imply that the pixel-based CTE correction algorithm employed by the ACS reduction pipeline does not necessarily place charge back into its original location within extended sources. Based on this study, users are advised to keep backgrounds above the already recommended $30e^-/\mathrm{pixel}$, ensure targets will have at least $\sim 300e^-$ in a single exposure, and place targets close to the serial registers if analysis of their spatially resolved properties is needed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18754" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variable Red Giants Exploration with MASTER Robotic Net: Main Algorithms and Study of Three Mira-type Targets</a><span class="id">[2602.18754]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We are discussing the capabilities of MASTER network of robotic telescopes to study variable red giant stars.

The WVR is intended to decrease calibration overheads for tropospheric phase correction for the high frequency bands (5 &amp; 6; 30.5-116 GHz) to levels lower than feasible with fast switched reference gain calibration. In this memo, we present an alternative concept utilizing the standard Band-4 science receivers and the main antennas. This would require the Band-4 feed to be placed between those of Bands 5 &amp; 6 resulting in a beam offset of 0.8 deg, similar to the beam size of the standalone 1.5 m antenna. The main benefits of the Band-4 WVR concept are: (1) sensing water vapor in a region more representative of the Band 5 &amp; 6 science beams in the lower layers of the troposphere, in the near-field of the 18 m antenna, than the 1.5 m antenna (2) significantly relaxing the stability requirements due to the lower receiver temperature of the standard Band-4 cryogenic receiver and (3) eliminating the procurement, deployment, and maintenance of a large number of standalone units. Given these advantages, it is recommended that the details and the pros and cons of Band-4 WVR implementation compared a standalone system be carefully considered.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tempawral: A Time-Resolved Retrieval Framework for Variable Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2602.18984]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Brown dwarfs and exoplanets are thought to host complex atmospheric phenomena such as clouds, storms, and chemical heterogeneity, akin to weather patterns on Earth. These features can produce pronounced spectral variability. Time-variability monitoring provides a unique window into surface inhomogeneities that cannot be directly resolved with foreseeable imaging technology. Current time-series analysis techniques have provided qualitative constraints on variability mechanisms but lack the ability to quantitatively estimate the extent of variation on atmospheric properties. We present Tempawral, the first data-driven time-resolved atmospheric retrieval framework that quantitatively retrieving variability in atmospheric parameters via an eigen-spectra inversion technique, leveraging the full spectra dataset. We validate this method on simulated time-series spectra of a variable brown dwarf, demonstrating that it successfully recovers key variability drivers, including inhomogeneous cloud coverage, evolving chemical abundances, and changes in temperature structure. We further showcase the utility of Tempawral by applying it to JWST/NIRISS-SOSS time-series observations of a highly variable T2.5 brown dwarf. The observed variability is best explained by a $\sim$300 K temperature perturbation near the 1-bar, accompanied by variations in the abundances of $\rm H_{2}O$, $\rm CO$, $\rm FeH$, as well as changes in the thickness of the iron cloud deck. This work provides a generalized framework for time-resolved atmospheric retrievals in the JWST era, enabling comprehensive interpretations of dynamic atmospheric processes in substellar objects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astrometric properties of reference frame sources as a function of redshift</a><span class="id">[2602.19135]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Previous studies based on the latest realisation of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3) have suggested a correlation between astrometric properties (such as the radio-optical offset) and redshift for active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We extend these investigations by using a large, all-sky sample of approximately 22,000 compact radio sources from the Radio Fundamental catalogue (RFC) to examine this relationship in a systematic and statistically robust manner. We compiled redshifts for about 10,000 RFC sources over the range 0 &lt; z &lt; 5 by combining data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17/19 with additional datasets from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. Cross-matching with Gaia Data Release 3 yielded a clean sample of 4,068 RFC objects with reliable spectroscopic redshifts and classifications (galaxies and quasi-stellar objects; QSOs). We analysed the redshift dependence of their radio astrometric properties from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) and their optical astrometric properties from Gaia. We find that the VLBI astrometric properties show no significant dependence on redshift within the achieved level of precision. In contrast, several optical astrometric quantities exhibit clear redshift-dependent behaviour. The median absolute radio-optical offsets decrease markedly over 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.5, where galaxies dominate the sample, decline more gradually over 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.3, and exhibit a mild increase at z &gt; 1.3, where QSOs dominate. Similar behaviour is observed for several Gaia astrometric quantities, including astrometric uncertainties, proper motions, and G magnitudes. These behaviours can be largely explained by the dependence of Gaia astrometric performance on G magnitude and by the evolution of the G magnitude with redshift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19286" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Safety Acquisitions: Redundancy for non-repeatable multi-orbit STIS visits</a><span class="id">[2602.19286]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For observations of supernovae, kilonovae, tidal disruption events, and other non-repeatable observations, it is important the science data is taken successfully within a specific time window. Part of obtaining that data is often centering objects in the aperture to a higher accuracy than is available from Hubble Space Telescope's (HST's) blind pointing. On HST STIS the sequence of exposures responsible for this centering is the target acquisition or STIS ACQ sequence, and it is most often placed only at the beginning of a visit. Unfortunately, STIS ACQ sequences will fail if the observatory experiences issues locating guide stars in time for the start of the required exposures. If the guide stars are located at a later point in the visit, the remaining science exposures can be taken but the pointing might not be as accurate as is required. This work discusses both the frequency of this issue and the feasibility of placing redundant or &quot;safety&quot; STIS ACQ sequences in a multi-orbit visit to regain the desired pointing accuracy in an affected visit. To do so we select a subset of all 113 STIS ACQ sequences from September 2018 to September 2023 which have experienced this issue. We find that this problem occurs in  5% of the total STIS ACQ sequences taken during that time period, with a recent increase in the rate to  9% from March to September 2023. Since the observatory goes through periods of better or worse pointing performance, this recent increased failure rate is not guaranteed to continue. For those failed visits which span multiple orbits,  39% never obtain a lock on the guide stars and thus take no data. Of the multi-orbit visits that do recover the guide stars, the majority ( 78%) do so before the beginning of science exposures in the second orbit. We also provide advice for users on how to make a risk assessment based on the analysis presented here.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19447" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photometry of Fireballs using High Frame Rate Cameras</a><span class="id">[2602.19447]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast sampling photometry is essential for characterising fireballs and their fragmentation episodes which link to the meteoroid internal structure. Accurate measurements remain challenging due to the large required dynamic range of up to 10 stellar magnitudes driving up operational complexity and cost. We developed an all-sky camera system operating at up to 500 frames per second featuring a novel Detection Localised Auto-brightness Control. Custom software manages high data throughput via transient detection and region-of-interest saving with real-time photometry. Two field deployments validate photometric accuracy against conventional 30 frames per second cameras and demonstrate the successful capture of a bright magnitude -15 fireball with minimal saturation. The system achieves an effective dynamic range between apparent magnitudes -3 and -17 capturing minimally saturated light curves for most fireballs. A successful semi-empirical fragmentation analysis verifies its ability to provide data for detailed physical modelling. The primary application for this validated system will be as a core component of the Global Fireball Observatory's next-generation instrumentation. The intention is to deploy it in a hybrid observatory, operating alongside a dedicated high-resolution astrometric camera. This configuration will allow the network to simultaneously capture precise trajectory data for orbit and fall-line calculations and acquire complete, unsaturated high dynamic range light curves at high temporal resolution for detailed physical analysis, combining the strengths of both systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exo Skryer: A JAX-accelerated sub-stellar atmospheric retrieval framework</a><span class="id">[2602.19687]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Contemporary exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheric research relies heavily on retrieval frameworks to recover thermal and chemical properties and perform model comparison in an observational data-driven approach.

In addition, I present a new method to directly retrieve the real and imaginary optical constants (n, k) of suspected aerosol infrared absorption features.

SiPMs exhibit comparable or even higher photon detection efficiencies (PDEs) than PMTs. The sensitivity of a PMT matches well the spectral shape of Cherenkov radiation from extended air showers. In contrast to a PMT, the sensitivity of a SiPM is shifted toward longer wavelengths, where the intensity of light of night sky (LoNS), considered as unwanted noise, increases significantly. It is obvious that a SiPM with a higher PDE will indeed measure more Cherenkov light than a PMT, but it will also detect significantly higher LoNS noise; the question is which factor will predominate in the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). To compare the performance of a PMT with that of a SiPM, we built SiPM-based modules and installed these and operated in parallel in the imaging camera of the 17 m diameter MAGIC telescope. Our long-term studies show that SiPM, despite their higher PDE, can deliver only a comparable to PMT performance. As already the name SiPM suggests, we use these semiconductor sensors analogously to classical PMTs: We amplify their small signals, digitize, and calibrate the converted amplitudes. Although SiPM is essentially a digital sensor, its common-anode design does not allow one to directly profit from it. Numerous arrays of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are being developed in various laboratories worldwide. Unlike SiPM, SPAD arrays digitize the incident photons from the outset and count their number. We will dwell on the potential further developments of SPADs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Bayesian Method for Air-Shower Reconstruction using Information Field Theory</a><span class="id">[2602.19864]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The radio detection of extensive air showers provides a powerful method for studying the origin of high-energy cosmic rays.

Our method is built on a fully differentiable forward model of the radio signal, which incorporates a physical emission parameterization and a precise wavefront model. Additionally, we augment this physical model with Gaussian processes to account for systematic uncertainties in both the signal fluence and arrival timing. By leveraging gradient information, our approach enables efficient (three orders of magnitude acceleration w.r.t.\ the legacy method) and robust inference of the underlying physical shower parameters, such as primary energy and the depth of shower maximum, $X_\text{max}$. This work provides not only point estimates but also a rigorous quantification of uncertainties.

After data cleaning, resampling, feature selection, and correlation analysis, the dataset was segmented into fixed-length intervals, in which the first I samples represented the input sequence provided to the model, while the forecast length, T, indicated the number of future time steps to be predicted. A sliding-window technique was then applied to increase the number of intervals. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was trained to perform multivariate forecasting across all features simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD), and it was also benchmarked against a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The MLP model demonstrated consistent results across different features and I-T configurations, and matched the performance of the LSTM while converging faster. It achieved an MSE of 0.019+/-0.003 and an NMAD of 0.032+/-0.009 on the test set under its best configuration (4 hidden layers, 720 units per layer, and I-T lengths of 300 samples each, corresponding to 5 hours at 1-minute resolution). Extending the forecast horizon up to 6.5 hours-the maximum allowed by this configuration-did not degrade performance, confirming the model's effectiveness in providing reliable hour-scale predictions. The proposed NBM provides a powerful tool for enabling early anomaly detection in online ASTRI-Horn monitoring time series, offering a basis for the future development of a prognostics and health management system that supports predictive maintenance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HelioSpectrotron 5000: An Interactive Multi-Resolution Solar Spectral Atlas</a><span class="id">[2602.20101]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>HelioSpectrotron 5000 (HS5000) is an interactive, multi-resolution solar spectral atlas designed to facilitate direct comparison between high-resolution reference spectra and observations obtained with a wide range of ground-based instruments.

In this work, we resolve this issue by optimizing the geometrical configuration of a torque-coupled gravity field calibrator (GCal), achieving an improvement in calibration-line SNR by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional layouts. For the Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed-meter (CHRONOS), the calibration signal appears as a monochromatic line within the $0.1$–$10~\mathrm{Hz}$ band. At $1~\mathrm{Hz}$, the strain-equivalent calibration amplitude reaches $|h_{\rm GCal}| = 1.18 \times 10^{-14}$, corresponding to an SNR density of $|h_{\rm GCal}|/S_h = 4.25 \times 10^{3}$. This demonstrates for the first time that a high-SNR calibration line can be directly injected into the sub-Hz band of a torsion-bar detector. A first-order perturbative error propagation analysis yields a total fractional systematic uncertainty of $\delta h_{\rm GCal}/h_{\rm GCal} = 0.24\%$, dominated by geometric alignment uncertainties, while contributions from mass uncertainties and the gravitational constant remain subdominant. The corresponding absolute systematic uncertainty is $\delta h_{\rm GCal} \sim 10^{-17}$ at $1~\mathrm{Hz}$. These results establish torque-coupled gravitational calibration as a practical solution to the longstanding low-SNR problem in sub-Hz torsion-bar detectors and provide a robust pathway toward precision absolute calibration in the low-frequency regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPU-Native Compressed Neighbor Lists with a Space-Filling-Curve Data Layout</a><span class="id">[2602.19873]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have developed a compressed neighbor list for short-range particle-particle interaction based on a space- filling curve (SFC) memory layout and particle clusters.

Simulating subsonic turbulence with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</a><span class="id">[2503.10273]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Direct numerical simulation of subsonic turbulence with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has traditionally been hampered by zeroth-order (E0) errors, inaccurate gradient evaluations, and excessive numerical dissipation. We demonstrate that the recently developed SPH-EXA code can overcome these challenges, producing results similar to those of other state-of-the-art non-SPH codes, such as AREPO and GIZMO. We show that SPH-EXA accurately reproduces the Kolmogorov inertial range scaling in the subsonic regime with increasing resolution, closely matching state-of-the-art non-SPH methods. This is an outstanding result given the important role of SPH codes in astrophysics and cosmology, and the ubiquity of turbulent phenomena.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post-glitch Recovery and the Neutron Star Structure: The Vela Pulsar</a><span class="id">[2506.02100]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed analysis of the Vela pulsar's rotational behaviour using approximately 100 months of observational data spanning from September 2016 to January 2025, during which four glitches were identified. Here, we demonstrate the post-glitch recovery of these glitches within the framework of the vortex creep model. We further present the investigation of vortex residuals (the discrepancy between observed values and those predicted by the vortex creep model) by interpreting them in the context of the vortex bending model. In addition, we report a positive correlation between the glitch magnitude and the time to the next glitch, applicable only for the large glitch events observed in the Vela pulsar. Furthermore, we estimate the braking index of the Vela pulsar to be 2.94 $\pm$ 0.55.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eccentric Disks With Self-Gravity</a><span class="id">[2510.12871]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Can a disk orbiting a central body be eccentric, when the disk feels its own self-gravity and is pressureless? Contradictory answers appear in the literature. We show that such a disk can be eccentric, but only if it has a sharply truncated edge: the surface density $\Sigma$ must vanish at the edge, and the $\Sigma$ profile must be sufficiently steep at the point where it vanishes. If either requirement is violated, an eccentric disturbance leaks out of the bulk of the disk into the low density edge region, and cannot return. An edge where $\Sigma$ asymptotes to zero but never vanishes, as is often assumed for astrophysical disks, is insufficiently sharp. Similar results were shown by Hunter &amp; Toomre (1969) for galactic warps. We demonstrate these results in three ways: by solving the eigenvalue equation for the eccentricity profile; by solving the initial value problem; and by analyzing a new and simple dispersion relation that is valid for any wavenumber, unlike WKB. As a byproduct, we show that softening the self-gravitational potential is not needed to model a flat disk, and we develop a softening-free algorithm to model the disk's Laplace-Lagrange-like equations. The algorithm is easy to implement and is more accurate than softening-based methods at a given resolution by many orders of magnitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04374" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Numerics of VMEC++</a><span class="id">[2502.04374]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>VMEC++ is a Python-friendly, from-scratch reimplementation in C++ of the Variational Moments Equilibrium Code (VMEC), a fixed- and free-boundary ideal-MHD equilibrium solver for stellarators and tokamaks. The first VMEC implementation was written by Steven P. Hirshman and colleagues in the 1980s and 1990s and its latest Fortran incarnation (PARVMEC, this https URL ) is widely used in stellarator optimization systems. Our work improves on previous implementations with regard to various critical aspects: special care has been put in providing an idiomatic Python experience, from installation to actual usage; VMEC++ has a zero-crash policy; it supports inputs in the classic INDATA format as well as friendlier JSON files. VMEC++ execution times are typically less than or equal to previous implementations, and time to convergence can be decreased dramatically by leveraging its hot-restart feature: by providing the output of a VMEC++ run as initial state for a subsequent one, VMEC++ is initialized using the previously converged equilibrium. This can dramatically decrease runtimes when running on many similar magnetic configurations as it typically happens in stellarator optimization pipelines. On the flip side, some features of the original Fortran VMEC implementation are not yet available in VMEC++, such as support for non-stellarator-symmetric configurations. This contribution presents the internal numerics of the open-source VMEC++ package publicly for the first time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optical design and sensitivity optimization of Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</a><span class="id">[2510.24780]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the optical design and sensitivity modeling of the 2.5 m Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), a triangular Sagnac speed-meter interferometer incorporating power- and signal-recycling techniques. Using ABCD-matrix analysis and Finesse3 simulations, we show that stable eigenmodes are obtained with optimized mirror curvatures and focal placements, achieving mode-matching efficiencies above 99.5 %. The resulting configuration reaches a quantum-noise-limited strain sensitivity of $h \simeq 3\times10^{-18},\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$ at 1 Hz, with a ring-cavity finesse $\mathcal{F}\simeq3.1\times10^{4}$ and round-trip Gouy phase $\psi_{\mathrm{rt}}\approx153^{\circ}$. The power-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_p=-85^{\circ}$) dominates the low-frequency quantum noise, while the signal-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_s=0^{\circ}$) mainly introduces a uniform quadrature rotation. The optimal homodyne angle ($\zeta_{\mathrm{opt}}\simeq46^{\circ}$) balances shot-noise and radiation-pressure effects to give the best sensitivity near 1 Hz. Assuming end-mirror reflectivity $R_{\mathrm{ETM}}=99.9999\%$ under cryogenic operation at 10 K, CHRONOS can achieve quantum-noise-limited performance on a laboratory scale and serve as a testbed for future long-baseline, cryogenic interferometers probing sub-hertz gravitational waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16297" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterization of an MPPC-Based Scintillator Telescope and Measurement of Cosmic Muon Angular Distribution</a><span class="id">[2602.16297]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This report presents the design, characterization, and application of a high-sensitivity optical detection system based on plastic scintillators coupled to Multi-Pixel Photon Counters (MPPCs). The primary objective was to evaluate the performance of MPPCs (Silicon Photomultipliers) as robust, low-voltage alternatives to traditional photomultiplier tubes for detecting faint scintillation light. The optoelectronic properties of the sensors were analyzed, including single-photoelectron gain calibration and dark count rate measurements, to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. By embedding wavelength-shifting fibers to enhance light collection efficiency, the system was configured into a three-fold coincidence telescope. The angular distribution of the cosmic ray muon flux was measured to validate the detector's stability and geometric acceptance. Fitting the experimental data to a $\bm{\cos^n(\theta)}$ distribution yielded an angular exponent of $\bm{n = 1.44 \pm 0.06}$, consistent with literature values. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the MPPC-scintillator coupling for precise photon counting and timing applications in high-energy physics instrumentation.</p></div></details></article></body>
