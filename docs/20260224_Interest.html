<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Matter in Zwicky's Cosmology: Towards an Epistemological Reconstruction</a><span class="id">[2602.18475]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A new contextualised reading of Fritz Zwicky's 1933 article ”The redshift of extragalactic nebulae” about the virial analysis of the velocity dispersion of galaxies in the Coma cluster leads to a reconsideration of the traditional discourse on the introduction of dark matter. We argue that this component of matter was not only already on the stage of the scientific debates of the time, but also, in a more concealed form, played a central role in Zwicky's epistemic context. We thus reject the narration that dark matter is the result of a “na{ï}ve” astrophysical observation and emphasise the cosmological motivations that prompted Zwicky to presciently search for it. Moreover, with regard to its abundance, we argue that the discrepancy between the observed amount of luminous matter in the Coma Cluster and Zwicky's higher mass estimate derived from virial analysis was not, in fact, astonishing. What Zwicky described as a surprising excess of dark matter was of precisely the order of magnitude he had set out to identify. Consequently, we challenge the widespread view that dark matter was merely an ad hoc hypothesis introduced to rescue Newtonian theory. Instead, we suggest it may represent one of the earliest cosmological indications supporting a new emerging theory of gravitation: General Relativity. This reinterpretation contributes to ongoing debates in the philosophy of science concerning the epistemic status of ad hoc hypotheses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19364" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marking Noon: The Time Balls and Time Flaps of the Netherlands</a><span class="id">[2602.19364]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the nineteenth century, the Netherlands quickly adopted the time ball – a British innovation for maritime chronometer calibration – in its main naval ports (Nieuwediep/Den Helder, Vlissingen, Hellevoetsluis) and commercial centres (Amsterdam, Rotterdam). A large sphere dropped from a mast at a fixed time, the device enabled ships to verify their chronometers against a standard, essential for accurate longitude determination and safe navigation. Its ready acceptance was eased by indigenous Dutch traditions. Rural communities had long used visual time signals like the sjouw on Terschelling island, a wicker ball raised on a mast to mark the lunch hour and milking time for farmers, and the lawei, a basket or sack used in the peat bogs of Friesland to regulate labourers' hours. The Dutch time-signal system was distinguished by its strong institutional backing from the country's Royal Navy, its Hydrographic Service and by professional astronomers. Among the latter, Frederik Kaiser was a pivotal figure, vehemently defending the system's accuracy and pioneering technical improvements. He successfully advocated for replacing the traditional falling ball with a system of rotating flaps, which provided a more instantaneous and reliable visual signal. Beyond their practical role, time signals became civic spectacles and symbols of Dutch scientific modernity and imperial reach. Their decline began with the electric telegraph and was finalised by wireless radio, which allowed ships to calibrate chronometers at sea.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dutch Colonial Time: Time Signals in Paramaribo and the Dutch Caribbean</a><span class="id">[2602.19365]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the nineteenth century, the Dutch established time signals in their Atlantic colonies to synchronise maritime navigation with European standards. In Paramaribo (Suriname), a sophisticated sequence of apparatus – including time balls, noon guns, discs and flags – operated from 1851 until World War I. Naval officers aboard guard ships used sextants equipped with artificial horizons to determine local noon, thus integrating the colony into the global Greenwich-based cartographic system. This infrastructure was not merely technical; it became a civic ritual, with the daily noon gun structuring urban life and becoming a point of political negotiation between naval commanders and the colonial governor. In contrast, the Dutch Caribbean islands employed simpler, pragmatic systems. Curaçao used a daily time flag, a cost-effective solution suited to its climate and harbour scale, while smaller islands like Aruba and St. Eustatius relied on occasional noon guns. This diversity reflected a decentralised colonial administration that adapted technologies to local conditions and budgets. The history of these time signals reveals a process of hybrid adaptation, not simply replication of European models. They were shaped by environmental challenges, fiscal constraints and local politics, functioning simultaneously as navigational aids and civic landmarks. Their eventual decline, owing to budgetary pressures and new technologies like wireless telegraphy, underscores the fragile and negotiated nature of colonial scientific infrastructures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18641" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Category Mistake of Cislunar Time: Why NASA Cannot Synchronize What Doesn't Exist</a><span class="id">[2602.18641]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In April 2024, the White House directed NASA to establish Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC) by December 2026. The programme assumes that a unified time standard can be constructed by deploying atomic clocks on the lunar surface, computing relativistic corrections, and distributing synchronized time via LunaNet. This paper argues that the entire enterprise rests on a category mistake in the sense introduced by Ryle and developed by Spekkens in quantum foundations: it treats &quot;synchronized time&quot; as an ontic entity – something that exists independently and can be transmitted from authoritative sources to dependent receivers – when it is in fact an epistemic construct: a model-dependent representation of observer-relative clock relationships. We analyze the cislunar time programme through the lens of Forward-In-Time-Only (FITO) assumptions, Spekkens' Leibnizian operationalism, the Wood-Spekkens fine-tuning argument, and the distinction between ontic and epistemic interpretations that has dissolved long-standing puzzles in quantum mechanics. We show that the same conceptual move that dissolves quantum &quot;mysteries&quot; – recognizing what is epistemic versus what is ontic – dissolves the apparent coherence of the cislunar time programme and reveals it as an engineering project built on a philosophical confusion. We sketch a transactional alternative grounded in bilateral atomic interactions rather than unidirectional time distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The early history of symmetric teleparallel gravity: An overlooked period</a><span class="id">[2602.19194]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is noteworthy that symmetric teleparallel gravity has attracted considerable attention in recent years. A survey of the literature indicates that this surge of interest became particularly prominent around 2017 and 2018. However, together with my students and collaborators, we published a series of systematic and pioneering papers on this subject between 2004 and 2013. In this letter, we will summarize our overlooked contributions to symmetric teleparallel gravity produced during that period. For the sake of completeness and coherence, we will also briefly review our work on this topic carried out after 2018. In the final paragraph, we will write our personal perspectives on the future of symmetric teleparallel geometry.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curiosity Over Hype: Modeling Motivation Language to Understand Early Outcomes in a Selective Quantum Track</a><span class="id">[2602.19659]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study whether latent motivation signals in short Spanish admission responses predict engagement and performance in an early quantum computing pathway run by QuantumHub Peru. We analyze N=241 applicants' open responses and link them to outcomes from two selective modules: Module 1 (secondary; mathematics and computing foundations; n=23) and Module 2 (secondary + early undergraduate; quantum fundamentals; n=36, including M1 continuers). To ensure baseline comparability, the M2 university entrance exam matched the difficulty of the M1 final. Final grades followed the program's official cohort-specific weightings (attendance/assignments/exam), which we retain to preserve ecological validity. Methodologically, we model text with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA, k=8) and, for robustness, with sentence embeddings from a small multilingual language model, EmbeddingGemma-300M, projected via UMAP and clustered with HDBSCAN. This combination leverages the transparency of bag-of-words topics and the semantic richness of small language model embeddings. Descriptively, curiosity/learning topics show higher grades and attendance than technology/career-oriented topics; inferential tests are underpowered (e.g., linear R2   0.03; logistic pseudo-R2   0.04) so effect-size estimates should be viewed as preliminary rather than confirmatory. Embedding-based clustering yields seven clusters with 11.2% noise and modest agreement with LDA (ARI=0.068; NMI=0.163). Results suggest that brief motivation responses encode promising signals that could support early mentoring in rigorous STEM pipelines, while highlighting the need for larger, pre-registered studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12029" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sangkuriang: A pseudo-spectral Python library for Korteweg-de Vries soliton simulation</a><span class="id">[2601.12029]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</p></div></details></article></body>
