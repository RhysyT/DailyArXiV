Direct Formation of Gas Giants via Disk Fragmentation</a><span class="id">[2510.19915]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational instability (GI) has long been considered a viable pathway for giant planet formation in protoplanetary disks (PPDs), especially at wide orbital separations or around low-mass stars where core accretion faces significant challenges. However, a primary drawback is that disk fragmentation from GI was generally found to produce over-massive clumps, typically in the mass range of brown dwarfs, although most numerical studies adopted simplified cooling prescriptions or with limited numerical resolution. We conduct a suite of global three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations of self-gravitating PPDs using the meshless finite-mass (MFM) method. By implementing radiation transport via the M1 closure and systematically varying disk mass and opacity, we show that increasing disk mass and lowering opacity promote fragmentation by enhancing radiative cooling. Non-fragmenting disks settle into a gravito-turbulent state with low-order spiral structures and effective angular momentum transport characterized by $\alpha \sim \beta_\mathrm{cool}^{-1}$. In fragmenting disks, a subset of gravitationally bound clumps survives as long-lived fragments. Their initial masses form a consistent distribution around $\Sigma \cdot\lambda_\mathrm{T} \cdot 2 (c_s/\Omega_\mathrm{K})$ (with $\lambda_T$ the Toomre wavelength), corresponding to $\sim 0.3 - 10\,M_\mathrm{J}$ in our simulations, consistent with being gas giants. These results demonstrate that GI can produce planet-mass fragments under more realistic conditions, reinforcing it as a viable gas giant formation pathway and motivating further studies of fragment evolution and observational signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pristine ices in a planet-forming disk revealed by heavy water</a><span class="id">[2510.19919]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Water is essential to our understanding of the planet-formation process and habitability on Earth. Although trace amounts of water are seen across all phases of star and planet formation, the bulk of the water reservoir often goes undetected, hiding crucial parts of its journey from giant molecular clouds to planets. This raises the question of whether water molecules in comets and (exo-)planets is largely inherited from the interstellar medium or if the water molecules are destroyed and then reformed in the disk. Water isotopologue ratios involving doubly deuterated water (D$_2$O) are a sensitive tracer to answer this question. We present strong evidence of inheritance through an enhancement of D$_2$O in the outbursting V883 Ori disk. The high D$_2$O/H$_2$O ratio of $(3.2 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{-5}$ is consistent with values seen in protostellar envelopes and a comet and is two orders of magnitude higher than expected if water is reprocessed. The high deuteration of the heaviest isotopologues D$_2$O/HDO = $(2.3 \pm 1.0) \times $HDO/H$_2$O further establishes the inheritance of water. We conclude that water ice in disks originates from the earliest phases of star formation, providing the missing link between cold dark clouds and (exo-)comets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Determining the Hubble Constant through Cross-Correlation of Galaxies and Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2510.19931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens have the potential to measure the Hubble constant $H_0$ in the local universe independently of the distance ladder, and thus offer unique new insights into the Hubble tension. A key challenge with standard sirens is detecting their electromagnetic counterparts, and therefore assigning redshifts to the measured distances. One promising way to proceed is to utilize GW `dark sirens' – events without an identified electromagnetic counterpart – and cross-correlate their angular distribution with that of galaxies. We present a quantitative study of how precisely the Hubble constant can be measured using tomographic cross-correlation between galaxies and GW sources. Overall, we find that the constraints on $H_0$ will be limited by the quality and quantity of GW data. We find that percent-level constraints on $H_0$ will primarily depend on achieving small distance uncertainties ($\sigma_{d_L}=0.1\,d_L$), obtaining a large number of GW dark sirens ($\gtrsim$$5{,}000$), and accurate sky localization in the tomographic analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confirming the uniformity of the Hubble flow with Pantheon+ Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2510.19945]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>According to the perturbed Friedmann model, the difference between Hubble constant measurements in two rest frames, at leading order in velocity, is determined solely by the relative motion of the observers and remains unaffected by the peculiar velocities of the sources. This implies that, when averaging over a sufficiently large and distant set of sources where local nonlinear inhomogeneities are diminished, such a difference should vanish, so that the Hubble flow is statistically uniform, as predicted by the Cosmological Principle – a core assumption of the standard cosmological paradigm. In previous works, distance measurement compilations, e.g. the CosmicFlows-3 catalogue, were used for this purpose, as it comprises a large number ($\sim 10^4$) of sources of different types. Due to the increasing amount of precise luminosity distance measurements of Type Ia Supenovae (SNe) in the last few years, in this work we investigate whether we can confirm the uniformity of the Hubble flow with low-$z$ SN distances only. By means of the Pantheon+ and SH0ES compilation, we find that the results align well with previous works based on the CF3 catalogue, and are in good agreement with the expected Hubble variance in the standard model across cosmic scales of $20-150$ Mpc. Notably, the Hubble constant difference $\Delta H_0 \approx 0$ is observed at around $85$ Mpc. Despite the smaller sample size ($\sim 10^2$ versus $\sim 10^4$) relative to CF3 at those scales, our analysis show that the Pantheon+ and SH0ES dataset supports the standard model paradigm, which indicates that the Hubble flow becomes statistically uniform at around $70-100$ Mpc, which is compatible with independent determinations of the homogeneity scale based on galaxy number counts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of a Nearby Habitable Zone Super-Earth Candidate Amenable to Direct Imaging</a><span class="id">[2510.19956]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the discovery of GJ 251 c, a candidate super-Earth orbiting in the Habitable Zone (HZ) of its M dwarf host star. Using high-precision Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID RVs, in conjunction with archival RVs from the Keck I High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES), the Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with Near-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrograph (CARMENES), and the SPectropolarimètre InfraROUge (SPIRou), we improve the measured parameters of the known planet, GJ 251 b ($P_{b}$ = 14.2370 days; $m \sin(i)$ = 3.85$^{+0.35}_{-0.33}$ M$_{\oplus}$), and we significantly constrain the minimum mass of GJ 251 c, placing it in a plausibly terrestrial regime (P$_{c}$ = 53.647 $\pm$ 0.044 days; $ m \sin i_{c}$ = 3.84 $\pm$ 0.75 M$_{\oplus}$). Using activity mitigation techniques that leverage chromatic information content, we perform a color-dependent analysis of the system and a detailed comparison of more than 50 models that describe the nature of the planets and stellar activity in the system. Due to GJ 251's proximity to Earth (5.5 pc), next generation, thirty meter class telescopes will likely be able to image terrestrial planets in GJ 251's HZ. In fact, GJ 251 c is currently the best candidate for terrestrial, HZ planet imaging in the Northern Sky.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A comprehensive grid of massive binary evolution models for the Galaxy - Surface properties of post-mass transfer stars</a><span class="id">[2510.19965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive stars often evolve in binary systems, in which binary interactions significantly affect their evolution. Massive stars in the Galaxy serve as valuable testbeds for this due to their proximity. We computed the evolution of more than 38000 galactic binary systems with initial primary star masses of 5...100 Msun. In this paper, we aim to investigate the surface properties of post-mass transfer mass donor and mass gainer stars through core hydrogen burning, core helium burning, and for the pre-supernova stage. The models are computed with MESA, incorporating detailed stellar and binary physics, including internal differential rotation, magnetic angular momentum transport, mass-dependent overshooting, stellar wind mass-loss, mass and angular momentum transfer and tidal interaction. They incorporate a new extensive nuclear network for hydrogen burning, which allows us to track the full range of hydrogen burning nucleosynthesis products, from the light elements to aluminum. The widest, non-interacting binary models in our grid effectively serve as single star models. We find that mass gainers and mass donors may evolve through long-lived blue and yellow supergiant stages during core helium burning where single stars of the same mass remain red supergiants. Furthermore, some of our gainers evolve into more luminous yellow and blue supergiants prior to core collapse than single stars, while some donors end their life as red or yellow supergiants, showing a rich diversity in supernova progenitors. We show that the surface elemental and isotopic abundances carry valuable information about a star's evolutionary history and can be used to distinguish binary interaction products from single stars. Our binary model grid may serve as a tool for identifying post-mass transfer stars and supernovae, and holds potential for population studies, supernova modeling, and guidance of future observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19993" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic flux cancellation in the solar atmosphere through 3D realistic numerical modeling</a><span class="id">[2510.19993]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulation of a magnetic cancellation event. The model is calculated with the Bifrost code and spans from the uppermost convection zone to the corona. The cancellation occurs between the positive polarity of an emerged magnetic bipole and a preexisting negative polarity. We try both to understand the RMHD aspects as well as to carry out comparison to observations, in part via spectral synthesis of optically thick photospheric and chromospheric lines using the RH1.5D code, and optically thin coronal ones. The reconnection between the opposite flux systems takes place at chromospheric heights through a quasi-separatrix layer without null points. Sharp V-shaped upward-moving field lines and highly warped downward-moving post-reconnection loops are created. The chromospheric reconnection is in full swing when the colliding magnetic patches are still separated by a granular cell at the photosphere. In a later phase, photospheric cancellation takes place with submergence of the closed magnetic loops linking the opposite polarities. We carry out comparisons with the observations of the photospheric magnetic flux loss rates, as well as of the horizontal magnetic field and vertical velocity at the polarity inversion line. The reconnection outflows cause intensity brightenings, jets and different spectral features in the synthesized chromospheric spectral lines, strongly reminiscent of those found in recent observations. Coherent, twisted magnetic flux ropes are created by the flows associated with the process. Including coronal levels is crucial for proper modeling, even if no major ejection or brightening is produced in the corona in this event.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The late formation of chondrites as a consequence of Jupiter-induced gaps and rings</a><span class="id">[2510.19994]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The accretion ages of the first planetesimals-the parent bodies of magmatic iron meteorites-suggest they formed within the first 0.5-1 Myr of Solar System history. Yet, planetesimal formation appears to have occurred in at least two distinct phases. A temporal offset separates early-forming bodies from later-forming chondrite parent bodies, which accreted 2-3 Myr after the Solar System onset - an unresolved aspect of Solar System formation. Here we use numerical simulations to show that Jupiter's early formation reshaped its natal protoplanetary disk. Jupiter's rapid growth depleted the inner disk gas and generated pressure bumps and dust traps that manifested as rings. These structures caused dust to accumulate and led to a second-generation planetesimal population, with ages matching those of non-carbonaceous chondrites. Meanwhile, the evolving gas structure suppressed terrestrial embryos' inward migration, preventing them from reaching the innermost regions. Jupiter likely played a key role in shaping the inner Solar System, consistent with structures observed in Class II and transition disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of 79 $δ$ Scuti Stars in NGC 3532 Suggests a Decrease of Pulsator Occurrence with Age</a><span class="id">[2510.20048]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many A-F type stars do not display $\delta$ Scuti pulsations, despite being located within the instability strip. Open clusters provide a unique opportunity to study $\delta$ Scuti pulsations among coeval populations with uniform chemical composition. Here we use data from the TESS Mission to discover 79 $\delta$ Scuti pulsators in the 300 Myr old open cluster NGC 3532, the largest number found within a single open cluster to-date. We report a $50\pm5\%$ pulsator fraction in NGC 3532, considerably lower than in younger stellar populations, such the Pleiades (110 Myr), NGC 2516 (100 Myr), and the Cep-Her Complex ($\leq\,$80 Myr), and similar to the pulsator fraction found among field star samples. We introduce the concept of pulsator occurrence, which corrects for incompleteness, and find it to be $63\pm6\%$. For the stars that do pulsate, we find that the hotter stars occupy a distinct branch in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) due to faster rotation ($&gt;\,$150 km/s) than their non-pulsating counterparts. These results suggest that pulsator occurrence decreases with age and that rapid rotation is important in maintaining $\delta$ Scuti pulsations over time. We also investigate the Period-Luminosity (P-L) relation and the $\nu_{\rm max}$–$T_{\rm eff}$ relation of $\delta$ Scuti stars in NGC 3532. We find much scatter in the P-L relation of the dominant mode and two distinct branches in the $\nu_{\rm max}$–$T_{\rm eff}$ relation, similar to the Cep-Her Complex.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of the nuclear equation of state on the explodability of massive stars</a><span class="id">[2510.20076]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In recent years, astrophysical observations have placed tight constraints on key properties of the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Using 45 two-dimensional simulations for three different EoS compatible with the current tight constraints, we show that the EoS remains a major uncertainty for the outcome of core-collapse supernovae. Whereas explosions are obtained in most cases for the SFHo and SFHx EoS, for the CMF EoS, which includes a crossover from nucleonic matter to a quark phase, explosions occur only for 2 out of 15 progenitors. Less favourable conditions for neutrino-driven explosions arise for the CMF EoS due to lower neutrino luminosities and mean energies and slightly weaker contraction of the warm proto-neutron star. Our results suggest that the explodability of massive stars cannot yet be predicted based on first principles without better knowledge of the nuclear EoS. Conversely, observational constraints on stellar explodability may help further constrain the EoS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MG-NECOLA: Fast Neural Emulators for Modified Gravity Cosmologies</a><span class="id">[2510.20086]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of the large-scale structure (LSS) provide a powerful test of gravity on cosmological scales, but high-resolution N-body simulations of modified gravity (MG) are prohibitively expensive. We present MG-NECOLA, a convolutional neural network that enhances fast MG-PICOLA simulations to near-N-body fidelity at a fraction of the cost. MG-NECOLA reproduces QUIJOTE-MG N-body results in the power spectrum and bispectrum with better than 1% accuracy down to non-linear scales ($k \simeq 1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), while reducing computational time by several orders of magnitude. Importantly, although trained only on $f(R)$ models with massless neutrinos, the network generalizes robustly to scenarios with massive neutrinos, preserving accuracy to within 5% at non-linear scales. This combination of precision and robustness establishes MG-NECOLA as a practical emulator for producing large ensembles of high-fidelity simulations, enabling efficient exploration of modified gravity and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies in upcoming surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unexpected Near-Resonant and Metastable States of Young Multi-Planet Systems</a><span class="id">[2510.20185]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations suggest that the incidence of near-resonant planets declines as planetary systems age, making young planetary systems key signposts of early dynamical evolution. Here we investigate the dynamical states of three of the youngest multi-transiting planetary systems: AU Mic (3-planet, $\sim$20-Myr-old), V1298 Tau (4-planet, $\sim$23-Myr-old), and TOI-2076 (4-planet, $\sim$200-Myr-old). We find that most planet pairs in these systems lie near resonance with circulating rather than librating resonant angles. As a result, they are more susceptible to dynamical chaos than systems that are either securely locked in resonance or far removed from it. Even modest eccentricities of 0.04 to 0.08 may drive them to instability on timescales of tens to hundreds of Myr. Moreover, the observed orbital architectures are vulnerable to eccentricity excitation through mechanisms such as divergent resonance crossing triggered by planetesimal scattering. The observed near-resonant state may represent a transitional phase between a librating resonant chains and a mature non-resonant planetary system. Finally, we briefly discuss mechanisms that could give rise to the observed near-resonant configurations, including overstable libration, disk turbulence, and receding disk inner edge.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20203" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Joint Observation of the CSST Shear and clustering of astrophysical gravitational wave source measurements</a><span class="id">[2510.20203]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive forecast for cosmological constraints using the joint observation of the cosmic shear signal from the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) and the clustering signal from the next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detector networks, e.g. Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). By leveraging the angular clustering of astrophysical gravitational wave sources (AGWS) from the third-generation detectors and CSST's weak lensing surveys, we develop a theoretical framework to compute auto- and cross-angular power spectra of AGWS clustering, cosmic shear, and their cross-correlation. Mock datasets are generated by considering the detector-specific selection functions, uncertainties in luminosity distance, and weak lensing systematics. We employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to constrain the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological parameters, AWGS bias parameters, and star formation rate (SFR) parameters under three detector configurations. Our results demonstrate that the joint observation can achieve sub-$5\%$ precision on $H_0$ ($2.19\%$) and $w$ ($5.7\%$). Besides, the AGWS clustering bias parameters can be constrained to the precision of $4\%-5\%$, enabling the differentiation between stellar-origin compact binaries and primordial black hole scenarios. This multi-messenger approach can also be helpful to resolve mass-redshift degeneracies in the dark siren methods, providing independent validation for the Hubble tension. Our work indicates that the joint observation of the third-generation GW detectors and the CSST can be a powerful probe of the large-scale structure and the cosmic expansion history.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of a Debris Disk Around TWA 20</a><span class="id">[2510.20216]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of a debris disk surrounding the M3 star, TWA 20, revealed by JWST coronagraphic observations using the Near-infrared Camera (NIRCam). With reference-star differential imaging (RDI), we resolve the disk in scattered light in the F200W filter at a high signal-to-noise ratio and in the F444W filter at a low signal-to-noise ratio. The disk morphology and orientation are characterized via a forward modeling approach, where we determine a radius of 64.7-6.5+6.2 AU and an inclination of 70.1-3.3+2.5 deg. Utilizing our forward model, we improve the fidelity of the debris disk image using model-constrained RDI (MCRDI). The newly discovered disk is one of only 6 disks detected in scattered light that orbit M dwarf stars; it is the third largest of the 6 resolved M dwarf disks and orbits the third faintest host star. The detection of this disk exemplifies the sensitivity of JWST to debris disks around low-luminosity host stars, which have historically been difficult to detect because these disks are cool and dim. We identify a nebulous structure that cannot be explained by an axisymmetric disk. A search for companions in the TWA 20 system yields no candidates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D analytical theory of the perturbed single-synchronous state. Application to the post-impact Didymos-Dimorphos system</a><span class="id">[2510.20317]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop the 3D generalization of the planar analytical theory presented in Gaitanas et. al., 2024, which deals with states slightly perturbed from the exact `single-synchronous equilibrium state' (SSES) of the full two-body problem. The SSES corresponds to two non-spherical gravitationally interacting bodies, settled in nearly circular relative orbit, with rotation axes normal to the orbital plane, rapid rotation of the primary and synchronous rotation of the secondary. In the present paper we remove all simplifying assumptions of our previous work Gaitanas et. al., 2024, and show how to compute analytical solutions describing a 3-dimensional perturbation of the system from the SSES in the framework of two distinct theories, called `linear' and `nonlinear'. Linear theory stems from averaging the equations of motion over the primary's rapid rotation angle. This maps the SSES to an equilibrium point of the averaged system, around which analytical solutions can be computed by linearization of the equations of motion. In nonlinear theory, instead, we compute a high order normal form for the Hamiltonian of motion through a sequence of canonical transformations in the form of series. Resonances between the basic system's frequencies appear in the nonlinear theory as small divisors. We show that, close to resonances, the nonlinear theory leads to a partially integrable model, sufficient to analytically describe the evolution of the relative orbit, but only of some of the Euler angles of the system. As a basic application, we compute analytical solutions representing various possible Didymos-Dimorphos post-impact orbital and rotational states. In this case, all analytical formulas here proposed are of direct utility in fitting algorithms exploiting available time series of post-impact observational data.}}</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Stochastic Parameterization of Non-Orographic Gravity Waves Induced Mixing for Mars Planetary Climate Model</a><span class="id">[2510.20410]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents a formalism of mixing induced by non-orographic gravity waves (GWs) to integrate with the stochastic GWs scheme in the Mars Planetary Climate Model. We derive the formalism of GWs and their mixing under the same assumptions, integrating the two schemes within a unified framework. Specifically, a surface-to-exosphere parameterization of GW-induced turbulence has been derived in terms of the eddy diffusion coefficient. Simulations show that the coefficient is on the order of 1E4 to 1E9 cm2 s-1 and a turbopause is at altitudes of 70 to 140 km, varying with seasons. The triggered mixing has minor effects on model temperatures, yet it substantially impacts upper atmospheric abundances. Simulations are consistent with observations from the Mars Climate Sounder and the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer. Mixing enhances the tracer transports in the middle and upper atmosphere, governing the dynamics of these regions. The scheme reveals how non-orographic GW-induced turbulence can regulate upper atmospheric processes, such as tracer escape.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of stellar winds and tidal locking effects on the habitability of Earth-like exoplanets around M dwarf stars</a><span class="id">[2510.20417]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an assessment of the effects of stellar wind magnetic and mechanical components on the habitability of Earth-like exoplanets orbiting the inner and outer radii of the habitable zone (HZ) of M dwarfs. We consider stars with masses in the range of $0.09 - 0.75 M_\odot$ and planets with a surface dipolar magnetic field of 0.5 G. We estimate the size of the magnetospheres of such exoplanets using the pressure balance equation including the contribution of magnetic and ram pressures from stellar winds. We explore different scenarios, including fast and slow stellar winds, to assess the relevance of kinetic contribution. Furthermore, the effect of tidal locking and potential deviations from the Parker spiral, typically used to describe the interplanetary magnetic field, are analyzed. We show that for low mass stars ($M &lt; 0.15 M_\odot$), the ram pressure exerted by stellar winds affects the size of the magnetosphere more than the stellar wind magnetic pressure. Interestingly, when the ram pressure is not much stronger than the magnetic pressure, typically for higher mass stars, the inclusion of ram pressure can be beneficial to the magnetosphere due to the magnetopause currents. A magnetosphere with the size of that of modern Earth is difficult to achieve with the current assumptions. However, an early Earth magnetosphere is achieved by roughly half of our hypothetical planets orbiting the outer radius of the HZ in most of the considered cases. We find that deviations from the Parker spiral can affect the results significantly, reducing the magnetosphere by $56\%$ in extreme cases. Most of the hypothetical planets are most likely (or might be) tidally locked, with the notable exception of those orbiting the outer HZ of GJ 846 and V1005 Ori.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mass-Radius relationship and Gravitational Wave Emission from Spheroidal Magnetized Quark Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.20459]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we have studied the masses, equatorial radii and gravitational wave strain amplitudes of strongly magnetized oblate spheroidal quark stars.

We also computed the ellipticity, the gravitational redshift, the mass quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability for two values of bag constants: 65 MeV/ fm^3 and 75 MeV/ fm^3, for both MSQM and MCFL phases. Additionally, using the mass quadrupole moment, we have calculated the gravitational wave strain amplitudes for isolated deformed rotating magnetized quark stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20545" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-conservative Mass Transfer in the Neutron Star Stripping Model</a><span class="id">[2510.20545]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The process of long-term stable mass transfer (or stripping) in a close neutron star binary system is possible at a sufficiently large initial asymmetry of the component masses. At the final stage of the evolution of such systems, the low-mass neutron star fills its Roche lobe, whereupon its mass is gradually transferred to the more massive component. At a certain point, the stability of the mass transfer is lost, causing the minimum-mass neutron star to explode. In the present stripping calculations, the effect of non-conservative mass transfer has been taken into account for the first time, resulting in an increase in the duration of stable mass transfer from a few tenths of a second to a few seconds. This allows the time delay of 1.7 s between the loss of the gravitational-wave signal and the detection of the gamma-ray burst from the multimessenger event GW170817-GRB170817A to be naturally explained. The interaction of the envelope of the exploded minimum-mass neutron star with the matter ejected during non-conservative mass transfer may explain two episodes in the light curve of this gamma-ray burst.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barium abundances of A–F–G type stars in the Hyades cluster</a><span class="id">[2510.20546]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With an aim of clarifying the extent and parameter-dependence of compositional anomaly of barium in A-type stars, Ba abundances were spectroscopically determined based on BaII 6141/6496 lines for 89 (23 A-type and 66 F–G-type) main-sequence stars belonging to the members of Hyades cluster by taking into account the non-LTE effect and the hyper-fine-structure effect. While the non-LTE effect tends to strengthen lines in G stars, it acts in the direction of line weakening in the regime of A stars due to increasing imortance of overionization. The Ba abundances of G stars turned out almost constant (&lt;A&gt;= 2.33), indicating that the primordial composition of Ba in Hyades is mildly supersolar by  +0.2dex. In contrast, A-type stars show Ba overabundances of considerably large dispersion (0 &lt;[Ba/H] &lt;2). Since this Ba excess tends to increase with an increase/decrease in Teff/vsini, these two parameters may be essential for producing or controling the anomaly. Regarding Hyades F-type stars, their Ba abundances are not uniform but show a broad depression (by &lt; 0.3dex) around Teff 6500K, interestingly coinciding with the location of Li-dip.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scaler data from the Pierre Auger Observatory as a proxy of solar activity</a><span class="id">[2510.20589]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar activity variations strongly impact the modulation of the flux of low-energy Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) reaching the Earth.

We show that the low-threshold rate (scaler) time series recorded over 16 years of operation by the surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargüe (Argentina) strongly reflects solar activity and can be considered as a new proxy of solar variability. To achieve this result, we apply advanced spectral methods to this time series and to the classical solar sunspot number and sunspot area series. We detect and compare highly significant variations with periods ranging from the decadal to the daily scale and identify the origin of each variability mode. In conclusion, we show that the Auger scaler data, thanks to the very low noise level and high statistical significance related to the very high count rates ($\sim 10^6$ counts per second), allow for a thorough and detailed investigation of the GCR flux variations in the heliosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assessing the star formation history of all-sky and part-sky 100pc white dwarf samples</a><span class="id">[2510.20624]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thanks to Gaia and large-scale spectroscopic follow-up surveys (4MOST, DESI, WEAVE, SDSS-V), it is now possible to build representative and minimally biased samples of the local white dwarf population.

By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\kappa$ tails for $\delta B_0/B_0 \gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\delta B_0/B_0 \ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\bf v}_E \cdot {\bf \kappa}$, with ${\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\bf\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20652" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue supergiants and the zero point of the Tully-Fisher relation: a path to a new independent test of the Hubble constant</a><span class="id">[2510.20652]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Blue supergiant distances of nearby galaxies obtained with the flux-weighted gravity-luminosity relationship are used for a measurement of the zero points of Tully-Fisher relationships at different photometric passbands.

The EBL is an isotropic diffuse photon field from optical to infrared wavelengths, which is difficult to measure directly due to strong foreground emission. We present niebla, the first open-source code to compute the EBL using a forward-folding approach that accepts fully customizable inputs. This software enables a detailed modelling of the influence of EBL opacities on VHE observations and facilitates the distinction between different dust reemission models. The code models the optical background primarily from stellar emission, by evolving the spectrum of a single stellar population as a function of redshift, considering mean metallicity evolution and star formation rate density. Additional sources to the EBL can be provided by the user. The code already includes optional contributions from, e.g., stripped stars, intra-halo light, or the decay of axion dark matter. The optical emissivity is then absorbed by interstellar dust and reemitted in the infrared regime. We provide multiple prescriptions to model this process, using spectral dust templates or a combination of blackbodies. We provide three EBL models calculated with different dust reemission prescriptions, which have been fitted to various observational data sets. In addition, we showcase the versatility of our model through a simulated observation of the blazar Markarian 501 in a high-flux state with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory array. We find that the simulated VHE spectrum is highly sensitive to the EBL opacity coming from the infrared. Our model will therefore allow the community to distinguish between different dust reemission models and constrain EBL parameters with future observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20676" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DKIST resolves sub-arcsec photospheric scattering polarization</a><span class="id">[2510.20676]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scattering polarization signals offer a unique diagnostics of the physical conditions in the solar atmosphere, in particular magnetic fields via the Hanle effect.

Here, we present a first dynamical assessment of the system's stability through numerical simulations of test particles, accounting for Chiron's triaxial figure. For an equatorial ellipticity of C22 0.02, as inferred from the most recent shape estimates, our simulations reveal a chaotic inner zone extending to  260 km, where particle lifetimes reach up to a year, while particles beyond  260 km can remain stable for at least a decade. These results suggest that the innermost portion of the disk is ephemeral and can only persist if continuously replenished. For lower ellipticity values (C22&lt;0.012), however, the entire disk is located within the stable region, regardless of Chiron's mass. Under the physical parameters currently available in the literature, Chi2R is possibly linked to the 1:3 spin-orbit resonance, while Chi1R cannot be linked to the 1:2 resonance, as previously proposed, since this resonance is unstable. Instead, Chi1R and Chi3R may be associated with the 2:5 and 1:5 spin-orbit resonances, respectively. Both the 1:3 and 1:5 resonances are bifurcated, generating chaotic zones that may explain the gap in Chi2R and the longitudinal asymmetry observed in Chi3R.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20705" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring cosmic dipole with the GRB luminosity-time relation</a><span class="id">[2510.20705]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new analysis of cosmic dipole anisotropy using gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as high-redshift standardizable candles.

For the first time, we employ the luminosity-time (L-T) relation, known in the literature as the bidimensional X-ray Dainotti relation, corrected for redshift evolution, to standardize a sample of 176 long GRBs detected by \textit{Swift}. We test for dipolar modulations in the GRB Hubble diagram using both the Dipole Fit Method and a new approach introduced here, the Anisotropic Residual Analysis Method. Both methods yield consistent results: a dipole amplitude of $A_d \simeq 0.6 \pm 0.2$ pointing towards (RA, DEC) $\approx (134^\circ \pm 30^{\circ}, -36^\circ \pm 21^{\circ})$ (equatorial coordinates). As shown in the Appendix, this corresponds to a boost velocity of the observer with respect to the GRB rest-frame in the antipodal direction from the dipole direction. Extensive isotropy tests and 20,000 Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the detected signal cannot be explained by chance alignments or by the angular distribution of the GRB sample. We also show how, by incorporating a dipole term, residual correlations are eliminated, showing that the dipole model provides a better fit than standard isotropic $\Lambda$CDM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20740" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Evidence for Polar Orbits of Sub-Saturns Around Hot Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.20740]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sub-Saturns have been reported to preferentially occupy near-polar orbits, but this conclusion has so far been based primarily on systems with cool host stars; obliquity measurements for sub-Saturns orbiting hot stars remain scarce. Expanding the census into the hot-star regime is essential to test whether the polar preference persists across the Kraft break and to diagnose the underlying excitation mechanisms. In this work, we present Rossiter-McLaughlin observations of TOI-1135 b, a sub-Saturn orbiting a hot star with $T_{\rm eff}=6320\pm120$ K, using WIYN/NEID. We confirm its near-polar architecture, measuring a sky-projected obliquity of $\lambda=-68.1^{+7.5}_{-5.3}$ degrees and a true obliquity of $\psi=72.2^{+6.4}_{-6.6}$ degrees. Coupling our new measurement with stellar-obliquity data from the literature, we find that sub-Saturns and hot Jupiters around cool stars are unlikely to be drawn from the same parent distribution at the $5.2\sigma$ level, consistent with weaker tidal realignment induced by lower-mass planets. Of the two known misaligned sub-Saturns around hot stars, both are near-polar, suggesting that the polar preference may extend above the Kraft break. Moreover, their obliquities lie near $\sim 65$ degrees, supporting predictions from secular resonance crossing for sub-Saturns around rapidly rotating hot stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Opacity Project: R-Matrix Calculations for Opacities of High-Energy-Density Astrophysical and Laboratory Plasmas</a><span class="id">[2510.20775]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurate determination of opacity is critical for understanding radiation transport in both astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.

Given the expected low amplitude of the signal, its estimate, parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, is highly susceptible to contamination from Galactic foreground residuals that remain after component separation. In this work, we introduce an agnostic, model-independent procedure to construct a spectral template of residual foreground contamination in the observed angular power spectrum. Specifically, a cleaned multifrequency set of foreground-emission maps is blindly reconstructed from the observed data using the Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) technique. These maps are then combined with the weights adopted for CMB reconstruction, yielding an estimate of the spatial distribution of foreground residuals after component separation. The power spectrum of this residual map, after proper noise debiasing, is incorporated into the spectral model of the cosmological likelihood, thereby enabling unbiased inference of cosmological parameters. We validate the method on realistic simulations of a LiteBIRD-like experiment, focusing on constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We demonstrate that including the residual template in the likelihood yields unbiased estimates of $r$, regardless of its input value, the assumed foreground model, or the adopted masking strategy, thus proving the robustness of the proposed procedure.

Applying it to massive neutrinos yields a factor-of-two reduction in total runtime relative to CLASSIER without the approximation. Compared to standard CLASS runs (with $\ell_{\rm max}^{\rm NCDM}=40$ and no late-time massive neutrino fluid approximation) under the same precision setting, CLASSIER with this approximation is faster by a factor of 3-6. The approximation faithfully reproduces the late-time behavior of massive neutrino perturbations and preserves sub-$0.1\%$ accuracy in the matter power spectrum today up to comoving wavenumber $k=100\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. With this approximation, massive-neutrino perturbations are no longer the computational bottleneck on small scales for linear-theory predictions.

Extending to the baryonic sector, we analyze primordial gas collapse in minihalos, emphasizing molecular hydrogen cooling and the thermochemical pathways leading to Population III star formation. Finally, we examine primordial black holes as potential seeds for early galaxies, connecting their accretion-driven growth to the stellar masses and disk properties of high-redshift systems.

However, direct signatures of extra dimensions are difficult to observe in many cases. This is the situation, for example, if the energy scales associated with extra dimensions are close to the string or Grand Unification scale. The energetic early universe provides an exciting opportunity to overcome this challenge, since the heavy states associated with high-scale extra dimensions, such as scalar moduli and Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, could have been produced on-shell at early epochs. In this work, we illustrate this by focusing on how such states can be produced during inflation and leave signatures in primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). Specifically, we consider a 5D spacetime with a warped extra dimension that remains stabilized as inflation proceeds in the four non-compact dimensions. By discussing an explicit stabilization mechanism, we compute the masses and couplings of the radion modulus and the KK graviton modes. Being gravitational degrees of freedom, these unavoidably couple to the field(s) generating curvature perturbation, and can lead to observable NG with a distinctive oscillatory shape and characteristic angular dependence. We give example benchmarks which can already be probed by the Planck data and identify targets for the future. Our study shows that cosmological surveys have the potential to observe on-shell imprints of extra dimensions in the coming years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detecting White Dwarf Binary Mergers with Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2510.19913]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mergers of white dwarf binaries are a possible progenitor channel for Type Ia supernovae. While white dwarfs are abundant in the universe and relatively well understood, their gravitational wave signals have not yet been directly observed. In order to detect gravitational waves from merging white dwarf binaries, a detector in the mid-band between LVK and LISA appears necessary. In this paper, we compute and discuss the gravitational waves emitted by inspiraling and merging white dwarf binaries, and assess their detectability with proposed space-based atom-interferometer detectors such as MAGIS Space and AEDGE. Gravitational waves from massive white dwarf binaries can be observed for many years before merger, offering a unique early warning of their final explosion. Our projections suggest that MAGIS Space could detect signals from Type Ia supernova progenitors at least once every four years, while AEDGE could observe at least a few hundred such events annually. The prolonged gravitational wave emission captured by atom-interferometers provides precise sky localisation and can allow observation of the final explosion with electromagnetic telescopes. The combined observation with electromagnetic radiation from the white dwarf binary coalescence could open a new pathway for multi-messenger astronomy involving some of the brightest transient events in the universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Swift Memory Burden Effect with GW250114-like Events</a><span class="id">[2510.19916]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Black hole spectroscopy allows to infer the properties of the remnant of a binary black hole coalescence.

In this work we simulate a series of black-hole mergers with mass ratios $q=1$ and $q=1/2$, immersed in an scalar field overdensity with masses in the range $M\mu_{\rm{S}} \in[0,1.0]$. To do so, we implemented a constraint-satisfying initial data solver based on the puncture method, we improved the accuracy of our open-source software Canuda to eighth order finite differences, and we reduced the initial orbital eccentricity.

The bound sates are defined as the perturbations in the interior of the black hole with an imaginary spectrum which are regular at the center of black hole while their time-dependent profile falls off exponentially on the event horizon. Using the scale factor in the expanding direction in the interior of the black hole as the clock, we rewrite the corresponding Regge-Wheeler equation and solve it semi-analytically as well as numerically. We confirm that the bound state solutions exist for scalar, vector and axial tensor perturbations. It is shown that for a given value of $\ell &gt;s$, there are total $\ell-s$ such bound states. We obtain the universal lower bound $2 G M \omega_I &gt;1$ for the spectrum of bound state which is asymptotically saturated in the large $\ell$ limit. Furthermore, we obtain an upper bound on the spectrum of axial perturbations which for large $\ell$ scales like $2 G M \omega_I \lesssim 0.04\, \ell^4 $.

To this end, we introduce a novel parametrization of the pairing gap, in which each parameter has a direct physical meaning, and perform systematic parameter-space exploration with the BSk24 equation of state (EoS). Using a newly-developed Fortran-based cooling code coupled to Optuna's TPE algorithm, we conduct both single-objective ($\chi^2$ only) and multi-objective ($\chi^2$ + slope difference) optimizations under identical conditions. By optimizing the neutron $^3\text{P}_2$ pairing gap parameters to best reproduce the Cas A NS observational data during repeated neutron-star cooling simulations, we obtain reasonably-behaving neutron $^3\text{P}_2$ pairing gap functions with maximum values of $\Delta_\text{max}\approx$ 0.5–0.6 MeV. Fixing $M=1.4\,M_\odot$, increasing $q$ progressively drives the optimized gap and the critical temperature $T_\text{c}$ profiles toward smoother, more traditional shapes and improves agreement with the observational data; the PBF efficiency factor of $q\gtrsim0.4$ reproduces the Cas A NS slope well, whereas $q\simeq0.19$ remains insufficient. Our results support previous indications that enhanced PBF efficiency or additional rapid-cooling channels may be required to fully explain the Cas A NS observational data. The new parametrization not only improves interpretability but also provides a framework for future Bayesian inference and machine-learning applications. Extensions of this work will further advance the systematic study of dense-matter physics with neutron-star cooling.

Like many incarnations of BSM physics this model has a number (four) of arbitrary parameters, which determine the experimental signals, and cosmological observables such as the dark matter relic density. We show that analysis of the phenomenology can be greatly accelerated by using symbolic expressions derived for the observables in terms of the input parameters. Here we focus on the Higgs mass, the cold dark matter relic density, and the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We find that SR can produce remarkably accurate expressions. Using them we make global fits to derive the posterior probability densities of the CMSSM input parameters which are in good agreement with those performed using conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate a major advantage of SR which is the ability to make fits using differentiable methods rather than sampling methods. We also compare the method with neural network (NN) regression. SR produces more globally robust results, while NNs require data that is focussed on the promising regions in order to be equally performant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GUT-Scale Smooth Hybrid Inflation with a Stabilized Modulus in Light of ACT and SPT Data</a><span class="id">[2510.20478]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze a generalized framework of smooth F-term hybrid inflation (smFHI) consistent with gauge coupling unification within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM).

In the present work, we simultaneously address these two issues by incorporating certain modification during inflation over the usual inflationary scenario. Such modification amplifies the primordial tensor perturbation over the modes that are sensitive to the NANOGrav frequency region. For this purpose, we take the thermodynamic route of cosmology where the entropy of the apparent horizon is given by a generalized form of entropy that is able to generalize the other known form of horizon entropies for suitable representations.

The extragalactic radio background, as detected by ARCADE-2 and LWA-1, suggests a strong radio background from cosmic dawn, which can significantly alter the cosmological 21 cm signal, enhancing both the global signal amplitude and the 21 cm power spectrum. In this paper, we employ an artificial neural network (ANN) to check if there is a radio excess over the cosmic microwave background in mock data, and if present, we classify its type into one of two categories, a background from high-redshift radio galaxies or a uniform exotic background from the early Universe. Based on clean data (without observational noise), the ANN can predict the background radiation type with $96\%$ accuracy for the power spectrum and $90\%$ for the global signal. Although observational noise reduces the accuracy, the results remain quite useful. We also apply ANNs to map the relation between the 21 cm power spectrum and the global signal. By reconstructing the global signal using the 21 cm power spectrum, an ANN can estimate the global signal range consistent with an observed power spectrum from SKA-like experiments. Conversely, we show that an ANN can reconstruct the 21 cm power spectrum over a wide range of redshifts and wavenumbers given the global signal over the same redshifts. Such trained networks can potentially serve as a valuable tool for cross-confirmation of the 21 cm signal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15702" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studying the Power Sources Behind Type Ic Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2501.15702]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Astrophysical transients can be powered by a broad range of energy sources including shock-heating (internal and external shocks), decay of radioactive isotopes, and long-lived central engines (magnetar and fallback). The dominant energy source for astrophysical transients depends on the nature of the explosive engine and its progenitor. To model all transients, light-curve codes must include all of these energy sources. Here we present a supernova light-curve code implementing analytic source models to compare the role of different energy sources in these transients. To demonstrate the utility of this code, we conduct an extensive study of type Ic broad-line supernovae. A diverse set of energy sources have been linked to Ic broad-line supernovae making them an excellent candidate for this light-curve code. In this paper, we explore which features of the explosion (mass, velocity, etc.) affect the type Ic supernovae light-curves, focusing on shock-interaction and radioactive decay energy sources. Although the explosion properties under both energy sources can be tuned to match the peak emission, matching the light-curve evolution in many Ic broad-line supernovae requires fine-tuned conditions. We find that shock interactions in the stellar wind are likely to be the dominant energy source at peak for these supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterizing CMB noise anisotropies from CMB delensing</a><span class="id">[2504.20919]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Un-doing the effect of gravitational lensing on the Cosmic Microwave Background (`de-lensing') is essential in shaping constraints on weak signals limited by lensing effects on the CMB, for example on a background of primordial gravitational waves. Removing these anisotropies induced by large-scale structures from the CMB maps also generally helps our view of the primordial Universe by sharpening the acoustic peaks and the damping tail. However, practical implementations of delensing transfer parts of these anisotropies to the noise maps. This will induce a new large scale `mean-field' bias to any anisotropy estimator applied to the delensed CMB, and this bias directly traces large-scale structures. This paper analytically quantifies this delensed noise mean-field and its impact on quadratic (QE) and likelihood-based lensing estimators. We show that for Simons-Observatory-like surveys, this mean-field bias can reach 15\% in cross-correlation with large-scale structures if unaccounted for. We further demonstrate that this delensed noise mean-field can be safely neglected in likelihood-based estimators without compromising the quality of lensing reconstruction or $B$-mode delensing, provided the resulting lensing map is properly renormalized.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio observations point to a moderately relativistic outflow in the fast X-ray transient EP241021a</a><span class="id">[2505.08781]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) are short-lived X-ray outbursts with diverse progenitor scenarios, including compact object mergers, stellar core-collapses and tidal disruption events. The Einstein Probe (EP) has enabled the rapid discovery and follow-up of dozens of FXRTs, revealing that while some of them overlap with traditional gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), a larger fraction of FXRTs have no associated gamma-ray counterpart down to deep limits. The origin of these gamma-ray dark FXRTs and their connection to the diverse landscape of stellar explosions remains an open question, which can be tackled through the study of their multi-wavelength counterparts and environment. In this paper, we present long-term radio observations of the gamma-ray dark EP241021a, which exhibits sustained radio emission for over 100 days, placing it among the longest-lived radio afterglows. We detect signature of interstellar scintillation in early epochs, allowing us to constrain the angular size and Lorentz factor of the emitting region. Our observations point to an outflow that is at least mildly relativistic with Lorentz factor &gt; 4. Afterglow modeling favors a moderately relativistic and collimated outflow interacting with a low-density interstellar medium. The derived beaming-corrected kinetic energy and low radiative efficiency are consistent with a standard relativistic explosion which did not produce bright gamma-rays. Alternatively, a highly-relativistic structured jet remains consistent with our observations if seen substantially off-axis. In the latter case, the initial X-ray flare detected by EP would be caused by the slower ejecta from the lateral wings intercepting our line of sight rather than by traditional prompt-emission mechanisms within the jet core.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indicator Functions: Distilling the Information from Gaussian Random Fields</a><span class="id">[2506.06668]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A random Gaussian density field contains a fixed amount of Fisher information on the amplitude of its power spectrum.

When we choose one particular distance regime (i.e., cells separated by $60$-$80h^{-1}$ Mpc), we find that the information in that range peaks at moderately rare densities (where the number of smoothed survey cells is roughly of order of magnitude 100). Counter-intuitively, we find that, for a finite survey volume (again at a particular distance range), indicator function analysis can outperform conventional two-point statistics while using only a fraction of the total survey cells, and we explain why.

Some of these flares reached extreme luminosities of $\mathcal{O}(10^{47}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}})$. No consistent temporal correlation emerged between HE and VHE activity: HE flares preceded, coincided with, or followed VHE emission across sources, with some showing no HE counterpart. Remarkably, 3FHL J0308.4+0408 (NGC 1218) is a Seyfert Type I galaxy, while no object of this class was known as a VHE emitter before.

This discrepancy leads to a preference for a total neutrino mass that is lower than the minimum value inferred from neutrino oscillation experiments. Alternatively, this tension can be eased within $\Lambda$CDM by assuming a higher optical depth ($\tau \simeq 0.09$), but such a value conflicts with large-scale CMB polarization data. We point out that cosmic birefringence, as suggested by recent Planck reanalyses, resolves this discrepancy if the birefringence angle varies significantly during reionization. Specifically, we consider the fact that the measured cosmic birefringence angle $\beta_0=0.34\pm0.09\,(1\,\sigma)\,$deg has the phase ambiguity, i.e., the measured rotation angle is described by $\beta=\beta_0+180n\,$deg ($n\in \mathbb{Z}$). We show that cosmic birefringence induced by axion-like particles with nonzero $n$ suppresses the reionization bump, allowing a higher $\tau$ consistent with data. We provide a viable parameter space where the birefringence effect simultaneously accounts for the low-$\ell$ polarization spectra, the Planck $EB$ correlations, and the elevated value of $\tau$, suggesting a key role for cosmic birefringence in current cosmological tensions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinetic Fragmentation of the QCD Axion on the Lattice</a><span class="id">[2507.01822]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Kinetic misalignment, one of the most compelling scenarios for the non-thermal generation of axion dark matter, is generally accompanied by axion fragmentation, a process in which the energy of the axion condensate is transferred to its perturbations.

In this work, we present the first classical lattice simulation of kinetic axion fragmentation in the context of dark matter production, focusing on parameters relevant to the QCD axion. Our findings indicate that the non-perturbative dynamics captured by the lattice lead to a significantly broader spectrum of axion fluctuations, with a sustained transfer of energy to mildly relativistic modes and with smaller occupation numbers compared to the linear approximation. As a consequence, the final dark matter abundance is typically O(1) lower than in the linear approximation, which is itself O(1) lower than the zero-mode-only prediction. This broadening and suppression of the spectrum could have a significant impact on axion mini-halo formation, one of the main experimental handles on kinetic fragmentation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Persistent and serious challenge to the $Λ$CDM throne: Evidence for dynamical dark energy rising from combinations of different types of datasets</a><span class="id">[2507.22856]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive multiple constraints on dark energy and compare dynamical dark energy models with a time-varying equation of state ($w_0 w_a$CDM) versus a cosmological constant model ($\Lambda$CDM). We use Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) from DESI and DES, Cosmic Microwave Background from Planck with and without lensing from Planck and ACT (noted CMBL and CMB, respectively), supernova (SN), and cross-correlations between galaxy positions and galaxy lensing from DES. First, we use pairs or trios of datasets where we exclude one type of dataset each time and categorize them as “NO SN&quot;, “NO CMB&quot; and “NO BAO&quot; combinations. In all cases, we find that the combinations favor the $w_0 w_a$CDM model over $\Lambda$CDM, with significance ranging from 2.3$\sigma$ to 3.3$\sigma$. For example, DESI+DESY6BAO+CMB yields 3.2$\sigma$ without SN, DESI+DESY6BAO+DESY5SN yields 3.3$\sigma$ without CMB, and CMB+DESY5SN+DES3x2pts yields 2.6$\sigma$ without BAO. The persistence of this pattern across various dataset combinations even when any of the datasets is excluded supports an overall validation of this trending result regardless of any specific dataset. Next, we use larger combinations of these datasets after verifying their mutual consistency within the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. We find combinations that give significance levels $\sim$4$\sigma$, with DESI+DESY6BAO+CMBL+DESY5SN reaching 4.4$\sigma$. In sum, while we need to remain prudent, the combination of the first step that supports a validation of the pattern of these results beyond any single type of dataset and their associated systematics, together with the second step showing high-significance results when such datasets are combined, presents a compelling overall portrait in favor of a dynamical dark energy with a time-evolving equation of state over a cosmological constant, and constitutes a serious challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model's reign.

The analysis reveals significant polarisation, with polarisation degrees (PD) of ${\sim}1.4$\% in the NB and ${\sim}3.7$\% in the HB, indicating a notable decrease in polarisation when transitioning from the HB to the NB. The polarisation angles show a consistent trend across the states. Spectropolarimetric analysis favours a dependence of the polarisation on the energy. The Comptonised component shows similar polarisation in both the HB and NB and is higher than the theoretical expectation for a boundary or spreading layer. This suggests a contribution from the wind or the presence of an extended accretion disc corona (ADC) to enhance the polarisation. The results obtained here highlight the importance of using polarimetric data to better understand the accretion mechanisms and the geometry of this class of sources, providing insights into the nature of the accretion flow and the interplay between different spectral components. Overall, the findings advance our understanding of the physical processes governing accretion in low-mass X-ray binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bright siren without electromagnetic counterpart by LISA-Taiji-TianQin network</a><span class="id">[2509.04218]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves (GWs) with electromagnetic counterparts (EMc) offer a novel approach to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens, enabling $H_0$ measurements by combining GW-derived distances with EM-derived redshifts.

However, severe challenges to the phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM model have emerged recently, including the Hubble constant tension and the significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration. Despite many explanations for the two challenges have been proposed, the origins of them are still intriguing mysteries. Here, we investigate the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) measurements to interpret the Hubble constant tension. Employing a non-parametric method, we find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift from DESI BAO data and type Ia supernovae. From the Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) is derived from $w(z)$ model-independently. We find that the values of $H_0$ show a descending trend as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant tension. Our study finds that the two unexpected challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM model can be understood in one physical framework, e.g., dynamical dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulations of multiple dust ring formation in a subsolar-metallicity protoplanetary disk</a><span class="id">[2509.18449]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Super-Earths exist around subsolar-metallicity host stars with a frequency comparable to that around solar-metallicity stars, suggesting efficient assembly of dust grains even in metal-deficient environments. In this study, we propose a pathway for the formation of multiple dust rings that will promote planetesimal formation in a subsolar-metallicity disk. We investigate the long-term evolution of a circumstellar disk with 0.1 $Z_{\odot}$ over 750 kyr from its formation stage using two-dimensional thin-disk hydrodynamic simulations. The motion of dust grains is solved separately from the gas, incorporating dust growth and self-consistent radial drift. The disk is initially gravitationally unstable and undergoes intense fragmentation. By 300 kyr, it tends toward a stable state, leaving a single gravitationally bound clump. This clump generates tightly wound spiral arms through its orbital motion. After the clump dissipates at $\sim$410 kyr, the spiral arms transition into axisymmetric substructures under the influence of viscosity. These axisymmetric substructures create local gas pressure bumps that halt the inward radial drift of dust grains, resulting in the formation of multiple-ring-shaped dust distributions. We observe several rings within $\simeq$200 au of the central star, with separations between them on the order of $\sim$10 au, and dust surface density contrasts with inter-ring gaps by factors of $\sim$10-100. We also demonstrate that turbulent viscosities at observationally suggested levels are essential for converting spiral arms into axisymmetric substructures. We speculate that the physical conditions in the dust rings may be conducive to the development of streaming instability and planetesimal formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19158" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk).

The physical and chemical makeup of the embedded phase can provide valuable insights into the process of star and planet formation. This study aims to provide a thorough overview of the various morphologies for molecular emissions observed on disk scales toward nearby embedded sources. We present high angular resolution (0.1&quot;, 15 au) molecular line emissions for $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SO, SiO, DCN, CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO, and c-C$_3$H$_2$ towards 19 nearby protostellar sources in the context of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program &quot;Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk)&quot;. Emissions in $^{12}$CO are seen towards all sources and primarily trace outflowing materials. A few sources also show high-velocity jets in SiO emission and high-velocity channel maps of $^{12}$CO. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O emissions are well-known tracers of high-density regions and trace the inner envelope and disk regions with clear signs of rotation seen at continuum scales. The large-scale emissions of $^{13}$CO also delineate the outflow cavity walls where the outflowing and infalling materials interact with each other, and exposure to UV radiation leads to the formation of hydrocarbons such as c-C$_3$H$_2$. Both DCN and CH$_3$OH, when detected, show compact emissions from the inner envelope and disk regions that peak at the position of the protostar. The CH$_3$OH emissions are contained within the region of DCN emissions, which suggests that CH$_3$OH traces the hot core regions. Likewise, a few sources also display emissions in CH$_3$OH towards the outflow. Both SO and H$_2$CO show complex morphology among the sources, suggesting that they are formed through multiple processes in protostellar systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) abundances in the disk around T Chamaeleontis (T Cha): PAH sizes, ionization fraction, and mass during JWST observations</a><span class="id">[2509.21238]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The T Tauri star T Cha is known to have a protoplanetary disk with a dust gap separating the inner and outer disk regions. The mid-infrared JWST spectrum of T Cha shows multiple prominent aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) around 6.2, 8.1, and 11.3 $\mu$m. AIBs are commonly accepted as the emission stemming from PAH molecules. We aim to characterize the PAHs giving rise to the AIBs observed in the JWST spectrum of T Cha. Our objective is to estimate the PAH abundances, in terms of their sizes, ionization fraction, and mass, in the disk of T Cha. We perform spectral fitting of the observed AIBs to identify the possible underlying PAH emission components. We transfer the stellar radiation through a parametric disk model in order to reproduce the mid-IR spectrum, optical photometric fluxes, and mm continuum band fluxes of T Cha. We include PAH dust grains, which are stochastically heated, in our model calculations to simulate the AIBs. Thus, we estimate the PAH abundances from our modelling. We use the results from previous observations and modelling efforts to reduce our model degeneracies. The overall disk morphology - an inner and an outer disk separated by a dust gap - derived in this work is consistent with the previous results from Spitzer, VLT, and ALMA observations. PAHs are located within the outer disk in our model. Given our best fiducial model, we estimate a population of small PAHs of &lt;26 C atoms, with an ionized PAH fraction of $\sim0.15$. We also obtain a PAH-to-dust mass ratio of  7$\times$10$^{-3}$, which amounts to  17% of the PAH-to-dust mass ratio observed in the ISM. We predict the outer disk to have a frontal wall with smaller dust grains, sizes limited up to $\mu$m-order, in order to properly fit the continuum slope within 14-25 $\mu$m. We propose a possibility of sub-micron dust grains within the gap to justify an observed plateau around  10 $\mu$m in the JWST spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18301" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Growth of the Central Black Holes in Quasi-stars</a><span class="id">[2510.18301]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations by JWST have confirmed the presence of supermassive black holes (BHs) at redshifts $z\gtrsim10$, lending support to scenarios in which BHs experience rapid growth through intense gas accretion. Here we investigate the growth of a BH embedded at the center of a quasi-star, a theoretically predicted object formed via direct collapse. In a quasi-star, the central BH accretes at a highly super-Eddington rate, while the excess energy is transported outward by convection and radiated at approximately the Eddington luminosity of the entire star. We employ the open-source stellar evolution code \texttt{MESA} to construct quasi-star models and follow the time-dependent growth of the central BH under different prescriptions for the accretion rate at the inner boundary $R_i$, and further considering the effect of winds. For the case $R_i=NR_{\rm B}$, where $N$ is a constant and $R_{\rm B}$ is the Bondi radius corresponding to the mass of the BH and the gas infalling onto it, our models terminate when the BH mass reaches a critical value $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(N)=c_{s,i}^3/(12\sqrt{N^3G^3\pi\rho_i})$ (where $c_{s,i}$ and $\rho_i$ are the sound speed and density at $R_i$, respectively), a limit we also derive analytically. Models that feature an inner convective region matched to an outer adiabatic envelope exhibit BH growth up to approximately $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_\star\simeq 0.33$, largely independent of the stellar mass $M_\star$ itself. This ratio is approximately preserved even in the presence of mass loss, as several properties of the model are independent of the quasi-star's total mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19132" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence of Energy Injection in the Short and Distant GRB 250221A</a><span class="id">[2510.19132]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical facilities COLIBRÍ, the Harlingten 50 cm Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the \textit{Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} and the \textit{Einstein Probe}, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+10$ ks (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the classification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the prompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB 250221A an unusual event and underscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the importance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds May Significantly Limit the Use of Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</a><span class="id">[2408.12118]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many scalars, minimally coupled to only gravity, that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints. We also mention further constraints from Hawking radiation from black holes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parity-doubled nucleons can rapidly cool neutron stars</a><span class="id">[2501.02055]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In confined hadronic matter, the spontaneous breaking and restoration of chiral symmetry can be described by considering nucleons, $N_{+}(939)$, and excited states of opposite parity, $N_{-}(1535)$.

To that end, we study a simple setup of two linearly-coupled harmonic oscillators, and compute the purity of one oscillator when the interaction is switched off. We find that there exists a critical value for the coupling strength below which the purity oscillates and above which it decays exponentially. This decay cannot be captured by perturbation theory; hence, decoherence is always a non-perturbative phenomenon. When the interaction is turned off, the purity either freezes to its value prior to the turn-off, or it smoothly goes back to a value very close to one (recoherence). This depends on the rate at which the turn-off occurs. We thus develop a new adiabatic-expansion scheme and find complete recoherence at any finite order in the inverse turn-off time. Therefore, decoherence is always a non-adiabatic effect. The critical value of the turn-off time above which recoherence takes place is then expressed in terms of the other time scales of the problem. Finally, we show that the dynamics of the system is never Markovian, even when decoherence takes place. We introduce a new measure of Markovianity dubbed the Bures velocity and use it to optimise Markovian approximations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the axiverse with reionization</a><span class="id">[2507.03535]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axions that couple to electromagnetism are produced in the early Universe by, among other channels, freeze-in via the Primakoff process.

Despite its fundamental significance, a self-consistent treatment has so far remained elusive. In this work, we perform a one-loop semiclassical analysis using the robust anomaly-based method in the canonical setup of Einstein gravity minimally coupled to a free, massless scalar field. Focusing on explicitly solvable critical solutions in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, we analytically solve the semiclassical Einstein equations and provide definitive answers to several long-standing questions. We find that regularity uniquely selects a Boulware-like quantum state, encoding genuine vacuum polarization effects from the collapsing matter. Remarkably, the resulting quantum corrections manifest as a growing mode. Horizon-tracing analyses, incorporating both classical and quantum modes, reveal the emergence of a finite mass gap, signaling a phase transition from classical Type II to quantum-modified Type I behavior, thereby providing a quantum enforcement of the weak cosmic censorship. The most nontrivial aspect of our analysis involves dealing with non-conformal matter fields in explicitly time-dependent critical spacetimes.

Considering a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe with scale factor $a(t)$, it is shown that, in the matter free Universe, the kinetic term $\lambda X^\alpha \phi^\beta$ can lead to a power law solution $a(t)\propto t^{n}$ but the maximum possible value of $n$ turns out to be $(1+\sqrt{3})/4 \approx 0.683$. When $\alpha \geq 18$, this model can lead to a solution $a(t)\propto t^{2/3}$, thereby mimicking the evolution of scale factor in a cold dark matter dominated epoch with Einstein's General Relativity (GR). With the addition of a linear potential term $V(\phi) = V_{0}\phi$, it is shown that this model mimics the standard $\Lambda$CDM model type evolution of the Universe. The larger the value of $\alpha$, the closer the evolution of $a(t)$ in this model to that in the $\Lambda$CDM model based on Einstein's GR. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that this model with a linear potential can mimic the GR based $\Lambda$CDM model. However, with an appropriate choice of the potential $V(\phi)$, this model can provide a unified description of both dark matter and dynamical dark energy, as if it were based on Einstein's GR.</p></div></details></article></body>
