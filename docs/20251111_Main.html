Most constraints on dark energy arise from background observables – supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background – which mainly test the homogeneous expansion history. To move beyond this limitation, we examine how kinetic Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (kSZ) tomography, combined with galaxy clustering, can probe perturbative effects of dark energy and improve constraints on its background parameters. Using a Fisher-matrix analysis of the joint power spectra for LSST- and CMB-S4-like surveys, we quantify the additional information kSZ tomography contributes to dark-energy inference. Including kSZ data tightens constraints on $w_0$ by 15 % and on $w_a$ by 32 %, with parameter degeneracies distinct from those of geometric probes. We also assess the detectability of dark-energy perturbations through a two-parameter model, finding that for canonical sound speed ($c_s=1$) the effects are sub-percent and confined to horizon scales, while smaller sound speeds shift them to accessible $k$-ranges. Near-term kSZ measurements will primarily serve to test the consistency between background and perturbative signals, while future low-noise, high-resolution surveys may begin to uncover the microphysical properties of dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Estimating $η_\oplus$ is Difficult: A Kepler-Centric Perspective</a><span class="id">[2511.05658]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>$\eta_{\oplus}$, the occurrence rate of rocky habitable zone exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars, is of great interest to both the astronomical community and the general public. The Kepler space telescope has made it possible to estimate $\eta_{\oplus}$, but estimates by different groups vary by more than an order of magnitude. We identify several causes for this range of estimates. We first review why, despite being designed to estimate $\eta_{\oplus}$, Kepler's observations are not sufficient for a high-confidence estimate, due to Kepler's detection limit coinciding with the $\eta_{\oplus}$ regime. This results in a need to infer $\eta_{\oplus}$, for example extrapolating from a regime of non-habitable zone, non-rocky exoplanets. We examine two broad classes of causes that can account for the large discrepancy in $\eta_\oplus$ found in the literature: a) differences in definitions and input data between studies, and b) fundamental limits in Kepler data that lead to large uncertainties and poor accuracy. We highlight the risk of large biases when using extrapolation to describe small exoplanet populations in the habitable zone. We discuss how $\eta_{\oplus}$ estimates based on Kepler data can be improved, such as reprocessing Kepler data for more complete, higher-reliability detections and better exoplanet catalog characterization. We briefly survey upcoming space telescopes capable of measuring $\eta_{\oplus}$, and how they can be used to supplement Kepler data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Evolution in Coma Molecular Composition of Comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) Across the H$_2$O Sublimation Zone: ALMA Imaging of an H$_2$O-Dominated Coma</a><span class="id">[2511.05662]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report a survey of molecular emission from cometary volatiles using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) carried out on UT 2022 September 21, 22, and 23 at a heliocentric distance (\rh{}) of 2.1 au. These measurements of HCN, CS, CO, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO (along with continuum emission from dust) sampled molecular chemistry in C/2017 K2 at the inner edge of the H$_2$O sublimation zone, discerning parent from daughter or extended source species. This work presents spectrally integrated flux maps, production rates, and parent scale lengths for each molecule. CH$_3$OH, CO, and HCN were produced within $\sim$250 km of the nucleus, potentially including contributions from sublimation of icy grains. CS was consistent with production from CS$_2$ photolysis, and H$_2$CO required production from extended sources in the coma. An ortho-to-para ratio OPR=$2.9\pm0.4$ for H$_2$CO was derived from simultaneously measured transitions of each spin species. The continuum was extended and spatially resolved, consistent with thermal emission from dust in the coma. Analysis of the continuum visibilities provided an upper limit on the nucleus diameter $d&lt;6.6$ km and coma dust masses of $1.2-2.4\times10^{11}$ kg.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grand Unification Higgs-$\mathcal{R}^2$ Inflation: Complementarity between Proton Decay and CMB Observables</a><span class="id">[2511.05673]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a predictive $SO(10)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) framework for cosmic inflation in the Palatini $\mathcal{R}^2$ formulation of gravity. In this model, a GUT Higgs field both drives inflation and induces intermediate-scale symmetry breaking, thereby linking primordial cosmology, gauge unification, and topological defect formation. A partial inflationary phase of $N_I \sim 10$–$17$ $e$-folds following monopole formation can dilute magnetic monopoles to abundances $Y_M \sim 10^{-35}$–$10^{-27}$. The model yields Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) predictions of $0.955 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.974$, accommodating the tensions between Planck-BICEP ($n_s \approx 0.965$) and Planck+ACT ($n_s \approx 0.971$) via $\phi &lt; M$ and $\phi &gt; M$ branches repectively. The predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 8\times10^{-4}$ lies within current observational constraints and is accessible to forthcoming experiments, including the Simons Observatory and LiteBIRD. The resulting correlations between the unification scale $M_U$, the inflationary observables $(n_s, r)$, and proton-decay lifetimes highlight a complementarity between CMB measurements and proton-decay searches, with regions of parameter space testable in forthcoming experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05686" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards the Composition of sub-PeV Cosmic Rays at IceCube</a><span class="id">[2511.05686]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the implementation of a low-energy trigger, the surface array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is able to record cosmic-ray induced air showers with a primary energy of a few hundred TeV. This extension of the energy range closes the gap between direct and indirect observations of primary cosmic rays and provides the potential to test the validity of hadronic interaction models in the sub-PeV regime. Composition analyses at IceCube highly benefit from its multi-detector design. Combining the measurement of the electromagnetic shower component and low-energy muons at the surface with the response of the in-ice array to the associated high-energy muons improves the directional reconstruction accuracy and opens unique possibilities to extract the primary particle's mass. In this contribution, a new methodical approach for the analysis of these low-energy air showers is presented, including techniques for the identification of coincident background in the in-ice detector and a machine learning model based on convolutional neural networks to determine the elemental composition. The achieved performance in primary mass discrimination and energy reconstruction of air-shower events is discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Jet Compositions with Extreme Mass Ratio Binary Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2511.05698]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Determining whether black hole jets are dominated by leptonic or baryonic matter remains an open question in high-energy astrophysics. We propose that extreme mass ratio binary (EMRB) black holes, where an intermediate mass secondary black hole (a &quot;miniquasar&quot;) periodically interacts with the accretion flow of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), offer a natural laboratory to probe jet composition. In an EMRB, the miniquasar jet is launched episodically after each disk-crossing event, triggered by the onset of super-Eddington accretion. The resulting emissions exhibit temporal evolution as the jet interacts with the SMBH accretion disk. Depending on whether the jet is leptonic or hadronic in composition, the radiative signatures differ substantially. Notably, a baryonic jet produces a more pronounced gamma-ray output than a purely leptonic jet. By modeling the evolution of the multifrequency characteristic features, it is suggested that the gamma-ray-to-UV emissions may serve as a diagnostic tool capable of distinguishing between leptonic and baryonic scenarios. The resulting electromagnetic signals, when combined with multi-messenger observations, offer a powerful means to constrain the physical nature of relativistic jets from black holes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05724" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-linear simulations of the onset and non-linear dynamics of inertial waves in solar and stellar interiors</a><span class="id">[2511.05724]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inertial modes have been recently detected in the Sun via helioseismology, yet their origin, evolution, and role in the dynamics of the solar plasma and magnetic field remain poorly understood. In this study, we employ global numerical simulations to investigate the excitation mechanisms and dynamical consequences of inertial modes in the Sun and stellar interiors. We validate first our numerical setup by analyzing the evolution of sectoral and tesseral perturbations imposed on a rigidly rotating sphere. The results confirm that a perturbation of a given mode can excite neighboring modes with both smaller and larger wavenumbers along the dispersion relation of Rossby waves. Subsequently, we use a physically motivated forcing to impose differential rotation with varying shear amplitudes, and examine the spontaneous onset and nonlinear evolution of inertial modes. The simulations reveal that the growth of velocity perturbations is primarily driven by baroclinic instability. It gives rise to high-latitude inertial modes in the form of retrograde polar vortices whose properties depend on the imposed shear. Equatorial Rossby modes are also excited, albeit with lower intensity than their high-latitude counterpart. Perturbations with arbitrary azimuthal wavenumbers lead to the excitation of Rossby modes for all available wave numbers, sustained by both direct and inverse energy cascades. In simulations with stronger shear, the high latitude modes produce Reynolds stresses able to modify the imposed differential rotation and accelerate the rotation of the poles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05753" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finite Lifetime Fragment Model 4 for Striae Formation in the Dust Tails of Comets (FLM 4) Acceleration by Lorenz-force</a><span class="id">[2511.05753]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The striations in the dust tails of comets are referred to as striae, and their origin has long been a mystery. We introduce a new dynamic model to describe the forms of the striae observed in comets Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1), West (C/1975 V1), and Seki-Lines (C/1962 C1). Charged particles made of refractory materials, with radii less than 0.5 $\mu m$, are expelled from the comet's nucleus and accelerated by Lorentz forces near the nucleus. These particles decay many times to form striae, which have a lifespan of less than about 100 days at a distance of 1 astronomical unit from the sun. Over time, they continue to decay and eventually disappear from view. The following dynamic model explains these material science processes. Particles expelled from the comet's nucleus are subjected to three forces: solar gravity, solar radiation pressure, and Lorentz forces near the nucleus. As these particles decrease in size, the Lorentz forces and radiation pressure cause fluctuations, increasing and decreasing to form striae. This model, which is less of a dynamic approximation than previous theories (FLM3), explains the structure of the striae, enables predictions of their luminosity, and clarifies their origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Triple System V1371 Tau: An Eclipsing Binary with an Outer Be Star</a><span class="id">[2511.05761]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although triple systems are common, their orbital dynamics and stellar evolution remain poorly understood. We investigated the V1371 Tau system using TESS photometry, multi-epoch spectroscopy, and recent interferometric data, confirming it as a rare triple system consisting of an eclipsing binary orbited by a classical Be star, with a spectral classification of (B1V + B0V) + B0Ve. The eclipsing binary exhibits an orbital period of approximately 34 days, and the Be star orbits the inner pair on a timescale of a few years. Weak H$\alpha$ emission lines suggest the presence of a Keplerian disk with variability on a timescale of months around the Be star, and a nearly constant V/R ratio with no detectable asymmetry variations. Besides the eclipses, frequencies at 0.24 and 0.26 c/d dominate the photometric variability. Higher-frequency signals are present which appear associated with non-radial pulsation. The eclipsing pair ($i \approx 90^\circ$) shows projected rotational velocities of 160 and 200 km s$^{-1}$. The Be star's measured $v \sin i \approx 250$ km s$^{-1}$ implies a critical rotation fraction between 0.44 and 0.76 for plausible inclinations, significantly faster than the eclipsing components. The shallower eclipses in the KELT data compared to TESS suggest a variation in orbital inclination, possibly induced by Kozai-Lidov cycles from the outer Be star. The evolution analysis suggests that all components are massive main-sequence stars, with the secondary star in the eclipsing binary being overluminous. This study emphasizes the complexity of triple systems with Be stars and provides a basis for future research on their formation, evolution, and dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asteroseismology and Buoyancy Glitch Inversion with Fourier Spectra of Gravity Mode Period Spacings</a><span class="id">[2511.05780]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the small, quasi-periodic modulations seen in the gravity-mode period spacings of pulsating stars. These “wiggles” are produced by buoyancy glitches – sharp features in the buoyancy frequency ($N$) caused by composition transitions and the convective–radiative interface. Our method takes the Fourier transform of the period-spacing series, $FT(\Delta P_k)$ as a function of radial order $k$. We show that $FT(\Delta P_k)$ traces the radial derivative of the normalized glitch profile $\delta N/N$ with respect to the normalized buoyancy radius; peaks in $FT(\Delta P_k)$ therefore pinpoint jump/drop locations in $N$ and measure their sharpness. We also note that the Fourier transform of relative period perturbations (deviations from asymptotic values), $FT(\delta P/P)$, directly recovers the absolute value of the glitch profile $|\delta N/N|$, enabling a straightforward inversion for the internal structure. The dominant $FT(\Delta P_k)$ frequency correlates tightly with central hydrogen abundance ($X_c$) and thus with stellar age for slowly pulsating B-stars, with only weak mass dependence. Applying the technique to MESA stellar models and to observed slowly pulsating B-stars and $\gamma$ Dor pulsators, we find typical glitch amplitudes $\delta N/N \lesssim 0.01$ and derivative magnitudes $\lesssim 0.1$, concentrated at chemical gradients and the convective boundary. This approach enables fast, ensemble asteroseismology of g-mode pulsators, constrains internal mixing and ages, and can be extended to other classes of pulsators, with potential links to tidal interactions in binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hunting for Extragalactic Axion-like Dark Matter in a Decade-long Blazar Optical Polarimetry</a><span class="id">[2511.05839]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidates whose coupling to photons induces periodic oscillations in the polarization angle of astrophysical light. This work reports the first search for such a signature using ten years of optical polarimetric monitoring of the blazar 1ES 1959+650. No statistically significant periodicity is detected using a Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Monte Carlo analysis. Assuming a central DM density in the host galaxy, this null result places tight upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling constant at $g_{a\gamma}&lt;(5.8 \times 10^{-14}-1.8\times 10^{-10})\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ across a broad ALP mass range of $m_a \sim (1.4\times10^{-23}-5.2\times10^{-20})\,\mathrm{eV}$. Our constraints surpass those from Very Long Baseline Array polarimetry of active galactic jets and are competitive with those from long-term Galactic pulsar timing of PSR J0437-4715 over the same ALP mass window. These results establish long-term blazar polarimetry as a competitive and complementary approach for probing axion-like DM on extragalactic scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05986" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of Binary Millisecond Pulsars with Helium White Dwarfs in a New Magnetic Braking Prescription</a><span class="id">[2511.05986]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic braking (MB) mechanism plays a vital role throughout the evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Considering the standard MB prescription, the initial orbital periods of LMXBs that can evolve into binary millisecond pulsar (MSP) with He white dwarfs (WDs) and short orbital periods ($2-9~\rm hours$) are within an extremely narrow interval, which was named the fine-tuning problem. Employing the detailed binary evolution model, we investigate the evolution of LMXBs in both the standard and convection and rotation boosted (CARB) MB laws. In the standard MB case, it is difficult for donor stars to form a He core and exhaust H envelope through mass transfer at short orbital periods, making them semidetached systems. The CARB MB mechanism can drive LMXBs evolve toward compact detached MSP-WD systems in wide initial orbital periods, over which binary MSPs with long orbital periods will be produced. We obtain the initial parameter space of binary MSPs with He WDs in the initial orbital period and donor-star mass plane, which can be applied to future statistics study by population synthesis simulations. We also discuss a new relation between orbital period and WD mass, formation of persistent ultra-compact X-ray binaries with relatively long orbital periods, and detectability of compact MSP-WD systems as low-frequency gravitational wave sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three New Light Curves and Updated Transit Timings of WASP-135 b</a><span class="id">[2511.06015]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present updated transit timing measurements for the hot Jupiter WASP-135 b using three new ground-based transit observations obtained with Leia, a 0.6-meter telescope operated by NASA's Exoplanet Watch at the Table Mountain Facility. These observations, conducted as part of Exoplanet Watch citizen science initiative, were analyzed with the EXOplanet Transit Interpretation Code (EXOTIC) pipeline to generate high-quality light curves and extract precise mid-transit times. By combining our new data with previously published observations, we refined the planet's ephemeris, reducing uncertainties in both the orbital period and mid-transit time. Our final mid-transit value is 2460585.6563426 +/- 0.00001908 BJD_TDB and the final period value is 1.4013776 +/- 0.0000002 days. Our updated timing solution demonstrates a 92% reduction in mid-transit time uncertainty compared to the original discovery paper and improves the precision of transit forecasts through 2030 which is critical to ensure efficient scheduling of future missions, such as ESA's Ariel. This work highlights the critical role of ongoing ground-based observations by students and citizen scientists in maintaining accurate ephemerides, which are essential for planning future space-based follow-up with facilities such as the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes. The work in this paper was done as part of the SEDS-PH (Students for the Exploration and Development of Space-Philippines) Upskill Groups, which provides opportunities for Filipinos to participate in space-related projects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the numerical convergence of MRI simulations</a><span class="id">[2511.06022]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The magnetorotational instability (MRI) plays a crucial role in the evolution of many types of accretion disks. It is often studied using ideal-MHD numerical simulations. In principle, such simulations should be numerically converged, i.e. their properties should not change with resolution. Convergence is often assessed via the MRI quality factor, $Q$, the ratio of the Alfvén length to the grid-cell size. If it is above a certain threshold, the simulation is deemed numerically converged. In this paper we argue that the quality factor is not a good indicator of numerical convergence. First, we test the performance of the quality factor on simulations known to be unconverged, i.e. local ideal-MHD simulations with zero net-flux, and show that their $Q$s are well over the typical convergence threshold. The quality-factor test thus fails in these cases. Second, we take issue with the linear theory underpinning the use of $Q$, which posits a constant vertical field. This is a poor approximation in real nonlinear simulations, where the vertical field can vary rapidly in space and generically exhibits zeros. We calculate the linear MRI modes in such cases and show that the MRI can reach near-maximal growth rates at arbitrarily small scales. Yet, the quality factor assumes a single and well-defined scale, near the Alfvén length, below which the MRI cannot grow. We discuss other criticisms and suggest a modified quality factor that addresses some, though not all, of these issues.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Absolute Parameters of the Southern Detached Eclipsing Binary DG Mic</a><span class="id">[2511.06025]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As part of an ongoing programme of observing detached eclipsing binary stars in the southern sky, we present the first analysis of spectroscopic observations of the Algol-type binary system DG Mic. A spectroscopic analysis of mid-resolution spectra allowed us to constrain the effective temperature of the primary component and to test the consistency of the system parameters with its spectral energy distribution (SED). Combined solutions of mid-resolution spectra and TESS, ASAS and WASP light curves imply a system of two almost identical components ($q$ = 0.99) in circular orbits. Our final model shows that the system is a detached binary star. The masses and radii of the primary and secondary components of DG Mic were derived to be 1.65($\pm$0.12) M$_\odot$, 1.64($\pm$0.18) M$_\odot$ and 1.63($\pm$0.10) R$_\odot$, 1.91($\pm$0.13) R$_\odot$, respectively.

We performed 2D hydrodynamical simulations of multiple planets embedded in a circumstellar disk using the PLUTO code, with the addition of dust treated as Lagrangian particles with a multi-size distribution. We carried out a large parameter space analysis to check the influence of disk and planetary properties on the dust component. Planets with $m \gtrsim 1 \, M_{\oplus}$ can open dust gaps for small grains in dense and warm disks (strong coupling) and for large grains in thin and cold disks (weak coupling), without significantly perturbing the gas. In the strong coupling regime, rapid Type I migration can shift the gap location inward or outward with respect to the planetary orbit, depending on the direction of migration. We also find dust gaps that overlap with Lindblad resonances. In the weak coupling regime, planets can create an inner dust cavity, multiple dust rings, or hide inside a common gap. Our results show how low-mass multi-planet systems perturb the dust distribution, which cannot be explained by considering each planet in isolation and has a crucial dependence on local disk conditions and dust grain sizes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06058" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AthenaK Simulations of Magnetized Binary Neutron Star Mergers</a><span class="id">[2511.06058]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new numerical-relativity simulations of a magnetized binary neutron star merger performed with AthenaK.

We employ adaptive mesh refinement and consider three grid resolutions, with grid spacing down to $\Delta x_{\rm min} \simeq 92\ {\rm m}$ in the most refined region. When comparing the two highest resolution simulations, we find orbital dephasing of over 7 orbits until merger of only $0.06$ radians. The magnetic field is amplified during the merger and we observe the formation of a magnetized funnel in the polar region of the remnant. Simulations are continued until about $30$ milliseconds after merger. However, due to significant baryonic pollution, the binary fails to produce a magnetically-dominated outflow.

Cosmic rays that are accelerated in astrophysical sources can escape from their jets and interact with background radiation fields. Interactions with the extragalactic background light can produce pions and hence neutrinos, while interactions with the cosmic microwave background predominantly drive inverse Compton scattering, contributing to electromagnetic cascades in intergalactic space. The resulting secondary gamma-ray emission can be detected with high-energy gamma-ray telescopes. Here, we report on a new search for such cosmogenic cascade emission from the blazar TXS 0506+056, using a combined data set from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope and VERITAS. We compare the gamma-ray spectrum and neutrino observations with the predictions of cosmic-ray induced cascades in intergalactic space. The observed gamma-ray spectrum is modeled as a combination of the primary spectrum and the cascade spectrum. We apply a Monte Carlo simulation with a $\Delta\chi^2$-based likelihood analysis to jointly determine the best-fit parameters of a proton emission spectrum describing the data and derive constraints on the proton escape luminosity. Assuming a log-parabola primary photon spectrum, we find consistency with a proton injection spectral index of $\alpha_{p} \simeq 2.0$ and a cutoff energy of $E_{p,\text{max}} \simeq 1.3 \times 10^{16}$ eV, and constrain the isotropic proton escape luminosity to $1 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ $\lesssim L_{p, esc} \lesssim 3 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the 90 % confidence level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C–MetaLL) survey: VIII. High-Resolution IGRINS Spectroscopy of 23 Classical Cepheids: Validating NIR Abundances</a><span class="id">[2511.06264]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. While most chemical abundance studies of Cepheids rely on optical spectroscopy, near-infrared (NIR) observations offer advantages in terms of reduced extinction and access to new elemental tracers. Aims. We aim to validate NIR-based abundance determinations against optical results and to explore the diagnostic power of spectral lines inaccessible in the optical domain. The H and K bands allow us to trace elements such as P, K, and Yb, while also probing obscured Galactic regions and more distant Cepheids. Methods. We obtained high-resolution (R=45000) H- and K-band spectra for 21 Galactic and 2 LMC Classical Cepheids using IGRINS. Atmospheric parameters were derived from photometry and line-depth ratios (Teff), empirical calibrations (log g), and spectral fitting. Abundances of 16 elements were determined via LTE full spectral synthesis and compared with optical literature values. Results. We find excellent agreement between NIR and optical abundances, confirming the reliability of IGRINS-based measurements. The Fe, Mg, and Si gradients match previous optical determinations. We provide the first homogeneous NIR-based measurements of P, K, and Yb in Cepheids, consistent with chemical evolution models. The two LMC Cepheids in our sample, also studied optically, serve as extragalactic benchmarks for validating NIR abundances in low-metallicity regimes. Conclusions. High-resolution NIR spectroscopy yields accurate chemical abundances in Cepheids, consistent with optical results, and grants access to additional nucleosynthetic tracers. These results support future large NIR spectroscopic surveys with instruments such as MOONS, ELT, and JWST for Galactic and extragalactic archaeology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Precision Cosmology with the Lightest Elements</a><span class="id">[2511.06275]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This is a transcript of the joint talk we gave at the Sixth Gruber Cosmology Conference at Yale University on 3 October 2025.

The long-term MAXI light curve, along with the hardness-intensity diagram (HID) derived from NICER data, indicates that the source remained in the hard state and did not switch to the soft state. Spectral modeling using two different model combinations reveals that the broadband spectrum is best described by two distinct Comptonizing regions, associated reflection components, and thermal emission from the disk. The harder Comptonizing region dominates ($\gtrsim88\%$) the total flux and is primarily responsible for the observed reflection features from the distant part of the disk. We find that the accretion disk is truncated at a radius of $\sim16-56~r_{\rm{g}}$, while the luminosity is $\sim1.9\%$ of the Eddington limit. Our spectral results also show consistency in the estimated inner disk radius obtained through two independent methods: modeling the disk continuum and the reflection spectrum. The variability studies imply the presence of intrinsic disk variability, likely originating from an instability in the disk. We also detect hard time lags at low frequencies, possibly arising from the inward propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations from the outer to the inner regions of the accretion disk. Moreover, an observed deviation of the lag-energy spectrum from the log-linear trend at $\lesssim 0.7$ keV is most likely attributed to thermal reverberation, arising from the reprocessing of hard coronal photons in the accretion disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A TESS View of Post-Eruption Variability in the Novae V1405 Cas,V1716 Sco, and V1674 Her</a><span class="id">[2511.06399]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyzed TESS archival data of three novae after recent outbursts, searching the orbital and white dwarf (WD) rotation period and possible variations of these periods. In V1405 Cas, we detected a period of $\sim$116.88 seconds, which we identified as due to the WD spin, and measured a rate of increase of 0.001542$\pm0.000009\, {\rm s\, d}^{-1}$, one the fastest spin-down rates ever recorded. The rapid spin-down coupled with an X-ray luminosity several orders of magnitude lower than the available spin-down power, strongly indicates that the system is in a magnetic “propeller” state, namely the rotational energy powers the system's X-ray luminosity. We measured a previously unknown orbital period of 1.36 days for V1716 Sco. If the X-ray flux modulation with a period of 77.9 s detected in outburst for this nova is due to the rotation of an strongly magnetized white dwarf as in other novae with similar modulations of the supersoft X-ray source in outburst, the system is in a parameter space that challenges standard models of cataclysmic variable evolution. For V1674 Her, which has already been classified as an intermediate polar (IP), we confirm the known spin period of 501.33$\pm$0.01 s and the orbital period of 0.1529$\pm$0.0001 days, suggesting that the spin modulation was also the root cause of the periodicity in X-rays in outburst, and that the WD atmosphere in the supersoft X-ray phase was not thermally homogeneous. Our results highlight the power of high-cadence, continuous observations in revealing extreme and unexpected characteristics of accreting white dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kerr Black Hole Shadows in Dispersive Plasma: Frequency-Dependent Geodesics and Shadow Distortions</a><span class="id">[2511.06466]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The black hole shadow, a direct probe of the event horizon's gravitational influence, has been observationally confirmed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). While theoretical models of shadows in vacuum are mature, real astrophysical black holes like M87* and Sgr A* are enveloped in plasma, which can alter photon trajectories through dispersion. Current understanding, based on foundational work, indicates that only specific plasma distributions allow for an analytical treatment via the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we build upon this framework to systematically investigate the propagation of light rays in Kerr spacetime surrounded by a pressureless, non-magnetized cold plasma. We explicitly derive the separability condition, identifying the exact class of plasma densities that permit a generalized Carter constant. For these models, we compute the photon regions and shadow boundaries, characterizing how the shadow's size and shape deviate from the vacuum case in a frequency-dependent manner. Our results provide analytical benchmarks for the distortion of shadows in dispersive media and determine the critical plasma frequency beyond which the shadow is erased, offering a direct link between observable shadow features and the properties of the ambient plasma environment and providing a foundation for studying more dynamic, non-separable plasma distributions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiperiodic pulsations of the unique DAQ white dwarf J0551+4135: insights into a merger remnant</a><span class="id">[2511.06478]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>2MASS J05513444+4135297 (herafter J0551+4135) is the only pulsating DAQ white dwarf known with a carbon and hydrogen atmosphere. Its unusual atmospheric composition and kinematics indicate a white dwarf merger origin. We present time-series photometry of J0551+4135 obtained using the Apache Point Observatory 3.5m, Gemini North 8m, and Gran Telescopio Canarias 10m telescopes. J0551+4135 exhibits variations in pulsation amplitude and frequency over time. We detect ten significant recurring peaks across different subsets of observations, with frequencies ranging from 987 to 1180 $\mu$Hz, consistent with non-radial gravity ($g$)-mode oscillations. We present new evolutionary models suitable for spectroscopic characterization of DAQ white dwarfs, and derive a mass of $1.13 \pm 0.01\,M_\odot$ and a cooling age of $1.7 \pm 0.1$ Gyr for a CO core, and $1.12 \pm 0.01\,M_\odot$ and $1.6 \pm 0.1$ Gyr for an ONe-core white dwarf, respectively. However, detailed asteroseismology of this unique pulsator has to wait until fully-consistent DAQ evolutionary models are available. Further observations, including multi-site campaigns to reduce daily aliasing and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio would be helpful for identification of additional modes and constraining the internal structure of this unique pulsator.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06489" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sub-GeV dark matter in neutron stars: halo morphologies and their suppression by vacuum-like pressure</a><span class="id">[2511.06489]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate neutron stars that contain a unified dark sector composed of cold, degenerate fermionic dark matter and a vacuum-like dark-energy component. Within a general-relativistic two-fluid framework that allows a covariantly conserved, gradient-driven energy exchange between baryons and the dark sector, we quantify how dark microphysics reshapes global structure when the total gravitational radius need not coincide with the luminous baryonic radius. Using a state-of-the-art baryonic equation of state, we explore the halo-forming mass range for fermionic dark matter with particle masses of 400 MeV and 1 GeV, and we characterize sequences by the difference between the total and luminous radii and by the fractional difference between the total and baryonic masses. We confirm established trends: lighter fermions typically support low-density halos that increase the total radius by several kilometers at nearly fixed mass, whereas masses near 1 GeV tend to shrink halos and make the two radii appreciably closer. Our central new result is that a percent-level vacuum-like admixture markedly reduces halo formation, shrinking the radius difference from several kilometers to sub-kilometer scales and the fractional mass difference to $\lesssim 1\%$. Combined gravitational-wave and X-ray observations offer a practical route to bound the halo size and the allowed vacuum-like fraction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building Wet Planets through High-Pressure Magma-Hydrogen Reactions</a><span class="id">[2511.06507]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Close-in transiting sub-Neptunes are abundant in our galaxy \cite{fulton2017california}. Planetary interior models based on their observed radius-mass relationship suggest that sub-Neptunes contain a discernible amount of either hydrogen (dry planets) or water (wet planets) blanketing a core composed of rocks and metal \cite{bean2021nature}. Water-rich sub-Neptunes have been believed to form farther from the star and then migrate inward to their present orbits \cite{bitsch2021Dry}. Here, we report experimental evidence of reactions between warm dense hydrogen fluid and silicate melt that releases silicon from the magma to form alloys and hydrides at high pressures. We found that oxygen liberated from the silicate melt reacts with hydrogen, producing a significant amount of water up to a few tens of weight percent, which is much greater than previously predicted based on low-pressure ideal gas extrapolation \cite{misener2023Atmospheresa,schlichting2022Chemical}. Consequently, these reactions can generate a spectrum of water contents in hydrogen-rich planets, with the potential to reach water-rich compositions for some sub-Neptunes, implying an evolutionary relationship between hydrogen-rich and water-rich planets. Therefore, detection of a large amount of water in exoplanet atmospheres may not be the optimal evidence for planet migration in the protoplanetary disk, calling into question the assumed link between composition and planet formation location.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the impact of the dynamic solar wind on the propagation of a coronal mass ejection with two models and multi-spacecraft measurements</a><span class="id">[2511.06521]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the main drivers of disturbances in the solar heliosphere because they propagate and interact with the magnetic field of the solar wind. It is crucial to investigate the evolution of CMEs and their deformation for understanding the interaction between the solar wind and CMEs. We quantify the effect of the dynamic solar wind on the propagation of a CME in the heliosphere with a hydrodynamic plasma cloud-cone model and a linear force-free spheromak model at various locations in the heliosphere. We chose a CME event that launched on SOL2021-09-23T04:39:45 and was observed by multiple spacecraft, namely BepiColombo, Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, Stereo A and ACE. The solar wind was modelled in the steady and dynamic regimes in the Icarus model. The CME parameters were approximated for the selected event, and two CME models (spheromak and cone) were launched from the inner heliosphere boundary. The obtained synthetic in situ measurements were compared to the observed in situ measurements at all spacecraft. The internal magnetic field of the flux rope was better reconstructed by the spheromak model than by the cone CME model. The cone CME model maintained a nearly constant longitudinal angular extension while somewhat contracting in the radial direction. In contrast, the spheromak model contracted in the longitudinal direction while expanding in the radial direction. The CME sheath and magnetic cloud signatures were better reproduced at the four spacecraft clustered around the CME nose by the spheromak CME model. The dynamic solar wind caused a greater deceleration of the modelled CME than the steady-state solar wind solution. Because the background was homogeneous, the modelled CME properties were only mildly affected by the solar wind regime, however.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Total solar eclipse 2024 modelling with COCONUT</a><span class="id">[2511.06535]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronal modelling is crucial for a better understanding of solar and helio-physics. Due to the strong brightness of the Sun and the lack of white light observations of the solar atmosphere and low corona (1-1.5R$_\odot$), total solar eclipses have become a standard approach for validating the coronal models. In this study, we validate the COCONUT coronal model by predicting the coronal configuration during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024. We aim to predict the accurate configuration of the solar corona during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024. We utilise the full 3D MHD model to reconstruct the solar corona from the solar surface to $30\;R_\odot$. The upcoming total solar eclipse predictions were conducted in three different regimes: quasi-steady driving of the inner boundary conditions (BCs) with a daily cadence and dynamic driving of the inner BCs with both daily and hourly cadences. The results from all the simulations are compared to the total solar eclipse images. Additionally, the synthetic white-light (WL) images are generated from the STEREO-A field of view and compared to COR2 observed images. Normalised polarised brightness is compared in the COR2 and synthetic WL images. The predicted solar corona does not vary significantly in the first half of the prediction window. The dynamic simulations yielded better results than the quasi-steady predictions. The west limb was reconstructed better in the simulations than the east limb. We have predicted the total solar eclipse coronal configuration 18 days before the total solar eclipse. We can conclude that the dynamic simulations produced more accurate predictions. The availability of comprehensive observations is crucial, as the emergence of the active region on the east limb made it difficult to accurately predict the east limb coronal configuration due to incorrect input of magnetic field data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LRPayne: Stellar parameters and abundances from low-resolution spectra</a><span class="id">[2511.06546]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aims. This paper introduces LRPayne, a novel algorithm designed for the efficient determination of stellar parameters and chemical abundances from low-resolution optical spectra, with a primary focus on data from large-scale galactic surveys such as WEAVE. Methods. LRPayne employs a model-driven approach, utilising a fully connected artificial neural network (ANN), trained on a library of 70,000 synthetic stellar spectra generated using iSpec with 1D MARCS model atmospheres and the Turbospectrum synthesis code. The network is trained to predict normalized flux given stellar labels (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], vmic, vmax and v sin i, and 24 individual elemental abundances). Stellar parameters are subsequently derived from observed spectra by finding the best-fit synthetic spectrum from the ANN using a chi-squared minimisation technique. The method operates on spectra degraded to a resolution of R=5000 covering the wavelength range 4200-6900 Å. Results. Internal accuracy tests on synthetic spectra show a median interpolation error of less than 0.13 % for 90 % of the validation sample. The method accurately recovers most input labels from synthetic spectra, even at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 20, with some expected challenges for elements like Li, K, and N. Validation on observed spectra of 25 Gaia FGK benchmark stars and 42 metal-poor stars reveals good agreement with literature values. For stellar parameters, mean differences are 22+-87 K for Teff , 0.19+-0.23 dex for log(g), and 0.01+-0.17 dex for [Fe/H]. Abundances for elements like Na, Mg, Si, and most Fe-peak elements (Cr, Ni, V, Sc) are well-recovered. Challenges are noted for oxygen, manganese in metal-rich giants, aluminium in metal-poor stars and dwarfs, and for deriving log g in hot metal-poor dwarfs, partly due to non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects and line characteristics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation Channels of Magnetars</a><span class="id">[2511.06554]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formation channels of magnetars remain an open question. Although core collapse supernovae of isolated massive stars are important, binary interactions – such as tidal interaction, common envelope evolution, and stellar mergers – may also play a significant role in making magnetars. Understanding the relative contributions of these channels is crucial for linking magnetars to their observed properties and host environments. In this paper, we investigate potential magnetar formation channels using population synthesis simulations, considering both single-star and isolated binary system evolution. By conducting simulations with different parameters, we compare the effects of various evolution processes on magnetar formation. Additionally, we study the delay times and kick velocities across all formation channels, analyze the orbital properties and companion types of surviving magnetar binaries. We find that the majority of magnetars are observed as single objects ($\geq 90\%$), although a large fraction of them were originally in binary systems and experienced either kick disruption or merger. Surviving binaries are most likely to host main-sequence companions and exhibit different distributions of eccentricities due to different supernova mechanisms. These findings show the critical role of binary evolution in magnetar formation and provide predictions for the properties of magnetar populations that can be tested with future observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starobinsky Inflation and the Latest CMB Data: A Subtle Tension?</a><span class="id">[2511.06640]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the Starobinsky inflation model and the impact of curvature corrections, particularly a cubic $R^3$ term, to assess their behavior in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).

In this paper, we implement the Starobinsky inflationary potential directly into the CLASS code, without relying on the slow-roll approximation, and we constrain the number of e-folds of inflation $N_k$ using a theoretically motivated range derived from reheating considerations and standard couplings between matter fields and gravity. We show that it is still possible to identify a significant region of parameter space where the Starobinsky model remains highly consistent with the latest observational data.

From this analysis we have found that of the 84% of catalogued events that have MWA IPS data available, 68% of them appear in MWA observations. Of the enhancements first identified in IPS observations, only 58% have a potential match with a catalogued event. The majority of enhancements that were identified in the IPS observations were situated greater than 10$^\circ$ from the ecliptic plane. Two such features were selected for detailed analysis, connecting their solar origins to their propagation through the heliosphere. The first of these features was created by a coronal mass ejection (CME), captured over two successive MWA observations and recorded in several catalogues. The second feature has the potential of being a stream interaction region (SIR) travelling out of the ecliptic plane. This particular SIR was not recorded in any catalogue. Thus the MWA shows promise in detecting heliospheric transients that other commonly-used techniques may overlook. These results show the strength of the MWA in having unbridled access to the heliosphere, able to make remote observations of events far out of the ecliptic as it is not restrained to the orbits of spacecraft. We demonstrate how the inclusion of MWA IPS data can potentially boost the number of CME and SIR events that are characterised.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seyfert Galaxies as Neutrino Sources: An Outflow$-$Cloud Interaction Perspective</a><span class="id">[2511.06707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Following the identification of the first confirmed individual neutrino source, Seyfert galaxies have emerged as the most prominent class of high-energy neutrino emitters.

In this framework, fast AGN-driven winds collide with clumpy gas clouds in the nuclear region, forming bow shocks that efficiently accelerate cosmic-ray protons. The accelerated protons subsequently interact with cold protons from the outflows via inelastic proton–proton ($pp$) collisions, producing high-energy neutrinos, while the photomeson ($p\gamma$) process with disk photons may provide a subdominant contribution at the highest energies. Applying this model to five neutrino-associated Seyfert galaxies, we successfully reproduce the observed TeV neutrino fluxes without violating existing gamma-ray constraints. By integrating over the Seyfert population using X-ray luminosity functions, we further demonstrate that Seyfert galaxies can account for a substantial fraction of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino background in the $10^4-10^5~{\rm GeV}$ energy range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implication of multiple source populations of Galactic cosmic rays from proton and helium spectra</a><span class="id">[2511.06733]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Complicated hardenings and softenings of the spectra of cosmic ray protons and helium have been revealed by the newest measurements, which indicate the existence of multiple source populations of Galactic cosmic rays.

A sample is constructed from 26 T Tauri and Herbig disks located within 300 pc, with constraints on the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH intensity and with high-resolution ALMA continuum data.

A strong correlation with a Pearson coefficient of 0.88+/-0.07 between the 3.3 micron PAH intensity and the warm dust mass was found. The correlation is driven by the combination of deep upper limits and strong detections corresponding to a range of warm dust masses. Possible correlations with other disk properties like FUV radiation field or total dust mass are much weaker. Correlations with PAH features at 6.2, 8.6 and 11.3 micron are potentially weaker, but this could be explained by the smaller sample for which these data were available. The correlation is consistent with the hypothesis that PAHs are generally frozen out on pebbles in disks, and are only revealed in the gas phase if those pebbles have drifted towards warm dust traps inside the 30 K radius and vertically transported upwards to the disk atmosphere with sufficiently high temperature to sublimate PAHs into the gas phase. This is similar to previous findings on complex organic molecules in protoplanetary disks and provides further evidence that the chemical composition of the disk is governed by pebble transport.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06962" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turnover detection using the power spectrum and bispectrum</a><span class="id">[2511.06962]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The turnover at the peak of the Fourier matter power spectrum encodes a fundamental signature of matter-radiation equality in the early Universe. This delivers a potential standard ruler, independent of baryon acoustic oscillations and therefore able to break parameter degeneracies and improve precision. Furthermore, the turnover scale is independent of redshift and clustering bias, allowing for stacking of the signals from redshift bins. In practice, the very large scale of the turnover means that sample variance and systematics are serious impediments to its detection. Detections of the turnover and measurements of its scale have been made in the WiggleZ, eBOSS, Quaia, and DESI surveys. Upcoming surveys should improve the detection significance and reduce errors on the turnover scale. We use MCMC forecasts for turnover detection in a spectroscopic Euclid-like survey and a futuristic MegaMapper-like survey. In addition to the power spectrum, we include the signal from the bispectrum in equilateral configurations. These surveys are forecast to detect the turnover at $\sim\! 6\sigma$ (Euclid-like) and $\sim\! 15\sigma$ (MegaMapper-like), with precision on the turnover scale of $\sim\! 4\%$ and $\sim\! 2\%$. The inclusion of the bispectrum delivers a modest improvement of $\sim\! 10-17\%$ in the constraints on the turnover scale.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing spectral line asymmetries due to the propagating transverse waves in the solar corona</a><span class="id">[2511.06965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Decades-long studies of asymmetric spectral lines in the solar corona suggest mass and energy transport from lower atmospheric layers to the corona. While slow magnetoacoustic waves and plasma flows are recognized as drivers of these spectral line asymmetries, the role of transverse MHD waves remains largely unexplored. Previous simulations have shown that unidirectionally propagating kink waves, in the presence of perpendicular density inhomogeneities, can produce a turbulence-like phenomenon called “uniturbulence”. However, the spectroscopic signatures of this effect have not been investigated until now. Due to varying Doppler shifts from the plasma elements with different emissions, we expect to observe signatures of both blueward and redward asymmetries. Past instruments like EIS may have missed these signatures due to resolution limitations, but current instruments like DKIST offer a better opportunity for detection. We conducted 3D MHD simulations of transverse waves in a polar plume with density inhomogeneities and performed forward modeling for the Fe XIII emission line at 10749 Å. Our findings show that transverse waves and uniturbulence induce alternating red and blueward asymmetries, with magnitudes reaching up to 20\% of peak intensity and secondary peak velocities between 30 and 40 km s$^{-1}$, remaining under 100 km s$^{-1}$. These asymmetries propagate with the transverse waves, and even at DKIST resolution, similar signatures can be detected. Our study suggests that spectral line asymmetries can serve as a diagnostic tool for detecting transverse wave-induced uniturbulence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The s Process and Beyond</a><span class="id">[2511.06987]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutron captures produce the vast majority of abundances of elements heavier than iron in the Universe.

Superflares were thoroughly investigated using broadband photometry predominantly from Kepler, K2, and TESS. Here we present a spectroscopic investigation of superflares on the very active spectroscopic binary CC Eri. We focus on spectroscopic signatures of (super)-flares and line asymmetries with the goal to characterize superflares spectroscopically. In 70 nights of spectroscopic observations obtained at the ESO 1.52m telescope with the Echelle spectrograph PUCHEROS+ hosted by the PLATOSpec consortium we identified 31 flares from which two are superflares already from the deduced g'-band energies. We also find a broad blue-wing asymmetry occurring in the impulsive phase of another superflare which shows great potential to be a prominence eruption. For the second most luminous flare we find the largest number of excess emissions during the impulsive and gradual flare. We identify the flare to be occurring close to the stellar limb which indicates that the flare was even more energetic than derived from its g'-band and spectral line energies. We identify more than sixty spectral lines in the spectral range of 4100 and 7200Å showing excess emission during this flare. We detect continuum enhancements as well as photospheric line fillings during the flare. Generally we find that depending on the flare energy the number of spectral lines revealing excess emission increases, especially for the more energetic superflares. We therefore conclude that superflares are likely scaled-up versions of less energetic normal flares.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A catalog of new blue stragglers in open clusters with Gaia DR3</a><span class="id">[2511.07043]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The high-precision {\it Gaia} data release 3 (DR3) enables the discovery of numerous open clusters in the Milky Way, providing an excellent opportunity to search for blue straggler stars in open clusters and investigate their formation and evolution in these environments. Using the member stars from literature open cluster catalogs, we visually inspected the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of each cluster and selected cluster candidates that potentially host blue stragglers. We then reassessed cluster memberships using the {\tt pyUPMASK} algorithm with {\it Gaia} DR3 and performed isochrone fitting to derive physical parameters for each cluster, including age, distance modulus, mean reddening, and metallicity. Finally, we empirically identified straggler stars based on their positions relative to the best-fitting isochrone, zero-age main sequence (ZAMS), and equal-mass binary sequence on the CMD. In total, we identified 272 new straggler stars in 99 open clusters, comprising 153 blue stragglers, 98 probable blue stragglers, and 21 yellow stragglers.

The most prominent features are the three periods $P_1 = 26.5$ d, $P_2 = 26.9$ d, and $P_{\rm long} = 4.6$ years. Occasionally, a fourth period of 26.7 d is also detected. Mathematically, these four periods are interrelated via the interference pattern of a beating. Competing scenarios that seek to determine which of these periods are physical and which are secondary are under debate. The detection of a fifth period, $P_3 = 26.3$ d, was recently claimed. Our aim is to determine which of these periods are intrinsic (likely related to physical processes) and which of these are secondary (resulting from interference). We avoided any assumption about the physical scenario and restricted our analysis to the phenomenology of the radio emission variability. We selected intervals from archival radio data and applied the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We fit the observational data to generate synthetic data that only contain specific signals. We analyzed these synthetic data to assess the impact of these signals and their interference on the light curves and the periodogram. The two-peaked profile, consisting of $P_1$ and $P_2$, was detected in the periodogram of the actual data for intervals that are significantly shorter than $P_{\rm long}$, provided that these intervals contain a minimum of the long-term modulation. The characteristics of the observational data and their periodogram could only be reproduced with synthetic data if these explicitly included all three periods $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_{\rm long}$, the residuals being limited by noise. We have found that all three periods, i.e., $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_{\rm long}$, could correspond to physically real processes occurring in LS I +61 303.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulse profile modelling of the accretion-powered millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 using NICER data from its 2019 and 2022 outbursts</a><span class="id">[2511.07152]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulse profile modelling is a relativistic ray-tracing technique that has provided constraints on parameters, with a focus on mass and radius, of five rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. While the technique can also be applied to accretion-powered millisecond pulsars (AMPs), this requires accounting for the X-rays from the accretion disc and has only been applied to archival data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Here, we apply a previously developed neutron star and accretion disc model to the NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer) data of the 2019 and 2022 outbursts of SAX J1808.4-3658. We find that a single circular hotspot model is insufficient to explain the data. Modelling with two hotspots and an accretion disc model provides better phase-residuals, but a spectral residual at around 1 keV remains. In contrast, we find a good fit with a flexible background approach, replacing the accretion disk. However, the inferred parameters are not robust due to a degeneracy in the origin of the non-pulsed radiation, which can be caused either by the background or a hotspot that is at least partially in view throughout a full rotation. This work represents an important next step in pulse profile modelling of AMPs by analysing NICER data and underlines the need for more accurate accretion disc and hotspot modelling to achieve robust parameter constraints. We expect the inclusion of higher energy and polarimetric data will provide complementary constraints on inclination, hotspot colatitude, and hotspot size, improving the accuracy of pulse profile modelling of AMPs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rethinking mass transfer: a unified semi-analytical framework for circular and eccentric binaries.II. Orbital evolution due to non-conservative mass transfer</a><span class="id">[2511.07190]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although mass transfer (MT) has been studied primarily in circular binaries, observations show that it also occurs in eccentric systems. We investigate orbital evolution during non-conservative MT in eccentric orbits, a process especially relevant for binaries containing compact objects (COs). We examine four angular momentum loss (AML) modes; Jeans, isotropic re-emission, orbital-AML and $L_2$ mass loss – the latter is the most efficient AML mode. For fixed AML mode and accretion efficiency, orbital evolution is correlated: orbits either widen while becoming more eccentric, or shrink while circularizing. Jeans mode generally yields orbital widening and eccentricity pumping, whereas $L_2$ mass loss typically leads to orbital shrinkage and eccentricity damping. Isotropic re-emission and orbital-AML show intermediate behavior. Adopting isotropic re-emission, we demonstrate that eccentric MT produces compact binaries that merge via gravitational waves (GW) within a Hubble time, whereas the same systems would instead merge during MT under traditional modeling. We further show that, in eccentric orbits, the gravitational potential at $L_2$ becomes lower than at $L_1$ across large range of mass ratios and eccentricities, naturally linking eccentricity to $L_2$ mass loss. Since interacting binaries containing COs are frequently eccentric, $L_2$ mass loss offers a new robust pathway to orbital tightening during eccentric MT, contributing to the formation rate of GW sources. This model can treat orbital evolution due to conservative and non-conservative MT in arbitrary eccentricities with applications ranging from MT on the main sequence to GW progenitors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for steady and flaring neutrino emission from cosmic sources using the complete ANTARES dataset</a><span class="id">[2511.07239]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>ANTARES, a neutrino detector located in the depths of the Mediterranean Sea, operated successfully for over 15 years before being decommissioned in 2022. The telescope offered an ideal vantage view of the Southern Sky and benefited from optimal water properties for enhanced angular resolution. This study makes use of data collected over the entire operational period of ANTARES to search for sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos, considering both steady and flaring emission scenarios. First, a time-integrated search for high-energy neutrino clustering across the celestial sphere is conducted. The most significant accumulation is found at coordinates $(\alpha, \delta) =(200.5^\circ\, 17.7^\circ)$ with a post-trial p-value equal to 0.38. A dedicated search in the Galactic Plane is also performed for extended sources, yielding no significant excess. Additionally, a list of potential neutrino sources are investigated. The blazar MG3 J225517+2409 is identified as the most significant object, yet the excess remains compatible with background fluctuations. A mild local excess of 2.4$\sigma$ is found for the blazar TXS 0506+056. The full sky is also examined for the presence of flaring neutrino emissions. The most significant excess in this case corresponds to a $\sim$4-day flare from the direction $(\alpha, \delta) = (141.3^\circ\, 9.8^\circ)$, with a post-trial p-value of 0.30. Finally, the directions of sources highlighted in IceCube's time-dependent searches are investigated. Temporal overlaps between ANTARES and IceCube flares are identified for PKS 1502+106 and TXS 0506+056, with an estimated chance probability of about 0.02%, making this observation particularly noteworthy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07266" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The poltergeist mechanism - Enhancement of scalar-induced gravitational waves with early matter-dominated era -</a><span class="id">[2511.07266]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves induced by primordial density perturbations provide a powerful probe of the Universe's thermal history, which may include an early matter-dominated (eMD) era predicted by well-motivated particle-physics models.

Our study reveals that Weywot's orbit deviates significantly from a purely Keplerian model, requiring the inclusion of Quaoar's non-spherical gravitational field and center-of-body-center-of-light (COB-COL) offsets in our orbit models. We place a robust upper limit on Weywot's orbital eccentricity ($e&lt;0.02$), substantially lower than previous estimates, which has important implications for the strength of mean motion resonances (MMRs) acting on Quaoar's ring system. Under the assumption that Quaoar's rings lie in its equatorial plane, we detect Quaoar's dynamical oblateness, $J_2$, at $\sim$2$\sigma$ confidence. The low $J_2$ value found under that assumption implies Quaoar is differentiated, with a total bulk density of $1751\pm13$ (stat.) kg m$^{-3}$. Additionally, we detect significant COB-COL offsets likely arising from latitudinal albedo variations across Quaoar's surface. These offsets are necessary to achieve a statistically robust orbit fit and highlight the importance of accounting for surface heterogeneity when modeling the orbits of dwarf planet moons. These findings improve our understanding of Quaoar's interior and surface while providing key insights into the stability and confinement mechanisms of its rings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital Characterization of a Newly Discovered Small Satellite Around Quaoar</a><span class="id">[2511.07370]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations of a stellar occultation have revealed the presence of a previously undiscovered small satellite around Quaoar. Orbiting near Quaoar's unusual ring system, this new satellite has the potential to provide significant insights into the formation and evolution of Quaoar and its ring system. In this letter, we characterize the orbit of this newly discovered satellite, finding that it is likely on a $3.6^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$-day orbit, plausibly placing it near a 5:3 mean motion resonance with Quaoar's outermost known ring. Examining the possibility of observing the newly discovered satellite with further stellar occultations, we estimate that $\sim$hundreds of observing stations are required for recovery, since phase information about its orbit was rapidly lost after the lone detection. We also attempted to recover the satellite in JWST NIRCam imaging of Quaoar, but find no convincing detection. This non-detection is limited by the accuracy of the available NIRCam PSF models, as well as the satellite's extreme faintness and close-in orbital separation. Therefore, current-generation telescopes will likely struggle to directly image this new satellite, but near-future 30-meter-class telescopes should prove capable of detecting it. Discovery of such a satellite provides evidence that the rings around Quaoar may have been part of an initially broad collisional disk that has evolved considerably since its formation. To further explore this hypothesis, we encourage follow-up observations of the rings and satellites with stellar occultations and direct imaging, as well as updated hydrodynamical, collisional, and tidal modeling of the system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07393" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surprisingly Similar: The Mass Function of Gaia Neutron Stars and First-Born Double Neutron Stars</a><span class="id">[2511.07393]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The mass distribution of neutron stars encodes information about their formation and binary evolution. We compare the masses of two distinct populations: I) the recently identified Gaia neutron stars in wide orbits with solar-like companions and, II) the assumed first-born recycled pulsar in Galactic double neutron star systems. Naively, one would expect their masses to differ due to both the presumed differences in their evolutionary histories, as well as astrophysical selection effects that can filter out configurations that would merge or be disrupted. Yet, we find that their mass distributions are strikingly similar. Using a two-component Gaussian model, we find that both populations exhibit a narrow component centred near $1.3 \text{ M}_\odot$, accompanied by a broader, higher-mass component that extends the distribution toward larger masses. The highest density regions of their fitted parameter posteriors coincide by over 91.6%. Statistical tests further confirm the agreement between these distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence $JS &lt; 0.08$ and an earth mover's distance of $W &lt;0.063 \text{ M}_\odot$ at 90% credibility. This finding seems to imply that both mass functions reflect the natal mass distribution of first-born neutron stars in binary systems, supporting the hypothesis that neutron stars can be born with high masses. Consequently and perhaps surprisingly, binary evolutionary processes need not impart features on the NS mass distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The position of SN 1987A</a><span class="id">[2511.07394]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The accurate positional measurement of Supernova (SN) 1987A is important for determining the kick velocity of its compact object and the velocities of the ejecta and various shock components. In this work, we perform absolute astrometry to determine the position of SN 1987A. We used multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope imaging to model the early ejecta and the equatorial ring (ER). We combined our measurements and obtained the celestial coordinates in the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by registering the observations onto Gaia Data Release 3. The final average position of the different measurements is ${\alpha = 5^{\mathrm{h}}~ 35^{\rm{m}}~ 27^{\rm{s}}.9884(30)}$, ${\delta = -69^{\circ}~ 16'~ 11''.1134(136)}$ (ICRS J2016). The early ejecta position is located 14 mas south and 16 mas east of the ER center, with the offset being significant at 96% confidence. The offset may be due to instrument and/or filter-dependent systematics and registration uncertainties, though an intrinsic explosion offset relative to the ER remains possible. Image registration with proper motion corrections yields similar astrometry and a source proper motion of ${\mu_{\rm east} (\equiv \rm{PM_{\alpha }*}) = 1.60 \pm 0.15 ~\rm{mas ~ yr^{-1}}}$ and ${\mu_{\rm{north}} (\equiv \rm{PM_{\delta}}) = 0.44 \pm 0.09~\rm{mas ~ yr^{-1}}}$, in agreement with the typical local motion of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The absolute positional uncertainty of 21 mas adds a systematic uncertainty to the sky-plane kick velocity of ${123}~(t/40~\rm{yr})^{-1}~\rm{km~s}^{-1}$, where $t$ is the time since the explosion. Comparing the location of the compact source observed with JWST to our updated position implies a sky-plane kick of ${399\pm148~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ and a 3D kick of ${472\pm126~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$, which is consistent with previous estimates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Evidence for Violation of the Equivalence Principle in Disk Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.03839]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine the claimed observations of a gravitational external field effect (EFE) reported in Chae et al.

GR was created by A. Einstein in 1915. In 1917 Einstein proposed the first (static) cosmological model. Soon after the A. Eddington proved that the model is unstable therefore it can not be realizable in nature. In 1922 and 1924 A. A. Friedmann found non-stationary solutions for cosmological equations written in the framework of GR. In 1927 G. Lemaitre obtained very similar results and, in addition, he derived the Hubble law (E. Hubble obtained this law from observations). Unfortunately, G. Lemaitre published his paper in not very popular Belgium journal. In 1931 Lemaitre proposed the first version of hot Universe model (he called it hypothesis of the primeval atom). In his book Lemaitre predicted even a background radiation as a signature of his model. One of the important property of the Lemaitre – Gamow model was a prediction of CMB radiation with a temperature around a few K. It was recalled that the discovery of CMB radiation was done by T. Shmaonov in 1956 and his paper was published in 1957 (several years before Penzias and Wilson). In 1965, 1970 E. B. Gliner proposed vacuum like equation of matter which could correspond to exponential explosion of the Universe which was later called inflation. For decades in USSR, Friedmann's cosmological non-stationary models were treated as purely mathematical results without cosmologocal applications. On September 16, 1925 passed away untimely and it would be reasonable to remind today his great contribution in physical cosmology since the authors of book on Friedmann wrote that &quot;similarly to Copernicus who forced the Earth to move Friedmann forced the Universe to expand&quot;.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stochastic Limit of Growing Gravitational Wave Memory from Sources in the Early Universe and Astrophysical Sources</a><span class="id">[2511.06548]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that the stochastic background of gravitational wave memory of growing type leads to a fractional Brownian motion increasing at the order of $t^{H}$ for large $t$ where $\frac{1}{2} &lt; H &lt;1$. This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature. This would be particularly useful for the PTA data that has been already observed, answering the long-standing question on how to extract memory signals from the data. Further, the new results open up a new door to explore the conditions right after the Big Bang using the long-range dependence and further probability analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07226" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renormalization-Group Invariant Parity-Doublet Model for Nuclear and Neutron-Star Matter</a><span class="id">[2511.07226]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Parity-Doublet Model (PDM) is a chirally invariant effective theory for strong-interaction matter involving nucleons and their opposite-parity partners in a parity-doubling framework.

We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of component separation during the map-making stage in time domain space. This new technique leads to a more accurate description of the data and reduces the biases in cosmological analysis. The method uses a library for highly parallel computation which facilitates the programming and permits the description of experiments as easily manipulated operators.

Probing the maximum energies and luminosities of FRBs constrains their emission mechanism and cosmological population. Here we investigate the maximum energetics of a highly active repeater, FRB 20220912A, using 1,500 h of observations. We detect $130$ high-energy bursts and find a break in the burst energy distribution, with a flattening of the power-law slope at higher energy – consistent with the behaviour of another highly active repeater, FRB 20201124A. There is a roughly equal split of integrated burst energy between the low- and high-energy regimes. Furthermore, we model the rate of the highest-energy bursts and find a turnover at a characteristic spectral energy density of $E^{\textrm{char}}_{\nu} = 2.09^{+3.78}_{-1.04}\times10^{32}$ erg/Hz. This characteristic maximum energy agrees well with observations of apparently one-off FRBs, suggesting a common physical mechanism for their emission. The extreme burst energies push radiation and source models to their limit: at this burst rate a typical magnetar ($B = 10^{15}$ G) would deplete the energy stored in its magnetosphere in $\sim$ 2150 h, assuming a radio efficiency $\epsilon_\mathrm{radio} = 10^{-5}$. We find that the high-energy bursts ($E_\nu &gt; 3 \times 10^{30}$ erg Hz$^{-1}$) play an important role in exhausting the energy budget of the source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmology with voids from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</a><span class="id">[2410.19713]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We provide an accurate forecast of the expected constraining power from the main void statistics – the void size function and the void-galaxy cross-correlation function – to be measured by the Roman reference High Latitude Spectroscopic Survey from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

These observations will allow significant improvements in our understanding of helium stars. However, in the creation of these stars their companions may accrete a significant amount of helium-rich stellar material. These creates stars with unusual composition profiles – stars with helium-rich cores, hydrogen-rich lower envelopes and a helium-rich outer envelope. Thus the mean molecular weight reaches a minimum in the the middle of the star rather than continuously decreasing outwards in mass. To demonstrate this structure we present Cambridge STARS model calculations of an example interacting binary systems where the helium-rich material is transferred, and compare it to one where the composition of the accreted mass is fixed to the companion's surface composition. We show that the helium-rich material leads to the accretor being 0.2 dex hotter and 0.15 dex more luminous than models where the composition is not helium rich. We use a simple BPASS v2.2 population model to estimate that helium-rich mass transfer occurs in 23 per cent of massive binaries that undergo mass transfer. This suggests this is a common process. This binary process has implications for the discrepancy between spectroscopic and gravitational masses of stars, the production of ionizing photons and possibly the modelling of high redshift galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Comprehensive Hadronic Code Comparison for Active Galactic Nuclei</a><span class="id">[2411.14218]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform the first dedicated comparison of five hadronic codes (AM$^3$, ATHE$\nu$A, B13, LeHa-Paris, and LeHaMoC) that have been extensively used in modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of jetted active galactic nuclei. The purpose of this comparison is to identify the sources of systematic errors (e.g., implementation method of proton-photon interactions) and to quantify the expected dispersion in numerical SED models computed with the five codes. The outputs from the codes are first tested in synchrotron self-Compton scenarios that are the simplest blazar emission models used in the literature. We then compare the injection rates and spectra of secondary particles produced in pure hadronic cases with monoenergetic and power-law protons interacting on black-body and power-law photon fields. We finally compare the photon SEDs and the neutrino spectra for realistic proton-synchrotron and leptohadronic blazar models. We find that the codes are in excellent agreement with respect to the spectral shape of the photons and neutrinos. There is a remaining spread in the overall normalization that we quantify, at its maximum, at the level of $\pm 40\%$. This value should be used as an additional, conservative, systematic uncertainty term when comparing numerical simulations and observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12203" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mutated hilltop inflation in light of Planck/ACT observations</a><span class="id">[2412.12203]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Here, a single field inflationary model driven by a mutated hilltop potential, a subclass of the hilltop models of inflation, is investigated.

Yet, despite their astrophysical relevance, theoretical models often omit key interactions between relativistic dynamics and phase-dependent mass transfer (MT). In this study, we integrate a perturbed Keplerian formalism with post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to simulate the relativistic orbit of a WD around a rotating IMBH, explicitly resolving the narrow phase near pericentre where Roche-lobe overflow initiates MT. We find that GW emission and MT exert competing influences on the orbit: MT episodes can increase both orbital period and eccentricity, potentially enabling the WD to avoid complete tidal disruption and even escape. We further quantify the GW phase evolution induced by MT, identifying parameter regimes in which GW detectors could observe a one-radian phase shift over observational timescales. Finally, we propose that the orbital expansion driven by MT may lead to the disappearance of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). Our results underscore the necessity of jointly modeling relativistic effects and dynamic mass transfer in WD-IMBH systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17872" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possible binary neutron star merger history of the primary of GW230529</a><span class="id">[2503.17872]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Black holes (BHs) with masses between $\sim 3-5M_{\odot}$, produced by a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, can further pair up with a neutron star or BH and merge again within a Hubble time. However, the astrophysical environments in which this can happen and the rate of such mergers are open questions in astrophysics. Gravitational waves may play an important role in answering these questions. In this context, we discuss the possibility that the primary of the recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binary GW230529_181500 (GW230529, in short) is the product of a previous BNS merger. Invoking numerical relativity (NR)-based fitting formulas that map the binary constituents' masses and tidal deformabilities to the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant BH, we investigate the potential parents of GW230529's primary. Our calculations using NR fits based on BNS simulations reveal that the remnant of a high-mass BNS merger similar to GW190425 is consistent with the primary of GW230529. This argument is further strengthened by the gravitational wave-based merger rate estimation of GW190425-like and GW230529-like populations. We show that around 18% (median) of the GW190425-like remnants could become the primary component in GW230529-like mergers. The dimensionless tidal deformability parameter of the heavier neutron star in the parent binary is constrained to $67^{+163}_{-61}$ at 90% credibility. Using estimates of the gravitational-wave kick imparted to the remnant, we also discuss the astrophysical environments in which these types of mergers can take place and the implications for their future observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19510" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutrino Constraints on Black Hole Formation in M31</a><span class="id">[2504.19510]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate neutrino signals associated with black hole formation resulting from the gravitational collapse of massive stars, motivated by the candidate failed supernova M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31).

We examine several nuclear equations of state, specifically the Lattimer &amp; Swesty, Shen, Togashi, and SFHo models, to evaluate how the emission depends on neutron-star properties and nuclear-physics uncertainties. Comparison of the predicted event counts with SK's non-detection of neutrinos coincident with M31-2014-DS1 already rules out part of the model space and highlights the sensitivity of current neutrino detectors to both progenitor mass and the EOS.

We cover non-rotating solar-metallicity progenitors spanning an initial mass between 10 and about 40Msun and exploding as Type II or Ibc supernovae (SNe). Both photometrically and spectroscopically, the SN II models evolve distinctly from the SN Ibc models primarily because of the greater ejecta kinetic-energy-to-mass ratio in the latter, which leads to a greater gamma-ray escape together with a lower density and a higher ionization in our H-deficient ejecta. Type II SN models remain optically luminous at all times, whereas Type Ibc models progressively brighten in the infrared (which holds 80% of their luminosity at 500d), causing strong infrared lines such as [NeII]12.810mic and [NiII]6.634mic to evolve essentially at constant luminosity. The strength of [NeII]12.810mic exhibits a complicated dependence with either He-core or preSN mass because of the additional impact of ejecta ionization – this line radiates alone up to 20% of the SN luminosity after  300d in our Type Ibc SN models. The numerous infrared Ni lines are found to be good tracers of the material that underwent explosive nucleosynthesis and can thus be used directly to constrain the level of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SNe. The evolution of the integrated flux in infrared Fe and Co lines shows a great amount of diversity, which compromises their use as a diagnostic of the 56Ni-decay power source in our models. Future spectroscopic observations of core-collapse SNe by JWST will provide unprecedented information on the emission from atoms and ions in their ejecta, delivering critical constraints on massive star explosions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11758" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reconstruction of dark energy and late-time cosmic expansion using the Weighted Function Regression method</a><span class="id">[2506.11758]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with CMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\sigma$ CL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities, examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE. Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence at redshift $z_{\rm cross}\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\sim 2-4\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark energy density below $z\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed.

Extraction of cosmological information from these studies requires modeling of the forest correlations. While the models depend most importantly on the bias parameters of the intergalactic medium (IGM), they also depend on the numbers and characteristics of high-column-density systems (HCDs) ranging from Lyman-limit systems with column densities $\log_{10}\!\bigl(N_{\mathrm{HI}}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\bigr)&gt;17$ to damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems (DLAs) with $\log_{10}\!\bigl(N_{\mathrm{HI}}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\bigr)&gt;20.2$. These HCDs introduce broad damped absorption characteristic of a Voigt profile. Consequently they imprint a component on the power spectrum whose modes in the radial direction are suppressed, leading to a scale-dependent bias. Using mock data sets of known HCD content, we test a model that describes this effect in terms of the distribution of column densities of HCDs, the Fourier transforms of their Voigt profiles and the bias of the halos containing the HCDs. Our results show that this physically well-motivated model describes the effects of HCDs with an accuracy comparable to that of the ad-hoc models used in published forest analyses. We also discuss the problems of applying the model to real data, where the HCD content and their bias is uncertain.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23571" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The validity of separate-universe approach in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation</a><span class="id">[2506.23571]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the breakdown of the separate-universe approximation during transitions in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation by analyzing the evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal R}$ and its conjugate momentum $\Pi$.

Multiple formation channels have been proposed to explain this excess. To distinguish among these channels, it is essential to examine their predicted population-level distributions across additional parameters. In this work, we focus on BBH mergers near the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak and infer the population distributions of primary mass ($m_1$), mass ratio ($q$), effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$), and redshift ($z$). We observe a gradual increase in the merger rate with $m_1$, rising by a factor of $3$ from $20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to a peak around $34\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, followed by a sharp, order-of-magnitude decline by $50\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This population also shows a weak preference for equal-mass mergers and has a $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution skewed toward positive values, with a median of zero excluded at approximately $90\%$ confidence. We find no significant $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation in the $35\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak population, suggesting that lower-mass systems ($m_1&lt;20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) likely drive the $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ anti-correlation observed in the full BBH merger catalog. The redshift evolution of the merger rate is consistent with the cosmic star formation rate. We compare our findings with predictions from a wide range of formation channels. We find that common variants of the pair-instability supernova scenario, as well as hierarchical mergers, are incompatible with the observed features of the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ population. Ultimately, none of the formation channels we consider can explain all or even most of the features observed in this population.

Our analysis is based on different datasets for different timescales: for short-timescale periodicity in Time of Arrivals (TOAs), we use 57 observations from January to August 2024; for long-timescale periodicity, we employ an extended TOA dataset comprising 111 observations spanning from January 2024 to October 2025; and for burst time series analysis, we utilize individual burst data from the 57 FAST observations. We identify three candidate short-timescale periodic signals (0.673 s, 0.635 s, and 0.536 s) with significances of $3.2\sigma$–$6\sigma$, each detected in two independent observations. On longer timescales, we detect a significant $143.40\pm7.19$-day periodicity with $5.2\sigma$ significance, establishing FRB 20240114A as a periodic repeater. In burst time series, we find quasi-periodic oscillations in the few hundred Hz range ($3.4\sigma$ and $3.7\sigma$) and periodic burst trains with periods of several to tens of milliseconds ($3\sigma$–$3.9\sigma$), though these periodic features appear transient and short-lived. The detection of periodic signals at these different time scales indicates that FRB 20240114A exhibits intriguing periodic self-similar characteristics. Despite the comprehensive dataset, no definitive periodicity linked to the source's rotation is confirmed, placing stringent constraints on the intrinsic source properties and the modulation mechanisms. All data are available via the Science Data Bank.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiener filtering and multi-tracer techniques for dark matter cross-correlations between gamma-ray emission and galaxy catalogs</a><span class="id">[2508.02160]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cross-correlations between a gravitational tracer of dark matter and the contribution to the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) from the radiation produced by the annihilation of the particles responsible for the dark matter, have been established as a powerful tool to investigate the particle physics nature of dark matter. Cross-correlations of the UGRB with galaxy catalogs, cluster catalogs and weak lensing have indeed been measured. In this paper we study statistical techniques that could improve the sensitivity of the cross-correlation techniques on the bounds that can be set to the particle dark matter physical properties. The two methods that we investigate are the application of a Wiener filter and the exploitation of the full multi-tracer information. After identifying the optimal strategies, we show that the adoption of a Wiener filter in the cross-correlation analysis can improve the sensitivity to the dark matter annihilation rate by a factor of 2/2.5 as compared to the standard analysis where no filter is applied. The inclusion of the full multi-tracer information can improve the sensitivity up to a factor of 5 for dark matter masses below about 50 GeV, the Wiener filter remaining the best option for heavier dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1-2 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</a><span class="id">[2508.10514]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we present evidence for evolving dark energy using baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), combined with different Type Ia supernova calibrations (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5YR, and Union3) and the CMB compressed likelihood. In our analysis, we examined several dark energy models, including the Logarithmic, Exponential, CPL, BA, JBP, Thawing, Mirage, and GEDE parameterizations. We found that the evidence for evolving dark energy in the DESI measurements is primarily driven by the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers, as their combination yields a preferred value of $\omega_0 &gt; -1$. Further extending our analysis by combining other measurements, we find that all evolving dark energy models favor evolving dark energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$ (Quintom-B). Indeed, our results show a departure from the $\Lambda$CDM model at a significance level of up to $3$-$3.6\sigma$, with the DES-SN5YR sample showing the most significant deviation. When we exclude low-$z$ SNe Ia measurements from the DES-SN5YR sample, we find that the preference for evolving dark energy is significantly biased by the low-redshift ($z &lt; 0.01$) supernova sample. The evolution of $\omega(z)$ shows a phantom crossing around $z \sim 0.5$ in most of the dynamical dark energy models, and the evolution of $f_{DE}(z)$ further supports the evolving nature of dark energy. Bayesian analysis of model evidence shows that the inclusion of low-$z$ supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-$z$ data are excluded.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining deviations from $Λ$CDM in the Hubble expansion rate</a><span class="id">[2508.17848]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $\Lambda$CDM cosmolgical model has long been regarded as highly successful in accurately describing a wide range of astronomical observations. However, numerous observational findings have also provided hints of discrepancies from the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM framework. We explore a phenomenological model that quantifies the deviation of the Hubble expansion rate from the standard scenario, which is expressed as $H^{2}(z) = H^{2}_{\rm \Lambda CDM}(\Omega_m, z)[1+\delta(z)]$. We consider three distinct forms for the deviation parameter $\delta(z)$: in model I, $\delta(z)=\delta_c$; in model II, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}z/(1+z)$, and in model III, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}{\rm ln}(1+z)$. Here, $\delta_c$ represents a constant value. We utilize a comprehensive set of observational data to constrain the models. Our results show that for most combined datasets, $\delta_c$ tends to take on negative values for models I and II, while consistently taking positive values in model III. Furthermore, we find that both models I and II remain consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model across all datasets examined. In contrast, model III exhibits a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model, exceeding $2\sigma$ for the full combined datastes. The AIC indicates that models I and II are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model, whereas model III is preferred over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, with the $\Lambda$CDM model being disfavored for the combined datasets DESI BAO + CMB + CC + DESY5. These results suggest that the Hubble expansion rate likely deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LOFAR constraints on the repetition &amp; environments of CHIME FRBs</a><span class="id">[2509.01688]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The behaviour of fast radio bursts (FRBs) at radio frequencies &lt;400 MHz is not well understood due to very few detections, with only two known sources detected below 300 MHz. Characterising low-frequency emission of FRBs is vital for understanding FRB emission mechanisms and circumburst environments. We robustly characterise the 150 MHz activity CHIME-detected FRB sources relative to their 600 MHz activity – using their non-detection in 473 h of archival observations from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS), and 252 h of LOFAR observations of 14 repeating FRB sources, the largest sub-300 MHz targeted FRB campaign to date. In the LOTAAS data, we search for repeat bursts from 33 CHIME/FRB repeaters, 10 candidate repeaters and 430 apparent non-repeaters. Their non-detection yields a population-level constraint on the statistical spectral index $\alpha_{s, 150MHz/600MHz}&gt;-0.9$, indicating that FRB spectral indices are, on average, flatter than known spectral indices from pulsars. From the targeted campaign, we find that the prolific repeater FRB 20201124A shows a positive $\alpha_s&gt;0.55$, implying reduced low-frequency activity, unlike the typically negative $\alpha_{s}$ seen from FRBs at higher frequency bands. We explore free-free absorption in the circumburst environment as a cause of the non-detection at 150 MHz. The non-detection of FRB 20201124A is consistent with either a very young $\sim10$ yr old supernova remnant, or a typical HII region. Our simulations indicate that LOFAR2.0 can detect 0.3-9 FRBs per week, and up to 4 FRBs at redshifts in the range $1&lt;z&lt;3$. Such detections will provide robust constraints on cosmological parameters due to their clean environments. Our results guide future low-frequency FRB searches by showing how even non-detections can place meaningful constraints on the repetition rates and circumburst environments of FRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unified dark fluid with null sound speed as an alternative to phantom dark energy</a><span class="id">[2509.16155]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent BAO measurements from DESI, when combined with CMB and supernovae data, suggest evolving dark energy and in particular point to a possible phantom regime, with an equation of state parameter $w&lt;-1$. We explore an alternative phenomenological way to model dark matter and dark energy based on a unified dark fluid (UDF). By construction, our model reproduces the same background expansion history as DESI's best-fit using the CPL parametrization, but assumes a vanishing rest-frame sound speed and no anisotropic stress. This simple prescription ensures a consistent and physical treatment of perturbations and, in our case, the use of a unified dark sector avoids phantom behaviour. We model CMB, LSS, and redshift-space distortion observables, and find mostly small differences with CPL, suggesting that while stage IV CMB and galaxy surveys will be able to test these models, achieving a decisive distinction between them may prove challenging on linear scales. At the non-linear level, we study spherical collapse in the UDF and show that within this framework, structure formation proceeds very similarly to standard scenarios. Using Planck, DESI BAO DR2, and DES Y5 supernovae data, we demonstrate that this simple UDF model fits current observations nearly as well as CPL, while treating perturbations consistently. Because most cosmological observations are not sensitive to how the dark sector is split, the unified framework can also approximate the phenomenology of interacting dark energy-dark matter scenarios or evolving dark matter, making it a general way to model the data, at least as long as the dark components have a vanishing sound speed, which is the most distinctive feature of our analysis. Our results highlight that a unified dark fluid with evolving equation of state and null sound speed is sufficient to pass current constraints without invoking a phantom component.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hard X-ray view of two $γ$-ray detected low-luminosity active galactic nuclei: NGC 315 and NGC 4261</a><span class="id">[2510.06810]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aims. The accretion disk of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) is a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Our goal is to find evidence of RIAF radiation from LLAGNs with jets and analyze their radiation properties, which also adds samples to future research on LLAGNs. Methods. Weconducted an analysis of the X-ray data obtained from NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of NGC 315 and NGC 4261, encompassing both timing and spectral investigations. The joint X-ray spectra of the two LLAGNs were fitted using various functional forms and radiative models in XSPEC. Results. No significant variability on timescales of days is observed for both NGC 315 and NGC 4261. The X-ray continuum emission of NGC 315 is suitable for cutoff power-law (PL) fitting, yielding a cutoff energy of Ecut = 18.45 keV, which is the lowest value found in LLAGNssofar. In contrast, the X-ray continuum of NGC 4261 is composed of two PL components, with no signs of a cutoff energy. A prominent neutral Fe K{\alpha} line is observed in NGC 315, while an ionized Fe XXV line is seen in NGC 4261. The derived reflection fractions are R = 0.61 for NGC 315 and R = 0.18 for NGC 4579. Neither NGC 315 nor NGC 4261 shows evidence of a Compton reflection bump. Conclusions. The X-ray spectral characteristics support the RIAF emission as the dominant origin of the X-rays in both sources, although an additional soft PL component originating from the inner jet is observed in NGC 4261. The higher reflection fraction compared to other LLAGNs, along with the detection of a neutral Fe K{\alpha} line, suggests the existence of a truncated accretion disk with a relatively small radius in NGC 315. Bremsstrahlung radiation appears to be the dominant cooling mechanism for the plasma in NGC315, while Comptonization within the RIAF is more likely responsible for the X-ray emission in NGC 4261.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A test of Amati relation using HII galaxy distances</a><span class="id">[2510.22979]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use model-independent luminosity distances of 186 HII galaxy observations to address the circularity problem in the Amati relation for Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs).

The former are expected to follow the cosmic star formation rate (SFR), while the latter follows a delayed version of the SFR. However, this division has come under question in several ways, the most prominent being the observational evidence of a significant excess of LGRBs at low redhifts by several independent investigations, summarized in arXiv:2305.15081 . This could indicate that the progenitors of low-redshift LGRBs, whose formation rates are delayed, (similar to that of SGRBs) are compact mergers rather than collapsars. Two recent observations of low-redshift LGRBs show associations with kilonovae, a clear feature of compact mergers. Most results showing this separation are based on analyses of small (less than 200) samples of LGRBs with measured redshifts. The aim of this paper is to use a larger sample of LGRBs. The number of LGRBs with measured redshifts has increased by more than a factor of 2 over the last decade. To this data set we add a sample of LGRBs whose redshifts are estimated using a machine learning (ML) method ( arXiv:2410.13985 ). This, in addition to increasing the sample size, reduces the observational selection bias arising from the process of redshift measurement. To account for this bias, we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron-Petrosian method to establish the degree of correlation between luminosity and redshift, the luminosity evolution, which then allows us to use the Lynden-Bell $C^-$ method to obtain a complete description of the luminosity function. We find similar low redshift excess for the larger sample with measured redshifts. Adding the sources with ML-estimated redshifts, which tend to have more sources in mid-range redshifts, the excess is reduced.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25302" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ringed versus Ringless Worlds: How Poynting-Robertson Drag Shapes Rings across the Solar System</a><span class="id">[2510.25302]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planetary rings are not only ubiquitous around the giant planets in the outer Solar System, but have also been discovered around several small distant bodies. In contrast, no rings have been observed around any inner Solar System objects. To constrain the dynamical origin of this ringed-versus-ringless dichotomy, we employ a numerically cross-checked analytical model of gigayear-scale Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag due to the solar flux acting on an isolated particle, expressed as a function of the host body's heliocentric distance \(\,a_{\mathrm{pla}}\) and the particle radius \(\,r_{\mathrm{par}}\). Here we show that, in the absence of additional perturbations, PR drag alone can explain the observed ring architecture of the Solar System: outer planets and Centaurs/TNOs are able to retain rings for the age of the Solar System, whereas any rings around the inner planets are removed on much shorter timescales. Because the PR-drag lifetime scales steeply with heliocentric distance \(\bigl(\tau_{\mathrm{decay}}\propto a_{\mathrm{pla}}^{2} \,r_{\mathrm{par}}\bigr)\), we predict that forthcoming surveys will reveal an ever-growing population of ring-bearing bodies in the distant Solar System.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">When Magnetic Field Lines Stretch, Snap, and Expand: A New Look at Solar Flares with L-maps</a><span class="id">[2510.27024]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during solar flares remains challenging due to the lack of direct coronal field measurements. Here we combine data-driven MHD simulations of NOAA AR 11158 (Fan et al., 2024) with flare-ribbon and coronal-dimming observations to investigate realistic coronal magnetic-field evolution during an X-class flare. We introduce L-maps, maps of the logarithm of magnetic field line lengths, as a diagnostic tool to track the dynamics of simulated coronal magnetic structures. Variations in L-maps identify flare ribbons through field-line shortening and coronal dimmings through field-line lengthening. Comparison with SDO/AIA observations demonstrates strong morphological and temporal agreement, validating the simulated field evolution. Applying K-means clustering to the L-map temporal profiles, we distinguish three stages of coronal evolution: (1) slow pre-flare rise phase, (2) flare reconnection accompanied by CME rise, and (3) post-reconnection CME expansion. We detect a slow pre-flare rise phase of magnetic field lines rooted in ribbon footpoints and identify a new phenomenon, reconnection dimming, a rapid expansion of reconnected inner flux-rope field lines during the impulsive phase. Our results show that L-maps provide a powerful and physically intuitive framework for bridging simulations and observations and for tracking the full three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during flares.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">89.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral Diversity in Type Ibn Supernovae and the Large Host Offset of SN2024acyl</a><span class="id">[2511.03926]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we first present observations of SN 2024acyl, a normal Type Ibn supernova with a large projected offset ($\sim$35 kpc) from its host galaxy. The low star-formation rate measured at the explosion site raises the possibility that the progenitor of SN 2024acyl may not have been a massive star. We then examine, more broadly, the spectral diversity of Type Ibn supernovae around 20–35 days after peak brightness and identify two distinct groups: Group I, which shows bluer rest-frame optical color and narrower He I emission lines; and Group II, which shows redder rest-frame optical color and broader He I lines. Group I also tends to show higher peak luminosities. The diversity we identify appears to be closely connected to the diversity observed around peak and to persist into late phases ($&gt;80$ days after peak). Given its redder color and broader He I lines, we classify SN 2024acyl as belonging to Group II. Based on the current dataset, we find no clear connection between this spectral diversity and either the host environments of Type Ibn SNe or their pre-explosion activity. The observed diversity in Type Ibn SNe likely reflects differences in circumstellar material properties and/or explosion energetics. These differences could result from a range of progenitor properties, such as different helium star mass, orbital period and companion type if they are in binary systems, and may indicate fundamentally diverse progenitors. Whether a continuous distribution exists between the two groups remains to be determined and will require further data to explore.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">90.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charge-dependent spectral softenings of primary cosmic-rays from proton to iron below the knee</a><span class="id">[2511.05409]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In most particle acceleration mechanisms, the maximum energy of the cosmic rays can achieve is charge dependent. However, the observational verification of such a fundamental relation is still lack due to the difficulty of measuring the spectra of individual particles from one (kind of) source(s) up to very high energies. This work reports direct measurements of the carbon, oxygen, and iron spectra from   20 gigavolts to   100 teravolts (  60 teravolts for iron) with 9 years of on-orbit data collected by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE). Distinct spectral softenings have been directly detected in these spectra for the first time. Combined with the updated proton and helium spectra, the spectral softening appears universally at a rigidity of   15 teravolts. A nuclei mass dependent softening is rejected at a confidence level of &gt; 99.999%. Taking into account the correlated structures at similar energies in the large-scale anisotropies of cosmic rays, one of the most natural interpretations of the spectral structures is the presence of a nearby cosmic ray source. In this case, the softening energies correspond to the acceleration upper limits of such a source, forming the so-called Peters cycle of the spectra. The results thus offer observational verification of the long-standing prediction of the charge-dependent energy limit of cosmic ray acceleration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Regression to the Mean of Extreme Geomagnetic Storms</a><span class="id">[2201.02137]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extreme space weather events on Earth occur during intervals of strong solar wind driving. The solar wind drives plasma convection and currents in the near-Earth space environment. For low values of the driver, the Earth's response is linear, estimated by parameters such as the polar cap index based on ground magnetometer activity. Curiously, for extreme solar wind driving, the Earth's response appears not to increase beyond a saturation limit. Theorists have advanced a host of explanations for this saturation effect, but there is no consensus. Here, we demonstrate that the saturation is a manifestation of the regression to the mean effect resulting from random uncertainty in the time and magnitude of solar wind measurements. Our results reveal that data analysis underpinning the saturation theories is non-linearly biased; hence, the theories must be validated against the correct solar wind data. Correcting for the uncertainties reveals that the Earth's response to solar wind driving is linear throughout, and the impact of extreme geomagnetic storms can be twice as large as previously thought. We show that regression to the mean is a fundamental property of the relationship between measurement and the truth, where the truth corresponding to the measurement is closer to the mean. This effect is particularly pronounced for uncertain measurements of extreme values and is likely to manifest across various fields, from extreme climate studies to chronic medical pain.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">92.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symmetry energy dependence of the bulk viscosity of nuclear matter</a><span class="id">[2504.07805]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We clarify how the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity $\zeta$ and the bulk relaxation time $\tau_\Pi$ of neutrino-transparent $npe$ matter depend on the nuclear symmetry energy.

Starting with a Lagrangian formalism, we derive the Dirac equation and develop the harmonic analysis of spinor fields, extending previous treatments in the Mixmaster universe. We solve the Dirac equations for non-rotating and rotating axisymmetric Bianchi IX spacetimes using a fixed-background approximation. We find that spatial anisotropy induces spin-dependent energy splittings, while global rotation produces particle-antiparticle asymmetries in the energy spectra, effects absent in FLRW models. These results demonstrate that spacetime geometry alone can imprint nontrivial structure on particle spectra, suggesting that geometric effects may contribute to the matter-antimatter asymmetry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">97.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sommerfeld Enhancement from Quantum Forces for Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2507.12522]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quantum forces are long-range interactions that arise only at the loop level. In this work, we study the Sommerfeld enhancement of dark matter (DM) annihilation cross sections caused by quantum forces. One notable feature of quantum forces is that they are subject to coherent enhancement in the presence of a background of mediator particles, which occurs in many situations in cosmology. We show that this effect has important implications for the Sommerfeld enhancement and DM physics. For the first time, we calculate the Sommerfeld factor induced by quantum forces for both bosonic and fermionic mediators, including the background corrections. We observe several novel features of the Sommerfeld factor that do not exist in the case of the Yukawa potential, such as temperature-induced resonance peaks for massless mediators, and having both enhancement and suppression effects in the same model with different DM masses. As direct applications, we discuss the DM phenomenology affected by the Sommerfeld enhancement from quantum forces, including thermal freeze-out, CMB spectral distortion from DM annihilation, and DM indirect detection. We highlight one particularly interesting effect relevant to indirect detection caused by the Sommerfeld enhancement in a non-thermal background of bosonic mediators in the galaxy, in which case the DM mass is shifted due to the background correction and the effective cross section for DM annihilation can be either enhanced or suppressed. This may be important for DM searches in the Milky Way or its satellite galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">98.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Limits on Exotic Muon Interactions Mediated by Axion-Like Particles</a><span class="id">[2508.00504]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The precise measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$ provides a sensitive probe of exotic interactions between muons mediated by light beyond the Standard Model (BSM) bosons.

Our analysis is based on an extensive set of simulated gravitational-wave (GW) signals, including both general relativistic and non-GR sources, injected into zero-noise data colored by the noise power spectral densities of the LIGO and Virgo GW detectors at their designed sensitivities. We evaluate the performance of PCA-based methods in the context of two established frameworks: TIGER and FTI. For GR-consistent signals, we find that PCA enables stringent constraints on potential deviations from GR, even in the presence of multiple free parameters. Applying the method to simulated signals that explicitly violate GR, we demonstrate that PCA is effective at identifying such deviations. We further test the method using numerical relativity waveforms of eccentric binary black hole systems and show that missing physical effects–such as orbital eccentricity–can lead to apparent violations of GR if not properly included in the waveform models used for analysis. Finally, we apply our PCA-based test to selected real gravitational-wave events from GWTC-3, including GW190814 and GW190412. We present joint constraints from selected binary black hole events in GWTC-3, finding that the 90% credible bound on the most informative PCA parameter is $0.03^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ in the TIGER framework and $-0.01^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ in the FTI framework, both of which are consistent with GR. These results highlight the sensitivity and robustness of the PCA-based approach and demonstrate its readiness for application to future observational data from the fourth observing runs of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">100.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09892" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What do the fundamental constants of physics tell us about life?</a><span class="id">[2509.09892]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the 1970s, the renowned physicist Victor Weisskopf famously developed a research program to qualitatively explain properties of matter in terms of the fundamental constants of physics. But there was one type of matter prominently missing from Weisskopf's analysis: life. Here, we develop Weisskopf-style arguments demonstrating how the fundamental constants of physics can be used to understand the properties of living systems. By combining biophysical arguments and dimensional analysis, we show that vital properties of chemical self-replicators, such as growth yield, minimum doubling time, and minimum power consumption in dormancy, can be quantitatively estimated using fundamental physical constants. The calculations highlight how the laws of physics constrain chemistry-based life on Earth, and if it exists, elsewhere in our universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">101.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11244" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydrodynamic properties in soliton field theory</a><span class="id">[2510.11244]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The crucial role of hydrodynamic instabilities in soliton field theory is revealed. We demonstrate that the essential of soliton formation mechanism is the sound mode instability induced by thermodynamic instability. This instability triggers phase separation, where new thermal phases are generated to produce solitons. These solitons can be regarded as a coexistence state composed of a matter phase and a vacuum phase, with an interface providing surface tension to maintain dynamical equilibrium. The phase separation mechanism naturally allows the existence of vacuum bubbles, characterized by a vacuum phase surrounded by a matter phase with negative pressure. Furthermore, we show that the soliton interface resembles a fluid membrane, whose interface pressure satisfies a Young-Laplace-type relation, resulting in the emergence of the membrane instability induced by surface tension. In the thin-wall limit, the dispersion relation is analytically derived. This instability triggers topological transition of the interface, splitting a cylindrical interface into multiple spheres with a smaller total surface area. Such results highlight the duality between solitons and fluids, providing a field theory description for hydrodynamics with interfaces.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">102.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective matter sectors from modified entropies</a><span class="id">[2511.04613]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a general formalism linking modified entropy functions directly to a modified spacetime metric and, subsequently, to an effective matter sector of entropic origin. In particular, within the framework of general relativity, starting from the first law of black-hole thermodynamics we establish an explicit correspondence between the entropy derivative and the metric function, which naturally leads to an emergent stress-energy tensor representing an anisotropic effective fluid. This backreaction effect of horizon entropy may resolve possible inconsistencies recently identified in black hole physics with modified entropies. As specific examples, we apply this procedure to a wide class of modified entropies, such as Barrow, Tsallis-Cirto, Renyi, Kaniadakis, logarithmic, power-law, loop-quantum-gravity, and exponential modifications, and we derive the associated effective matter sectors, analyzing their physical properties and energy conditions.</p></div></details></article></body>
