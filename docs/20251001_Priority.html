Circumnebular extinction variations and their effect on the planetary nebulae luminosity function</a><span class="id">[2509.25306]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For decades, the theoretical understanding of planetary nebulae (PNe) has remained in tension with the observed universal bright-end cutoff of the PN luminosity function (PNLF). While the brightest younger PN populations are expected to be brighter in their [OIII] emission than observed, recent studies have proposed circumnebular extinction to be a key ingredient for bringing their brightness down to the observed bright end. In this work we use the recently introduced PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations) framework to investigate the impact of different circumnebular extinction treatments on the modeled PNe and their PNLF for a large range of stellar ages and metallicities. We test how different slopes in the observed relation of extinction versus central star mass modify the bright-end cutoffs of the PNLF, finding that steeper slopes lead to large changes for young stellar populations. In contrast, the differences for older PNe are much smaller. However, for individual PNe, the extinctions observed in nearby galaxies appear to be much higher than the models predict, showing that improvements on both the modeling and observational sides are needed to gain a better understanding of the brightest and strongly extincted PNe. These findings further advance the theoretical foundation for interpreting observed extragalactic PN populations coming from more complex composite stellar populations in the future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living the stream: Properties and progenitors of tidal shells and streams around galaxies from Magneticum</a><span class="id">[2509.25307]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar shells and streams are remnants of satellite galaxies visible around galaxies. Advances in low-surface-brightness observations and increasing resolution of cosmological simulations now allow investigating the properties and origin of these features. The metallicity, age, and velocity dispersion of shells and streams are investigated to infer their progenitor galaxies properties. We employed the hydrodynamical cosmological simulations Magneticum Pathfinder to extract these properties and identify the progenitors of the shells and streams. We compared to observational results from surveys and individual galaxies, matching and testing the methodology used in observations. Mock observations of shells and streams agree well with observational data regarding their morphology and spatial distribution. We find that both types of features are associated with localized depressions in stellar velocity dispersion compared to the surrounding regions. They are not as clearly distinct in metallicity and ages, though overall shells and more metal rich and streams are younger. We confirm results from idealized models that shells form commonly from radial major mergers but also through minor mergers, while streams usually form from minor mergers on circular orbits. We do not find the widths of streams to correlate with the half-mass radii of their progenitors, but the progenitors follow the mass-metallicity relation. On average, the masses measured for shells and streams approximately corresponds to 20% of the progenitor mass. We introduce a class of star-forming streams, which originate from in-situ star formation rather than the disruption of a satellite galaxy. Measuring stellar population properties of shells and streams provides the means to reconstruct the progenitor properties, and especially distinguish those streams that are not made through the disruption of a galaxy but formed in-situ.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25309" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-explosive pre-supernova feedback in the COLIBRE model of galaxy formation</a><span class="id">[2509.25309]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the implementation and testing of a subgrid non-explosive pre-supernova (NEPS) feedback module for the COLIBRE model of galaxy formation. The NEPS module incorporates three key physical processes sourced by young, massive stars that act immediately following star formation: momentum injection from stellar winds and radiation pressure, and thermal energy from photoheating in HII regions. The age- and metallicity-dependent energy and momentum budgets are derived from BPASS stellar population models and are coupled self-consistently to the local gas properties. We test the model using a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated, unstable gaseous disks at various numerical resolutions (gas particle masses in the range $10^4-10^6$ $\rm M_{\odot}$). We find that the NEPS module successfully regulates star formation by providing pressure support that prevents catastrophic gas collapse. This regulation improves the numerical convergence of star formation rates and disk structure. In our model, feedback from HII regions is the dominant regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate a crucial synergy with subsequent supernova feedback; NEPS feedback pre-processes the interstellar medium, creating a more homogeneous environment that moderates the effect of explosive feedback from supernova events. Our NEPS module thus provides a physically motivated and numerically robust framework that mitigates resolution-dependent artefacts and promotes self-regulated galaxy growth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25310" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MUSE study of two giant low surface brightness galaxies with compact satellites</a><span class="id">[2509.25310]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Giant low-surface-brightness disk galaxies (gLSBGs) are rare objects with disk radii up-to 160 kpc and dynamical masses of an order of up to 10$^{12}$ $M_{\odot}$. Their very existence challenges currently accepted theories of galaxy formation and evolution, as it is difficult to build such large, dynamically cold disks through mergers without destroying them. We present deep MUSE mosaic observations of two nearby gLSBGs with compact elliptical satellites: UGC 1382, which hosts a globally counter-rotating gaseous disk, and AGC 192040, which does not. We analyze properties of ionized gas and present spatially resolved kinematics and metallicity maps; as well as stellar population analysis for the central regions of the galaxies. The radial gradients of gas-phase metallicities are flat for both galaxies. Our estimates of the effective oxygen yield suggest 'passive' gas in the outskirts of both stellar systems that is not involved in star formation. Our observational data indicate that both galaxies experienced mergers several Gyrs ago. However, the scenarios of formation of giant disks appear to be slightly different for these two systems. For AGC 192040 we propose the gas accretion from the filament followed by the intermediate-mass ratio merger with the companion on a prograde orbit. For UGC 1382 multiple gas-rich mergers with companions on retrograde orbits are preferred by the data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo Properties from Observable Measures of Environment: II. Central versus Satellite Classification</a><span class="id">[2509.25312]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A physical understanding of galaxy formation and evolution benefits from an understanding of the connections between galaxies, their host dark matter halos, and their environments. In particular, interactions with more-massive neighbors can leave lasting imprints on both galaxies and their hosts. Distinguishing between populations of galaxies with differing environments and interaction histories is therefore essential for isolating the role of environment in shaping galaxy properties. We present a novel neural-network based method, which takes advantage of observable measures of a galaxy and its environment to recover whether it (1) is a central or a satellite, (2) has experienced an interaction with a more massive neighbor, and (3) is currently orbiting or infalling onto such a neighbor. We find that projected distances to, redshift separations of, and relative stellar masses with respect to a galaxy's 25 nearest neighbors are sufficient to distinguish central from satellite halos in $&gt; 90\%$ of cases, with projection effects accounting for most classification errors. Our method also achieves high accuracy in recovering interaction history and orbital status, though the network struggles to distinguish between splashback and infalling systems in some cases due to the lack of velocity information. With careful treatment of the uncertainties introduced by projection and other observational limitations, this method offers a new avenue for studying the role of environment in galaxy formation and evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray shocks in the cool cores of galaxy clusters: insights from TNG-Cluster</a><span class="id">[2509.25314]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Shock fronts driven by active galactic nuclei in galaxy cluster cores represent a promising mechanism to heat the intracluster gas by converting kinetic energy into thermal energy through gas compression, thereby offsetting radiative cooling. Despite their potential importance, such shocks are challenging to detect, requiring deep X-ray exposures, and have only been identified in ten clusters. We present the first systematic detection and characterization of AGN-driven shocks in simulated clusters from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxies. TNG-Cluster exhibits a rich variety of X-ray structures, including realistic populations of X-ray cavities, as well as shocks, produced by its AGN feedback model, without collimated, relativistic jets, nor cosmic rays. We produce mock Chandra observations with deep exposure times, for a sample of 100 clusters, mass-matched (M$_{500c}=1.2$ - $8.5 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$) to the ten observed clusters with shocks. Using observational techniques, we identify shocks through surface brightness edges fitted with broken power laws and associated density and temperature jumps. We detect 50 shocks in 30 of the 100 clusters, with  35% hosting multiple shocks. These shocks lie within a hundred kiloparsec of the central SMBH, are weak (Mach number &lt; 2, median   1.1), and are associated with cavities in about half of the cases. Both in observations and in TNG-Cluster, shocks tend to be located at larger radii than cavities, with median offsets of 46 and 27 kpc, respectively. The observationally inferred shock powers are comparable to the cluster cooling luminosities (10$^{44-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$), suggesting that shocks in the simulation are crucial heating mechanisms. Our results indicate that shocks play a role as important as cavities in balancing cooling in cluster cores, acting isotropically and up to larger distances.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[C/N] Ages for Red Giants and their Implications for Galactic Archaeology</a><span class="id">[2509.25321]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Red giants undergo the first dredge-up, a mixing event that creates a connection between their surface [C/N] and their mass and age. We derive a [C/N]-Age relationship for red giants calibrated on APOGEE DR17 abundances and APOKASC-3 asteroseismic ages. We find that we can use [C/N] to reliably recover asteroseismic ages between 1 and 10 Gyr with average uncertainties of 1.64 Gyr. We find that [C/N] yields concordant ages, with modest offsets, for stars in different evolutionary states. We also find that the [C/N]-birth mass relationship is robust for luminous giants, and argue that this is an advantage over direct asteroseismology for these stars. We use our ages to infer Galactic birth abundance trends in [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] as a function of position in the Galactic disk. We filter out stars with kinematic or chemical properties consistent with migrators and found the number of migrators to be much lower than expected by standard radial migration prescriptions. The remaining population shows weak chemical evolution trends, on the order of 0.01 dex/Gyr, over the last 10 Gyr across a wide range of radii.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Untangling the Complex Nature of AGN Variability with Fairall 9</a><span class="id">[2509.25324]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The accretion flow in AGN is not well understood, motivating intensive monitoring campaigns of multiwavelength variability to probe its structure. One of the best of these is the 3 year optical/UV/X-ray approximately daily monitoring campaign on Fairall 9, a fairly typical moderate accretion rate AGN. The UV lightcurve shows a clear increase over $\sim 50$ days between years 1 and 2, strongly coherent with the X-ray lightcurve rise. This changes the average spectral energy distribution such that the disc component is stronger while the X-ray spectrum steepens, so that the total X-ray power remains roughly constant. Outside of this global change, we apply a Fourier resolved analysis to test stochastic models where intrinsic fluctuations in the UV disc propagate down into the hard X-ray emission region via both changing the seed photon flux for Compton scattering (short light travel timescale) and changing the electron density (longer propagation timescale). Unlike these models, the hard X-rays are not particularly well correlated with the UV, and also have the wrong sign in that the hard X-rays marginally lead the UV fluctuations. We show that this is instead consistent with uncorrelated stochastic fluctuations in both the UV (slow) and X-ray (fast), which are linked together only weakly via light travel time. These variability properties, as well as the changes in the SED, has implications for our understanding of AGN structure and physics, as well as future monitoring campaigns.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AVISM: Algorithm for Void Identification in coSMology</a><span class="id">[2509.25329]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic voids are key elements in our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe. They are crucial to constrain cosmological parameters, understand the structure formation and evolution of our Universe, and they could also be pristine laboratories for studying galaxy formation without all the hassle due to environmental effects. Thus, the ability to accurately and consistently identify voids, both in numerical simulations and in observations, becomes mandatory. We present Algorithm for Void Identification in coSMology (AVISM), a new void finder for analysing both cosmological simulation outputs and observational galaxy catalogues. In the first case, the code should handle raw particle or cell data, dark matter halos or synthetic galaxy catalogues. In the case of observational data, the code should be coupled with external tools providing with the required dynamical information to apply the algorithm. A set of numerical tests designed to assess the code's capabilities are carried out. AVISM's performance is also compared, both statistically and on a one-to-one basis, with the DIVE and ZOBOV state-of-the-art void finders using as input a dark matter halo catalogue from a large-volume cosmological simulation. An application to a galaxy survey is provided to demonstrate the code's ability to handle real data. We have designed a new void finder algorithm that combines geometrical and dynamical information to identify void regions plus a hierarchical merging process to reconstruct the whole 3D structure of the void. The outcome of this process is a void catalogue with complex boundaries without assuming a prior shape. This process can be repeated at different levels of resolution using finer grids, leading to a list of voids-in-voids and a proper description of void substructure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25335" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The SAGA Survey. VI. The Size-Mass Relation for Low-Mass Galaxies Across Environments</a><span class="id">[2509.25335]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate how Milky Way-like environments influence the sizes and structural properties of low-mass galaxies by comparing satellites of Milky Way analogs from the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey with two control samples: an environmentally agnostic population from the SAGA background (SAGAbg) sample and isolated galaxies from the SDSS NASA-Sloan Atlas. All sizes and structural parameters are measured uniformly using pysersic to ensure consistency across samples. We find the half-light sizes of SAGA satellites are systematically larger than those of isolated galaxies, with the magnitude of the offset ranging from 0.05 to 0.12 dex (10-24%) depending on the comparison sample and completeness cuts. This corresponds to physical size differences between 85-200 pc at 10^7.5 solar masses and 220-960 pc at 10^10 solar masses. This offset persists among star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environment can influence the structure of low-mass galaxies even before it impacts quenching. The intrinsic scatter in the size-mass relation is lower for SAGA satellites than isolated galaxies, and the Sérsic index distributions of satellites and isolated galaxies are similar. In comparison to star-forming satellites, quenched SAGA satellites have a slightly shallower size-mass relation and rounder morphologies at low-mass, suggesting that quenching is accompanied by structural transformation and that the processes responsible differ between low- and high-mass satellites. Our results show that environmental processes can imprint measurable structural differences on satellites in Milky Way-mass halos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25340" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The spatially-resolved effect of mergers on the stellar mass assembly of MaNGA galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.25340]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the origin of stars within a galaxy - whether formed in-situ or accreted from other galaxies (ex-situ) - is key to constraining its evolution. Spatially resolving these components provides crucial insights into a galaxy's mass assembly history. We aim to predict the spatial distribution of ex-situ stellar mass fraction in MaNGA galaxies, and to identify distinct assembly histories based on the radial gradients of these predictions in the central regions. We employ a diffusion model trained on mock MaNGA analogs (MaNGIA), derived from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. The model learns to predict the posterior distribution of resolved ex-situ stellar mass fraction maps, conditioned on stellar mass density, velocity, and velocity dispersion gradient maps. After validating the model on an unseen test set from MaNGIA, we apply it to MaNGA galaxies to infer the spatially-resolved distribution of their ex-situ stellar mass fractions - i.e. the fraction of stellar mass in each spaxel originating from mergers. We identify four broad categories of ex-situ mass distributions: flat gradient, in-situ dominated; flat gradient, ex-situ dominated; positive gradient; and negative gradient. The vast majority of MaNGA galaxies fall in the first category - flat gradients with low ex-situ fractions - confirming that in-situ star formation is the main assembly driver for low- to intermediate-mass galaxies. At high stellar masses, the ex-situ maps are more diverse, highlighting the key role of mergers in building the most massive systems. Ex-situ mass distributions correlate with morphology, star-formation activity, stellar kinematics, and environment, indicating that accretion history is a primary factor shaping massive galaxies. Finally, by tracing their assembly histories in TNG50, we link each class to distinct merger scenarios, ranging from secular evolution to merger-dominated growth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seeking Kinematic Association of Known FU Orionis Stars with Young Clusters in Cygnus</a><span class="id">[2509.25341]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Kinematic studies of young stars and star clusters have increased our understanding of the process of star formation and evolution in the Milky Way. FU Orionis objects are a specific class of young stellar object notable for their extremely high disk-to-star accretion rates. We use parallax and proper motion information from the Gaia astrometric survey to study five known FU Ori stars towards the Cygnus clouds, in the distance range  500-900 parsecs, and seek evidence of their kinematic association with proximal stellar groups or clusters. We develop multiple search criteria within the Gaia datasets to look for nearby stellar aggregates and to reliably isolate their likely member stars. We show that V1057 Cygni and HBC 722 are kinematically consistent with the 3D locations as well as the inferred proper motion fields of the North America Nebula cluster. We show a similar association of V1515 Cygni with NGC 6914 in the Cygnus-X region, and of V2494 Cygni with stars in the dark cloud LDN 1003 and Braid Nebula. Further, we find that V1735 Cygni is consistent in both position and proper motion with the streamer structure of IC 5146, and we trace the streamer's similar proper motions to the main cluster. Color-magnitude diagrams of all identified clusters show the presence of pre-main-sequence populations, strengthening the likelihood of a physical association between the young FU Ori stars and their respective nearby clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning the Dark Matter Halo Mass of the Milky Way</a><span class="id">[2509.25362]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although numerous dynamical techniques have been developed to estimate the total dark matter halo mass of the Milky Way, it remains poorly constrained, with typical systematic uncertainties of 0.3 dex. In this study, we apply a neural network-based approach that achieves high mass precision without several limitations that have affected past approaches; for example, we do not assume dynamical equilibrium, nor do we assume that neighboring galaxies are bound satellites. Additionally, this method works for a broad mass range, including for halos that differ significantly from the Milky Way. Our model relies solely on observable dynamical quantities, such as satellite orbits, distances to larger nearby halos, and the maximum circular velocity of the most massive satellite. In this paper, we measure the halo mass of the Milky Way to be $\log_{10} M_\mathrm{vir}/\Msun = 12.20^{+0.163}_{-0.138}$. Future studies in this series will extend this methodology to estimate the dark matter halo mass of M31, and develop new neural networks to infer additional halo properties including concentration, assembly history, and spin axis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25363" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Stellar Mass and Age Distributions of Star-Forming Clumps at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 5$ in JWST CANUCS: Implications for Clump Formation and Destruction</a><span class="id">[2509.25363]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the resolved properties of star-forming clumps and their host galaxies at $0.5&lt;z&lt;5$ in the JWST CANUCS fields. We find that the fraction of clumpy galaxies peaks near $z\sim2$ for galaxies with masses of $\log(M_{g,*}/M_\odot)\geq10$, while galaxies with masses of $8.5 \leq \log(M_{g,*}/M_\odot) &lt; 10$ show lower clumpy fractions with little redshift evolution. We identify and measure individual clump masses, finding that the aggregated clump stellar mass function (cSMF) follows a power-law slope of $\alpha = -2$ across all redshift bins, broadly consistent with \textit{in-situ} clump formation. However, when split by galaxy masses, the cSMF is found to be flatter ($\alpha\sim-1.6$) for massive galaxies and steeper ($\alpha\sim-2.3$) for lower mass galaxies, with little redshift evolution in both cases. We explore how different formation mechanisms and disruptive processes affect the shape of the clump mass function. In particular, we find that the cSMF slope is flatter with increasing gas fractions in younger clump populations ($&lt;300$ Myr old), suggesting that higher gas availability leads to more massive clumps forming at the time of formation. Alternatively, many high-redshift galaxies in the sample have disturbed morphologies and simulations show that clumps of \textit{ex-situ} origins can flatten the cSMF slope. We also investigate the evolution of clump populations, where we find the cSMF slope become flatter as clumps evolve and age. We interpret this as an indication of the long-term survivability of massive clumps, with feedback mechanisms preferentially disrupting low-mass clumps. Overall, the galaxy-mass dependent cSMF and age distribution point to a complex history for clumps, involving different and competing mechanisms for their formation and destruction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Co-SOM: Co-training for photometric redshift estimation using Self-Organizing Maps</a><span class="id">[2509.25366]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The upcoming galaxy large-scale surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will generate photometry for billions of galaxies. The interpretation of large-scale weak lensing maps, as well as the estimation of galaxy clustering, requires reliable redshifts with high precision for multi-band photometry. However, obtaining spectroscopy for billions of galaxies is impractical and complex; therefore, having a sufficiently large number of galaxies with spectroscopic observations to train supervised algorithms for accurate redshift estimation is a significant challenge and an open research area. We propose a novel methodology called Co-SOM, based on Co-training and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), integrating labeled (sources with spectroscopic redshifts) and unlabeled (sources with photometric observations only) data during the training process, through a selection method based on map topology (connectivity structure of the SOM lattice) to leverage the limited spectroscopy available for photo-z estimation. We utilized the magnitudes and colors of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 18 (SDSS-DR18) to analyze and evaluate the performance, varying the proportion of labeled data and adjusting the training parameters. For training sets of 1% of labeled data ($\approx 20{,}000$ galaxies) we achieved a performance of bias $\Delta z = 0.00007 \pm 0.00022$, precision $\sigma_{zp} = 0.00063 \pm 0.00032$, and outlier fraction $f_{\mathrm{out}} = 0.02083 \pm 0.00027$. Additionally, we conducted experiments varying the volume of labeled data, and the bias remains below $10^{-3}$, regardless of the size of the spectroscopic or photometric data. These low-redshift results demonstrate the potential of semi-supervised learning to address spectroscopic limitations in future photometric surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assessing Self-Absorbed Molecular Lines as Tracers of Gravitational Collapse</a><span class="id">[2509.25399]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Redshifted self-absorption features in molecular lines are commonly interpreted as signatures of gravitational collapse in pre- and protostellar cores. The shape of the line profile then encodes information on the dynamics of the collapse. There exist well-established observational techniques to estimate infall velocities from these profiles, but these have historically been calibrated on constant-velocity slab models, whereas more realistic simulations of gravitational collapse produce highly non-uniform radial velocity profiles. We produce synthetic line observations of a simulated collapsing prestellar core, including a treatment of the time-dependent chemical evolution. Applying observational techniques to the synthetic line profiles, we find that the estimated infall velocities are significantly and systematically lower than the mass-weighted infall velocities from the simulation. This is primarily because the self-absorption features tend to originate from the outer regions of the core, well beyond the location of the peak infall velocity. Velocities and mass accretion rates measured via these techniques are likely to underestimate the true values.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25440" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Near-Infrared Extinction and Reddening Map Towards the Galactic Bulge Using UKIRT</a><span class="id">[2509.25440]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Galactic bulge is one of the most information-dense regions to study resolved stellar populations, variables, and transients, such as microlensing events. Studies toward the Galactic bulge are complicated by the large and variable extinction along the line of sight. We measure the near-infrared $A_{K_S}$ extinction and $E(H-K_S)$ reddening in this region using $H$- and $K$-band photometry obtained with the 2017 UKIRT microlensing survey. We fit the apparent magnitude and color distribution of bright giants in the bulge to recover the apparent magnitude and color of Red Clump stars, which are known to be standard candles and crayons. We present $2^\prime \times 2^\prime$ resolution maps in UKIRT fields between $-2.15^{\circ} \le l \le 2.71^{\circ}$ and $-2.69^{\circ} \le b \le 2.03^{\circ}$ of the $A_{K_S}$ extinction and the $E(H-K_S)$ reddening. We find large variations in the $K_S$-band extinction and $E(H-K_S)$ reddening on all the scales we probe. We find that a constant, standard extinction law is a poor representation of the relationship between the extinction and reddening we measure in fields of different latitudes. These maps will be useful for understanding the near-infrared extinction law for sight lines close to the Galactic plane, as well as for final field selection for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shocked, Heated, and Now Resolved: H$_2$ excitation in the low-luminosity AGN at M58 core with JWST</a><span class="id">[2509.25483]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present \textit{JWST} NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations of the central kiloparsec of M58 (NGC 4579), a nearby LINER galaxy hosting a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN; $L_\mathrm{bol} \sim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) with a low-power jet. These data provide an unprecedented view of the warm molecular gas phase and reveal clear signatures of feedback. We detect 44 H$_2$ lines, including bright pure rotational lines (S(1)-S(18)) and rovibrational lines up to $\nu=2$, probing a wide range of excitation conditions. Excitation diagrams show that rotational lines follow a power-law temperature distribution with an exponential cutoff, consistent with heating by low-velocity shocks. H$_2$ rovibrational lines deviate from thermal models primarily because of sub-thermal excitation at low density. Additionally, there may be a 10% contribution by AGN X-ray heating in the nucleus. The dust lanes associated with the spiral inflow appear dynamically undisturbed but show signs of shock heating, while the inner $\sim$200 pc exhibits turbulent kinematics produced by outflowing molecular gas. These results reveal the subtle yet measurable impact of LLAGN feedback on the interstellar medium, demonstrating that even weak, vertically oriented jets and low radiative accretion rates can perturb molecular gas and regulate nuclear reservoirs. This study highlights JWST's transformative ability to uncover hidden modes of AGN feedback.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterizing the host galaxies and delay times of Ca-rich gap transients vs 91bg-like SNe and normal Type Ia SNe</a><span class="id">[2509.25577]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Calcium-rich gap transients are a faint, fast-evolving class of supernovae that show strong nebular Ca emission lines. Their progenitor systems are uncertain, but they are often associated with old and quiescent host galaxies. In this work, we compare the properties of the hosts of hydrogen-poor Ca-rich gap transients to the hosts of 3 other classes of supernova (SNe): normal Type Ia, 91bg-like, and Type II. We use data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Census of the Local Universe (CLU) experiment to build up our 4 SNe samples and identify the host galaxies. A combination of precomputed host properties from the CLU catalog and those derived from SED fitting are used to characterize each host's stellar mass, star formation rate, and specific star formation rate (sSFR). We find that the hosts of Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe occupy a similar parameter space of mass and sSFR, and are more massive and quiescent compared to the hosts of Type Ia and Type II SNe. Additionally, we construct delay time distributions (DTDs) for our 4 samples, finding that Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe have the longest peak delay times $\sim 10^4$ Myr, compared to the peak delay times of Type Ia SNe ($\sim 10^3$ Myr) and Type II SNe ($\sim 10$ Myr). The similarity of host environment and DTDs for Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe motivates further analysis of the relationship of these two transient classes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hourglass-shaped Magnetic Fields and Dust Filaments in the HH 211 Protostellar Envelope</a><span class="id">[2509.25764]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic fields influence the structure and evolution of protostellar systems, thus understanding their role is essential for probing the earliest stages of star formation. We present ALMA Band 3 and 6 polarized continuum observations at $\sim$0.5$^{\prime \prime}$ resolution toward the Class 0 protostellar system HH 211. Three dust filaments ($\sim$4000 au in length) are found in the HH 211 protostellar envelope, two of which are aligned with core-scale ($\sim$10,000 au) magnetic fields detected by previous JCMT observations. This result suggests that the formation of the dust filaments may be influenced by magnetic fields. In the inner envelope ($\sim$1000 au), we detect a clear hourglass-shaped magnetic field morphology near the protostar and toroidal fields along the outflow directions. We also estimate the line-of-sight-averaged temperature and column density distributions in the inner envelope and find that the temperature is higher in the east, while the column density is enhanced in the southern and western regions. The southern dense regions of the inner envelope may trace either outflow cavity walls, due to their alignment with the outflow, or possible infalling channels in the midplane, given the close correspondence between the observed magnetic fields and the predicted infall trajectories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hector Galaxy Survey: Data Processing, Quality Control and Early Science</a><span class="id">[2509.25784]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Hector Galaxy Survey is a new optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) survey currently using the AAT to observe up to 15,000 galaxies at low redshift ($z &lt; 0.1$). The Hector instrument employs 21 optical fibre bundles feeding into two double-beam spectrographs to enable wide-field multi-object IFS observations of galaxies. To efficiently process the survey data, we adopt the data reduction pipeline developed for the SAMI Galaxy Survey, with significant updates to accommodate Hector's dual-spectrograph system. These enhancements address key differences in spectral resolution and other instrumental characteristics relative to SAMI, and are specifically optimised for Hector's unique configuration. We introduce a two-dimensional arc fitting approach that reduces the RMS velocity scatter by a factor of 1.2–3.4 compared to fitting arc lines independently for each fibre. The pipeline also incorporates detailed modelling of chromatic optical distortion in the wide-field corrector, to account for wavelength-dependent spatial shifts across the focal plane. We assess data quality through a series of validation tests, including wavelength solution accuracy, spectral resolution, throughput characterisation, astrometric precision, sky subtraction residuals, and flux calibration stability (4\% systematic offset when compared to Legacy Survey fluxes). We demonstrate that Hector delivers high-fidelity, science-ready datasets, supporting robust measurements of galaxy kinematics, stellar populations, and emission-line properties, and provide examples. Additionally, we address systematic uncertainties identified during the data processing and propose future improvements to enhance the precision and reliability of upcoming data releases. This work establishes a robust data reduction framework for Hector, delivering high-quality data products that support a broad range of extragalactic studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FIELDMAPS Data Release: Far-Infrared Polarization in the &quot;Bones&quot; of the Milky Way</a><span class="id">[2509.25832]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polarization observations of the Milky Way and many other spiral galaxies have found a close correspondence between the orientation of spiral arms and magnetic field lines on scales of hundreds of parsecs. This paper presents polarization measurements at 214 $\mu$m toward ten filamentary candidate “bones&quot; in the Milky Way using the High-resolution Airborne Wide-band Camera (HAWC+) on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). These data were taken as part of the Filaments Extremely Long and Dark: A Magnetic Polarization Survey (FIELDMAPS) and represent the first study to resolve the magnetic field in spiral arms at parsec scales. We describe the complex yet well-defined polarization structure of all ten candidate bones, and we find a mean difference and standard deviation of $-74^{\circ} \pm 32^{\circ}$ between their filament axis and the plane-of-sky magnetic field, closer to a field perpendicular to their length rather than parallel. By contrast, the 850 $\mu$m polarization data from \textit{Planck} on scales greater than 10 pc show a nearly parallel mean difference of $3^{\circ} \pm 21^{\circ}$. These findings provide further evidence that magnetic fields can change orientation at the scale of dense molecular clouds, even along spiral arms. Finally, we use a power law to fit the dust polarization fraction as a function of total intensity on a cloud-by-cloud basis and find indices between $-0.6$ and $-0.9$, with a mean and standard deviation of $-0.7 \pm 0.1$. The polarization, dust temperature, and column density data presented in this work are publicly available online.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time-Dependent obscuration of a tidal disruption event candidate in the active galactic nucleus CSS100217</a><span class="id">[2509.25935]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>CSS100217 is considered a peculiar tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate occurring in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Unlike typical TDEs, where the post-flare luminosity is equal to that pre-flare, CSS100217 decayed to $\sim$ 0.4 magnitudes fainter than its pre-flare V band level. In this manuscript, we propose an obscured TDE model to explain the light curve of CSS100217. Assuming that the time-dependent obscuration, caused by the TDE unbound stellar debris, or by nuclear clouds moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH), follows a Weibull distribution, we find that the light curve of CSS100217 can be described by the tidal disruption of a $4.6_{-0.9}^{+0.9}{\rm M_\odot}$ main-sequence star by a $3.3_{-0.3}^{+0.3}\times10^7{\rm M_\odot}$ black hole. The total energy of the event derived from our fit is $7.23\times10^{53}$ ergs and about 1.38 ${\rm M_\odot}$ of debris mass is accreted by the central SMBH. The model indicates that the contribution of the host galaxy to the observed pre-flare optical luminosity is not-significant compared to that of the AGN, which is consistent with the results of the spectral analysis. These results suggest that obscuration may play an important role in explaining the unusual TDE-like variability observed in CSS100217.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating four new candidate redback pulsars discovered in the image plane</a><span class="id">[2509.25943]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper reports the discovery and follow-up of four candidate redback spider pulsars: GPM J1723-33, GPM J1734-28, GPM J1752-30 and GPM J1815-14, discovered with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) from an imaging survey of the Galactic Plane. These sources are considered to be redback candidates based on their eclipsing variability, steep negative spectral indices, and potential Fermi $\gamma$-ray associations, with GPM J1723-33 and GPM J1815-14 lying within a Fermi 95% error ellipse. Follow-up pulsation searches with MeerKAT confirmed pulsations from GPM J1723-33, while the non-detections of the other three are likely due to scattering by material ablated from their companion stars. We identify possible orbital periods by applying folding algorithms to the light curves and determine that all sources have short orbital periods (&lt;24 hours), consistent with redback spider systems. Following up on the sources at multiple radio frequencies revealed that the sources exhibit frequency-dependent eclipses, with longer eclipses observed at lower frequencies. We place broad constraints on the eclipse medium, ruling out induced Compton scattering and cyclotron absorption. Three sources are spatially consistent with optical sources in the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey imaging, which may contain the optical counterparts. Each field is affected by strong dust extinction, and follow-up with large telescopes is needed to identify the true counterparts. Identifying potential radio counterparts to four previously unassociated Fermi sources brings us closer to understanding the origin of the unexplained $\gamma$-ray excess in the Galactic Centre.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26053" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme NiI/FeI abundance ratio in the coma of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</a><span class="id">[2509.26053]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Emission lines of FeI and NiI are commonly found in the coma of solar system comets, even at large heliocentric distances. These atoms are most likely released from the surface of the comet's nucleus or from a short-lived parent. The presence of these lines in cometary spectra is unexpected because the surface blackbody equilibrium temperature is too low to allow the sublimation of refractory minerals containing these metals. These lines were also found in the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov which has a NiI/FeI abundance ratio similar to that observed in solar system comets. On average, this ratio is one order of magnitude higher than the solar Ni/Fe abundance ratio. Here, we report observations of the new interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which were carried out with the ESO Very Large Telescope equipped with the UVES spectrograph. Spectra were obtained at six epochs, at heliocentric distances ranging from 3.14 to 2.14 au. NiI was detected at all epochs. FeI was only detected at heliocentric distances smaller than 2.64 au. We estimated the NiI and FeI production rates by comparing the observed line intensities with those produced by a fluorescence model. Comet 3I exhibits a high production rate of NiI atoms as well as a high NiI/FeI ratio, making it exceptional when compared to solar system comets and 2I/Borisov. Additionally, we found that the NiI/FeI ratio decreases rapidly with decreasing heliocentric distance, suggesting that comet 3I could soon become indistinguishable from solar system comets in this respect. We interpreted these observations assuming that the NiI and FeI atoms were released through the sublimation of Ni(CO)$_4$ and Fe(CO)$_5$ carbonyls, which supports the presence of these species in the cometary material.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signatures of dark subhalos in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: I. Fluctuations in surface density</a><span class="id">[2509.26056]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter (DM) subhalos offer critical tests of cosmological models through their abundance and properties, yet most remain undetectable due to their lack of stars. We investigate whether their presence leaves measurable imprints on the projected stellar density fields of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Building on literature $N$-body experiments, we show that subhalo interactions induce subtle out-of-equilibrium fluctuations appearing as density corrugations. In a CDM framework, these fluctuations are dominated by the most massive subhalos in the host halo. We develop a Fourier-based framework to quantify these features, identifying characteristic peaks in the spatial frequency spectrum that are well described by Voigt profiles. The peak parameters are sensitive to both the subhalo mass function and the number of stellar tracers. For the configurations tested, $N_{\star} \sim 10^5$ stars suffice to detect subhalo populations with $M_{\rm subhalo} \lesssim 10^6~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, while larger masses produce stronger and more complex signatures. We assess the feasibility of this technique by analyzing Gaia and HST data: in this context, the Fornax dwarf shows residual low-frequency structures resembling those in our controlled subhalo experiments, making it an interesting case for follow-up. Prospectively, wide-field surveys such as Euclid, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are expected to deliver stellar samples of $N_{\star} \sim 10^5$ per dwarf, offering compelling prospects for probing subhalo imprints. Our results introduce a novel pathway to constrain the subhalo mass function in dSphs, and motivate follow-up work that incorporates alternative DM models and additional dynamical perturbations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An excess of luminous white dwarfs in the peculiar Galactic globular cluster NGC 2808</a><span class="id">[2509.26190]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence of the Galactic Globular Cluster (GGC) NGC 2808 by using deep near-UV data from the Hubble Space Telescope and theoretical models, to investigate if this cluster hosts an excess of WDs. Excess in WDs is a rare phenomenon that has been found to exist only in a few GGCs. We compared star counts from different evolutionary phases on the near-UV color-magnitude diagram to evolutionary times predicted by BaSTI models. The investigation was carried out over a region within a radii of 1.5 $\arcmin$ of the cluster center and a region of similar dimension located 5$\arcmin$ away. We find a WD excess of $\approx$ 60 - 70\% when comparing star counts and evolutionary models of the WD cooling sequence to the main-sequence turn-off, and by using different values and fractions of Helium enhancement. This excess decreases to $\approx$ 30 - 40\% when the WD cooling sequence is compared to the horizontal branch. The WD excess is slightly larger in the internal field that covers the cluster center; however, the difference with the external field is compatible within the uncertainties. We argue that this excess is possibly related to the existence of SCWDs and Helium-core WDs in NGC 2808, and might be directly associated to the extended blue horizontal branch of this GGC.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHEMOUT: CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy.

To understand chemical evolution across the Milky Way, deriving molecular abundances in star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy is essential for refining models of sub-Solar metallicity environments. We analyzed IRAM 30m observations at 3 and 2 mm toward 35 sources at Galactocentric distances of 9$-$24 kpc, within the &quot;CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the outer Galaxy&quot; (CHEMOUT) project. We focused on species with the highest detection rates (i.e., HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCO, SO) and searched for trends in column densities, abundances, and line widths with Galactocentric distance. Abundances for H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH were updated using H$_2$ column densities from new NIKA2 dust maps. Fractional abundances relative to H$_2$ of most species (HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, HCO, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH) scale at most with the elemental carbon abundance ([C/H]) up to $\sim$24 kpc. SO shows a steeper gradient than sulfur abundance ([S/H]), while H$^{13}$CO$^+$ shows a shallower gradient than [$^{13}$C/H]. Gas turbulence, inferred from line widths, decreases with Galactocentric distance, suggesting a more quiescent environment in the outer Galaxy with respect to the inner Galaxy. In the outer Galaxy, the formation efficiency of most molecules, following the parent element availability, is comparable or higher (e.g., for H$^{13}$CO$^+$) than in the local Galaxy, whereas SO forms less efficiently. These results have significant implications for chemical models of the outermost star-forming regions and for understanding molecule formation under lower metallicity conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The JWST EXCELS Survey: A spectroscopic investigation of the ionizing properties of star-forming galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;8</a><span class="id">[2509.26591]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Charting the Epoch of Reionization demands robust assessments of what drives the production of ionizing photons in high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and requires better predictive capabilities from current observations. Using a sample of $N=159$ SFGs at $1&lt;z&lt;8$, observed with deep medium-resolution spectroscopy from the JWST/NIRSpec EXCELS survey, we perform a statistical analysis of their ionizing photon production efficiencies ($\xi_\rm{ion}$). We consider $\xi_\rm{ion}$, measured with Balmer line measurements, in relation to a number of key galaxy properties including; nebular emission line strengths ($W_\lambda(\rm{H\alpha})$ and $W_\lambda$( [OIII])), UV luminosity ($M_\rm{UV}$) and UV slope ($\beta_\rm{UV}$), as well as dust attenuation ($E(B-V)_\rm{neb}$) and redshift. Implementing a Bayesian linear regression methodology, we fit $\xi_\rm{ion}$ against the principal observables while fully marginalising over all measurement uncertainties, mitigating against the impact of outliers and determining the intrinsic scatter. Significant relations between $\xi_\rm{ion}$ and $ W_\lambda(\rm{H\alpha})$, $W_\lambda$([OIII]) and $\beta_\rm{UV}$ are recovered. Moreover, the weak trends with $M_\rm{UV}$ and redshift can be fully explained by the remaining property dependencies. Expanding our analysis to multivariate regression, we determine that $W_\lambda(\rm{H\alpha})$ or $W_\lambda$([OIII]), along with $\beta_\rm{UV}$ and $E(B-V)_\rm{neb}$, are the most important observables for accurately predicting $\xi_\rm{ion,0}$. The latter identifies the most common outliers as SFGs with relatively high $E(B-V)_\rm{neb}\gtrsim0.5$, possibly indicative of obscured star-formation or strong differential attenuation. Combining these properties enable $\xi_\rm{ion,0}$ to be inferred with an accuracy of $\sim0.15\,$dex, with a population intrinsic scatter of $\sigma_\rm{int}\sim0.035\,$dex.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Connection between Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies and the First Massive Quenched Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.26646]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-redshift (z &gt; 2) massive quiescent (MQ) galaxies provide an opportunity to probe the key physical processes driving the fuelling and quenching of star formation in the early Universe. Observational evidence suggests a possible evolutionary link between MQs and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; or submillimetre galaxies), another extreme high-redshift population. However, galaxy formation models have historically struggled to reproduce these populations - especially simultaneously - limiting our understanding of their formation and connection, particularly in light of recent JWST findings. In previous work, we presented a re-calibrated version of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model that provides an improved match to observationally-inferred number densities of both DSFG and MQ populations. In this work, we use this new model to investigate the progenitors of MQs at z &gt; 2 and the physical mechanisms that lead to their quenching. We find that most MQs at z &gt; 2 were sub-millimetre-bright ($S_{870}$ &gt; 1 mJy) at some point in their cosmic past. The stellar mass of MQs is strongly correlated with the maximum submillimetre flux density attained over their history, and this relation appears to be independent of redshift. However, only a minority of high-redshift DSFGs evolve into MQs by z = 2. The key distinction between typical DSFGs and MQ progenitors lies in their merger histories: MQ progenitors experience an early major merger that triggers a brief, intense starburst and rapid black hole growth, depleting their cold gas reservoirs. In our model, AGN feedback subsequently prevents further gas cooling, resulting in quenching. In contrast, the broader DSFG population remains sub-millimetre-bright, with star formation proceeding primarily via secular processes, becoming quenched later.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23029" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mass and distance of AGN black holes from warped accretion disks</a><span class="id">[2509.23029]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Along the last ten years, a general relativistic method has been developed to generate analytical expressions for the black hole (BH) parameters in terms of observations, namely the frequency shift of photons emitted by orbiting test particles and their positions on the sky. Applications of the method to astrophysical systems such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), in particular to megamaser systems orbiting the central BH on their flat accretion disks, showed a coupling behavior in the mass-to-distance ratio $M/D$. Estimates for the ratio $M/D$ of a sample of BHs hosted at the core of several AGNs have been performed in recent years with the help of this method. However, both analytical expressions and statistical estimations depend only on the $M/D$ ratio rather than on independent parameters. It is of current general interest to work with decoupled parameters in order to safeguard the intrinsic physical information encoded in each of them, given their high scientific relevance in understanding the structure of our Universe. The purpose of this work is to find analytical expressions for the mass and distance of a Schwarzschild BH in terms of astrophysical observations by introducing a slight warping in the accretion disk of the orbiting megamasers. As a result, independent analytical formulas for the mass and distance of AGN supermassive BHs are presented in terms of astrophysical observations: maser frequency shifts, disk parameters, and the galaxy's peculiar redshift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast giant flares in discs around supermassive black holes</a><span class="id">[2404.08441]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We studied the thermal stability of non-self-gravitating turbulent $\alpha$-discs around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) to test a new type of high-amplitude galactic nucleus flares. By calculating the disc structures, we computed the critical points of equilibrium curves for discs around SMBHs, which cover a wide range of accretion rates and resemble the shape $\xi$. We find that a transition of a disc ring from a recombined cold state to a hot, fully ionised, advection dominated, geometrically thick state is possible. Such a transition can trigger a giant flare for SMBHs with masses $\sim 10^6-10^8\, M_\odot$ if the prior geometrically thin and optically thick disc surrounded a central radiatively inefficient accretion flow. An increase in the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ is a necessary condition for this scenario. This increase may be related to the fact that the magnetic Prandtl number increases and exceeds 1 during ionisation. When self-gravity effects in the disc are negligible, the duration and power of the flare exhibit a positive correlation with the prior truncation radius of the geometrically thin disc. According to our estimates, the mass of about $\sim 4-3000\, M_\odot$ can be involved in the giant flare lasting 1 to 400 years if the flare is triggered somewhere between $60$ and $600$ gravitational radii from the SMBH of $10^7\, M_\odot$. The accretion rate on the SMBH peaks about 10 times faster at the potentially super-Eddington level. An optically thick outflow leads to anisotropy of the emission. At the beginning of the giant flare, the region near the truncation radius is heated to $\sim 10^5\,$K, and its UV/optical luminosity is at least $\sim 0.3-4 \,L_\mathrm{Edd}$ depending on the SMBH mass. The sudden heating of a cold disc around a SMBH can trigger a massive outburst, similar in appearance to what is proposed to occur after a tidal disruption event.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological implications of the Gaia Milky Way declining rotation curve</a><span class="id">[2407.18846]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although the existence of dark matter has been widely acknowledged in the cosmology community, it is as yet unknown in nature, despite decades of research, which questions its very existence. This never-ending search for dark matter leads to consider alternatives. Since increasing the enclosed mass is the only way to explain the flat appearance of galaxies' rotation curves in a Newtonian framework, the MOND theory proposed to modify Newton's dynamics when the acceleration is around or below a threshold value, $a_0$. Observed rotation curves, generally flat at large distances, are then usually well reproduced by MOND with $a_0 \sim 1.2 10^{-10}$ m/s$^{2}$. However, the recent Gaia evidence of a decline in the Milky Way rotation curve is a distinct behavior. Therefore, we examine whether MOND can accommodate the Gaia declining rotation curve of the Milky Way. We first depict a standard model to describe the Milky Way's baryonic components. Secondly, we show that a NFW (Navarro, Frenk, &amp; White ) model is able to fit the decline, assuming a scale radius $R_s$ of the order of $4$ kpc. In a third step, we show that the usual MOND paradigm is not able to reproduce the declining part for a standard baryonic model. Finally, we examine whether the MOND theory can accommodate the declining part of the rotation curve when relaxing the characteristics of the baryonic components. To do so we use a MCMC method on the characteristics of the stellar and the HI disk, including their mass. We found that the stellar disk should be massive, of the order of $10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$. The HI disk mass is capped at nearly 1.8 $ 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ but could also be negligible. Finally, $a_0$ is consistent with 0, with an upper limit of $0.53 10^{-10}$ m/s$^{2}$ (95\%), a value much lower than the above mentioned value usually advocated to explain standard flat rotation curves in MOND theory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The rise of the galactic empire: luminosity functions at $z\sim17$ and $z\sim25$ estimated with the MIDIS$+$NGDEEP ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam dataset</a><span class="id">[2503.15594]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a sample of six F200W and three F277W dropout sources identified as $16&lt;z&lt;25$ galaxy candidates using the deepest JWST/NIRCam data to date (5$\sigma$ depths $\sim31.5$ mag at $\geq2$ $\mu$m), provided by the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) and the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey (NGDEEP). We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at $z\sim17$ and $z\sim25$. The number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes $-19&lt;M_\mathrm{UV}&lt;-18$ at $z\sim17$ ($z\sim25$) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at $z\sim12$; the luminosity density presents a similar evolution. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at $z=17-25$ in $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{DM}=10^{8.5-9.5}$ M$_\odot$ dark matter halos, provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense compact starbursts with enhanced emissivity linked to strong burstiness, low or primordial gas metallicities, and/or a top-heavy initial mass function. There are few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above $z\sim20$ in the literature, however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function would predict a more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our $z&gt;16$ candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations $\mathrm{A(V)}&lt;0.1$ mag. Their average stellar mass is $\mathrm{M}_\bigstar\sim10^{7}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, implying a stellar-to-baryon mass fraction around 10% if the emissivity increases with redshift, or significantly higher otherwise. Three candidates present very blue UV spectral slopes ($\beta\sim-3$) compatible with Pop III young ($\lesssim10$ Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons; the rest have $\beta\sim-2.5$ similar to $z=10-12$ samples.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collisionless relaxation to equilibrium distributions in cold dark matter halos: origin of the NFW profile</a><span class="id">[2506.02104]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of such states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation has remained poorly understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a spherical isotropic halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating by an initially cored halo develops an $r^{-1}$ cusp in the density profile of the accreted material, with $r$ the halocentric radius, if it is initially shallower than $r^{-1}$. This is fundamentally a consequence of the virial theorem: self-gravitating systems have a negative specific heat and want to cool down when energized. The inner halo relaxes to an $r^{-1}$ cusp because its central region is the coldest among all $r^{-\gamma}$ profiles with $0\leq \gamma \leq 2$. Accretion and relaxation in the $r^{-1}$ cusp develops an $r^{-3}$ outer fall-off, thereby establishing the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile. We demonstrate for the first time that this profile emerges as a steady state solution to the problem of self-consistent collisionless relaxation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Macroscopic states in Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter model with axionlike interaction</a><span class="id">[2506.23761]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The phase diagrams of ultralight dark matter (DM), modeled as a self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate with axionlike interaction, are studied. We classify stable, metastable, and unstable DM states over a wide range of condensate wave function amplitudes. It is shown that the axionlike interaction causes instability and an imaginary speed of sound at low amplitudes, whereas, in a specific high-amplitude band, DM attains a stable state capable of forming a dense solitonic core and suppressing quantum fluctuations in the surrounding galactic DM halo. These findings are corroborated by evaluating thermodynamic functions for DM in the dwarf galaxy NGC 2366 and its hypothetical analogs with different core-to-halo mass ratios. Distinct DM phase compositions respond differently to fluctuation-induced partial pressure, resulting in a first-order phase transition in a certain range of an interaction parameter. While the DM properties in NGC 2366 lie within the supercritical regime, the phase transition nonetheless provides a thermodynamic marker separating stable from unstable DM configurations. Once a dense core forms - reaching a threshold of about 12% of the total mass - the enhanced gravitation stabilizes the DM halo against fluctuations, while the internal pressure ensures core stability. In particular, we find that NGC 2366's dense DM comprises roughly 19% of the DM mass while occupying only 4.7% of its total volume.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roles of Supernova and Active Galactic Nucleus Feedback in Shaping the Baryonic Content in a Wide Range of Dark Matter Halo Masses</a><span class="id">[2507.10673]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We build upon FEGA25 (Contini et al 2025), a previously introduced semi-analytic model for galaxy formation and evolution, focusing on its enhanced treatment of supernova and active galactic nucleus feedback mechanisms. In addition to the traditional AGN feedback modes, negative (suppressing cooling), and the new positive mode (triggering star formation), we introduce two implementations of a third mode: the ejection of hot gas beyond the virial radius, AGNeject1 and AGNeject2. This component addresses a longstanding issue in semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations: the overestimation of hot gas fractions in low and intermediate mass halos. FEGA25 is calibrated via MCMC using a suite of cosmological N-body simulations YS50HR, YS200, and YS300, and a comprehensive set of observed stellar mass functions across a wide redshift range. We find that supernova feedback dominates gas ejection in halos with logM_{halo} &lt; approximately 12, while AGN feedback becomes increasingly important at higher halo masses. The AGNeject2 model, which activates primarily at late times, redshift &lt; 1, reproduces a characteristic cavity, a U shaped feature in the baryon fraction at redshift zero, similar to trends observed in simulations like SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. Conversely, AGNeject1 yields a smoother, redshift independent evolution. Both models preserve the stellar and cold gas components and successfully reproduce the stellar to halo mass relation up to redshift 3. Our results emphasize that a physically motivated AGN driven mechanism capable of selectively removing hot gas is essential to accurately model the baryon cycle, particularly in intermediate halo mass regimes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord of LRDs: Insights into a &quot;Little Red Dot&quot; with a low-ionization spectrum at z = 0.1</a><span class="id">[2507.23774]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent JWST observations have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar &quot;V&quot;-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as &quot;Little Red Dots&quot; (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at z &gt; 4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z = 0.1, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in an JWST-selected LRD at z = 2.26. We find small but statistically significant variability in H$\alpha$ consistent with previous findings. Finally, with the new X-ray observation from NuSTAR, we confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with $N_{\rm H}&gt;10^{24}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02940" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Diversity of Metal-Enrichment and Abundance Patterns at High Redshift: A Magellan Survey of Gas-rich Galaxies Traced by Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers at z 5</a><span class="id">[2508.02940]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A powerful technique to trace the signatures of the first stars is through the metal enrichment in concentrated reservoirs of hydrogen, such as the damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) in the early universe. We conducted a survey aimed at discovering DLAs along sight lines to high-z quasars in order to measure element abundances at z&gt;4. Here we report our first results from this survey for 10 DLAs with redshifts of  4.2-5.0. We determine abundances of C, O, Si, S, and Fe, and thereby the metallicities and dust depletions. We find that DLA metallicities at z&gt;4.5 show a wide diversity spanning  3 orders of magnitude. The metallicities of DLAs at 3.7&lt;z&lt;5.3 show a larger dispersion compared to that at lower redshifts. Combining our sample with the literature, we find a relatively smooth evolution of metallicity with redshift out to z 5.3, with a tentative ( 2 sigma) indication of a slight rise in metallicity at 4.5&lt;z&lt;5.3. The relative abundances exhibit C enhancement for both metal-poor and metal-enriched DLAs. In addition, alpha-element enhancement is evident in some DLAs, including a DLA at z=4.7 with a super-solar metallicity. Comparing [C/O] and [Si/O] with model predictions, 4 DLAs in our survey seem consistent with a non-zero Pop III contribution (3 with &gt;=30% Pop-III contribution). Combining our sample and the literature, we find the dust depletion strength and dust-to-metal ratios to correlate positively with the total (gas+solid phase) metallicity, confirming the presence of metal-rich, dusty DLAs even at  1 billion years after the Big Bang.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consistent gas-phase C/O abundances from UV and optical emission lines: a robust scale for chemical evolution across cosmic time</a><span class="id">[2508.03954]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The carbon to oxygen (C/O) abundance ratio is a valuable tracer of star formation history, as C and O enrichment occurs on different timescales. However, measurements based on ultraviolet (UV) collisionally excited lines and those based on optical recombination lines may be subject to biases from the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF), which is well established for oxygen but uncertain for carbon. We present precise UV-based measurements of gas-phase C$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ ionic abundance in four H II regions which have prior optical-based measurements, combined with archival UV data for two additional H II regions, in order to establish a reliable abundance scale and to investigate biases between the two methods. We find a clear ADF for the C$^{2+}$ ion which is consistent with that of O$^{2+}$, assuming a similar temperature structure in the zones of the nebula which these ions occupy. The C/O abundance derived from UV collisional lines and optical recombination lines is therefore also consistent to within $&lt;0.1$ dex, with an offset of $0.05\pm0.03$ dex in C$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ for the standard T$_e$ method. While the absolute C/H and O/H abundances are subject to large uncertainty from the ADF, our results establish that C/O abundances measured from these different methods can be reliably compared. Thus we confirm the robustness of gas-phase C/O measurements for studying galaxy evolution and star formation timescales, including from rest-UV observations of high redshift galaxies with JWST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14367" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peculiar Disk Substructures Associated with the Young Eruptive Star EX Lupi</a><span class="id">[2508.14367]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Young eruptive stars such as EXors undergo dramatic accretion outbursts characterized by sudden optical brightenings, yet the underlying physical mechanism remains uncertain.

Our images reveal, for the first time, two distinct substructures: a compact, crescent-shaped inner arc within 10 au of the star, and a narrow outer ring at 30 au. The inner arc is strongly elongated and casts a shadow observed in the Very Large Telescope/SPHERE near-infrared scattered light. The outer ring exhibits a radial width comparable to the local pressure scale height, consistent with moderately efficient dust trapping. Geometric and thermal analysis of the disk surface, based on combined ALMA and SPHERE data, indicates that the disk is moderately flared with an average disk temperature consistent with that of classical T Tauri disks. The observed substructures suggest dynamical perturbations-plausibly induced by a massive companion companion-that may modulate accretion rates through gravitational interaction with the inner arc. These findings provide morphological evidence linking disk substructure to episodic accretion in the structurally mature disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How far have metals reached?

In this paper we use redshift parameterizations of these two statistics to predict the cosmic evolution of an equivalent-width ($W_r$) radial profile model, tailored for the low-ionization species Mg II and O I. Our model provides an excellent match with well-sampled, low-redshift Mg II equivalent-width/impact-parameter pairs from the literature. We then focus on the evolution of various quantities between the Reionization and Cosmic Noon eras. Our findings are: (1) The extent of Mg II and hence the amount of cool ($T\sim 10^4$ K), enriched gas in the average halo decreases continuously with cosmic time after $z \approx 6$–$8$. This effect is more pronounced in $W_r^{2796}\lesssim 0.3$ Å systems (outermost layers of the model) and, in general, affects O I more than Mg II, probably due to the onset of photoionization by the UV background. (2) The line density of $W_r^{2796}\gtrsim 1$ Å systems (model inner layers) constantly increases in synchrony with the star formation rate density until it reaches a peak at Cosmic Noon. The line density of $W_r^{2796}\lesssim 0.3$ Å systems, on the other hand, remains constant or decreases over the same period. (3) At the end of Reionization, the filling factor is low enough that the winds have not yet reached neighboring halos. This implies that the halos are self-enriched, as suggested by semi-analytic models. We discuss how these statistical predictions can be reconciled with early metal enrichment models and offer a practical comparison point for future analyses of quasar absorption lines at $z&gt;6$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of a nova super-remnant surrounding the recurrent nova LMCN 1971-08a in the Large Magellanic Cloud</a><span class="id">[2509.14368]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A nova super-remnant (NSR) is a greatly-extended structure grown by repeated nova eruptions sweeping the surrounding material away from a nova into a dense outer shell and are predicted to form around all novae.

Given that the chemical inventory on interstellar dust grains in the prestellar phases might be altered due to the prostostellar warm-up, an alternative to infer the chemical composition on the grains could be to observe regions affected by shocks associated with molecular outflows. Such shocks can desorb the molecules, and might produce less chemical processing due to shorter timescales. We present here a detailed study of the chemical reservoir of a shocked region located in the G31.41+0.31 protocluster using GUAPOS data (G31.41+0.31 Unbiased ALMA sPectral Observational Survey). We report here the detection of 30 molecular species (plus 18 isotopologues). We performed a comparison of the molecular ratios in the shocked region with those derived towards the hot core of G31.41+0.31, finding that they are poorly correlated, excepting N-bearing species. Our results confirm observationally that a different level of chemical alteration is present in hot cores and in shocks. While the former likely alter the molecular ratios due to thermal processing during longer timescales, the latter might represent freshly desorbed material that constitutes a better proxy of the icy mantle composition. The similarity of molecular ratios between the N-bearing species in the G31.41 shock and the hot core suggests that these species are desorbed at early evolutionary stages. Interestingly, we have found that the abundances in the G31.41 shock show better correlations with other shock-dominated regions (two protostellar outflows and a Galactic Center molecular cloud). This suggests a negligible gas-phase chemistry after shock-induced ejection from grains, and that the ice-mantle composition is similar regardless of the Galactic environment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A novel algorithm for GPU-accelerated particle-mesh interactions implemented in the QUOKKA code</a><span class="id">[2509.18261]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel, GPU-optimized algorithm for particle-mesh interactions in grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, designed for massively parallel architectures. This approach overcomes the inefficiency of particle neighbour searches or sorts across multiple GPU nodes by using a new “particle-mesh-particle” interaction scheme, which extends the particle-mesh method for self-gravity. The algorithm proceeds in two main stages: first, quantities exchanged between particles and the mesh – such as mass, energy, and momentum added by stellar feedback or removed by accretion onto a sink – are deposited into a buffer mesh equipped with ghost zones, where multiple contributions per cell are accumulated using atomic additions and then communicated across distributed memory ranks. In the second stage, the buffer states are applied to real mesh states, incorporating cell-wise limiters to enforce physical constraints such as positive density. We implement this scheme in the GPU-native radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code QUOKKA, demonstrating its application to both supernova feedback and sink particle accretion. We demonstrate that the former scheme converges in the terminal radial momentum from multiple supernovae across varying spatial resolutions, while for the latter simulations of accretion in several configurations show excellent agreement with analytic solutions. This scheme enables efficient, scalable particle-mesh coupling for GPU-optimized simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photometric Redshift Forecast for 7-Dimensional Sky Survey</a><span class="id">[2509.22165]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the expected accuracy of redshifts that can be obtained using low-resolution spectroscopic (medium-band) data from the 7-Dimensional Sky Survey (7DS).

Our sample consists of a catalog with 8,172 RRLs with metallicity, distance and radial velocities estimated from SDSS and LAMOST spectroscopic data, and an extended catalog of 135,873 RRLs with metallicity and distance estimated from Gaia photometry. After careful quality cuts, 165 hypervelocity RRL candidates were found. We performed further checks on their light curves, and selected the most reliable 87 hypervelocity RRLs. All of them exceed the Milky Way's escape velocity in the tangential component. Among them, 7 stars have tangential velocity over 800 km s^-1. We identified two spatially distinct distributions of hypervelocity RRLs: one concentrated toward the Galactic Center and another localized around the Magellanic Clouds, suggesting that their origins are likely associated with these regions through the Hills or other mechanisms. Furthermore, we detected a significant number of RRLs associated with dwarf galaxies that exceed the Milky Way's escape velocity, likely ejected from their host systems.

Here we present an improved version of our cross-correlation technique and an investigation into how efficient the technique is when searching for other molecules in JWST NIRSpec/G395H data. Our search results in the detection of more molecules via cross-correlations in the atmosphere of WASP-39b, including $\rm H_{2}O$ and $\rm CO_{2}$, and confirms the CO detection. This result proves that cross-correlations are a robust and computationally cheap alternative method to search for molecular species in transmission spectra observed with JWST.

We find that that the cross-correlation search of each molecule is more efficient over limited wavelength regions of the spectrum, where the signal for that molecule dominates over other molecules, than over broad wavelength ranges.

Detecting transiting exoplanets only yields their size, and it is thus standard to measure a planet's mass before moving towards their atmospheric characterization, or even the publication of their discovery. This framework, however, can act as a bottleneck for high-throughput exoplanetology. Here, we review existing applications of an alternative approach deriving exoplanet masses in small JWST atmospheric exploration programs and quantify the potential of its systematic application. We find that for $\sim$20\% of transiting exoplanets with existing mass constraints, a small JWST exploration program could yield the planetary mass with a similar–or better – precision. Such results suggest that proceeding directly with atmospheric exploration programs for favorable exoplanets (i.e., with a transmission spectroscopy metric, TSM, $\geq$100) could substantially reduce the time from detection to exoplanet atmospheric study and further support JWST's scientific output over its lifetime while saving up to 20\% of resources on radial-velocity (RV) facilities. Furthermore, it can substantially increase the sample of characterized planets of three distinct subpopulations (Neptune-sized, young, and hot-star exoplanets), each providing specific insights into formation and evolution processes.

On current architectures, the friction computation remains acceptable for both codes (below the typical hydro time step) up to 16 species, enabling a further implementation of growth and fragmentation. This algorithm might be applied to other physical processes, such as radiative transfer or chemistry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25350" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Case for Space: Estimating Precise Time Delays from Ground- and Space-Based Observations of Lensed Supernovae with Glimpse</a><span class="id">[2509.25350]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The delay in arrival time of the multiple images of gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) can be related to the present-day expansion rate of the universe, $H_{0}$. Despite their rarity, Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin-LSST) is expected to discover tens of galaxy-scale glSNe per year, many of which will not be resolved due to their compact nature. Follow-up from ground- and space-based telescopes will be necessary to estimate time delays to sufficient precision for meaningful $H_{0}$ constraints. We present the Glimpse model (GausSN Light curve Inference of Magnifications and Phase Shifts, Extended) that estimates time delays with resolved and unresolved observations together for the first time, while simultaneously accounting for dust and microlensing effects. With this method, we explore best follow-up strategies for glSNe observed by Rubin-LSST. For unresolved systems on the dimmest end of detectability by Rubin-LSST, having peak i-band magnitudes of 22-24 mag, the time delays are measured to as low as 0.7 day uncertainty with 6-8 epochs of resolved space-based observations in each of 4-6 optical and NIR filters. For systems of similar brightness that are resolved by ground-based facilities, time delays are consistently constrained to 0.5-0.8 day precision with 6 epochs in 4 optical and NIR filters of space-based observations or 8 epochs in 4 optical filters of deep ground-based observations. This work improves on previous time-delay estimation methods and demonstrates that glSNe time delays of $\sim10-20$ days can be measured to sufficient precision for competitive $H_{0}$ estimates in the Rubin-LSST era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25428" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-year stacking searches for solar system bodies</a><span class="id">[2509.25428]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Digital tracking detects faint solar system bodies by stacking many images along hypothesized orbits, revealing objects that are undetectable in every individual exposure. Previous searches have been restricted to small areas and short time baselines. We present a general framework to quantify both sensitivity and computational requirements for digital tracking of nonlinear motion across the full sky over multi-year baselines. We start from matched-filter stacking and derive how signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degrades with trial orbit mismatch, which leads to a metric tensor on orbital parameter space. The metric defines local Euclidean coordinates in which SNR loss is isotropic, and a covariant density that specifies the exact number of trial orbits needed for a chosen SNR tolerance. We validate the approach with Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, recovering known objects in blind searches that stack thousands of images over six years along billions of trial orbits. We quantify ZTF's sensitivity to populations beyond 5 au and show that stacking reaches most of the remaining Planet 9 parameter space. The computational demands of all-sky, multi-year tracking are extreme, but we demonstrate that time segmentation and image blurring greatly reduce orbit density at modest sensitivity cost. Stacking effectively boosts medium-aperture surveys to the Rubin Observatory single-exposure depth across the northern sky. Digital tracking in dense Rubin observations of a 10 sq. deg field is tractable and could detect trans-Neptunian objects to 27th magnitude in a single night, with deep drilling fields reaching fainter still.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytic Interferometry of Rotating Stellar Surfaces</a><span class="id">[2509.25433]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The surfaces of rotating stars serve as a window into their interiors, magnetic dynamos, and are important in other areas including exoplanet discovery and atmospheric characterization. While indirect techniques such as photometry and Doppler imaging have been studied for their ability to map stellar surfaces, the gold standard remains optical long-baseline interferometry. In this paper, we develop new closed-form solutions for the interferometric visibility of a rotating star with an arbitrary inhomogeneous surface. We introduce the concept of 'stellar rotation synthesis' in interferometry–an analog of Earth rotation synthesis–where stellar rotation adds information to the spherical harmonic modes representing the star's surface intensity. We implement these solutions in the open-source package harmonix, written in JAX with automatic differentiation, providing a rich ecosystem for fitting and inference. Inspired by similar studies for photometry and Doppler imaging, we use simulations of a fiducial star as observed by the CHARA Array and intensity interferometers to perform a comprehensive theoretical study of the information theory of the starspot mapping problem in interferometry. We show that adding simultaneous photometry from a space-based instrument such as TESS adds complementary spatial information to interferometry and can improve the precision on the map coefficients by over an order of magnitude, enabling the detailed mapping of nearby main-sequence stars with current facilities. Finally, we evaluate the performance of existing and proposed intensity interferometers for stellar surface mapping.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A transmission hologram for slitless spectrophotometry on a convergent telescope beam.

Understanding exoplanet spectra requires atmospheric chemical and climate models that span the diversity of planetary atmospheres. Here, we present a more general chemical and climate model of planetary atmospheres. Specifically, we introduce the open-source, one-dimensional photochemical and climate code Photochem, and benchmark the model against the observed compositions and climates of Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Titan with a single set of kinetics, thermodynamics and opacities. We also model the chemistry of the hot Jupiter exoplanet WASP-39b. All simulations are open-source and reproducible. To first order, Photochem broadly reproduces the gas-phase chemistry and pressure-temperature profiles of all six planets. The largest model-data discrepancies are found in Venus's sulfur chemistry, motivating future experimental work on sulfur kinetics and spacecraft missions to Venus. We also find that clouds and hazes are important for the energy balance of Venus, Earth, Mars and Titan, and that accurately predicting aerosols with Photochem is challenging. Finally, we benchmark Photochem against the popular VULCAN and HELIOS photochemistry and climate models, finding excellent agreement for the same inputs; we also find that Photochem simulates atmospheres 2 to 100 time more efficiently. These results show that Photochem provides a comparatively general description of atmospheric chemistry and physics that can be leveraged to study Solar System worlds or interpret telescope observations of exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Simons Observatory: Studies of Phase Drift in RF Transmission Lines from the First Large-Scale Deployment of Microwave Frequency Multiplexing for Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2509.25726]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fulfilling the science goals of the Simons Observatory, a state-of-the-art cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment, has required deploying tens of thousands of superconducting bolometers. Reading out data from the observatory's more than 67,000 transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors while maintaining cryogenic conditions requires an effective multiplexing scheme. The SLAC microresonator radio frequency (SMuRF) electronics have been developed to provide the warm electronics for a high-density microwave frequency multiplexing readout system, and this system has been shown to achieve multiplexing factors on the order of 1,000. SMuRF has recently been deployed to the Simons Observatory, which is located at 5,200 m on Cerro Toco in Chile's Atacama Desert. As the SMuRF system is exposed to the desert's diurnal temperature swings, resulting phase drift in RF transmission lines may introduce a systematic signal contamination. We present studies of phase drift in the room-temperature RF lines of the Simons Observatory's 6 m large-aperture telescope, which hosts the largest deployment to date of TES microwave frequency multiplexing to a single telescope. We show that these phase drifts occur on time scales which are significantly longer than sky scanning, and that their contribution to on-sky in-transition detector noise is within the readout noise budget.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25836" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for Dark Structures: A Comparison of Weak Lensing Convergence Maps and Lensing-Weighted Galaxy Density Maps</a><span class="id">[2509.25836]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the result of a comparison between the dark matter distribution inferred from weak gravitational lensing and the observed galaxy distribution to identify dark structures with a high dark matter-to-galaxy density ratio.

The two maps show overall agreement. However, we could identify 22 regions where the dark matter density exhibits an excess compared to the galaxy density. After carefully examining the survey depths and proximity to survey boundaries, we select seven of the most probable candidates for dark structures. This sample provides valuable testbeds for further investigations into dark matter mapping. Moreover, our method will be very useful for future studies of dark structures as large-scale weak-lensing surveys become available, such as the $\textit{Euclid}$ mission, the Vera C.

Previous CALET observing runs (O3 and O4) relied on averaged pre/post-event baselines or low-order polynomial fits, approaches that neglect correlated noise, temporal non-stationarity, and the propagation of background uncertainty into derived flux upper limits. These simplifications can lead to reduced sensitivity to faint or atypical transients. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian framework for background estimation based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression and change-point modeling. Our approach captures correlated structures in the detector background, quantifies predictive uncertainties, and propagates them into both detection statistics and Bayesian credible upper limits. We demonstrate, using archival CALET time-tagged event data and simulated signal injections, that our method improves sensitivity to weak short-duration bursts by up to an order of magnitude compared to traditional polynomial fits. This probabilistic background treatment enables a more physically robust interpretation of non-detections and offers a scalable, real-time compatible extension for future joint multi-messenger searches.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), with its unprecedented depth and cadence, will detect thousands of TDEs, motivating the need for robust photometric classifiers capable of efficiently distinguishing these events from other extragalactic transients. We aim to develop and validate a machine learning pipeline for photometric TDE identification in LSST-scale datasets. Our classifier is designed to provide high precision and recall, enabling the construction of reliable TDE catalogs for multi-messenger follow-up and statistical studies. Using the second Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC2) dataset, we fit Gaussian Processes (GP) to light curves for feature extraction (e.g., color, rise/fade times, GP length scales). We then train and tune boosted decision-tree models (XGBoost) with a custom scoring function emphasizing high-precision recovery of TDEs. Our pipeline is tested on a diverse simulation of transient and variable events, including supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and superluminous supernovae. We achieve high precision (up to 95%) while maintaining competitive recall (about 72%) for TDEs, with minimal contamination from non-TDE classes. Key predictive features include post-peak colors and GP hyperparameters, reflecting characteristic timescales and spectral behaviors of TDEs. Our photometric classifier provides a practical and scalable approach to identifying TDEs in forthcoming LSST data. By capturing essential color and temporal properties through GP-based feature extraction, it enables efficient construction of clean TDE candidate samples.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Second-timescale Glints from Satellites and Space Debris Detected with Tomo-e Gozen</a><span class="id">[2509.25947]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A search for second-timescale optical transients is one of the frontiers of time-domain astronomy. However, it has been pointed out that reflections of sunlight from Earth-orbiting objects can also produce second-timescale “glints.” We conducted wide-field observations at 2 frames per second using Tomo-e Gozen on the 1.05 m Kiso Schmidt telescope. We identified 1554 point-source glints that appeared in only one frame (0.5 sec). Their brightness ranges from 11 to 16 mag, with fainter glints being more numerous. These glints are likely caused by satellites and space debris in high-altitude orbits such as the geosynchronous Earth orbit or highly elliptical orbits. Many glints brighter than 14 mag are associated with known satellites or debris with large apogees ($&gt;$ 30,000 km). In contrast, most fainter glints are not associated with cataloged objects and may be due to debris with sizes of 0.3–1 m. The event rate of second-timescale glints is estimated to be $4.7 \pm 0.2\ {\rm deg^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$ (average) and $9.0 \pm 0.3\ {\rm deg^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$ (near the equator) at 15.5 mag. Our results demonstrate that high-altitude debris can represent a significant foreground in searches for second-timescale optical transients. They also imply that deep surveys such as Rubin/LSST will detect many of these glints in single-exposure images.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Efficient Shift-and-Stack Algorithm Applied to Detection Catalogs</a><span class="id">[2509.26279]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The boundary of solar system object discovery lies in detecting its faintest members. However, their discovery in detection catalogs from imaging surveys is fundamentally limited by the practice of thresholding detections at signal-to-noise (SNR) $\geq 5$ to maintain catalog purity. Faint moving objects can be recovered from survey images using the shift-and-stack algorithm, which coadds pixels from multi-epoch images along a candidate trajectory. Trajectories matching real objects accumulate signal coherently, enabling high-confidence detections of very faint moving objects. Applying shift-and-stack comes with high computational cost, which scales with target object velocity, typically limiting its use to searches for slow-moving objects in the outer solar system. This work introduces a modified shift-and-stack algorithm that trades sensitivity for speedup. Our algorithm stacks low SNR detection catalogs instead of pixels, the sparsity of which enables approximations that reduce the number of stacks required. Our algorithm achieves real-world speedups of $10$–$10^3 \times$ over image-based shift-and-stack while retaining the ability to find faint objects. We validate its performance by recovering synthetic inner and outer solar system objects injected into images from the DECam Ecliptic Exploration Project (DEEP). Exploring the sensitivity–compute time trade-off of this algorithm, we find that our method achieves a speedup of $\sim30\times$ with $88\%$ of the memory usage while sacrificing $0.25$ mag in depth compared to image-based shift-and-stack. These speedups enable the broad application of shift-and-stack to large-scale imaging surveys and searches for faint inner solar system objects.

It has traditionally been confined to specific domains: terahertz, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet, each requiring distinct comb sources and detection mechanisms tailored to the nature of the spectroscopic target. Yet, similar techniques may be implemented in the terahertz (THz) and mid-infrared (MIR) regions, such as optical rectification for comb generation and electro-optic sampling for detection, both using crystals with quadratic nonlinearity. However, in the Reststrahlen band near phonon resonances in these crystals, typically between 5 and 10 THz, both linear and nonlinear susceptibilities experience abnormally high dispersion, and light propagation is strongly suppressed. This confines DCS operation to spectral regions either below or above the Reststrahlen band and effectively separating the THz and MIR domains. Here we demonstrate high-resolution DCS performed simultaneously over two broad spectral bands, each spanning an octave or more. The measurements cover both the MIR (350-1150 cm$^{-1}$; 8.7-28.5 $\mu$m; 10.5-34.5 THz) and the THz region (80-160 cm$^{-1}$; 62.5-125 $\mu$m; 2.4-4.8 THz), effectively bridging these traditionally separate regions within a single acquisition. This enables direct cross-referencing of molecular absorption line strengths across widely separated spectral domains. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the simultaneous acquisition of ro-vibrational and pure rotational absorption spectra of ammonia (NH$_3$) with a spectral resolution of 7.3 MHz (0.00024 cm$^{-1}$), sufficient to fully resolve Doppler-broadened line shapes across the entire measured spectral range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational wave experiments: achievements and plans</a><span class="id">[2509.25952]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave (GW) experiments have transformed our understanding of the Universe by enabling direct observations of compact object mergers and other astrophysical phenomena.

Traditionally, two methodologies have been employed: the Individual Fit, which fits each transit independently to analyze impact parameter changes, and the Dynamical Fit, which simulates planetary dynamics to match transit light curves. We introduce a new fitting method, Simultaneous Impact Parameter Variation Analysis (SIPVA), which demonstrates advantages over the Individual Fit and avoids the computational cost of N-body integrations required by the Dynamical Fit. SIPVA directly incorporates a linear time-dependent model for impact parameters into the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework by fitting all transits simultaneously. We evaluate SIPVA and the Individual Fit on artificial systems with varying log-likelihood ratios and find that SIPVA consistently outperforms the Individual Fit in recovery rates and accuracy. When applied to selected Kepler planetary candidates exhibiting significant transit duration variations (TDVs), SIPVA identifies significant impact parameter trends in 10 out of 16 planets, whereas the Individual Fit does so in only 4. We also employ probabilistic modeling to simulate the theoretical distribution of planets with significant impact parameter variations across all observed Kepler systems and compare the distribution of recovered candidates by the Individual Fit and Dynamical Fit from previous work with our theoretical distribution. Our findings offer an alternative framework for analyzing planetary transits, relying solely on Bayesian inference without requiring prior assumptions about the planetary system's dynamical architecture.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17516" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The BINGO/ABDUS Project: Forecast for cosmological parameters from a mock Fast Radio Bursts survey</a><span class="id">[2411.17516]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There are various surveys that will provide excellent data to search for and localize Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs).

We quantify the dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift ($z$) for the BINGO FRB mock sample. Furthermore, we use current datasets (Supernovae, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Microwave Background data) prior to assessing the efficacy of constraining dark energy models using Monte Carlo methods. Our results show that spatially localized BINGO FRB dataset will provide promising constraints on the population of host galaxies intrinsic DM and be able to measure the nuisance parameters present within a FRB cosmological analysis. They will also provide alternative estimates on other parameters such as the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state. In particular, we should see that BINGO FRB data can put constraints on the degenerate $w-H_0$ plane, which the CMB is incapable of measuring, allowing FRBs to be a viable alternative to BAO to constrain the dark energy equation of state. We conclude that FRBs remain a promising future probe for cosmology and that the FRBs localized by the BINGO project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the current cosmological model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21407" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debris disks and their properties with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</a><span class="id">[2509.21407]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The study of the last stages of planet formation, also known as debris disks, is fundamental to place constrains on the formation of planetary sized bodies.

The distribution of the dust can reveal the presence of forming planets and its composition can directly trace that of comets, asteroids and even planets. While we have been observing debris disks for 40 years now, most observations so far have been restricted to the cold outer regions of the system, and therefore information of the terrestrial zone is still missing. The improved spatial resolution, inner working angle and sensitivity that the Habitable Worlds Observatory will provide will enable a much closer look into the structure and composition of debris disks (particularly of its inner region) and enable the search for the forming rocky planets within the disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glitches far from transient gravitational-wave events do not bias inference</a><span class="id">[2506.21869]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detectors, known as &quot;glitches,&quot; can bias the inferred parameters of transient signals when they occur nearby in time and frequency. These biases are addressed with a variety of methods that remove or otherwise mitigate the impact of the glitch. Given the computational cost and human effort required for glitch mitigation, we study the conditions under which it is strictly necessary. We consider simulated glitches and gravitational-wave signals in various configurations that probe their proximity both in time and in frequency. We determine that glitches located outside the time-frequency space spanned by the gravitational-wave model prior and with a signal-to-noise ratio, conservatively, below 50 do not impact estimation of the signal parameters.</p></div></details></article></body>
