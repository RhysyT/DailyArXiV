<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notes on Crowther and the &quot;Interpretation&quot; of Quantum Mechanics (arXiv:2512.14315)</a><span class="id">[2512.23721]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We read Karen Crowther's \emph{Another 100 Years of Quantum Interpretation?} with two practical goals. First, we spell out what she means by interpretation”: an attempt to provide understanding (not just predictions), which may be representationalist or non-representationalist, and which she contrasts with deeper \emph{reductive} (inter-theoretic) explanation – especially in the quantum-gravity setting. Second, we list twelve points where the paper's physics-facing wording could be sharpened. In our view, several claims are directionally well-motivated but stated more strongly than the underlying physics supports, or they run together distinct notions (e.g.\ degrees of freedom,” singularity,” and different senses of locality”) that need careful separation. We end by suggesting that the philosophical question is genuinely worthwhile, but the physics should be phrased more cautiously so that heuristic motivation is not mistaken for strict implication.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Logical Structure of Physical Laws: A Fixed Point Reconstruction</a><span class="id">[2512.25057]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We formalise the self referential definition of physical laws using monotone operators on a lattice of theories, resolving the pathologies of naive set theoretic formulations. By invoking Tarski fixed point theorem, we identify physical theories as least fixed points of admissibility constraints derived from Galois connections. We demonstrate that QED and General Relativity can be represented in such a logical structure with respect to their symmetry and locality principles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geometric View of One-Dimensional Quantum Mechanics</a><span class="id">[2512.23923]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We apply De Haro's Geometric View of Theories to one of the simplest quantum systems: a spinless particle on a line and on a circle. The classical phase space M = T*Q is taken as the base of a trivial Hilbert bundle E   M x H, and the familiar position and momentum representations are realised as different global trivialisations of this bundle. The Fourier transform appears as a fibrewise unitary transition function, so that the standard position-momentum duality is made precise as a change of coordinates on a single geometric object. For the circle, we also discuss twisted boundary conditions and show how a twist parameter can be incorporated either as a fixed boundary condition or as a base coordinate, in which case it gives rise to a flat U(H)-connection with nontrivial holonomy. These examples provide a concrete illustration of how the Geometric View organises quantum-mechanical representations and dualities in geometric terms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A short technical comment on Bub's There is No Quantum World (arXiv:2512.18400v2) and a brief remark on related Grangier's reply (arXiv:2512.22965v1)</a><span class="id">[2512.24198]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This note is a friendly technical check of Jeffrey Bub's There is No Quantum World ( arXiv:2512.18400v2 ). I flag one unambiguous mathematical slip (a cardinality identity that implicitly assumes the Continuum Hypothesis) and then point out a few places where the discussion of infinite tensor products, “sectorization,” and measurement updates would benefit from sharper wording. Nothing here is meant as a critique of Bub's interpretive goals; the aim is simply to separate what is mathematically forced from what depends on choices of algebra, representation, or philosophical stance. I end with a short remark on Philippe Grangier's reply ( arXiv:2512.22965v1 ).</p></div></details></article></body>
