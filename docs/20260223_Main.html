In this Letter, we present the first relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a surface shear-driven magnetar eruption, capturing reconnection-driven plasma heating, the ejection of relativistically hot plasma, and the formation of a hot fireball confined within the inner magnetosphere. We find that magnetic reconnection in the equatorial current sheet launches a hot trailing outflow capable of powering the initial spike observed in giant flares, while simultaneously leaving behind a thermally stratified fireball with sufficient thermal energy to produce the pulsating, decaying tail. Together, these features provide a self-consistent physical framework for understanding the observed energetics of magnetar giant flares. The eruption also expels a magnetically dominated giant plasmoid carrying up to $\sim 9\%$ of the magnetosphere's total magnetic energy. Furthermore, our simulation demonstrates how the plasmoid drives the formation of a blast wave – an important ingredient in models linking magnetar eruptions to fast radio bursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17756" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pushing spectral siren cosmology into the third-generation era: a blinded mock data challenge</a><span class="id">[2602.17756]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave (GW) spectral sirens offer a promising method for measuring cosmological parameters using GW data only - without relying on external redshift information such as electromagnetic counterparts or galaxy catalogs - by exploiting distributional features in the population of GW sources. The advent of third-generation detectors like the Einstein Telescope (ET) will provide catalogs three orders of magnitudes larger than current ones, raising questions about the scalability and robustness of existing inference pipelines. We present a blinded mock data challenge that tests three public pipelines with distinct numerical implementations, namely, $\texttt{ICAROGW}$, $\texttt{CHIMERA}$, and $\texttt{pymcpop-gw}$, on simulated ET observations containing the best $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ binary black hole mergers that can be observed in 1 year. We assess their computational performance, validate their agreement in a blinded setting, and forecast cosmological constraints. We find that, thanks to GPU acceleration, these pipelines can process the events expected from ET within a manageable timeframe. All pipelines recover consistent cosmological and population parameters. Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we measure $H(z)$ at $z\sim1.5$ with 2.4% precision, and achieve a mean precision on $H(z)$ of 2.8% across $0.7&lt;z&lt;1.8$ with a catalog of $\sim 12,000$ high-S/N events. This corresponds to joint constraints of $\sim 10%$ on $H_0$ and $\sim 26%$ on $\Omega_{\rm m,0}$. We also identify the events that contribute mostly to constraining cosmological parameters, showing that low-distance sources near population features drive the constraining power on all cosmological parameters, while higher-distance events primarily constrain $\Omega_{\rm m,0}$. Our results establish a validated, performance-tested framework for spectral siren cosmology in the era of third-generation GW observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possible stratospheric emission in the warm Neptune GJ 436 b from high-resolution spectroscopy</a><span class="id">[2602.17777]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high spectral resolution $L$ band (2.91–3.85 $\mu$m) observations of the warm Neptune GJ 436 b from Keck II/KPIC. KPIC's single-mode fiber feed reduces the $L$ band sky background by a factor of 100, significantly improving sensitivity compared to a seeing-limited spectrometer and enabling a tentative ($\rm SNR = 3-4$) cross-correlation detection of GJ 436 b with a thermally inverted atmospheric model. In contrast with recent results from $JWST$ and high-resolution transmission spectroscopy, our retrieval analysis prefers the presence of H$_2$O, and possibly CH$_4$, molecular features in emission. The broad-band continuum flux associated with the maximum-likelihood model is substantially higher than expected based on both the $\sim670\rm\ K$ equilibrium temperature of GJ 436 b and previous results from low-resolution spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the loss of continuum information during the processing of high-resolution spectra makes our analysis effectively insensitive to the absolute continuum level of the planet, and that scaling the maximum-likelihood model to match the broad-band flux measured from low-resolution observations of GJ 436 b results in a detection of similar strength in cross-correlation. These results could be explained by a thermal inversion arising above a haze layer in the upper atmosphere of \gjb. Further observations, ideally post-eclipse in order to break the $K_p - \Delta v_{sys}$ degeneracy, are needed to clarify this possible detection. This work demonstrates the potential of $L$ band high-resolution spectroscopy for characterizing significantly smaller and cooler exoplanets compared with hot Jupiters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Origin of Coronal Picoflare Jets</a><span class="id">[2602.17796]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Small-scale jet-like eruptions, such as picoflare jets and jetlets, are recognized as potential contributors to coronal heating and solar wind acceleration, yet their physical origin is still not fully established. Using ultra-high-resolution extreme ultraviolet imaging datasets from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board the Solar Orbiter mission, we investigate tiny coronal jets observed off-limb in the Sun's polar regions. Visual inspection reveals that the majority of these jets exhibit distinct morphological features, including a bright spire accompanied by a dark eruptive jet component. We analyzed eleven of these jets in detail and found that their spatial and temporal scales are comparable to previously reported jetlets, while their kinetic energies are two to three orders of magnitude lower, placing them in the picoflare regime. The bright and dark components show distinct dynamics, with the dark structures generally displaying lower speeds. A comparison with coordinated Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory data, together with 2.5D radiative-MHD simulations performed with the Bifrost code, reveals a one-to-one morphological correspondence between the dark counterparts and cool chromospheric surges accompanying the bright jet spire. This association suggests that flux emergence and magnetic reconnection at low atmospheric heights may produce coupled bright-dark structures, providing a plausible mechanism for the generation of picoflare jets. Our results demonstrate Solar Orbiter's ability to resolve the dynamics of small-scale jets and place new constraints on their origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long-term eclipse time variations in white dwarf binaries</a><span class="id">[2602.17800]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The overwhelming majority of eclipsing white dwarf (WD) binary systems show quasi-periodic variations in eclipse timings on many year timescales. Currently, the mechanism behind these eclipse time variations (ETVs) is not known, with the main competing theories being the planetary hypothesis and the Applegate/Lanza mechanisms. Here, we present a comprehensive study of 43 WD binary systems, the vast majority of which have more than a decade of eclipse timing measurements, analysing their global properties to determine which driving force is the likely origin of the observed ETVs. Long-term, high-speed photometry data obtained with ULTRACAM, ULTRASPEC and HiPERCAM have allowed us to track the evolution of the ETVs in these systems, and analyse any previously unseen trends. From this analysis, we find a clear difference in the level of observed ETVs past the fully convective boundary, where systems with partially radiative companion stars consistently showing high levels of variation. While some systems may be affected by the presence of an unknown planet, the results from this study strongly indicates that an Applegate- or Lanza-like mechanism is the most likely driving force for the timing variations seen in the majority of systems in this sample. However, as found in previous studies, the Applegate/Lanza mechanisms are still not able to reproduce the large and rapid timing variations seen in the vast majority of systems, with the companion star to the WD unable to provide sufficient energy on these short timescales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyα forest bounds on sterile neutrino production via neutrino self-interactions</a><span class="id">[2602.17821]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sterile neutrinos in the keV mass range have long been considered a well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidate. In this work, we explore a sterile neutrino production mechanism through active neutrino self-interactions in the early universe, assuming that they constitute the full DM abundance. We implement a self-consistent treatment of the sterile-neutrino free streaming and the active-neutrino self-interactions on structure formation, which yield a unique scale-dependent modification to the linear matter power spectrum. We then set bounds on this scenario using a combination of the cosmic microwave background and Ly$\alpha$ forest constraints. Specifically, we utilize the two recent likelihoods derived from eBOSS data: (i) an effective field theory (EFT) based full-shape likelihood and (ii) a compressed likelihood obtained from the PRIYA-simulation emulator. We produce some of the most stringent observational constraints to date on sterile neutrino DM, comparable to the bounds from the most stringent laboratory constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17870" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The SB9 catalogue: status, comparison with non-single stars from Gaia DR3 and evolution to SBX</a><span class="id">[2602.17870]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Ninth Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits (SB9) is a comprehensive compilation of spectroscopic binaries (SBs) with orbital parameters sourced from literature, comprising approximately 4000 systems (2800 single-lined and 1200 double-lined). This work presents the latest status of SB9 after two decades of development, detailing the statistical properties of SBs through orbital period distributions and eccentricity-period diagrams categorized by spectral type and evolutionary stage. We performed a rigorous cross-match with Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) to update astrometric parameters and compare SB9 with the Gaia DR3 Non-Single Star (NSS) catalogue. Our methodology utilized positional separations, magnitudes, and proper-motion back-propagation for identification. The final SB9 version updated by D. Pourbaix includes 4003 systems, including higher-order multiples: 152 triples, 71 quadruples, and 14 higher-order systems. Of these, 3976 have Gaia DR3 identifiers; 21 are too bright and six too faint for detection. Ten SB9 systems with periods exceeding 1180 days were spatially resolved by Gaia DR3. We identified a common sample of 827 binaries cross-matched with Gaia NSS, with 655 considered highly reliable based on period and eccentricity differences under 10%. The limited overlap (20-30% of SB9) results from NSS selection cuts, brightness limits, and temporal baselines. This study highlights the complementary strengths of both catalogues and establishes a benchmark sample for binary star research. Finally, this work marks the transition of SB9 into SBX (The eXtended Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits), featuring a modern relational database, improved web interface, and Virtual Observatory access standards to enhance data quality and accessibility for the stellar community.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling brightness temperature of sunspots using ALMA single-dish observations</a><span class="id">[2602.18069]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We model sunspot brightness temperature in the wavelength range 0.3-10mm using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) single-dish measurements together with other instruments. Our modeling idea starts from an existing model, the 1D semi-empirical Avrett-Tian-Landi-Curdt-Wülser (ATLCW) model for sunspots. The original model is then modified in density and temperature with a constant factor over all heights. A least-square fit in both density and temperature to the observed values yields an improved model for sunspot brightness temperature. Observations show that sunspots are darker than QS at wavelengths below 2 mm and brighter beyond, while fitting of the ATLCW sunspot model imply that sunspots should be darker than QS over the entireALMArange. The best-fitted sunspot brightness temperature profiles resulted in 3.6-4.0 times lower sunspot density compared to the original sunspot ATLCW model, or 1.4-1.8 times higher density compared to QS. The temperature came out around 1.2 times higher than the original ATLCW predictions for sunspots, or 1.2 times lower than QS temperature. Even with improved density and temperature parameters, the remaining discrepancy between the bestfitted models and observations indicated that additional improvements are needed in the ATLCW model and modeling assumptions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18085" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The attempted polarity reversal and evolving magnetic environment of AD Leo</a><span class="id">[2602.18085]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the past two decades, the observed large-scale magnetic field of the active M dwarf star AD Leo has evolved from strongly to mildly negative, raising a suspicion that it might switch polarity. Although magnetic field reversals are observed every 11 years for the Sun, such reversals are poorly understood for M dwarfs. Further, no reversals have been observed for fast-rotating M dwarfs. We examine the properties of AD Leo's large-scale magnetic field and investigate how its evolution affects the space weather environment. We analysed spectropolarimetric data collected by ESPaDOnS and SPIRou in late-2022 and early-2023. With the optical and near-infrared data we computed the longitudinal magnetic field, and with the near-infrared data reconstructed the large-scale magnetic field using Zeeman-Doppler imaging. Using five magnetograms, from 2019 to 2023, we simulated three-dimensional Alfven wave-driven stellar winds using the space weather code SWMF. Although we see an evolution of the large-scale magnetic field of AD Leo, we find no polarity reversal. Rather, we see a restoration of the field to a simpler configuration with consistently negative values for the longitudinal magnetic field strength. Our new large-scale field reconstruction for AD Leo is characterised by a highly axisymmetric, poloidal-dipolar field with an increased mean large-scale field strength. SWMF simulations find the stellar mass loss rates to be, on average, an order of magnitude greater than that of the Sun. Additionally, we find that the habitable zone resides beyond the Alfven surface. Hypothetical magnetised habitable zone planets (with planetary field strengths greater than 0.34 G) would likely be shielded from the incident wind and atmospheric erosion would be negligible. Further, we find variable conditions across each epoch due to the evolving axisymmetry of the stellar large-scale magnetic field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D radiative transfer modeling of scattering polarization with partial frequency redistribution I. Verification and disk-center results for the solar Ca I 4227 Å line</a><span class="id">[2602.18100]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Several strong solar resonance lines show observable linear scattering polarization signals, holding a great potential for investigating the magnetism of the outer solar atmosphere. Accurately modeling these signals requires solving the radiative transfer (RT) problem for polarized radiation in comprehensive 3D models of the solar atmosphere, in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium, accounting for partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects. This problem has so far been computationally inaccessible. We present the first scientific application of TRIP, a novel software for the massively parallel solution of the 3D non-LTE RT problem for polarized radiation, including scattering polarization and PRD. We aim to verify the code and explore the combined action of PRD and the 3D structure of the solar atmosphere on scattering polarization. We run TRIP to synthesize the Stokes profiles of the Ca I line at 4227 Å in a 3D model of the solar atmosphere extracted from a radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulation. We efficiently solve the resulting large-scale problem, with up to $4 \times 10^{10}$ degrees of freedom, with a state-of-the-art preconditioned Krylov method, using up to 20 thousand parallel CPUs. After including verification tests, we find that the joint impact of PRD effects and the detailed 3D structure of the atmospheric model produce disk-center scattering polarization signals in the line wings. These signals are sensitive to the magnetic field, via magneto-optical effects, and to bulk velocity gradients. We also show that the CRD approximation underestimates the amplitude of disk-center line-core signals. This achievement represents a crucial step forward for diagnosing the magnetism of the solar chromosphere and transition region through the quantitative comparisons of synthetic and observational data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inhomogeneous magnetic coupling in exoplanets: the stop &amp; go of WASP-18 b's atmospheric flows</a><span class="id">[2602.18101]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Early studies of ionization in hot Jupiter atmospheres suggest that magnetic coupling can shape their dynamics. These effects may be most pronounced in ultra-hot Jupiters that sustain global magnetic fields. WASP-18 b hosts an ionized dayside atmosphere extending deep enough to be strongly influenced by magnetic forces. Phase curve observations suggest effective magnetic drag, yet its impact on the atmospheric circulation remains poorly constrained. This work explores how magnetic drag in an inhomogeneously ionized atmosphere shapes local and global dynamics to provide a pathway to constrain the planet's magnetic field strength. An analytical parameterization for anisotropic magnetic drag, including both Pedersen and Hall drag components, and associated frictional heating in the globally neutral atmosphere, is implemented in the 3D General Circulation Model ExoRad to study WASP-18 b's atmosphere. Climate characteristics are compared for different drag formulations to assess whether anisotropic physics is required to capture magnetic coupling effects. Anisotropic magnetic drag and frictional heating, both set by local ionization, strongly affect wind strength and direction in the upper atmosphere, modify the day-night circulation, and produce observable temperature asymmetries. They enhance the evening-morning terminator temperature difference near 0.1 bar and generate two off-equator hotspots with reduced eastward shift. The terminator regions are particularly sensitive to how magnetic drag is modeled. Anisotropic magnetic drag damps and redirects dayside-to-nightside winds, partially decoupling the equatorial flow at the morning terminator while maintaining the nightside jet. Locally varying drag forces and frictional heating create asymmetric temperature patterns manifesting as primary and secondary hotspot regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TROYE: Modeling Dynamic Phase Transitions in Gravitational Waves from Neutron Star-Black Hole Mergers</a><span class="id">[2602.18105]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Equation of State (EoS) of dense nuclear matter remains one of the most compelling open questions in high-energy astrophysics. While static EoS models are increasingly well-constrained by observations of binary neutron star (BNS) inspirals, the possibility of a dynamic phase transition occurring during the coalescence has been thus far deferred from standard gravitational-wave (GW) analyses. In this work, we investigate the detectability of such a phase transition, manifesting as a macroscopic shift in the tidal deformability parameter $\Lambda$, using GWs from Neutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH) coalescences. We argue that NSBH systems serve as a cleaner laboratory for this phenomenology than BNS systems due to the absence of the $\tilde{\Lambda}(\Lambda_1,\Lambda_2)$ degeneracy, allowing for the isolation of single-body tidal evolution. We introduce a phenomenological waveform model, TROYE (Transitional Representation Of varYing Equation-of-state), which stitches together two waveform approximants in the time domain to simulate a smooth but rapid transition between two equations of state during the late inspiral. We perform a comprehensive Bayesian injection and recovery campaign on 100 simulated events using the bilby inference library. Our results demonstrate that a phase transition corresponding to a tidal shift of $|\Delta\Lambda| \gtrsim 400$ is detectable with Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, yielding decisive statistical evidence ($\ln B &gt; 5$). We further identify a &quot;V-shape&quot; asymmetry in detectability, where &quot;softening&quot; transitions (decreasing $\Lambda$) are systematically easier to detect than &quot;stiffening&quot; ones due to the specific phase evolution of the tidal sector. Finally, we present &quot;stress tests&quot; showing that the transition remains recoverable even when marginalized over uncertainties in the stitching time and binary mass ratio.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The GAPS Programme at the TNG: LXX. TOI-5734b: A hot sub-Neptune orbiting a relatively young K dwarf with an Earth-like density</a><span class="id">[2602.18108]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Increasing interest in young exoplanets is leading to a growing effort to understand the formation and evolutionary processes responsible for their different architectures. One interesting target is TOI-5734, a relatively young K3-K4 dwarf star ($500_{-150}^{+300}$ Myr) showing a transiting candidate in photometric observations followed up with high-resolution spectroscopic data. Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry and High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) radial-velocity (RV) data, we aim to validate the presence of the companion TOI-5734b, measure its planetary mass, size, and its orbital parameters after having characterised its host star. We then aim to study its possible planetary composition and atmospheric evolution. By simultaneously modelling photometry and high-cadence RVs, we measured the radius, mass, and density of TOI-5734b precisely. In particular, we employed Gaussian processes (GPs) with a flexible kernel to discriminate between the stellar activity of the young host and planetary signals. We confirmed the planetary nature of TOI-5734b and measured its orbital period ($P_{\rm b}\sim6.18$ d), radius ($R_{\rm b} = 2.10^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$ $R_\oplus$), and mass ($M_{\rm b}=9.1^{+2.6}_{-2.6}$ $M_\oplus$). By measuring its density ($\rho_{\rm b}=0.98_{-0.30}^{+0.36}$ $\rho_\oplus$), we infer that TOI-5734b is close to having a rocky composition and an almost completely depleted primary envelope. Our results point toward the possibility of considering the target for atmospheric studies with present and future ground- and space-based facilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the Icy Pebble Accretion Hypothesis with Primordial Main Belt Asteroids</a><span class="id">[2602.18111]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large main-belt asteroids (diameter $D \gtrsim 120\ \mathrm{km}$) exhibit a surface composition gradient as a function of heliocentric distance, ranging from anhydrous bodies to those rich in hydrated and, possibly, ammoniated materials. Their primordial nature holds key clues to the evolution of the Solar System. It has been suggested that the volatile-rich bodies formed in the outer Solar System and were implanted into the main belt. Alternatively, volatiles may have been delivered via inward-drifting icy pebbles in the protosolar disk. Here, we examine whether in-situ formed rocky embryos can acquire volatiles through pebble accretion as the snowline migrated inward. With the turbulence strength of the disk, radial pebble flux, and the dimensionless stopping time of pebbles (St) as parameters, we calculate the growth of large asteroids. The results are then compared with mass and compositional constraints based on asteroid observations. We find that a moderate pebble flux ($\lesssim18~M_\oplus / \text{Myr}$) is required to enable volatile delivery while preventing the largest asteroids from becoming more massive than Ceres. Water accretion is feasible with $\mathrm{St} \sim 10^{-3}$ ($\sim 1$ mm). However, only the largest asteroids (D &gt; 200 km) can accumulate sufficient ammonia under such conditions. For most asteroids with D between 100 and 200 km, ammonia ice accretion requires $\mathrm{St} \sim 10^{-4}$ ($\sim 100\,\mu$m). Such small particle sizes may pose both theoretical and observational challenges. Thus, we propose that the intermediate-sized, potentially ammonia-bearing asteroids serve as a record of the Solar System's dynamic evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Updated Air-Shower $X_{\rm max}$ Moment Parametrizations for UHECR Composition with Latest Hadronic Interaction Models</a><span class="id">[2602.18118]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is commonly inferred from the first two moments of the depth of shower maximum, $X_{\rm max}$, measured by fluorescence and hybrid detectors. Such analyses require fast and accurate mappings between the moments of $X_{\rm max}$ and those of the logarithmic mass, $\ln A$, based on realistic air-shower simulations. In this work we provide updated parametrizations of the $X_{\rm max}$ moments and distributions for air showers initiated by nuclei from proton to iron, simulated with CONEX for three state-of-the-art hadronic interaction models: Epos LHC-R, Sibyll 2.3e, and QGSJet-III-01. We parametrize the mean depth $\langle X_{\rm max}\rangle$ and the variance $\sigma^2(X_{\rm max})$ as functions of energy and mass. For the variance we compare a second-order polynomial model with an exponential model. In addition, we model the full $X_{\rm max}$ distributions with a three-parameter generalized Gumbel function. The Gumbel parameters are fitted using an unbinned likelihood and are validated by comparing the implied mean and variance with the raw CONEX samples and with the moment parametrizations. Across the full energy range considered, residuals between the parametrizations (or the Gumbel representation) and the simulations are at the level of a few g cm$^{-2}$ for the mean and a few (g cm$^{-2}$)$^2$ for the variance, making these parametrizations suitable for precision UHECR composition studies and forward-folding analyses of $X_{\rm max}$ distributions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Photometric and Spectroscopic investigation of 11 TESS eclipsing contact binaries</a><span class="id">[2602.18127]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>By cross-matching the eclipsing binary catalog provided by Prsa et al. (2022) with LAMOST medium resolution spectra, we obtained 11 targets. Combining light and radial velocity curves analysis, we have derived accurate physical parameters for these 11 targets. The results indicate that there are 3 deep contact binaries, 3 moderate ones, and 5 shallow ones. Among them, 3 targets exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is attributed to the presence of star-spot on the component's surface. One target is a low-mass ratio deep contact binary and may be contact binary merging candidates. The evolutionary status of these 11 targets was studied using the mass-luminosity and mass-radius relation diagrams. Based on the O-C (Observed minus Calculated) analysis of 10 targets, we found that the orbital periods of 5 contact binaries show a long-term decreasing trend, likely due to the combined effects of mass transfer between the two components and loss of angular momentum. Meanwhile, the orbital periods of the other 4 stars are continuously increasing, which is attributed to mass transfer. Besides, the O-C curves of 3 targets show clear periodic changes, which might result from the Applegate mechanism or the light travel time effect.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power-law Indices of EUV Intensity Power Spectrum in Flaring Coronal Active Regions</a><span class="id">[2602.18133]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar intensity power spectra are usually characterised by coloured noise, with the spectral energy following a segmented power-law function of frequency, $S(f)\propto f^{-\alpha}$, over different frequency ranges. Typically, the power-law index exceeds 1 in the low-frequency part ($\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$) and is around 0 at high frequencies ($\alpha_\mathrm{hf}$). This work investigates the spatial and temporal evolution of the power-law indices of coronal EUV intensity power spectra in flare-hosting active regions. The spatial distribution of the power-law index in the low-frequency domain ($\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$) closely mirrors EUV intensity images, indicating that $\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$ can reveal the dynamics of coronal plasma structures. Temporally, $\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$ remains stable in quiescent active regions, but it exhibits significant variability before the flare onset. Motivated by this behaviour, we analysed 14 flare events, quantifying the temporal variation of the indices $\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$ and $\alpha_\mathrm{hf}$ as potential flare precursors. In all flare events considered, notable deviations of $\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$ beyond a defined threshold consistently occurred at the flare site within a few minutes before the flare. In some cases, the change in the value of $\alpha_\mathrm{lf} - \alpha_\mathrm{hf}$ was detected within 30–90 minutes before the flare. This proof-of-concept study suggests that the temporal variation of the power-law indices in coronal EUV intensity power spectra could potentially serve as short-term precursors of solar flares, which needs to be validated on a larger flare sample.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A geometric physics-informed machine learning inference for the neutron star maximum mass and the inverse problem</a><span class="id">[2602.18191]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The existence of a distinct mass boundary between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes remains in question. It is an artefact of our ignorance of the properties of matter at supra-nuclear densities, which exist in the cores of neutron stars. The study addresses these problems with a physics-informed machine learning approach, guided by astrophysical observations. The Transformer model is trained on an agnostically generated ensemble of equations of state. Two geometric parameters are defined on the mass-radius sequence of a neutron star–the front bending and the back bending. The transformer provides a two-step solution: first, the model predicts the maximum mass and radius using the bending parameters. Second, it predicts the square of the sound speed profile, completing the inverse mapping. The prediction is that massive neutron stars form when the sound speed peaks at low density, leading to strong back-bending and an early phase transition to quark matter. Massive stars favour a stiff equation of state at low density, and the density of matter at the star's core is sufficiently small. The maximum mass for a neutron star predicted by the astrophysical constrained transformer model is $2.477$ solar masses, and a minimum radius of about $11.498$ km for a neutron star of $1.4$ solar masses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Dark Photon Search Results from the Dandelion Experiment</a><span class="id">[2602.18218]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents the first results from the Dandelion experiment, a directional detection, which searches for 1 meV dark photon dark matter. We use a spherical mirror to convert dark photons into standard millimeter-wavelength photons that can then be detected with an array of 221 Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) cooled down to 150 mK within the KISS (KIDs Interferometric Spectral Surveyor) camera and operating between 150 and 350 GHz. We used 1480 minutes of data to search for the signal of dark photons in the KID detectors, which is expected to be modulated due to the Earth's rotation. Our main challenge was to deal with a large background from room temperature and stray-light fluctuations. We used a de-correlation analysis to remove these background fluctuations. Templates of the background fluctuations were constructed from a Principal Component Analysis decomposition of detector measurements outside the expected Field of View trajectory of dark photons. We found that the dark photon signal was consistent with zero, giving a new upper limit on the dark photon's kinetic mixing, $\chi$, with masses between 0.6 meV and 1.4 meV. These are the first constraints on dark photons as a dark matter candidate using an array of KIDs at millimeter wavelength.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18272" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMB anisotropies from cosmic (super)strings in light of ACT DR6</a><span class="id">[2602.18272]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present updated constraints on cosmic string and superstring parameters derived from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies.

For ordinary cosmic strings, we constrain the string tension $G\mu$, the string wiggliness parameter $\alpha$, and the self-chopping efficiency $\tilde{c}$. For cosmic superstrings, we constrain the fundamental string tension $G\mu_F$, the string coupling $g_s$, and a parameter $w$ describing the volume of the compact extra dimensions.

We pay attention to the neutrino mass effects, so that the derivation of Boltzmann equations needs to specify the concrete form of interaction. We work in a model in which the DM-neutrino scatterings are induced by a dimension-six operator, and present the details for deriving the full Boltzmann hierarchy for DM and neutrinos, including a novel method to obtain the fluid approximation for modes entering the horizon. It is shown that our interaction can induce the dark acoustic oscillation in the DM-neutrino fluid, leaving distinct signatures on the CMB and matter power spectra. By using the latest CMB and BAO datasets from Planck, DESI and ACT, the constraint on today's DM-neutrino interaction parameter for the normal neutrino mass ordering reaches $u^0_{\chi-\nu} \lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-13})$, nearly nine orders stronger than that for temperature-independent case in the literature. This can be understood by noting that the scattering cross section increases nearly quadratically with cosmological temperature in the early universe, leading to enhanced effects. We have investigated alternative scenarios with different neutrino mass assumptions. In particular, models with degenerate neutrino masses give rise to weaker constraint of $u^0_{\chi-\nu} \lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-11})$, showing the importance to incorporate the realistic neutrino mass ordering in the fits. Finally, when employing the logarithmic flat prior for $u^0_{\chi-\nu}$, we have shown hints to a nonzero interaction at $95\%$ CL by combining Planck, DESI and ACT data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18367" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical simulations of cold clumps in the hot accretion flows around black holes</a><span class="id">[2602.18367]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Previous numerical simulations have shown that cold clumps can form within hot accretion flows, offering insights into the detailed processes of the state transition in black hole X-ray binaries. However, the evolution of the cold clumps has not been investigated in detail yet. In this paper, we conduct hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the evolution of the cold clumps. In addition to previous result that when the accretion rate is high enough the cold clumps emerge within the hot accretion flow, we found that instead of directly moving toward to the black hole, the clumps moves outward when they initially form. The reason should be the combination of viscous torque and the condensation of hot gas from larger radii, which lead to the slightly super-Keplerian angular momentum of the clumps. After reaching the equilibrium position, the clumps begin to fragment at the inner edge with each fragment moving inward sequentially. Generally, the azimuthal movement of the clumps are quasi-Keplerian, being closer to the outer detached Keplerian cold disk rather than the surrounding sub-Keplerian hot accretion flow, which agrees well with the semi-analytical results for weak coupling case in Wang et al. (2012).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chandra Proper Motions and Milliarcsecond Astrometry of Nineteen Pulsars</a><span class="id">[2602.18436]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present X-ray proper motion (PM) measurements of 19 pulsars using new and archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, including pulsar wind trails and X-ray filaments.

It has been shown that all individual multiplet scenarios beyond the doublet lead to direct-detection signals above the neutrino floor and thus within the reach of next-generation experiments. If no signals are found, would minimal dark matter be excluded? Yes for the simplest models, but it has been unknown for the important extension of two multiplets coupled by Higgs interactions (Higgs-coupled minimal dark matter). We present a generalized framework for calculating nonperturbative effects for such models that also covers the case of individual multiplets. In this framework, we calculate nonperturbative effects on freezeout as well as the prospects for direct detection, correcting shortcomings and omissions in the literature. Importantly, for the mixed Majorana (odd) and Dirac (even) multiplet combinations 3M2D, 5M4D, and 7M6D, we find that the predicted direct-detection signals can extend below the neutrino floor.

The model contains two Majorana states $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ with $\delta=M_{\chi_2}-M_{\chi_1}&gt;0$ and $\chi_1$ the dark matter candidate, and a dark photon $A^{\prime}$ with mass $M_{A^{\prime}}$. Our analysis represents an integration of existing ones, where only specific benchmarks of the A$^{\prime}$iDM scenario have been discussed. In particular, we fix the $U(1)_D$ coupling $\alpha_D$ equal to the electromagnetic one $\alpha_{EM}$ and $\epsilon$ to its experimental upper bound, and perform a complete scan of the remaining parameters $(M_{\chi_1},\delta, M_{A^{\prime}})$, discussing the $\chi_1$ relic abundance, its direct and indirect searches, as well as potential signals from astrophysics and accelerators. Our systematic scan shows that $\alpha_D$ = $\alpha_{EM}$ is not disfavored, as some previous analyses, limited to specific benchmarks, may suggest. We also find that when the $\chi_1$ relic density matches observation direct and indirect searches are not kinematically accessible. On the other hand we find that the projected luminosity of FASER, a detector searching for Long Lived Particles (LLP) decay at the LHC, can probe or rule out the parameters space of the model for $M_{\chi_1}\lesssim$ 7 GeV, 100 MeV $\lesssim \delta\lesssim$ 300 MeV and $M_{A^{\prime}}\lesssim$ 25 GeV.

We employ a Skyrme-type $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction that includes the standard $s$- and $p$-wave terms, as well as a density-dependent term that effectively represents an $N\Lambda\Lambda$ three-body force. The $s$-wave terms are constrained using data on double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei supplemented by pseudodata obtained from core + $2\Lambda$ three-body model calculations including heavier hypernuclei. We show that the data on heavier systems are essential to simultaneously constrain the two $s$-wave parameters.

I focus primarily on solar $g$ modes, evaluating their responses for degree $l=2$ and azimuthal orders $m=0$ and $m=2$. The analysis incorporates both the earlier proposed and the current updated LISA sensitivity curves, and I perform a comparative assessment with the TianQin mission in the relevant low-frequency band. To assess the robustness of the predicted signals, I estimate the gravitational responses using two different standard solar models based on the GS98 and AGSS09 abundance compilations.

In this study, we integrate three types of machine learning models to generate solar magnetic patches in a physically interpretable manner and use those as a query to find matching patches in real observations. We use the magnetic field measurements from Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs) to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We connect the physical properties of GAN-generated images with their latent vectors to train Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that do mapping between physical and latent spaces. These produce directions in the GAN latent space along which known physical parameters of the SHARPs change. We train a self-supervised learner (SSL) to make queries with generated images and find matches from real data. We find that the GAN-SVM combination enables users to produce high-quality patches that change smoothly only with a prescribed physical quantity, making generative models physically interpretable. We also show that GAN outputs can be used to retrieve real data that shares the same physical properties as the generated query. This elevates Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) from a means-to-produce artificial data to a novel tool for scientific data interrogation, supporting its applicability beyond the domain of heliophysics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A solution to the tension of burning on neutron stars and nuclear physics</a><span class="id">[2506.11966]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When neutron stars accrete matter from a companion star, this matter forms a disc around them and eventually falls on their surface.

However, models predict that the bursts should cease at high accretion rates, whereas in many sources they disappear at much lower rates. Moreover, their recurrence times also show strong discrepancies with predictions. Although various solutions have been proposed, none can account for all the observational constraints. Here we describe a new model that explains all the contradictory behaviours within a single picture. We are able to reconstruct the conditions on the star surface that determine the burst properties by comparing data to new simulations.

This quantifies the ultimate precision achievable in parameter estimation, assuming ideal access to early-universe information. By comparing the quantum Fisher information to its classical counterpart - derived from measurements of the curvature perturbation power spectrum alone (homodyne measurement) - we evaluate how close current observations come to this quantum limit. Focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as a case study, we find that the gap between classical and quantum Fisher information grows exponentially with the number of e-folds a mode spends outside the horizon. This suggests the existence of a highly efficient (but presently inaccessible) optimal measurement.

This approach offers a physically intuitive characterization of void dynamics and can naturally be applied to non-standard cosmologies. We derive the cosmology-dependent mapping that relates the linear (Lagrangian) and fully non-linear (Eulerian) evolution of the matter density contrast, a central component for accurate theoretical modeling of void statistics. Furthermore, we present a new method for determining the shell-crossing epoch across arbitrary cosmological backgrounds, thereby extending previous treatments restricted to the Einstein-de Sitter universe. Motivated by recent DESI results hinting at dynamical dark energy, we investigate void evolution in $ w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies by varying $ w_0$ and $w_a$. We also consider the impact of varying the matter density parameter, $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}$. We find that the evolution of isolated, spherically symmetric cosmic voids is most sensitive to $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0} $ and $ w_0 $, which can alter the non-linear density contrast by up to 20-30%. Variations in $w_a$ have a smaller impact, but may still lead to measurable effects. We also show that the cosmology-dependent mapping between linear and non-linear density contrasts may provide a sensitive probe of dynamical dark energy in precision void analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$r$-process Heating Feedback on Disk Outflows from Neutron Star Mergers</a><span class="id">[2508.15288]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutron star mergers produce $r$-process elements, with yields that are sensitive to the kinematic and thermodynamic properties of the ejecta. These ejecta properties are potentially affected by dynamically-important feedback from $r$-process heating, which is usually not coupled to the hydrodynamics in post-merger simulations modeling the ejecta launching and expansion. The multi-messenger detection of GW170817 showed the importance of producing reliable ejecta predictions, to maximize the diagnostic potential of future events. In this paper, we develop a prescription for including $r$-process heating as a source term in the hydrodynamic equations. This prescription depends on local fluid properties and on the $Y_{e}$ history as recorded by dedicated tracer particles, which exchange information with the grid using the Cloud-in-Cell method. The method is implemented in long-term viscous hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disk outflows to investigate its feedback on ejecta properties. We find that $r$-process heating can increase the unbound disk ejecta mass by $\sim 10\%$ relative to a baseline case that only considers alpha particle recombination. Nuclear heating also enhances the radial velocity of the ejecta with $Y_e &lt; 0.25$ by up to a factor of two, while concurrently suppressing marginally-bound convective ejecta.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Interpretations of the Cosmological Preference for a Negative Neutrino Mass</a><span class="id">[2508.20999]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) show some tension with a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. For one, the cosmological parameters determined by the CMB are at odds with the expansion history determined by latest BAO measurements. In addition, the combined data has placed uncomfortably strong constraints on neutrino mass. Both effects can be interpreted as negative neutrino mass, one describing the change to the expansion history and the other one describing enhanced lensing. In this paper, we show the current tensions can be solved with a single change either to the lensing of the CMB or the expansion of the universe. We show additional lensing could arise from a variety of models with new light fields. However, these models rarely give the same signal in temperature and polarization, giving a concrete test of the scenario. Alternatively, dark sector models can explain the changes to the expansion by changing the evolution of the matter density. These models introduce new forces, giving rise to long range signals in the three-point statistics of galaxies. We discuss a range of other examples which all illustrate the pattern that additional signals should appear if these tensions are explained by beyond the Standard Model physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-high energy event KM3-230213A as a cosmogenic neutrino in light of minimal UHECR flux models</a><span class="id">[2509.09590]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, the KM3NeT experiment reported the detection of a neutrino with exceptionally high energy E = 220 PeV, whose origin remains unclear.

We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located $\geq 90^\circ$ from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21461" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stochastic analysis of ultra-high energy cosmic ray interactions</a><span class="id">[2509.21461]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Photonuclear interactions between ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) nuclei and surrounding photon fields are key to understanding the connection between the compositions observed at Earth and those emitted from the sources. These interactions can completely disintegrate a nucleus of iron over trajectory lengths of a few and up to hundreds of megaparsecs, depending on the energy of the UHECR. The stochastic nature of these interactions means that it is not possible to describe them deterministically for a single cosmic ray, and an exact formulation of the probability distributions is not yet available. Current approaches describe these interactions using either Monte Carlo simulations or solving ordinary differential equations that neglect stochasticity. Because of the limitations of these approaches, only partial capture of the process is achieved. This paper presents an analytic probabilistic description of UHECR interactions and the resulting nuclear cascades, establishing their connection to Markov jump processes. The fundamental properties of these cascades are presented, as is the computation of the usual quantities of interest, such as the horizon, spectrum, and composition. The benefits of this description are outlined using astrophysical examples related to extragalactic propagation and UHECR sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-long Gamma-ray Bursts from Micro-Tidal Disruption Events: The Case of GRB 250702B</a><span class="id">[2509.22779]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs), a rare class of high-energy transients with durations $&gt;10^3$s, remain poorly understood. GRB 250702B is notable for its multi-hour prompt emission, an X-ray pre-peak emission starting $\sim$1 day earlier, off-nuclear host position, and hard, rapidly variable gamma-rays. This combination is difficult to explain with standard ULGRB progenitors such as blue-supergiant collapsars, magnetar engines, or white-dwarf tidal disruptions by intermediate-mass black holes. We interpret the event as a micro-tidal disruption event ($\mu$TDE), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star partially or fully disrupts a main-sequence star. Three $\mu$TDE pathways can reproduce the observed pre-peak emission to main flare delay: (i) a dynamical (partial/repeating) disruption, in which a grazing passage yields a faint precursor and the core returns after $\sim$day for a deeper encounter; (ii) a natal-kick disruption, where the delay reflects the ballistic motion of a newborn compact object relative to its companion, leading to full disruption; and (iii) a hybrid natal-kick + partial case, in which the kick seeds the close encounter but the first passage is only partial, with the core returning on the day-scale period. Cross-section scalings imply comparable rates for partial and full outcomes in both dynamical and natal-kick scenarios. The highly variable, hard $\gamma$-ray emission supports association with a stellar-mass compact object. Fallback and viscous accretion naturally explain the ultra-long duration, energetics, and ks-scale X-ray variability. We outline observational discriminants between the three channels and argue that $\mu$TDEs offer a compelling framework for ULGRBs such as GRB 250702B.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comparing measures of the Hubble and BAO tensions in $Λ$CDM and possible solutions in $f(Q)$ gravity</a><span class="id">[2510.20964]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We test whether $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel gravity theories can solve the Hubble tension consistently with DESI DR2 BAO. We consider three $f(Q)$ functional forms: logarithmic, exponential, and hyperbolic tangent. We extend these models by allowing a cosmological constant, and compare to phenomenological models with a flexible exponential, hyperbolic secant, and polynomial decay addition to the standard $\Lambda$CDM $H(z)$. We test these models against DESI DR2 BAO, CMB (\emph{Planck} 2018 + SPT-3G + ACT DR6), local $H_0$, and Cosmic Chronometer data. The logarithmic and hyperbolic tangent $f(Q)$ models do not provide an adequate solution, but the exponential model does. Furthermore, it slightly reduces the $(\Omega_m, H_0 r_d)$ parameter space tension between CMB and BAO datasets to $2.56\sigma$, down from $2.65\sigma$ for $\Lambda$CDM. Although $\Lambda$CDM faces only $1.66\sigma$ tension in DESI data space, the $1\sigma$ higher tension in parameter space suggests a real anomaly. The models assisted by the cosmological constant perform slightly better still, at the cost of undermined theoretical motivation. They also perform poorly once local $H_0$ measurements are included. The phenomenological models fit all data reasonably well, yet the best-fitting models predict isotropically averaged BAO distances exceeding the DESI DR2 measurements at all redshifts. This highlights the difficulties of finding a theoretically motivated solution to the Hubble tension while remaining consistent with BAO data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rethinking mass transfer: a unified semianalytical framework for circular and eccentric binaries. II. Orbital evolution due to nonconservative mass transfer</a><span class="id">[2511.07190]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although mass transfer (MT) has been studied primarily in circular binaries, observations show that it also occurs in eccentric systems. We investigate orbital evolution during nonconservative MT in eccentric orbits, a process especially relevant for binaries containing compact objects (COs). We examined four angular momentum loss (AML) modes: Jeans, isotropic reemission, orbital-AML, and $L_2$ mass loss, with the last mode being the most efficient AML mode. For a fixed AML mode and accretion efficiency, orbital evolution is correlated: orbits either widen while becoming more eccentric, or shrink while circularizing. Jeans mode generally yields orbital widening and eccentricity pumping, whereas $L_2$ mass loss typically leads to orbital shrinkage and eccentricity damping. Isotropic reemission and orbital-AML show an intermediate behavior. Adopting isotropic reemission, we demonstrate that eccentric MT produces compact binaries that merge via gravitational waves (GW) within a Hubble time, whereas the same systems would instead merge during MT under traditional modeling. We further show that, in eccentric orbits, the gravitational potential at $L_2$ becomes lower than at $L_1$ across a wide range of mass ratios and eccentricities, naturally linking eccentricity to $L_2$ mass loss. Eccentric MT may therefore lead to the formation of the circumbinary disks observed around eccentric post-red-giant-branch and post-asymptotic-giant-branch systems. Since interacting binaries containing COs are frequently eccentric, $L_2$ mass loss offers a new robust pathway to orbital tightening during eccentric MT, contributing to the formation rate of GW sources. This model can treat orbital evolution due to conservative and nonconservative MT in arbitrary eccentricities, with applications ranging from MT on the main sequence to GW progenitors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joint Constraints on Fuzzy and Warm Dark Matter from Satellite Populations of the Milky Way and Andromeda</a><span class="id">[2512.01361]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform a joint analysis of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) satellite populations to constrain the properties of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and thermal-relic warm dark matter (WDM).

(2020) together with the appropriate selection functions. Uncertainties in the virial masses of the MW and M31 are incorporated through host-mass priors that linearly scale the relevant model parameters, allowing us to infer the full posterior distributions of all parameters. For the FDM case, we obtain $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} &gt; 1.74 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ (95\% CL) and $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} &gt; 1.42 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ (20:1 posterior ratio).

Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells by limiting the absorption coefficients. Finally, we apply multigroup \textsc{rich} in a pilot three dimensional study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIRPS tightens the mass estimate of GJ 3090 b and detects a planet near the stellar rotation period</a><span class="id">[2601.09330]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an updated characterization of the planetary system orbiting the nearby M2 dwarf GJ 3090 (TOI-177; $d = 22$ pc), based on new high-precision radial velocity (RV) observations from NIRPS and HARPS. With an orbital period of 2.85 d, the transiting sub-Neptune GJ 3090 b has a mass we refine to $4.52 \pm 0.47 M_{\oplus}$, which, combined with our derived radius of $2.18 \pm 0.06 R_{\oplus}$, yields a density of $2.40^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The combined interior structure and atmospheric constraints indicate that GJ 3090 b is a compelling water-world candidate, with a volatile-rich envelope in which water likely represents a significant fraction. We also confirm the presence of a second planet, GJ 3090 c, a sub-Neptune with a 15.9 d orbit and a minimum mass of $10.0 \pm 1.3 M_{\oplus}$, which does not transit. Despite its proximity to the star's 18 d rotation period, our joint analysis using a multidimensional Gaussian process (GP) model that incorporates TESS photometry and differential stellar temperature measurements distinguishes this planetary signal from activity-induced variability. In addition, we place new constraints on a non-transiting planet candidate with a period of 12.7 d, suggested in earlier RV analyses. This candidate remains a compelling target for future monitoring. These results highlight the crucial role of multidimensional GP modelling in disentangling planetary signals from stellar activity, enabling the detection of a planet near the stellar rotation period that could have remained undetected with traditional approaches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A simple mechanism for the enhancement of the inflationary power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2602.04055]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The background evolution in two-field inflation can feature two distinct stages, corresponding to the evolution along two successive field directions.

In this work, we test Giddings' nonviolent nonlocality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range – up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from nonviolent nonlocality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in nonviolent nonlocality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third-generation network.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04083" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial black hole ringdown: The irreducible stochastic gravitational wave background</a><span class="id">[2507.04083]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Independently from the formation mechanism of primordial black holes in the early Universe, their generation is accompanied by a ringdown phase during which they relax to a stationary configuration and gravitational waves under the form of quasinormal modes are emitted.

This process has been used for decades to constrain the population of such objects, particularly as a component of dark matter (DM). The effects of light compact objects, such as those in the unconstrained asteroid-mass range, have generally been neglected. In principle, low-energy perturbers can harden binaries instead of softening them, but the standard lore is that this effect vanishes when the perturber velocities are large compared to the binary's orbital velocity, as is typical for DM constituents. Here, we revisit the computation of the hardening rate induced by light perturbers. We show that although the perturbations average to zero over many encounters, many scenarios of interest for DM constraints are in the regime where the variance cannot be neglected. We show that a few fast-moving perturbers can leave stochastic perturbations in systems that are measured with great precision, and we use this framework to revisit the constraint potential of systems such as binary pulsars and the Solar System. This opens a new class of dynamical probes with potential applications to asteroid-mass DM candidates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Ionization by Schwarzschild Primordial Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2601.05935]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) are theorized to form from the collapse of overdensities in the very early Universe. PBHs in the asteroid-mass range $10^{17} \, {\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$ could serve as all or most of the dark matter today, but are particularly difficult to detect due to their modest rates of Hawking emission and sub-micron Schwarzschild radii. We consider whether the steep gradients of a PBH's gravitational field could generate tidal forces strong enough to disrupt atoms and nuclei. Such phenomena may yield new observables that could uniquely distinguish a PBH from a macroscopic object of the same mass. We first consider the gravitational ionization of ambient neutral hydrogen and evaluate prospects for detecting photon radiation from the recombination of ionized atoms. During the present epoch, this effect would be swamped by Hawking radiation – which would itself be difficult to detect for PBHs at the upper end of the asteroid-mass window. We then consider the gravitational ionization and heating of neutral hydrogen immediately following recombination at $z\simeq1090$, and identify a broad class of PBH distributions with typical mass $5\times10^{21}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23}\, {\rm g}$ within which gravitational interactions would have been the dominant form of energy deposition to the medium. We also identify conditions under which tidal forces from a transiting PBH could overcome the strong nuclear force, either by dissociating deuterons, which would be relevant during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), or by inducing fission of heavy nuclei. We find that gravitational dissociation of deuterons dominates photodissociation rates due to Hawking radiation for PBHs with masses $10^{14}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$. We additionally identify the phenomenon of gravitationally induced fission of heavy nuclei via tidal deformation.</p></div></details></article></body>
