<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Particles before symmetry</a><span class="id">[2509.25276]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The standard model of particle physics relies heavily on the idea of symmetry. But recently, a new geometry-first picture has been proposed in which the relevant symmetries do not appear explicitly at the ground level of ontology. Here, I extend the initial correspondence to include alternative – and more transparent – accounts of spontaneous symmetry breaking and of the Yukawa coupling: both fundamental for particles to have masses. These reformulations allow us to replace explanations that employ typical particle physics ideas and terminology with ones that are phrased geometrically</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lorentz, Poincaré, and Einstein: Rethinking Doppler, Aberration, and the Fresnel Drag</a><span class="id">[2509.26389]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper examines Lorentz's 1895 derivations of the classical Doppler formula and Fresnel drag, Einstein's 1905 derivation of the relativistic Doppler effect and aberration, and Einstein's 1907 kinematical route to the exact velocity composition law from which Fresnel drag is obtained as a low-velocity limit. Einstein acknowledged that he had read Lorentz's &quot;Versuch&quot; well before 1905. In 1907, Einstein identified Lorentz's &quot;Versuch&quot; as a crucial precursor to relativity. In that work, Lorentz had already invoked local time to derive Fresnel's drag coefficient from Maxwell's equations. There is a genuine &quot;family resemblance&quot; between Lorentz's and Einstein's treatments in that both preserve the phase of a plane wave under transformation. Yet I demonstrate that this resemblance is only formal. I also discuss the absence of the relativistic Doppler and aberration laws in Poincaré's Dynamics of the Electron.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26450" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diffeomorphism Invariance and Background Independence</a><span class="id">[2509.26450]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper answers examines the relationship between Diffeomorphism Invariance and Background Independence. First, a review of the relationship between Background Independence, General Relativity (GR) and pre-GR theories are given. Then, a wide range of other conceptions of background independence is discussed. It is shown that the definition of Background Independence is fluid and can mean different things to different philosophers and/or physicists. Most pertinently, the paper addresses the question of what kind of background independence is implied by a mathematical criterion of diffeomorphism invariance or in what sense is diffeomorphism invariance background independence. Lastly, the concept of haecceity in relation to diffeomorphism invariance is discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A physical approach to qualia and the emergence of conscious observers in qualia space</a><span class="id">[2203.10602]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I propose that qualia are physical because they are directly observable, and revisit the contentious link between consciousness and quantum measurements from a new perspective – one that does not rely on observers or wave function collapse but instead treats physical measurements as fundamental in a sense resonant with Wheeler's it-from-bit. Building on a mathematical definition of measurement space in physics, I reinterpret it as a model of qualia, effectively equating the measurement problem of quantum mechanics with the hard problem of consciousness. The resulting framework falls within panpsychism, and offers potential solutions to the combination problem. Moreover, some of the mathematical structure of measurement spaces, taken for granted in physics, needs justification for qualia, suggesting that the apparent solidity of physical reality is deeply rooted in how humans process information.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25355" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developing signal processing skills: A proposal for the teaching of filters</a><span class="id">[2509.25355]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In accordance with Bloom's taxonomy, a four-level evaluation abstraction was generated with the objective of structuring and hierarchizing curricula knowledge, allowing students to dominate a subject and progressively reach the top of Bloom's pyramid. The evaluation was conducted with 10 university students who analyzed and optimized a filtering process using MATLAB simulation while constrained by time. The results demonstrate that this novel teaching method facilitates a more profound comprehension of the subject for students with diverse learning styles in science.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25642" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help or Hype? Students' Engagement and Perception of Using AI to Solve Physics Problems</a><span class="id">[2509.25642]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the rise of large language models such as ChatGPT, interest has grown in understanding how these tools influence learning in STEM education, including physics. This study explores how students use ChatGPT during a physics problem-solving task embedded in a formal assessment. We analyzed patterns of AI usage and their relationship to student performance. Findings indicate that students who engaged with ChatGPT generally performed better than those who did not. Particularly, students who provided more complete and contextual prompts experienced greater benefits. Further, students who demonstrated overall positive gains collectively asked more conceptual questions than those who exhibited overall negative gains. However, the presence of incorrect AI-generated responses also underscores the importance of critically evaluating AI output. These results suggest that while AI can be a valuable aid in problem solving, its effectiveness depends significantly on how students use it, reinforcing the need to incorporate structured AI-literacy into STEM education.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25769" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Integrating noise into PhET simulations to promote student learning of measurement uncertainty</a><span class="id">[2509.25769]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding concepts and practices of measurement uncertainty is a core competency of physicists and engineers, and many physics lab courses aim to have students learn these ideas. However, there is strong evidence that these goals are often not met. To address the challenge of improving students' proficiency with measurement uncertainty concepts and practices, we designed and developed a new PhET simulation, Projectile Data Lab (PDL), featuring statistical noise and measurement tools in the context of projectile motion. We integrated this simulation into the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP), creating an instructional platform for collecting and analyzing data from the simulation, and designed three simulation-based instructional activities for instructors to use in their lab courses. We describe the pedagogical design of the new simulation, the PDL+CODAP instructional platform, and the associated instructional activities. We highlight how the targeted learning goals guided the pedagogical design, as well as how these three instructional tools (the simulation, the PDL+CODAP platform, and the lab activity) work together and leverage the affordances of each to scaffold learning. The goal of this work is to provide a model of how noise-enhanced simulations and activities can be designed to enhance student learning of measurement uncertainty.</p></div></details></article></body>
