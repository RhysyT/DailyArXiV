<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another 100 Years of Quantum Interpretation?</a><span class="id">[2512.14315]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interpretation is not the only way to explain a theory's success, form and features, and nor is it the only way to solve problems we see with a theory. This can also be done by giving a reductive explanation of the theory, by reference to a newer, more accurate, and/or more fundamental theory. We are seeking a theory of quantum gravity, a more fundamental theory than both quantum mechanics and general relativity, yet, while this theory is supposed to explain general relativity, it's not typically been thought to be necessary, or able, to explain quantum mechanics – a task instead assigned to interpretation. Here, I question why this is. I also present a new way of assessing the various interpretations of quantum mechanics, in terms of their heuristic and unificatory potential in helping us find a more fundamental theory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QBism, Polishing Some Points</a><span class="id">[2512.14122]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>QBism pursues the real by first eliminating the elements of quantum theory too fragile to be ontologies on their own. Thereafter, it seeks an &quot;ontological lesson&quot; from whatever remains. Here, we explore this program by highlighting three tenets of QBism. First, the Born Rule is a normative statement. It is about the decision-making behavior any individual agent should strive for, not a descriptive &quot;law of nature.&quot; Second, all probabilities, including all quantum probabilities, are so subjective they never tell nature what to do. This includes probability-1 assignments. Quantum states thus have no &quot;ontic hold&quot; on the world, which implies a more radical kind of indeterminism in quantum theory than other interpretations understand. Third, quantum measurement outcomes just are personal experiences for the agent gambling upon them. Thus all quantum measurement outcomes are local in the sense of the agent enacting them. Through these tenets, we explain four points better than previously: 1) how QBism contrasts with Bohr's concern over unambiguous language, 2) how QBism contrasts with the Everett interpretation, 3) how QBism understands the meaning of Bell inequality violations, and 4) how QBism responds to Wigner's &quot;suspended animation&quot; argument. Finally, we consider the ontological lesson of the tenets and ask what it might mean for the next one hundred years of quantum theory and humankind more generally.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measurement of electromagnetic radiation force using a capacitance-bridge interferometer</a><span class="id">[2408.04893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a mechanical cantilever-based tabletop interferometer to measure the radiation force exerted by light. Using a high-power (  1W) pulsed laser beam, we excite mechanical oscillations of a thin metallic cantilever. The cantilever forms a parallel plate capacitor with a printed circuit board trace. Using a capacitance-bridge geometry, we measure small capacitance changes of the order of femto-Farads, induced by the radiation forces of a few nano-Newtons. This experiment uses equipment commonly found in an undergraduate teaching laboratory for physics and electronics while providing insight into electromagnetic wave theory, circuit design for low-noise measurements, and Fourier analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can Large Language Models Correctly Interpret Equations with Errors?</a><span class="id">[2505.10966]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models to accurately extract and translate equations from typed student responses into a standard format. This is a useful task as standardized equations can be graded reliably using a Computer Algebra System or a Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver. Therefore physics instructors interested in automated grading would not need to rely on the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Language Models. We used two novel frameworks to improve the translations. The first is consensus where a pair of models verify the correctness of the translations. The second is a neuro-symbolic LLM-modulo approach were models receive feedback from an automated reasoning tool. We performed experiments using responses to the Australian Physics Olympaid exam. We report on results, finding that no open-source model was able to translate the student responses at the desired level of accuracy. Future work could involve breaking the task into smaller components before parsing to improve performance, or generalizing the experiments to translate hand-written responses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Which Rope Breaks? A Study of Tension Distribution in Multi-Rope Systems</a><span class="id">[2509.09973]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the tension distribution in systems of mass-less ropes under different loading conditions. For a two-rope system, we demonstrate how the breaking scenario depends on the applied force dynamics: rapid pulling causes the lower rope to break, while gradual pulling leads to upper rope failure. Extending to a three-rope Y-shaped configuration, we identify a critical angle $\theta_{C}=60^{\circ}$ that determines which rope breaks first. When the angle between the upper ropes exceeds this critical value, the upper ropes fail before the lower one. We further analyze how an attached mass at the junction point modifies this critical angle and establish maximum mass limits for valid solutions. Our results provide practical insights for introductory physics students understanding static forces and system stabilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05754" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Niñas Atómicas&quot; (Atomic Girls): An initiative that generates opportunities for young girls in STEM</a><span class="id">[2511.05754]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on an initiative that seeks to encourage high school girls to develop critical thinking and transferable skills widely used in scientific work, as well as to generate a concrete space of opportunities for girls to experience how real science is done. Our &quot;Niñas Atómicas&quot; workshop combines the teaching of particle physics, electronics, programming and scientific methodology through building and operating a dedicated experiment: a muon counter. Girls from all over Chile can apply to this workshop, where every year they are guided by female scientists for two weeks. We report on the contents and methodology of our workshop and provide details on how to build the muon detector. We report results on muon flux and proper lifetime, two muon properties which can be extracted from the data collected by the girls with the muon detectors they built themselves. Insights into the girl's experiences during the 2024 and 2025 editions of the workshop are also detailed, with the aim to contribute to the wider physics education research and outreach communities.</p></div></details></article>
