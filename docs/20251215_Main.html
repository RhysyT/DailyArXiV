While the power spectrum of these models has been extensively studied, higher-order correlations are much less understood. Motivated by the complex physics involved and the fact that PBH and SIGW formation are both sensitive to non-linearities, we present a detailed study of the bispectrum as the leading non-linear effect in these scenarios. We refer to the scale- and shape-dependence of the bispectrum collectively as its geometry; and define a scale-dependent shape correlator to disentangle the two dependencies. Generally, we find that for the scales most affected by phase transitions and particle production (including the power spectrum peak), the bispectrum is strongest near the equilateral configuration, while non-attractor phases tend to produce correlations near the squeezed configuration. We further propose a simplified bispectrum estimator, resembling local-type non-Gaussianity but with scale-dependent amplitude, that captures the main features of the full bispectrum. As an implication of our results, we show that incorporating the bispectrum significantly broadens the range of scales with a substantial probability of large smoothed density contrasts compared to linear analysis. This suggests that non-linearities can alter not only PBH abundance and SIGW amplitude but also their mass and frequency spectra. In particular, and in contrast with the usual assumption, our results hint that the second-highest peak of the power spectrum may produce more PBHs than the highest peak.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of in-situ nuclear networks and atomic opacities on neutron star merger ejecta dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and kilonovae</a><span class="id">[2512.11032]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modeling binary neutron star merger (BNSM) ejecta evolution requires simulations involving hydrodynamics, nuclear reactions, and radiative processes. The impact of nuclear burning and atomic opacity is poorly understood and often treated with simplified prescriptions. We systematically investigate different treatments of nuclear heating, thermalization, and opacities in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of BNSM ejecta and kilonova light curves. Ejecta from long-term numerical-relativity simulations are evolved to  30 days using a 2D ray-by-ray approach. We compare simplified heating-rates, thermalization prescriptions, and gray opacities with in-situ nuclear networks (NN) that track energy deposition, and include a composition-dependent thermalization scheme and frequency-dependent, atomic-physics-based opacities. Coupling NN and hydrodynamics affects nucleosynthesis and kilonova emission. Assuming homologous expansion alters the abundance evolution and produces a narrower second $r$-process peak and a third peak shifted to higher mass numbers. Nuclear heating back-reaction delays and reddens the early emission. A constant thermalization underestimates the early luminosity and overestimates the late emission. Analytical opacities yield dimmer and redder kilonovae at early times ($t\lesssim$ hour) and a prolonged emission at $t\gtrsim5$ days. Resolving the first hundreds of milliseconds of hydrodynamics is essential for robust nucleosynthesis calculations, and composition-dependent thermalization and frequency-dependent, atomic opacities are needed to accurately capture the ejecta temperature and kilonova brightness and color evolution. Analytic nuclear-power fits with simplified thermalization and opacities can reproduce the density and temperature evolution of the ejecta.

We study the Horndeski class of modified gravity models in an effective field theory framework employing a parameterisation that satisfies stability conditions by construction and, for the first time, present a cosmological analysis in this inherently stable parameter basis. Cosmic shear constrains the Horndeski parameter space significantly, matching or surpassing the CMB contribution. Adopting the de-mixed kinetic term of the scalar field perturbation, $D_{\rm kin}$, and the deviation of the Planck mass from its fiducial value, $\Delta M_*^2\equiv M_*^2-1$, as model parameters, we constrain their present values to be $\Delta \hat{M}_*^2=0.32^{+0.07}_{-0.21}$ and $\hat{D}_{\rm kin} = 3.74^{+0.69}_{-1.92}$, which deviate from general relativity at $1.5\sigma$ and $1.9\sigma$, respectively. We derive constraints on the structure growth parameter $S_8=0.813^{+0.008}_{-0.011}$, which is compatible with the $\Lambda$CDM constraint at $0.54\sigma$. We obtain the deviation of the effective Newtonian coupling from the GR value as $\Delta \mu_{\infty,{\rm eff}}=0.066\pm0.023$, corresponding to a $2.9\sigma$ significance. Although modified gravity provides a slightly better fit to the data, a model comparison shows only a weak preference for modified gravity at the $1.4\sigma$ level. When adopting a dynamical dark energy model of the background cosmology, the inferred modified gravity parameter constraints are stable with respect to a $\Lambda$CDM background, while a mild preference at $1.57\sigma$ for dynamical dark energy remains.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KiDS-Legacy: Constraining dark energy, neutrino mass, and curvature</a><span class="id">[2512.11041]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We constrain minimally extended cosmological models with the cosmic shear analysis of the final data release from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-Legacy) in combination with external probes. Due to the consistency of the KiDS-Legacy analysis with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we can combine these data sets reliably for the first time. Additionally, we use CMB lensing, galaxy redshift-space distortions, and baryon acoustic oscillations. We assess, in turn, the effects of spatial curvature, varying neutrino masses, and an evolving dark energy component on cosmological constraints from KiDS-Legacy alone and in combination with external probes. We find KiDS-Legacy to be consistent with the fiducial flat $\Lambda$CDM analysis with $c^2 \sum m_\nu\leq 1.5\,$eV, $w_0 = -1.0\pm 0.7$ and $w_a = -1.3^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$ while $\Omega_K = 0.08^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$ (1$\sigma$ bounds) with almost equal goodness-of-fit. $w_0w_a$CDM is not a significant improvement over $\Lambda$CDM when cosmic shear and CMB lensing are combined, yielding a Bayes factor $B = 0.07$. If all probes are combined, however, $B$ increases to 2.73, corresponding to a $2.6\sigma$ suspicousness tension. The constraint on $S_8 = \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3}$ is robust to opening up the parameter space for cosmic shear. Adding all external datasets to KiDS-Legacy, we find with $S_8 = 0.816 \pm 0.006$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $S_8 = 0.837 \pm 0.008$ in $w_0 w_a$CDM for all probes combined.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Detection of an Ultracool Dwarf at 340 MHz: VLITE Observations of EI Cancri AB</a><span class="id">[2512.11120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetically driven phenomena such as flaring events and aurorae lead ultracool dwarfs to emit at radio frequencies. Despite decades of scrutiny, a comprehensive physical understanding of their radio emission at different frequencies remains elusive, spurring on additional study of these complex objects. The VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE) is a commensal instrument operating at 340 MHz on the Very Large Array. A key advantage of 340 MHz observations is their sensitivity to circumstellar disks and planets at understudied distances from the stellar disk, intermediate between GHz and low MHz sensitivities. Hard-to-find coronal mass ejections are also predicted to be detectable at 340 MHz. However, this frequency regime is relatively unprobed in ultracool dwarf studies, with few searches and no published detections to date. Here we highlight our investigation of the nearby M7-M7 binary, EI Cancri. EI Cancri AB is magnetically active, yet has an uncharacteristically long 83-day candidate rotation period within the system. With the VLITE detection of the EI Cancri system, we present the first ever detection of ultracool dwarf emission at 340 MHz.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on the intergalactic magnetic field from Fermi-LAT observations of GRB 221009A</a><span class="id">[2512.11128]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected. Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B &lt; 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The magnetic origin of the outer boundary of sunspots</a><span class="id">[2512.11160]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Sunspot boundaries are commonly outlined by contours of the continuum intensity. However, their magnetic nature has not yet been fully characterised. Aims. We investigate the properties of the outer boundary of a long-lived sunspot to identify the magnetic property that defines it. Methods. We analysed the magnetic properties of AR NOAA11591 spot during its two passages across the solar disc, using SDO/HMI continuum intensity and magnetic field, and determined their contours to outline the outer boundary. Results. During the 1st disc passage, in which the sunspot is in its stable phase, the intensity contours at 0.9 of the mean quiet Sun intensity and isocontours of the magnetic field strength of 625G provide an almost perfect match between the two contours. With these thresholds, the time-averaged area of mismatch is minimised, yielding an average distance between the contours of 0.58 pixel, corresponding to less than 0.26 arcsec. During the 2nd disc passage, the spot shows clear signs of decay, and we find that the 0.9 intensity and 625G magnetic isocontours detach from each other, coupled to the disappearance of penumbra. In this super-equipartition area, granulation still operates. Conclusions. Based on a comparison with simulation data from our previous work, and in agreement with findings of other authors, we conclude that the outer boundary of stable sunspots is defined by an invariant magnetic field: the equipartition field. From the discrepancy between intensity and magnetic contours during the decaying phase of the sunspot, we surmise that alongside the well-established (magneto-)convective regimes of the photosphere - granular, penumbral, and umbral - a super-equipartition granular regime can be identified. In this regime, bright, but smaller granules occur where the magnetic field exceeds equipartition but remains sub-critical for convection suppression.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights for Early Dark Energy with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</a><span class="id">[2512.11163]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), as one of the earliest processes in the universe accessible to direct observation, offers a powerful and independent probe of the cosmic expansion history. With recent advances in both theory and observation, including efficient and flexible BBN codes, percent-level measurements of primordial deuterium and helium-4 abundances, refined measurements of nuclear reaction rates, and precise determinations of the baryon density from the cosmic microwave background, particularly keen insights can be gained from BBN. In this work, we leverage these developments to place model-independent constraints on deviations from the Standard Model expansion history during BBN. Using the latest abundance data, we apply principal component analysis to identify the most constrained and physically meaningful modes of expansion history variation. This approach allows us to impose the most general constraints on early dark energy during the epoch of BBN. We further examine whether general modifications to the expansion rate could alleviate the long-standing lithium problem. Our results demonstrate that BBN, sharpened by modern data and statistical techniques, remains an indispensable probe of dark energy and new physics in the early universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mantle Differentiation, Mixing and Interior-Exterior Exchange</a><span class="id">[2512.11181]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We review the formation of large-scale heterogeneity in the solid Earth from the magma ocean phase to the present day, focusing on lower-mantle structure and evolution, as well as continental formation and its impact on interior-exterior volatile exchange. The solidification of the magma ocean sets the &quot;initial condition&quot; for solid-state mantle structure and evolution, partitioning volatiles between the surface and interior, and differentiating major and trace elements between mantle reservoirs. A possibly long-lived basal magma ocean is a potential reservoir for iron and incompatible trace elements with important implications for the present-day structure of the lowermost mantle and the distribution of heat-producing elements. With emergent plate tectonics and mantle convection, the production of oceanic crust is the dominant differentiation mechanism, and may contribute to lower-mantle heterogeneity. In turn, convection acts to re-mix heterogeneity. Thus, the structure of the lower mantle records the early differentiation of our planet, as well as long-term evolution. The formation of continental crust and lithosphere has also an important influence on deep-mantle structure and composition, because the distribution of continents can control the scale of plate tectonics, and thus affect mantle convection patterns. While the formation of continental crust and lithosphere, scenarios can be tested by self-consistent long-term evolution models. The exchange of water between the surface and mantle also plays an important role in the dynamics of Earth\' s deep interior. By using relative sea-level change as a proxy for the interior-exterior exchange of water, it is possible to constrain the deep-mantle water cycle. Based on a comprehensive review of these topics, we conclude with several open questions that should be addressed by future studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free Energy Sources of Ion-scale Waves Observed by Parker Solar Probe</a><span class="id">[2512.11182]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observes abundant circularly polarized ion-scale waves throughout the inner heliosphere. These waves are a signature of the interplay between plasma microinstabilities and turbulent dissipation. We perform a mission-wide statistical survey of ion-scale waves observed by PSP, investigating if the waves correspond to specific free energy sources in the measured proton velocity distributions. We find that left-handed waves (LHWs) are frequently observed, with the fraction of time they are observed increasing closer to the Sun, reaching $\sim$30\%. Right-handed waves (RHWs) are less frequently observed, with the associated time fraction decreasing closer to the Sun. The observed LHWs are generally consistent with parallel propagating ion cyclotron wave (ICW) storms that occur continuously for extended periods of time. Turbulent energy spectra are consistently steeper when LHW storms are observed; these wave storms mediate the spatial transport of the free energy associated with temperature anisotropy. The observed RHWs are generally consistent with oblique and parallel fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs), and their observation is well correlated with enhanced proton parallel heat flux, which quantifies the presence of secondary proton populations. Using observations and the SAVIC machine learning instability identification algorithm, we identify a threshold on the proton heat flux beyond which FMWs are likely to be driven unstable by the proton beams. We are thus able to associate trends in the observed ion-scale waves with known sources of free energy for Encounters 3 through 24 of the PSP's prime science phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11204" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Border: Searching for Cometary Activity Near the Centaur-JFC Transition Line</a><span class="id">[2512.11204]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current wide-field surveys discover  15 Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) each year, typically identified via visual detection of a dust coma or tail. The same surveys also discover many asteroids that have distant JFC-like orbits, but with no reported activity. We observed asteroids on Jupiter-crossing orbits beyond the depth of typical survey imaging using the 2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope. We used deep imaging to observe 16 asteroids in this region, plus 7 known comets for comparison. Three asteroids (2011 WM183, (669525) 2012 XO144, and 2020 RX133) showed surface brightness profiles consistent with low-level activity, equating to  19% of our total sample. We note that 2020 RX133 is a Jupiter Trojan. When we considered the heliocentric distance range of the asteroids at the time they showed activity, this fraction increased to 33% of the targets in the 3.16 \leq Rh \leq 4.56 au region, and therefore it is possible to infer that at least  30 asteroids with Tj \leq 3.05 and in the 4.05 &lt; a &lt; 5.05 au parameter space may potentially exhibit low-level activity. We also estimated nuclear radii for the three active targets of r_n = 1.8 \pm 0.2 km, r_n \leq 0.8 km, and r_n \leq 0.5 km for (669525) 2012 XO144, 2011 WM183, and 2020 RX133 respectively.

This study is motivated by the solar near-surface shear layer, whose flows are thought to transition from a buoyancy-dominated regime near the photosphere to a rotation-dominated regime at depth. Here, we conduct a suite of spherical 3-D, nonlinear simulations of rotating convection that operate in either the buoyancy-dominated (high-Rossby-number, high-Ro) or rotation-dominated (low-Rossby-number, low-Ro) regime. At the base of each model convection zone, we impose a heat flux whose latitudinal variation is opposite to the variation that the system would ordinarily develop. In both the low- and high-Ro regimes, a strong thermal wind balance is sustained in the absence of forcing. With a larger flux variation, this balance becomes stronger at high latitudes and weaker at low latitudes. The resulting differential rotation weakens in response and, at sufficiently high forcing, its latitudinal variation reverses for both low- and high-Ro systems. At fixed forcing, there exists a Rossby number above which the convective flows efficiently mix heat laterally, and the imposed flux variation does not imprint to the surface. At sufficiently high-Ro, thermal wind balance is no longer satisfied. We discuss these results within the context of the Sun's near-surface region, which possesses a weakened differential rotation when compared to the deep convection, along with little-to-no variation of photospheric emissivity in latitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11266" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probable Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in the {\tt TESS} observations of blazars in the Swift X-ray Survey</a><span class="id">[2512.11266]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work presents possible quasi-periodic oscillations in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite observations of blazars that are in the 157-month hard X-ray survey done by Swift's Burst Alert Telescope. We report observations from four sources, J1104.4+3812, J1654.0+3946, J0353.4-6830, and J1941.3-6216, that show at least 3$\sigma$ local significance in generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram and weighted wavelet Z-transform methods. These results are also checked using a continuous autoregressive moving average analysis that also predicts the absent data tentatively using stochastic differential equations. Each of these four sources exhibits a nominal QPO signal frequency in the range of 0.5–1.1 d$^{-1}$, resulting in at least 5 putative cycles. However, when the number of frequencies examined and the number of sources examined are both taken into account, the global significances are reduced to $\approx2.2\sigma$ for J1654.0+3964 (Mrk 501), and to $\approx1.9\sigma$ for other sources. These QPOs are thought to arise from the processes within the relativistic jet. Plausible explanations include the kink instability, which arises due to current-driven instabilities in the plasma or the precession of substructures, or mini-jets, within the jets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The energy structure function of fast radio bursts supports a stochastic origin model</a><span class="id">[2512.11283]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has remained a mystery up to now. There are two kinds of process invoking neutron stars as an origin of FRBs, namely inner-driven starquakes and outer-driven collisions with interstellar objects (ISOs). The former origin should exhibit an earthquake-like statistical behavior while the latter should show a stochastic process. In this paper, we introduce a new statistical method by making use of the energy structure function of active repeating FRBs and earthquakes. We find that the energy structure function of FRBs exhibits a very different statistical behavior compared to that of earthquakes. On small time-interval scales, the energy of an earthquake show a tendency to decay with time-interval and the energy difference of a pair of events increases with time-interval. Such a behavior is not found in FRBs, whose energy function is very similar to those of a stochastic process. Our result shows that repeating FRBs may have an origin process differing from that of earthquakes, i.e., FRBs arise from a series of unrelated events such as collisions of a neutron star with ISOs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Implication of Cross-correlation between Galaxy Clustering and 21-cm Line Intensity Mapping</a><span class="id">[2512.11353]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The apparent anisotropies of galaxy clustering and 21-cm mapping in redshift space offer a unique opportunity to simultaneously probe cosmic expansion and gravity on cosmological scales through the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and redshift-space distortions (RSD). Although improved theoretical models exist for anisotropic clustering, their applicability is limited by the non-perturbative smearing effect caused by the randomness of relative velocities. Here, we consider an alternative approach using the statistical power of cross-correlation between galaxy clustering and 21-cm line intensity mapping. Based on Fisher matrix analysis, fully incorporating nonlinear RSD, we estimate the benefit of combining both observables. We find that, for spectroscopy surveys like DESI combined with 21-cm line-intensity mapping surveys, the constraint on the growth of structure is improved by a factor of two relative to the galaxy auto-correlation, while the constraint on the cosmic expansion is only slightly improved. Crucially, such an observation can strongly constrain the neutral hydrogen (HI) content Omega_HI to a sub-percent level. This level of precision unlocks the potential of this method to probe post-reionization astrophysics with enhanced precision. It would far surpass existing constraints from stacked 21-cm emission (resulting in   50%-100% uncertainties) and break the degeneracy between Omega_HI and the HI bias b_HI inherent in linear-regime power spectrum analysis. This cross-correlation approach effectively compensates for the loss of constraining power when using galaxy clustering alone.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Varying core-envelope coupling efficiency identified from stellar rotation–activity relation</a><span class="id">[2512.11376]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Core-envelope coupling provides a reasonable explanation of the spin-down stalling of stars in open clusters, which was not predicted by classical gyrochronology. However, it remains an open question whether the coupling efficiency is constant or variable. M dwarfs, possessing thicker convective envelopes and thus longer coupling timescales than other late-type stars, are ideal objects for this investigation. In this letter, we present a new analysis using LAMOST and DESI spectra to construct the rotation–activity ($R_{\rm{HK}}^{'}$–Ro) relation for M dwarfs. The new relation consists of three distinct regimes of fast, intermediate, and slow rotation, closely matching the three sequences of gyrochronology, namely the “Convective” sequence, “Gap”, and “Interface” sequence. Our study reveals, for the first time, a variable activity decay rate in the intermediate-rotation regime (i.e., the “Gap” region). This implies a varying core-envelope coupling efficiency, peaking towards the end of this region. It also coincides with the well-known stage of stalled stellar spin-down.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intergalactic magnetic field lower limits up to the redshift $z\approx3$</a><span class="id">[2512.11397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large-scale intergalactic magnetic fields may contain a mixture of galactic and cosmogenic contributions, that can be probed via observations of $\gamma$-ray &quot;echo&quot; from sources at cosmological distances.

Combing the Fermi/LAT measurements in the 0.1 GeV - 1 TeV energy range with the Monte Carlo simulations of the $\gamma$-ray &quot;echo&quot;, it is shown that the zero field strength hypothesis at $z = [0.5; 3]$ is disfavoured at the $\approx 9\sigma$ significance level, yielding the lower limit of $B \gtrsim 1\times10^{-18}$ cG for the magnetic field correlation length above 1 Mpc. It is further shown that the same data put a lower limit on the volume-filling fraction of this field of $f\gtrsim 90\%$ in the redshift range considered. It is also demonstrated that the derived limits are not substantially affected by either source flux variability or the assumed $\gamma$-ray emission attenuation model. Implications of these limits for intergalactic magnetic field origin are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measurement of the cosmic ray nickel energy spectrum from 10 GeV/n to 2 TeV/n with the DAMPE</a><span class="id">[2512.11425]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nickel, one of the most stable elements alongside iron, is the most abundant heavy element beyond iron in cosmic rays.

The main stripping mechanism for the hydrogen (H) envelope in the progenitors of SESNe is often considered to be interaction with a binary companion, while that for the helium (He) layer is unclear. We conducted photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ib SN 2021efd, which shows signs of interaction with H-free circumstellar material (CSM). Around 30 days after the r-band light curve (LC) peak, until at least   770 days, its LCs display excessive luminosity compared to regular SESNe and at least three distinct peaks. The light curve evolution is similar to that of SN 2019tsf, whose previously unpublished spectrum at 400 days is also presented here. The nebular spectrum of SN 2021efd shows narrow emission lines (  1000 km/s) in various species. Our observations suggest that SN 2021efd is a Type Ib SN interacting with CSM with the following parameters: The estimated CSM mass, composition, and distribution are at least a few times 0.1 M_sun, H-free, and clumpy, respectively. Based on the estimated ejecta properties, we conclude that this event is a transitional SN whose progenitor was experiencing He-layer stripping at the epoch of the explosion, and was on the way to becoming a carbon-oxygen star from a He star. The estimated CSM properties suggest that the progenitor had some episodic mass ejections with a rate of   0.001-0.01 M_sun/yr for the last decade and slightly smaller before this final phase at least from   200 years before the explosion, for the assumed CSM velocity of 100 km/s. For the case of   1000 km/s, the necessary mass-loss rate would be increased by a factor of ten, and the timescales decreased by a factor of ten.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Polarized X-ray Universe: Insights and Discoveries</a><span class="id">[2512.11488]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polarization is one of the fundamental natures of electromagnetic radiation. The detection of polarization or polarized photons from distant X-ray radiating systems (such as X-ray binaries (XBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), pulsars, and stars) complements the timing, spectral, and imagining analysis to better understand the physical mechanisms taking place in these sources. Polarization has enhanced the understanding of the internal geometry of these systems and their vicinity. Polarized X-rays can be generated either directly through non-thermal physical processes in the presence of a magnetic field(B) or through the scattering of unpolarized thermal radiation within plasma structures such as an accretion disk. X-ray polarization can measure the two important independent parameters, the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) of the X-ray photons. These parameters are crucial as they reveal the characteristics of particles in such a strong magnetic and gravitational field. In this chapter, we have discussed (i) the basic idea of polarization, (ii) some distant sources radiating polarized X-ray photons, (iii) missions dedicated to observing polarized X-ray photons, and (iv) recent breakthroughs and upcoming missions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal in the context of existing early and late time constraints on $Λ$CDM</a><span class="id">[2512.11568]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dark ages 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the currently unobserved infant universe between the formation of the Cosmic Microwave Background around $z \approx 1100$ and the first galaxies around $z\approx 30$. A detection of the signal will help researchers understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the expansion of the universe and any extensions to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model that could explain the reported Cosmic Dawn 21-cm signal from EDGES and the Hubble tension. In this letter we take existing constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model from two early time probes, Planck and WMAP, and two late time probes, DES galaxy lensing and clustering and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and propagate these through to constraints on the magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal. We constrain the magnitude and central frequency of the signal while methodically accounting for uncertainties in the cosmological parameters. We find that within the context of our modelling assumptions and the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, the depth of the dark ages 21-cm signal is known to better than 1 mK and the central frequency to within 0.05 MHz.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST and HST observations of the host galaxy and supernova, SN 2024aihh in EP240801a at z=1.67</a><span class="id">[2512.11572]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the counterpart of EP240801a, at z=1.67, the first fast X-ray transient (FXT) identified as an X-ray flash (XRF) by the Einstein Probe (EP) and Fermi-GBM. Our observations reveal strong photometric and spectroscopic evidence for an associated broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) SN 2024aihh, the most distant spectroscopically identified gamma ray-burst (GRB)-SN to date. The SN exhibits similar luminosity and light curve evolution to the proto-type GRB-SN 1998bw with an absolute magnitude of the SN at $\sim$23 days rest-frame of $M_{F140W} \approx$-19 mag. The SN is located in a host galaxy with complex morphology at a large ($\sim$6 kpc) offset in a region of relatively low surface brightness. The region around the SN has a modest star formation rate and is dominated by an intermediate mass-weighted age (1.4$\pm$0.3 Gyr) population, despite the apparent presence of a young, massive broad-lined Type Ic SN progenitor. These observations demonstrate that observations with HST and JWST can greatly extend the redshift range over which the GRB/FXT-SN connection can be studied, including in relatively low luminosity, X-ray rich events. They demonstrate little apparent evolution in the SN properties from local examples despite EP240801a originating from an epoch 10 Gyr ago.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark sector interactions in the $w \rightarrow -1$ limit: velocity locking in pure momentum exchange models</a><span class="id">[2512.11639]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Models of interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) involving pure momentum exchange are a promising avenue for resolving cosmological tensions. However, the behaviour of these interactions in the theoretically challenging limit where the DE equation of state, $w$, approaches $-1$ is not fully understood. We demonstrate that a generic feature of these models is a $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism, which systematically shifts the onset of matter power spectrum suppression to smaller scales as $w \rightarrow -1$. The suppression magnitude depends on the difference in fluid velocities. In this limit, however, the interaction's drag dominates over the DE pressure support and causes the DE velocity to track that of the DM fluid at larger scales. This mechanism provides a physical explanation for the weaker constraints found in the literature when $w\approx-1$ in models where the interaction strength does not explicitly depend on $w$. We also demonstrate that the common approximation of neglecting DE perturbations ($\delta_{\mathrm{DE}}=\theta_{\mathrm{DE}}=0$) fails in this limit. By artificially increasing the velocity difference between the fluids, this simplification incorrectly removes the $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism and erases the shift in power spectrum suppression to smaller scales. This leads to an overestimation of the constraining power of cosmological data on the interaction strength.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One-loop power spectrum corrections in interacting dark energy cosmologies</a><span class="id">[2512.11678]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) models offer a promising avenue to explore possible exchanges of energy and momentum between dark matter and dark energy, providing a dynamical extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Such interactions modify the growth of cosmic structures, imprinting distinctive signatures on the matter power spectrum that can be tested through large-scale structure (LSS) observations. In this work, we compute the one-loop corrections to the matter power spectrum in IDE models. We then reinterpret these results within the standard framework of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS), which provides a consistent description of mildly non-linear scales and allows for reliable comparisons with observational data. We investigate two commonly studied forms of the coupling function, $Q$, namely $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm m}$ and $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm DE}$, and introduce a novel interaction term, $Q = \Gamma \, \rho_{\rm m} \, \rho_{\rm DE} \, \theta_{\rm m}$, characterized by the non-linear coupling constant $\Gamma$, which links the interaction strength to the velocity divergence of dark matter. This coupling function is proposed to isolate the effects solely of the IDE model on mildly non-linear scales. Using Full-Shape (FS) measurements of the galaxy power spectrum from BOSS DR12, we constrain the interaction rate $\Gamma$, the cosmological parameters, and the bias parameters. We find $\Gamma = 0.0039 \pm 0.0082$, which is highly consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model. This work opens the possibility of testing IDE models at mildly non-linear scales, potentially providing new insights for this class of models beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Impact of Initial Mass Dependent Convective Boundary Mixing on the Structure and Fates of Massive Stars</a><span class="id">[2512.11728]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While convection has been known to play a key role in stars for many decades, its implementation in one-dimensional stellar evolution codes still represents a major uncertainty today. The purpose of this work is to investigate the impact of initial mass dependent convective boundary mixing (CBM), often referred to as overshooting, on the frequency and type of nuclear burning shell interactions that occur in low metallicity massive stars and the subsequent effect on their fates. Two grids of models were calculated using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code and a 22-isotope nuclear network, each with a different strength of CBM applied. One grid uses the typical CBM value for diffusive overshooting used in literature whereas the other grid uses CBM values guided by the results of 3D convection simulations. Interactions between the carbon, neon and oxygen shells (C-Ne-O) are common throughout both grids. The higher CBM grid also exhibits more frequent H-He and He-C interactions at lower initial masses than in the lower CBM grid. Several models also undergo multiple interaction events during evolution. While future work will be needed to fully assess the impact of the new CBM and the interactions it leads to, one expects interesting effects like unusual nucleosynthesis including more common or enhanced i- and gamma-process nucleosynthesis. Furthermore, SN precursors and a significant change to the pre-SN structure are also expected, with many models not having the commonly expected onion-ring like structure and having a different explosion probability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solving the Cosmological Vlasov-Poisson Equations with Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</a><span class="id">[2512.11795]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cold dark matter (CDM) evolves as a collisionless fluid under the Vlasov-Poisson equations, but N-body simulations approximate this evolution by discretising the distribution function into particles, introducing discreteness effects at small scales.

Physical constraints derived from the Vlasov-Poisson equations are embedded directly into the loss function, enabling accurate evolution beyond the first shell crossing. The trained model achieves sub-percent errors on the residuals even after seven shell crossings and matches N-body results while providing a resolution-free representation of the displacement field. In addition, displacement errors do not grow over time, a very interesting feature with respect to N-body methods. It can also reconstruct initial conditions through backward evolution when sufficient final-state information is available. Although current runtimes exceed those of N-body methods, this framework offers a new route to high-fidelity CDM evolution without particle discretisation, with prospects for extension to higher dimensions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-relativistic journeys through compact astrophysical objects</a><span class="id">[2509.07427]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It has recently been proved that, for constant density stars, there is a critical value $\Lambda^{*}=1$ for the dimensionless density parameter $\Lambda\equiv 4\pi R^2\rho_{\text{max}}$ of the star above which the asymptotically measured travel time $T_{\text{s}}$ along a semi-circular trajectory that connects two antipodal points on the surface of the star is {\it shorter} than the travel time $T_{\text{c}}$ along the (shorter) straight-line trajectory that connects the two antipodal points through the center of the compact star [here $\{R,\rho_{\text{max}}\}$ are respectively the radius and the maximum density of the compact astrophysical object]. This intriguing observation provides a nice illustration of the general relativistic time dilation (redshift) effect in highly curved spacetimes.

These gradients, which we refer to as axion hair, couple to the local background magnetic field, inducing a large voltage drop near the surface of the star; here, we demonstrate that the presence of axion hair decouples local near-field particle acceleration in the open magnetic field line bundle from the rotational frequency of the pulsar itself. This is significant as the non-observation of old slowly-rotating pulsars is attributed to the fact the rotationally-induced electric fields are not strong enough to sustain $e^\pm$ pair production. In this work, we review the evidence for the existence for `pulsar death', i.e. the threshold at which $e^\pm$ pair production (and thus, by association, coherent radio emission) ceases, and demonstrate using both semi-analytics and particle-in-cell simulations that the existence of axion hair can dramatically extend pulsar lifetimes. We show that the non-observation of extremely old, slowly rotating, pulsars allows for a new probe of light QCD and CP-violating axions. We also demonstrate how the observation of emission from both poles of pulsars with nearly orthogonal rotational and magnetic axes, as seen e.g. in PSR J1906+0746, can be used to set competitive limits on CP-violating axion-nucleon interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A review on combinatorial approach to aggregation</a><span class="id">[2512.11459]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, a combinatorial approach to discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has been progressively developed. In this work, we review its achievements up to the present moment, focusing on the practical aspects and discussing its limitations. First, we present the assumptions and combinatorial foundations of the approach, which are based on direct counting of the system states, in contrast to the previous approaches of Smoluchowski and Marcus–Lushnikov. A method to obtain combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and the corresponding standard deviation is described by solving the simplest example of a constant kernel. Then, we extend consideration to a number of kernels (e.g., additive, product, linear–chain, condensation), which were recently solved by explicitly finding the number of internal states of the cluster of a given size. Next, we show that theoretical predictions for any given kernel may be obtained with no need to find an explicit solution but using a recursive expression. We exploit this opportunity to present the use of combinatorial expressions to solve kernels related to the real processes of aerosol growth and planetesimal formation. At this point, a comparison to numerical results appears. Other potential application fields are indicated, including dust agglomeration and polymer growth. Finally, issues related to the varying precision of the theoretical predictions are summarized. In the last section, we propose open problems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11583" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Foundations and Exact Solutions in $n$–Dimensional Fractional Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2512.11583]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Three theoretically plausible techniques to developing a fractional scalar field cosmological model are pointed in this paper; the time-dependent kernel weighted action being then selected.

While the standard prediction for strong shocks is that the spectrum of accelerated particles is universal, $f(p)\propto p^{-4}$, numerous phenomena affect this simple conclusion. In general, the non-linear dynamical reaction of accelerated particles leads to a concave spectrum, steeper than $p^{-4}$ at momenta below a few tens of GeV/c and harder than the standard prediction at high energies. However, the non-linear effects become important in the presence of magnetic field amplification, which in turn leads to higher values of the maximum momentum $p_{max}$. It was recently discovered that the self-generated perturbations that enhance particle scattering, when advected downstream, move in the same direction as the background plasma, so that the effective compression factor at the shock decreases and the spectrum becomes steeper. We investigate the implications of the excitation of the non-resonant streaming instability on these spectral deformations, the dependence of the spectral steepening on the shock velocity and the role played by the injection momentum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12890" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling reflection spectra of super-Eddington X-ray sources</a><span class="id">[2407.12890]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Relativistic reflection is a common feature in the X-ray observations of accreting compact objects.

We develop two relativistic reflection frameworks for super-Eddington accretion: a slim-disk model that self-consistently accounts for disk thickening and self-shadowing, and an optically thick wind model that treats reflection off a funnel-shaped outflow. The slim-disk model offers a geometry where the inner disk thickness is proportional to radius, becoming thicker as the mass accretion rate increases. The wind model measures the opening angle of the funnel, the wind speed, and wind acceleration radius. The slim-disk profile reduces the brightness of the blue horn in the Fe K emission line for a fixed emissivity and significantly changes the intensity profile for a lamppost geometry. The wind model shows a blue-shifted iron line due to high velocity outflows. Both models assume a spherically symmetric spacetime.

We present multi-energy and multi-angle solutions of the neutrino quantum kinetic equations in three flavors, without employing any attenuation term for the neutrino self-interaction strength and taking into account neutrino advection and non-forward collisions with the background medium. Flavor evolution is explored within a spherically symmetric shell surrounding the region of neutrino decoupling in the interior of a core-collapse supernova, relying on the output of a spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model with a progenitor mass of $18.6 M_\odot$. We select two representative post-bounce times: $t_{\rm pb} = 0.25$ s (no angular crossings are present and flavor conversion is triggered by slow collective effects) and $t_{\rm pb} = 1$ s (angular crossings trigger fast flavor instabilities). We find that flavor equipartition is achieved for the late post-bounce time ($t_{\rm pb} = 1$ s), where the (anti)neutrino emission properties among different flavors tend to approach each other. In this case, $\bar\nu_e$ tends to $\bar\nu_x = (\bar\nu_\mu + \bar\nu_\tau)/2$ and a similar trend holds for neutrinos. However, flavor equipartition does not occur for our early post-bounce time ($t_{\rm pb} = 0.25$ s). Accounting for weak-magnetism corrections, crossings in the $\mu$ and $\tau$ lepton number angular distributions arise; however, such crossings have a magnitude smaller than the one occurring in the electron sector and negligibly affect flavor evolution. Because of flavor conversion, the neutrino heating rate increases up to $30\%$ with respect to the case where flavor conversion is neglected.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimal intrinsic alignment estimators in the presence of redshift-space distortions</a><span class="id">[2504.16076]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present estimators for quantifying intrinsic alignments in large spectroscopic surveys that efficiently capture line-of-sight (LOS) information while being relatively insensitive to redshift-space distortions (RSD).

This is further improved by replacing the flat Pimax cut with a LOS weighting based on shape projection and RSD.

Assuming instead that the UHECR deflections predominantly arise from the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), we obtain a GMF upper limit of $1.4 \, \mu$G kpc$^{1/2}$ for a Galactic halo size of 30 kpc.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sensitivity of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Dark Ages to parameters of primordial magnetic fields</a><span class="id">[2506.19436]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyse the impact of the decaying magnetic turbulence of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) and ambipolar diffusion on the ionisation and thermal history of the Dark Ages Universe ($30\le z\le300$), and its imprint on the spectral profile of the global signal in the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line. The heating function caused by decaying magnetic turbulence monotonically decreases after cosmological recombination; its amplitude strongly depends on the strength of the PMFs' $B_0$ and weakly depends on the spectral index of the initial power spectrum of the PMFs' $n_{\rm B}$. The heating function caused by ambipolar diffusion, in contrast, noticeably depends on the spectral index in the range $-3\lesssim n_{\rm B}\lesssim4$ but is subdominant in the Dark Ages epoch for PMF models with $B_0\lesssim0.5$ nG. We computed the ionisation and thermal history of intergalactic gas from the cosmological recombination up to the end of the Dark Ages epoch for a range of PMF parameters, $0.05\lesssim B_0\lesssim0.5$ nG, $-2.9\lesssim n_{\rm B}\lesssim4$, and show the essentially distinguished thermal evolution from one in the Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. We also show that the profile of the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line is very sensitive to the PMF parameters from this range and can be used for their constraints in conjunction with other observational data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fuzzy dark matter halos with repulsive self-interactions: coherent soliton and halo vortex network with moderate self-coupling</a><span class="id">[2507.00293]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine the impact of moderate repulsive self-interactions on fuzzy dark matter halos generated by merging smaller Gaussian density concentrations. We study the size of the core and the granules, the spatial dependence of the field's coherence, the turbulent vortex tangle and the oscillation frequency of the central soliton, covering the range from quantum-pressure-dominated to self-interaction-dominated stabilisation of the solitonic core. For the probed self-coupling strengths $g$ and with a fixed initial configuration, mergers with increasing $g$ result in cores with increased size and a reduced central density, oscillating with decreased frequency, in accordance with expectations from the study of isolated Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (SFDM) solitons. By contrast, the characteristic granule size and typical inter-vortex distances in the surrounding halo are only mildly affected, growing much less relative to the core. The total length of the vortex network, although less robust, shows no signs of decay over our simulation timescales. The generated halos therefore develop central self-interaction-dominated cores, but with the outer halos still supported by quantum-pressure and classical kinetic energy in equipartition as in the non-interacting case. Furthermore, measures of coherence of the field clearly separate the condensed core, identified via the Penrose-Onsager (largest eigenvalue) mode of the entire classical field, from the surrounding quasi-coherent halo. Unlike the $g=0$ case, we observe a relative increase of incoherent fluctuations coexisting with the coherent mode at the centre of the halo with increasing $g$, a phenomenon also observed in laboratory condensates at non-zero temperature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13248" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of low-luminosity X-ray pulsations from the accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17511-3057: An ever-thinning thread between bright accretion and sub-luminous states</a><span class="id">[2507.13248]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>After nearly a decade in quiescence, the accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17511$-$3057 displayed a new outburst on 2025 February 11, its third since discovery, following previous activity in 2009 and 2015. We report on an XMM-Newton Target of Opportunity observation performed on 2025 March 4, more than twenty days after the outburst onset. From the X-ray spectrum - well described by an absorbed Comptonization model - we estimated an unabsorbed 0.5$-$10 keV luminosity of $L_X \sim 7 \times 10^{33} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ (assuming a source distance equal to the upper limit of $6.9$ kpc). To place this in context, we analyzed an archival Chandra observation performed in 2019, which yielded a quiescent luminosity of $L_\mathrm{X,q} \sim 2 \times 10^{32} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ in the same energy band. Although this comparison indicates that the source was still well above its quiescent level during the XMM-Newton observation, the estimated low luminosity during the late stage of the 2025 outburst would typically place the source in the propeller regime. Nevertheless, we unexpectedly detected coherent X-ray pulsations with an amplitude peaking at $\sim$42% in the 0.3$-$3 keV band. We also observed a spectral softening compared to the early stages of the outburst. Finally, we report a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 60 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ on the source flux density at 5.5 GHz from ATCA observations acquired on 2025 April 12, following a decline of the accretion activity, as indicated by our analysis of NICER data from 2025 March 15, which revealed no significant X-ray pulsations at a luminosity level of $L_X \sim 1 \times 10^{34} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$. We discuss our findings in the context of other accreting millisecond pulsars and draw comparisons with transitional systems in the sub-luminous disk state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slantwise convection and heat transport in icy moon oceans</a><span class="id">[2508.06480]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ocean heat transport on icy moons shapes the ice shell topography, a primary observable of these moons. Two key processes control the heat transport: baroclinic instability driven by surface buoyancy contrasts and convective instability driven by heating from the core. However, global ocean simulations cannot accurately resolve convection under realistic icy moon conditions and instead often use Earth-based convective parameterizations, which capture only vertical convective mixing and cannot represent rotation-aligned slantwise convection on icy moons. We use high-resolution convection-resolving simulations to investigate ocean heat transport by slantwise convection in a parameter regime relevant to icy moons, isolated from baroclinic instability. Total heat transport follows the Coriolis-Inertial-Archimedean scaling with an added latitude dependence. The vertical transport increases with latitude, and the meridional transport is poleward. These results indicate that slantwise convection redistributes heat toward the poles, favoring a poleward-thinning ice shell, qualitatively consistent with Enceladus's observed ice thickness distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-linear spiral waves in accretion discs</a><span class="id">[2510.24839]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive a simple, accurate, non-linear, global equation governing spiral density waves in thin, non-self-gravitating, inviscid accretion discs. These discs may have any slowly varying surface density or temperature profile. For specific 'self-similar' disc profiles, solutions to our equation match (novel) smooth non-linear exact spiral solutions derived via a separate method, which highlight that non-linear spiral waves need not shock. Indeed, at low amplitudes, we find that dispersion can overcome wave steepening, and may prevent the inner spiral wakes excited by low mass planets (below roughly 1% of a thermal mass) embedded in protoplanetary discs from shocking. At high amplitudes, we find a simple universal description of non-linear spiral waves with shocks, as well as caps on the possible amplitude and wave action flux of non-linear spirals both with and without shocks, depending on how many arms they have. We further find that highly non-linear spirals are far more loosely wound than their linear counterparts. These developments shed light on why two-armed spirals are prevalent across a range of astrophysical systems which don't necessarily possess an intrinsic twofold symmetry, and why they appear surprisingly loosely wound in observations. These results are supported by very high-resolution numerical simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Mass-Independent Damping Timescale in Black Hole Accretion Systems</a><span class="id">[2511.05268]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The scaling laws reveal the underlying structural similarities shared by astrophysical systems across vastly different scales. In black hole accretion systems, the scaling relations between the characteristic damping timescales (CDTs) of light curves and black hole mass offer valuable insights into the underlying physical structure of accretion disks. Here, we investigate the long-term hard X-ray CDTs of 106 black hole and neutron star accretion systems using light curves from the \textit{Swift} Burst Alert Telescope 157-month catalog. Unexpectedly, for the first time, we discover a mass-independent CDT in these black hole accretion systems, in contrast to well-established scaling laws. This puzzling phenomenon can be attributed to conductive timescales arising from disk–corona interactions, instead of the intrinsic accretion disk processes characterized by scaling laws, and it may further modulate jet emission in blazars. This result demonstrates thermal conduction as a key mechanism driving hard X-ray variability and offers new observational evidence for the disk–corona–jet connection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forecasting the Constraint on the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ Modified Gravity in the CSST $3\times2$pt Photometric Survey</a><span class="id">[2511.16097]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We forecast the constraint on the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model from the photometric survey operated by the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). The simulated $3\times2$pt data of galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements within 100 deg$^{2}$ are used in the analysis. The mock observational maps are constructed from a light cone, redshift sampling and noise. The angular power spectra are measured with pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimators and compared to theory in the same basis using validated weighting functions and an analytic covariance matrix that includes Gaussian, connected non-Gaussian, and super-sample terms. We model the theoretical spectra using two methods. The first one uses MGCAMB to compute the linear modified-gravity clustering power spectra, and the second one adopts the FREmu emulator with a baseline of nonlinear $\Lambda$CDM prescription. Parameter inference is performed with Cobaya, and the cosmological and modified-gravity parameters are sampled within the emulator training domain, which is jointly fitted with the systematic parameters. We find that the predictions from the two methods are in good agreement at the overlapping large scales, and the emulator method can correctly provide additional high-$\ell$ information. The $1\sigma$ upper bounds of $\log_{10}|f_{R0}|$ are found to be $&lt;-5.42$ for cosmic shear only case and $&lt;-5.29$ for the 100 deg$^2$ CSST $3\times2$pt probe. The full CSST photometric survey with 17,500 deg$^2$ survey area is expected to further improve the constraint precision by about one order of magnitude. Our results demonstrate that the CSST $3\times2$pt survey can deliver strict tests on $f(R)$ gravity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A sudden fine-scale bright kernel captured by Hi-C Flare in 11 MK emission during an M1.6-class solar flare's post-maximum phase</a><span class="id">[2512.01140]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>On April 17, 2024, the third successful Hi-C sounding rocket flight, Hi-C Flare, recorded coronal images in Fe XXI 129 A emission from 11 MK plasma during the post-maximum phase of an M1.6-class solar flare, achieving unprecedented spatial ( 300 km) and temporal (1.3 s) resolutions. The flare started at 21:55 UT, peaked at 22:08 UT, and lasted  40 minutes. Hi-C observed for over five minutes (22:15:45 to 22:21:25), starting roughly eight minutes after flare maximum. A sudden compact bright burst - 875 +/- 25 km wide, lasting 90 +/- 1.3 s, exhibiting a proper motion of  50 km/s, and splitting into two toward the end - occurs near the foot of some post-flare loops. Its size and brightness are reminiscent of flare-ribbon kernels during a flare's rapid rise phase, kernels marking sites of sudden heating and hot plasma upflow, making its occurrence during the late phase surprising. Such isolated brightenings in a flare's post-maximum phase are rare, and have not been previously reported. The kernel was detected in all SDO/AIA channels. Its 1600 A light curve peaked  50 s earlier than its 131 A light curve, similar to that of flare-ribbon kernels, albeit with a smaller delay of  25 s, during the impulsive phase of the flare. In SDO/HMI magnetograms, the kernel sits in unipolar positive magnetic flux near an embedded clump of negative flux. Although localized magnetic reconnection within the kernel (a microflare) cannot be ruled out for its cause, the observations favor the localized brightening being an isolated, exceptionally late flare-ribbon kernel, resulting from an exceptionally late burst of the flare's coronal reconnection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterization of debris disks observed with SPHERE</a><span class="id">[2512.03128]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study aims to characterize debris disks observed with SPHERE across multiple programs, with the goal of identifying systematic trends in disk morphology, dust mass, and grain properties as a function of stellar parameters. We analyzed a sample of 161 young stars using SPHERE observations at optical and near-IR wavelengths. Disk geometries were derived from ellipse fitting and model grids, while dust mass and properties were constrained by modified blackbody (MBB) and size distribution (SD) modeling of SEDs. The dynamical modeling was performed to assess whether the observed disk structures can be explained by the presence of unseen planets. We resolved 51 debris disks, including four new detections: HD 36968, BD-20 951, and the inner belts of HR 8799 and HD 36546. In addition, we found a second transiting giant planet in the HD 114082 system, with a radius of 1.29 $R_{\rm Jup}$ and an orbital distance of  1 au. We identified nine multi-belt systems, with outer-to-inner belt radius ratios of $1.5-2$, and found close agreement between scattered-light and millimeter-continuum belt radii. They scale weakly with stellar luminosity ($R_{\rm belt} \propto L_{\star}^{0.11}$), but show steeper dependencies when separated by CO and CO$_2$ freeze-out regimes. Disk fractional luminosities follow collisional decay trends, declining as $t_{\rm age}^{-1.18}$ for A and $t_{\rm age}^{-0.81}$ for F stars. The inferred dust masses span $10^{-5}-1\,M_\oplus$ from MBB and $0.01-1\,M_\oplus$ from SD modeling. These masses scale as $R_{\rm belt}^n$ with $n&gt;2$ in belt radius and super-linearly with stellar mass, consistent with trends seen in protoplanetary disks. Analysing correlation between disk polarized flux and IR excess, we found an offset of  1 dex between total-intensity (HST) and polarized fluxes. A new parametric approach to estimate dust albedo and maximum polarization fraction is introduced.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09303" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Cluster Detection and Dynamical Analysis in the VIPERS High-Redshift Spectroscopic Survey</a><span class="id">[2512.09303]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a dynamical analysis of galaxy clusters identified in the VIPERS spectroscopic survey within the redshift range 0.5 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.2. Cluster candidates were first detected as overdense regions in redshift space through the Finger-of-God (FoG) effect, and cluster membership was assigned using the GalWeight technique within the FoG-GalWeight methodology developed by our team. For each cluster, we derived the virial radius (R200), velocity dispersion (sigma200), and virial mass (M200) using the virial mass estimator. We identified ten VIPERS clusters spanning a mass range of 0.59 x 10^14 &lt;= M200/(h^-1 Msun) &lt;= 4.32 x 10^14 and velocity dispersions of 360 &lt;= sigma200 &lt;= 900 km s^-1. We cross-matched the VIPERS clusters with published catalogs and found at least one matching system for each cluster, offering external validation for our detections. We investigated the velocity dispersion-mass relation for these systems and obtained log(sigma200) = (2.73 +/- 0.06) + (0.36 +/- 0.18) log(M200), with an intrinsic scatter of sigma_int = 0.04 +/- 0.07. The derived relation is consistent with theoretical predictions from N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, confirming the reliability of the FoG-GalWeight methodology and the robustness of the virial mass estimator. Our findings demonstrate that the velocity dispersion can serve as a reliable and direct proxy for cluster mass, even at high redshift, without requiring additional dynamical mass modeling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wind-mediated Eddington-limited emission in a $10^{4}M_\odot$ Black Hole Tidal Disruption Event</a><span class="id">[2512.10564]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have already produced tens of strong candidate flares, and their number will greatly increase with upcoming wide field surveys. Nevertheless, the origin of the measured luminosity peak at early times is still unknown, and the ultimate sources of energy dissipation in TDEs are not fully understood. Here we present the first three-dimensional end-to-end simulation of a TDE by a $10^{4}M_\odot$ intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) with realistic parameters, run with the radiation-hydrodynamics code RICH. We find that the stellar debris fails to circularize efficiently, while a low-density, radiation-driven wind forms near pericenter and expands quasi-spherically. Radiation is advected by this outflow and released at the photosphere, which expands to radii of $\approx10^{13}$ cm and reaches temperatures of  few $10^{4}$K at the peak of the light curve. The resulting luminosity briefly exceeds the Eddington limit before settling near that value. We systematically test the numerical convergence of our simulation by running it at three resolutions. While the nozzle shock at pericenter may be under-resolved, we find that global results are qualitatively converged and, largely, quantitatively robust. The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory's LSST (g and r band) and ULTRASAT (near UV) will be able to observe events like our simulated IMBH TDE up to redshifts of z$\approx$0.1 and z$\approx$0.06, respectively.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Role of the Schwinger Effect in Superradiant Axion Lasers</a><span class="id">[2503.01039]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Superradiance can cause the axion cloud around a rotating black hole to reach extremely high densities, and the decay of these axions can produce a powerful laser. The electric field of these lasers is strong enough that the Schwinger effect may become significant, resulting in the production of an electron-positron plasma. We explore the dynamics between axion lasers and this electron-positron plasma. While there are several mechanisms by which the inclusion of a plasma can impact the laser's behavior, the most significant of these mechanisms is that the electron-positron plasma imparts an effective mass on the photon. As the plasma frequency increases, axion decay becomes energetically unfavorable, up to the point where the axion no longer decays into photons, shutting off the laser. We find that the impact of the electron-positron plasma on the dynamics of the system depend heavily on the parameters, specifically the axion mass $m_\phi$ and the superradiant coupling $\alpha$, and that we may divide parameter space into three regimes: the unenhanced, enhanced, and unstable regimes. In the unenhanced and enhanced regime, the system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state, emitting a laser of constant luminosity while the number of axions remains constant. In the unenhanced regime, this equilibrium state can be calculated while neglecting the effects of Schwinger production; in the enhanced regime, the equilibrium luminosity is slightly larger than what it would be without Schwinger production. In the unstable regime, the electron-positron plasma suppresses axion decay to the point where the system is never able to reach equilibrium; instead, the axions continue to grow superradiantly. In all three cases, the production of superradiant axions will eventually cause the black hole to spin down to the point where superradiance ceases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$F$-term Multi-Field Inflation in Supergravity without Stabiliser Superfields</a><span class="id">[2508.20194]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Realising $F$-term slow-roll inflation in supergravity is non-trivial due to the well-known $\eta$-problem. The common strategy to solve the problem is to impose a shift symmetry on the Kähler potential, but this often leads to a negative potential in the large-field regime. To avoid negative potentials, an additional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired interaction. An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a stabiliser superfield, was earlier proposed by two of us in the setup with a single chiral superfield having inflaton and goldstino amongst its field components. In this work, we extend that alternative mechanism to multi-superfield models of inflation, thereby providing a generic framework for embedding a wide class of single- and multi-field inflation models into supergravity. We illustrate our approach by several concrete examples of multi-field inflation and clarify the conditions required to avoid tachyonic instabilities during multi-field evolution. Our proposal significantly broadens the theoretical landscape of $F$-term inflation models in supergravity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lensing Stability and Scattering Phenomena in Anisotropic Black Hole Spacetimes in Plasma</a><span class="id">[2508.21519]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the physical and observational features of static, spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes surrounded by anisotropic fluid and embedded in a plasma environment.

We begin by analyzing the background spacetime and matter content, examining the horizon structure and verifying the energy conditions associated with the anisotropic fluid. We then study photon trajectories in both vacuum and plasma environments, deriving the equations of motion and computing deflection angles and image magnifications under weak gravitational lensing. Both uniform and power-law plasma profiles are considered to model realistic astrophysical settings. In the wave optics regime, we first analyze the linear stability of the spacetime under axial (odd-parity) perturbations using Chandrasekhar's method, and then investigate scalar field scattering by solving the wave equation in the curved background with plasma. Using Born and WKB approximations, we compute the differential scattering cross-sections and examine how anisotropy and plasma affect interference features. Finally, we perform parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain the black hole mass and anisotropic fluid parameters, utilizing EHT and GRAVITY data for Sgr A* and EHT-only data for M87*. These results present a unified theoretical framework that links anisotropic matter effects with lensing and scattering observables providing a firm basis for future comparisons with high-resolution astrophysical data sets in diverse contexts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17790" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The $μ$-deformed Einstein field equations with $μ$-dependent effective cosmological constant</a><span class="id">[2511.17790]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we derive the $\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations from the generalized thermodynamic functions of the $\mu$-deformed analog of Bose gas model, applying the (adapted) Verlinde's approach.
