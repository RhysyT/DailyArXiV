However, their potential interaction with dark matter (DM), especially in galactic halos where DM is expected to be prevalent, may lead to significant consequences. This work proposes a novel EoS (EoS) that consistently incorporates both hot dense plasma and cold dark matter (CDM) contributions in hot WDs. The hot dense plasma EoS is extended to include thermal and radiative contributions. At the same time, the CDM component is modeled as a linear fluid, with the coupling constant $\alpha$ determined self-consistently within the star. A smooth phase transition between hot dense plasma and CDM regimes is introduced via a hyperbolic mixing function that depends on local energy density and stellar temperature. Our results show that the inclusion of CDM leads to an increase in the WD radius by approximately $12\%$ and a total mass enhancement of $0.7\%$, compared to standard hot WD models without lattice effects. These results highlight the importance of considering CDM in stellar modeling and suggest that WDs may serve as indirect probes for the astrophysical properties of dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effects of density stratification on Rossby waves in deep atmospheres</a><span class="id">[2511.03832]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Though Rossby waves have been observed on the Sun, their radial eigenfunctions remain a mystery. The prior theoretical work either considers quasi-2D systems, which do not apply to the solar interior, or only considers fully radiative or fully convective atmospheres. This project calculates the radial eigenfunctions for Rossby waves in a deep atmosphere for a general stratification. Here, we use the $\beta$-plane approximation to derive a vertical equation in terms of the Lagrangian pressure fluctuation $\delta P$, and we then calculate radial eigenfunctions for Rossby waves in a standard solar model, Model S. We find that working in the Lagrangian pressure fluctuation results in cleaner wave equations that lack internal singularities that have been encountered in prior work. The resulting radial wave equation makes it abundantly clear that there are two wave cavities in the solar interior, one in the radiative interior and another in the convection zone. Surprisingly, our calculated radial vorticity eigenfunctions for the radiative interior modes are nearly constant throughout the convection zone, raising the possibility that they may be observable at the solar surface.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03834" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photon Orbit Signatures in Spectra of Black Hole Accretion Disks</a><span class="id">[2511.03834]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Light orbiting an accreting black hole may impact the disk or jet multiple times before escaping to the observer, at a variety of angles with respect to the local magnetic field. In this letter, we characterize the imprints of these long path lengths and disparate magnetic field impacts in synchrotron spectra of hot accretion disks, as the strongly lensed “photon ring” exhibits a higher synchrotron turnover frequency in each lensed sub-image. We apply tools of varying complexity: first, we develop a minimal, unlensed one-zone model that isolates the first two sub-images of the accretion flow. By varying the magnetic field geometry encountered by each sub-image, we show that distinctive spectral signatures emerge in both total intensity and fractional linear polarization. Second, we examine a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model, in which we find that there is generally a frequency at which the first indirect image outshines the direct image even in total flux density. Lastly, we demonstrate that even general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation snapshots show this spectral character. We find a typical correction to the unresolved spectrum of order $10\%$ near the turnover frequency that grows with increasing viewing inclination, growing to order unity at higher frequencies. We predict sensitive spectral studies of the cores of Messier 87* and Sagittarius A* at frequencies exceeding $300$ GHz to constrain the existence of the photon ring even without imaging, with prospects for photon ring detection even in other sources with unresolved shadows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do Planets Affect the Behavior of the Long-term Solar Activity?</a><span class="id">[2511.03889]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar activity is a process driven by many independent but interconnected phenomena. Although the 11-year cycle is the result of operation of the dynamo mechanism, the cause of longer secular variations is not clear. In search of such a cause, it was proposed to take into account the influence of the planetary system. In order to verify the idea, we consider the action of all planets in the solar system reduced to the effect of a single barycenter. The tidal force is decomposed into radial and meridional components. The radial tidal force is too small compared to the powerful radial gravity of the Sun. The meridional force is not compensated for by solar gravity and depends on latitude. As the latitude of the barycenter changes quite slowly, the sign of this component changes over a characteristic time scale of about 5 years, during which the meridional acceleration constantly acts on the surface of the Sun. This could ultimately lead to speeds of several meters per second and, in principle, could significantly change the speeds of the meridional currents involved in generating the magnetic field. However, it turned out that the calculated speed variation does not agree with the observed periodicity of solar activity. Earlier, the relation was analyzed between the activity periods on solar-type stars and the rotation periods of exoplanets, and no correspondence was observed either. Thus, the planetary hypothesis as a cause of long-term modulation of solar activity is not confirmed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energy-dependent SEP Fe/O abundances during the May 2024 superstorm</a><span class="id">[2511.03905]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During mid-May 2024, active region (AR) 13664 produced a series of M- and X-class flares along with several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that resulted in exceptionally strong aurora at Earth. This study presents in-situ solar energetic particle (SEP) ion composition data from Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory Ahead (STA), Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) as their magnetic connectivity to AR 13664 varied throughout the event period. Between 08 to 24 May, STA was separated by 12° in longitude from ACE at 0.96 AU. SEP intensities rose gradually due to merged CMEs from AR 13664. On 13 May, an M6 flare was followed by a rapid-onset SEP event at STA, although velocity dispersion analysis yielded no clear path length or release time. PSP, 95° longitudinally separated from Earth at 0.74 AU, observed gradually increasing SEP intensities beginning 11 May, followed by a jump in both SEP intensity and magnetic field (&gt;100 nT) on 16 May. These early event intervals display stepwise SEP increases, consistent with the passage of successive CMEs. On 20 May, an X16.5 flare from AR 13664 produced an Fe-rich SEP event observed at all three spacecraft despite their wide longitudinal separations. Throughout the period, Fe/O ratios ranged from &lt;0.01 to &gt;0.8 and increased with energy between 1 to 100 MeV/nuc. This trend deviates from the typical energy-dependent decrease expected from diffusive shock acceleration and suggests more complex scenarios, possibly involving variable suprathermal seed populations or species-dependent transport.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing Hidden Cosmic Flows through the Zone of Avoidance with Deep Learning</a><span class="id">[2511.03919]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a refined deep-learning-based method to reconstruct the three-dimensional dark matter density, gravitational potential, and peculiar velocity fields in the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA), a region near the galactic plane with limited observational data. Using a convolutional neural network (V-Net) trained on A-SIM simulation data, our approach reconstructs density or potential fields from galaxy positions and radial peculiar velocities. The full 3D peculiar velocity field is then derived from the reconstructed potential. We validate the method with mocks that mimic the spatial distribution of the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalog and apply it to actual data. Given CF4's significant observational uncertainties and since our model does not yet account for them, we use peculiar velocities corrected via an existing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo reconstruction, rather than raw catalog distances. Our results demonstrate that the reconstructed density field recovers known galaxy clusters detected in an H \textsc{i} survey of the ZOA, despite this dataset not being used in the reconstruction. This agreement underscores the potential of our method to reveal structures in data-sparse regions. Most notably, streamline convergence and watershed analysis identify a mass concentration consistent with the Great Attractor, at $(l, b) = (308.4^\circ \pm 2.4^\circ, 29.0^\circ \pm 1.9^\circ)$ and $cz = 4960.1 \pm 404.4,{\rm km/s}$, for 64\% of realizations. Our method is particularly valuable as it does not rely on data point density, enabling accurate reconstruction in data-sparse regions and offering strong potential for future surveys with more extensive galaxy datasets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral Diversity in Type Ibn Supernovae and the Large Host Offset of SN2024acyl</a><span class="id">[2511.03926]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we first present observations of SN 2024acyl, a normal Type Ibn supernova with a large projected offset ($\sim$35 kpc) from its host galaxy. The low star-formation rate measured at the explosion site raises the possibility that the progenitor of SN 2024acyl may not have been a massive star. We then examine, more broadly, the spectral diversity of Type Ibn supernovae around 20–35 days after peak brightness and identify two distinct groups: Group I, which shows bluer rest-frame optical color and narrower He I emission lines; and Group II, which shows redder rest-frame optical color and broader He I lines. Group I also tends to show higher peak luminosities. The diversity we identify appears to be closely connected to the diversity observed around peak and to persist into late phases ($&gt;80$ days after peak). Given its redder color and broader He I lines, we classify SN 2024acyl as belonging to Group II. Based on the current dataset, we find no clear connection between this spectral diversity and either the host environments of Type Ibn SNe or their pre-explosion activity. The observed diversity in Type Ibn SNe likely reflects differences in circumstellar material properties and/or explosion energetics. These differences could result from a range of progenitor properties, such as different helium star mass, orbital period and companion type if they are in binary systems, and may indicate fundamentally diverse progenitors. Whether a continuous distribution exists between the two groups remains to be determined and will require further data to explore.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03949" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non ideal Transport Processes in the Solar Atmosphere</a><span class="id">[2511.03949]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Transport coefficients are calculated for a partially ionized plasma consisting of approximately 90% hydrogen and 10\% helium, representative of a model solar atmosphere with an assumed magnetic field profile. The ion Hall parameter, defined as the ratio of ion cyclotron to ion collision frequency, is determined by considering dominant resonance charge exchange processes alongside less significant nonresonant ion neutral collisions. Based on these calculations, we derive profiles for various transport coefficients. Our results demonstrate that thermal conductivity in partially ionized media, both parallel and perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, is dominated by neutral particles. The perpendicular thermal conductivity components show weak dependence on the ion Hall parameter and remain comparable in magnitude to their parallel counterparts. Wave damping through neutral thermal conductivity may contribute significantly to solar atmospheric heating. These findings indicate that perpendicular thermal conductivity components are essential for accurate modelling of partially ionized regions, including photosphere-chromosphere transition layers, spicules, and coronal prominences.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic voids and the kinetic analysis. V. Hubble tension, the cosmological constant and aperiodic filaments</a><span class="id">[2511.03990]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The appearance and specific properties of the structures in the local Universe are studied by means of the Vlasov kinetic technique. The role of the cosmological constant in the local structure formation is considered via the theorem on the general function satisfying the identity of the gravity of sphere and of point mass. Then, the Hubble tension is naturally explained as a result of two flows, local and global one, with non-coinciding Hubble parameters. The linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation with the cosmological term is shown to lead to van Kampen's waves, of Landau damping and then to aperiodic structures. The aperiodicity thus is emerging as a intrinsic feature of the filamentary and void structure of the local Universe, revealing the self-consistent field mechanism of its formation. The damping of the aperiodicity then is predicted and can be observationally traced upon the increase of the scale of the filaments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Low redshift observational constraints on dark energy models using ANN - CosmicANNEstimator</a><span class="id">[2511.04033]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present CosmicANNEstimator (Cosmological Parameters Artificial Neural Network Estimator), a machine learning approach for constraining cosmological parameters within the Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) framework.

The estimator is trained on synthetic data covering broad parameter ranges, with Gaussian random noise incorporated to simulate observational uncertainties. Our results demonstrate parameter estimates and associated uncertainties comparable to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, establishing machine learning as an efficient alternative for cosmological parameter estimation. This work underscores the potential of neural network-based inference to complement traditional Bayesian methods and accelerate future cosmological analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04067" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super amplification of lunar response to gravitational waves driven by thick crust</a><span class="id">[2511.04067]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Moon has been long regarded as a natural resonator of gravitational waves (GWs) since 1960, showing great potential to fill the frequency gap left behind GW detections by ground- or space-based laser interferometry. However, the spatial variation of this amplification capacity on the Moon remains unclear. Here, we numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs by fully considering the fluctuant topography and laterally heterogeneous interior structures. Our results show that most regions on the Moon can amplify GWs with a ratio over 2, a finding significantly higher than previous estimations. Particularly, the amplification ratio can even reach factors of tens at the resonant frequency of  0.015 Hz on the highlands surrounding the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, where the regional crust is the thickest. Our findings establish the thick-crust regions as critical zones of GW amplification, which is essential for future landing site selection and instrumental setting for GW detection on the Moon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04091" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early evidence for isotropic planetary obliquities in young super-Jupiter systems</a><span class="id">[2511.04091]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This decade has seen the first measurements of extrasolar planetary obliquities, characterizing how an exoplanet's spin axis is oriented relative to its orbital axis. These measurements are enabled by combining projected rotational velocities, planetary rotation periods, and astrometric orbits for directly-imaged super-Jupiters. This approach constrains both the spin axis and orbital inclination relative to the line of sight, allowing obliquity measurements for individual systems and offering new insights into their formation. To test whether these super-Jupiters form more like scaled-up planets or scaled-down stars, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer their population-level obliquity distribution. Using a single-parameter Fisher distribution, we compare two models: a planet-like formation scenario ($\kappa=5$) predicting moderate alignment, versus a brown dwarf-like formation scenario ($\kappa=0$) predicting isotropic obliquities. Based on a sample of four young super-Jupiter systems, we find early evidence favoring the isotropic case with a Bayes factor of 15, consistent with turbulent fragmentation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04099" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Cosmological Constraints of the Void-Lensing Cross-Correlation in the CSST Photometric Survey</a><span class="id">[2511.04099]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the cosmological constraints from the void-lensing cross-correlation assuming the $w$CDM model for the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) photometric survey. Using Jiutian simulations, we construct a mock galaxy catalog to $z=3$ covering 100 deg$^2$, which incorporates the instrumental and observational effects of the CSST. We divide the galaxy sample into seven photometric-redshift (photo-$z$) tomographic bins and identify 2D voids within each bin using the Voronoi tessellation and watershed algorithm. We measure the angular cross-power spectrum between the void distribution and the weak lensing signal, and estimate the covariance matrix via jackknife resampling combined with pseudo-$C_{\ell}$ approach to account for the partial sky correction. We employ the Halo Void Dust Model (HVDM) to model the void-matter cross-power spectrum and adopt the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to implement the constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. We find that our method can accurately extract the cosmological information, and the constraint accuracies of some cosmological parameters from the void-lensing analysis are comparable or even tighter than the weak lensing only case. This demonstrates that the void-lensing serves as an effective cosmological probe and a valuable complement to galaxy photometric surveys, particularly for the Stage-IV surveys targeting the high-redshift Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. I. Photometry</a><span class="id">[2511.04121]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formation of the first stars in the universe could be significantly impacted by the effects of Dark Matter (DM). Namely, if DM is in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), it could lead to the formation (at $z\sim 25-10$) of stars that are powered by DM annihilations alone, i.e. Dark Stars (DSs). Those objects can grow to become supermassive ($M\sim 10^6 \Msun$) and shine as bright as a galaxy ($L\sim 10^8 \Msun)$. Using a simple $\chi^2$ minimization, the first three DSs photometric candidates (i.e. \JADESeleven, \JADEStwelve, and \JADESzthirteen) were identified by \cite{Ilie:2023JADES}. Our goal is to develop tools to streamline the identification of such candidates within the rather large publicly available high redshift JWST data sets. We present here the key first step in achieving this goal: the development and implementation of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) search for Dark Star candidates, using data from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) photometric catalog. Our method reconfirms JADES-GS-z13 and JADES-GS-z11 as dark star candidates, based on the chi-squared goodness of fit test, yet they are $\sim10^4$ times faster than the Neadler-Mead $\chi^2$ minimization method used in \cite{Ilie:2023JADES}. We further identify six {\it new photometric} Dark Star candidates across redshifts $z \sim 9$ to $z \sim 14$. These findings underscore the power of neural networks in modeling non-linear relationships and efficiently analyzing large-scale photometric surveys, advancing the search for Dark Stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limiting Eccentricity in Restricted Hierarchical Three-Body Systems with Short-Range Forces</a><span class="id">[2511.04146]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A hierarchical three-body model can be widely applied to diverse astrophysical settings, from satellite-planet-star systems to binaries around supermassive black holes. The octupole-order perturbation on the inner binary from the tertiary can induce extreme eccentricities and cause orbital flips of the binary, but short-range forces such as those due to General Relativity (GR) may suppress extreme eccentricity excitations. In this paper, we consider restricted hierarchical three-body systems, where the inner binary has a test-mass component. We investigate the maximum possible eccentricity (called &quot;limiting eccentricity&quot;) attainable by the inner binary under the influence of the tertiary perturbations and GR effect. In systems with sufficiently high hierarchy, the double averaging (DA) model is a good approximation; we show that the orbits which can flip under the octupole-order perturbation reach the same limiting eccentricity, which can be calculated analytically using the quadrupole-order Hamiltonian. In systems with moderate hierarchy, DA breaks down and the so-called Brown Hamiltonian is often introduced as a correction term; we show that this does not change the limiting eccentricity. Finally, we employ the single averaging (SA) model and find that the limiting eccentricity in the SA model is higher than the one in the DA model. We derive an analytical scaling for the modified limiting eccentricity in the SA model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TESS and ground-based observations of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae in outburst</a><span class="id">[2511.04175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dwarf nova (DN) superoutbursts are accompanied by superhumps, which change their periods and profiles over a superoutburst. We present the TESS and ground-based observations of nine WZ Sge-type DNe and candidates in superoutburst. In TCP J23580961$+$5502508, ASASSN-23ba, PNV J19030433$-$3102187, V748 Hya, and ASASSN-25ci, we confirmed double-peaked oscillations called early superhumps, which are regarded as the unambiguous feature of WZ Sge-type DNe. On the other hand, the superhump and outburst properties of MO Psc and V1676 Her suggest that they may not be a member of WZ Sge-type DNe. The 2022 superoutburst of a confirmed WZ Sge-type DN TCP J05515391$+$6504346, however, lacked an early superhump phase. We find superhumps in a WZ Sge-type DN ASASSN-20mq during its rebrightening outburst. Thanks to the continuous coverage of TESS, we find the broken-powerlaw rise of the outburst light curve in V748 Hya and PNV J19030433$-$3102187, previously found in only one WZ Sge-type DN observed by Kepler. Early superhumps appeared when the system reached $\simeq40$% of the outburst peak flux. No orbital modulation from a hot spot is detected before and after this. This non-detection of orbital humps on the early rise of V748 Hya constrains that the corresponding mass transfer rate should be below $\simeq1\times10^{16}$ g s$^{-1}$, disfavouring an enhancement of a mass transfer rate by an order of magnitude or larger, even if it occurs. The contentious TESS observations also confirm the coexistence of early and ordinary superhumps during their transition and $\leq$2-cycle duration of stage A–B superhump transition in V748 Hya.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04210" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NANOGrav 15-year gravitational-wave signals from binary supermassive black-holes seeded by primordial black holes</a><span class="id">[2511.04210]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we explain the recently reported a nHz-band gravitational-wave background from NANOGrav 15-year through the merger of binary super-massive black holes with masses of $10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed by the growth of primordial black holes.

Since this has not been detected, there is a strict upper bound on the accretion rate. We have found that with the primordial black hole abundance $10^{-14} \lesssim f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-12}$ and the mass $1 M_{\odot} \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^3 M_{\odot}$, we successfully fit the nHz band gravitational wave background from NANOGrav 15-year while avoiding the 21 cm line emission.

We present observations of a quiescent filament eruption that occurs on 13 July 2015. The eruption is associated with a two-ribbon GOES B8.9 class flare. Photospheric magnetic flux cancellation is present below the filament during days. This builds up a flux rope which progressively rises until it gets unstable, first leading to a confined eruption and pre-flare brightenings, then to an ejection which starts $\approx$ 20 min later with the flare onset. An interesting feature of this event is the presence of a large circular brightening formed around the erupting region. This brightening is produced due to interchange reconnection of the ejected magnetic configuration with the surrounding open magnetic field. This null-point topology is confirmed by a potential-field extrapolation. The EUV loops located on the southern side of the filament eruption first contract during the null-point reconnection, then expand as the flux rope is ejected. The associated CME has both a classical flux rope shape and plasma ejected along open field lines on the flux rope side (a trace of interchange reconnection). Finally, we set all this disparate observations within a coherent framework where magnetic reconnection occurs both below and above the erupting filament.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing an Oscillating and Contracting Compact Corona near the Event Horizon of the Supermassive Black Hole in 1ES 1927+654</a><span class="id">[2511.04264]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dynamic processes in the accretion flow near black holes produce X-ray flux variability, sometimes quasi-periodic. Determining its physical origin is key to mapping accretion geometry but remains unresolved. We perform a novel phase-resolved analysis on a newly discovered quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the active galactic nucleus 1ES 1927+654. For the first time in a supermassive black hole (SMBH), we detect a unique `U'-shaped QPO lag-energy spectrum and observe coronal spectral variability over the QPO phase. We find that the QPO is adequately explained by plasma resonant oscillations within a corona. Modeling of QPO spectral properties and reverberation mapping reveal that the corona is contracting and confined to only a few gravitational radii regions near the SMBH, consistent with theoretical predictions for a decreasing QPO period of near 10 minutes. These results present the first observational evidence for an oscillating and contracting compact corona around an SMBH.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining gravity with the decay rate of cosmological gravitational potential</a><span class="id">[2511.04279]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A key task in cosmology is to test the validity of general relativity (GR) at cosmological scales and, therefore, to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity (MG) as the driver of the late-time cosmic acceleration. The decay rate ($DR$) of cosmological gravitational potential, being sensitive to gravity and being immune to various astrophysical uncertainties, enables GR tests independent to other structure growth probes. Recently we have measured $DR$ at $0.2\leq z\leq 1.4$, combining the DR9 galaxy catalog from the DESI imaging surveys and Planck cosmic microwave background maps \citep{ arXiv:2411.12594 }. Here we use this measurement to test gravity, and restrict the analysis to one-parameter extensions to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We consider four one-parameter MG parameterizations. One is $f(a)=\Omega_m^\gamma(a)$. The other three adopt the gravitational slip parameter $\eta=1$ and consider variations in the effective gravitational constant $G_{\rm eff}/G$ with the parameterization $\Sigma(a)=\Sigma_\Lambda \Omega_\Lambda(a)/\Omega_\Lambda$, $\Sigma(a)=\Sigma_1 a$ or $\Sigma(a)=\Sigma_2 a^2$. We find $\gamma=0.47^{+0.22}_{-0.15}$, consistent with the GR prediction $\gamma\simeq 0.55$. We also find $\Sigma_\Lambda=0.018^{+0.052}_{-0.053}$, $\Sigma_1=0.020^{+0.065}_{-0.062}$, and $\Sigma_2=0.027^{+0.067}_{-0.069}$, fully consistent with the GR case of $\Sigma=0$, regardless of parameterizations of $\Sigma(a)$. The constraining power is already competitive, while a factor of 2 further improvement is expected for the upcoming full-sky galaxy surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Initial mass function of field stars with mass $\leq$ 1 $M_{\odot}$ varies with metallicity</a><span class="id">[2511.04280]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigated a volume-limited sample of LAMOST main-sequence stars with masses from 0.25 to 1 $M_{\odot}$ and distances of 150-350 pc to explore how the stellar initial mass function (IMF) varies with metallicity. We corrected the spectroscopic selection function by comparing the stellar number densities with the photometric ones at the same colour and magnitude. From these corrected number density distributions, we derived IMFs for each metallicity sub-samples. Fitting a broken power-law function in each IMF with a fixed break point at 0.525 $M_{\odot}$, we found the power-law indices increase with [Fe/H] for both mass regimes: $\alpha_1$ (mass $\leq$ 0.525 $M_{\odot}$) rises from 0.54 $\pm$ 0.21 to 1.40 $\pm$ 0.07 and $\alpha_2$ (mass&gt;0.525 $M_{\odot}$) grows from 1.40 $\pm$ 0.16 to 1.86 $\pm$ 0.04 as [Fe/H] varies from -1 to +0.5 dex. It demonstrates that low-mass stars make up a larger fraction in metal-rich environments than in metal-poor ones. We performed simulations to assess the impact of unresolved binaries on the IMF power-law indices. After correction, the binary-adjusted $\alpha$ values retained a similar metallicity-dependent trend. Furthermore, by examining the IMF of the aggregate sample, we found the corrected indices ($\alpha_{\rm{1,corr}} = 1.48 \pm 0.03$ , $\alpha_{\rm{2,corr}} = 2.17 \pm 0.03$) are consistent with Kroupa's IMF values ($\alpha_1 = 1.3 \pm 0.5$ and $\alpha_2 = 2.3 \pm 0.3$). Finally, we verified the robustness of our results by testing different break points and mass bin sizes, confirming that the IMF's dependence on [Fe/H] remains consistent.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of a 9.67-s pulsar in an ultraluminous X-ray source in NGC 4631 with XMM-Newton</a><span class="id">[2511.04282]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thanks to a recent observation with XMM-Newton, we discovered periodic pulsations at P= 9.6652 +/- 0.0002 s in a new ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in the galaxy NGC 4631. This source, dubbed as X-8, shows one of the largest spin-up rates ever observed, dP/dt = (-9.6 +/- 0.5)*1E-8 s/s. These findings indicate that the compact object is a neutron star, and X-8 is a new member of the pulsating ULX class. The 0.3-10 keV luminosity of X-8 is  3.4E39 erg/s, and its X-ray spectrum can be described by an absorbed disk blackbody or a cut-off power law, similar to what is observed in other pulsating ULXs. We discuss two possible causes for the large spin-up rate: Doppler shift from orbital motion of the neutron star and intrinsic spin-up due to accretion torque. This new ULX pulsar adds a key source to the small known population, and will enable future studies to better constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for their super-Eddington luminosities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Massive stars exploding in a He-rich circumstellar medium XII.

It rises to an absolute magnitude peak of about -17.58 mag in 10.6 days, and displays a rapid linear post-peak light-curve decline in all bands, similar to most SNe Ibn. The optical pseudobolometric light curve peaks at ($3.5\pm0.8) \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with a total radiated energy of $(5.0\pm0.4) \times 10^{48}$ erg. The spectra are dominated by a blue continuum at early stages, with narrow P-Cygni \Hei lines and flash-ionisation emission lines of C {\sc iii}, N {\sc iii}, and He {\sc ii}. The P-Cygni \Hei features gradually evolve and become emission-dominated in late-time spectra. The \Ha line is detected throughout the entire spectral evolution, which indicates that the CSM is helium-rich with some residual amount of H. Our multiband light-curve modelling yields estimates of the ejecta mass of $M_{ej}$ = $0.98^{+0.30}_{-0.20} \, \msun$, with a kinetic energy of $E_{k} = 0.13^{+0.03}_{-0.02} \times 10^{51}$ erg, and a $^{56}Ni$ mass of $M_{\mathrm{Ni}} = 0.017 \, \msun$. The inferred CSM properties are characterised by a mass of $M_{\rm{CSM}} = 0.39^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ \msun, an inner radius of $R_0$=$15.6^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$ AU, and a density $\rho_{CSM} = (1.32\pm0.22)\times10^{-11} \, \mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$. The multi-epoch spectra are well reproduced by the CMFGEN/ \texttt{he4p0} model, corresponding to a He-ZAMS mass of 4 M$_\odot$. These findings are consistent with a scenario of an SN powered by ejecta-CSM interaction, originating from a low-mass helium star that evolved within an interacting binary system where the CSM with some residual hydrogen may originate from the mass-transfer process. In addition, a channel of core-collapse explosion of a late-type Wolf-Rayet star with H, or an Ofpe/WN9 star with fallback accretion, cannot be entirely ruled out.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An alternative theory of magnetic flux tubes in strong fields via axion origin photons</a><span class="id">[2511.04346]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In our alternative theory, built around the coincidence of experimental and theoretical data, three &quot;free&quot; parameters – the magnetic field in the tachocline of the order of  10^7 G (see Fig.(A.1) and Eq.(A17) in V.

The near-ultraviolet (NUV) regime is particularly sensitive to extended upper atmospheric and magnetospheric structures. We investigate whether star-planet interactions in the WASP-189 system could plausibly account for the early ingress feature suggested by NUV transit fitting models. We analyzed three NUV transits of WASP-189b observed as part of the Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment (CUTE), which employs a 6U CubeSat dedicated to exoplanet spectroscopy. To explore whether the observed transit asymmetry could plausibly arise from a magnetospheric bow shock (MBS), we performed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using representative stellar wind velocities and planetary atmospheric densities. During Visit 3, we identified an approximately 31.5-minute phase offset that is consistent with an early ingress. Our MHD simulations indicate that with a wind speed of 573 km s-1 and an upper atmospheric density of about 4.6e-11 kg m-3, a higher-density zone due to compression can form ahead of the planet within five planetary radii where the fast-mode Mach number falls below  0.56, even without a MBS. Shock cooling and crossing time estimates suggest that such a pileup could produce detectable NUV absorption. Our results indicate that while MBS formation is feasible for WASP-189b, low stellar-wind speeds favor NUV-detectable magnetic pileups over classical bow shocks and enhance the potential detectability of early-ingress signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04373" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectroscopic analysis of hydrogen and silicon in bright fireballs: New insights into meteoroid composition</a><span class="id">[2511.04373]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a study of the high-temperature spectral component in meteor fireballs, with a particular focus on neutral hydrogen at 656.28 nm and ionised silicon doublet at 634.71 nm and 637.14 nm. By analysing spectra from the European Fireball Network (EN) that exhibit H$\alpha$ and Si II emissions, we investigated the relationship between H and Si abundances across different meteoroid types. The plasma temperature of the high-temperature component remains independent of meteor velocity. This allows us to directly compare relative intensities of volatile hydrogen with less volatile silicon in bodies with different velocities. Our results confirmed that the H/Si value remains largely independent of meteor velocity. We show a positive correlation with photometric mass for cometary meteoroids, suggesting that larger bodies better preserve their volatile content, namely hydrogen. This correlation persists across the meteor showers, showing a physical process related to volatile preservation rather than specific parent body composition. Our data suggest that the abundance of hydrogen in large cometary meteoroids is not only higher than in CI chondrites, but is also comparable to or higher than the measured abundances in small particles of dust from Halley's comet, depending on the assumed plasma conditions. This work brought new constraints on the distribution and preservation of volatile elements in Solar System bodies and new insights into the potential delivery mechanisms of water to Earth. The prevalence of hydrogen in larger cometary meteoroids supports models where comets could be significant contributors to Earth's volatile inventory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transiting Exoplanets from Sharjah Astronomical Observatory (SAO-M47): The Exoplanet HAT-P-25b Using L and V Filters</a><span class="id">[2511.04396]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of observations carried out on the exoplanet HAT-P-25 b at the Sharjah Astronomical Observatory (SAO). We have employed two distinct filters, namely, the Luminoso (L) and Visual (V) filters. Our research aims to discern any variations in transit depth or exoplanet size resulting from the use of these different filters. The primary focus of this study is to determine the exoplanet's size relative to its host star using the transit method. The application of different filters was expected to introduce subtle variations in size, influenced by factors such as the exoplanet's atmosphere. Notably, our findings reveal that the exoplanet's size appears larger when observed through the L filter compared to the V filter. Throughout the analytical process, we employed the TRASCA model to determine the transit depth for each epoch. Fixed parameters, including the orbital period of the exoplanet (P, measured in days) and the transit duration (measured in minutes), were utilized in these calculations. Our results indicate that the transit depths observed with the L filter were greater than those with the V filter, measuring 0.0238 magnitudes and 0.0200 magnitudes, respectively. These values deviate from the reference result of 0.0204 magnitudes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How the gradient of $M_{\rm d}$ versus UV field strength yields insights into the ages of protoplanetary disc populations</a><span class="id">[2511.04410]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>FUV radiation from massive stars launch photoevaporative winds from the outer regions of protoplanetary discs around other stars, removing gas and dust. Observations have identified a relation between the median dust disc mass and the external UV field strength. Here we use disc evolutionary models to explore how this relation evolves over time, and with respect to other stellar and disc properties. We find that the slope for the relationship $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ flattens over time as populations age, possibly explaining the differences seen between the L1641-N and L1641-S clusters in Orion A. We determine that $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ depends on the stellar mass where more massive stars exhibit steeper gradients than their lesser counterparts, in agreement with the differences seen between Herbig and T Tauri stars. Additionally, the strength of the mechanism for angular momentum transport, either viscosity or MHD disc winds, is found to significantly affect $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ with stronger $\alpha$ values reducing $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ due to more material accreting on to the central stars in weaker UV environments. Estimates of $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ from observations of L1641 place preliminary constraints on $\alpha$ to be between $10^{-3.5}$–$10^{-2.5}$, consistent with literature estimates. Further observations in different regions and better classifications of stellar masses will allow us to place stringent constraints on disc evolution properties, improving our understanding of how protoplanetary discs evolve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dust Collisions in Protoplanetary Disks: Atomic Simulations of the Surface Free Energy</a><span class="id">[2511.04423]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coagulation of dust particles in protoplanetary disks is the first step on the journey to the formation of planets. The surface free energy (SFE) of the dust particles determines the effectiveness of particles sticking to each other after collision, as well as the critical collision velocity above which fragmentation will occur. Studies of SFE have focused on the simplest silicate, silica, usually at standard temperature and pressure. However, protoplanetary dust grains have a wide variety of mineralogical compositions, temperatures, and a low-pressure environment lacking in water vapor. We perform molecular dynamics simulations using a ReaxFF-type potential of the SFE of silica, albite, and anorthite at temperatures ranging from 30 to 700 K in a true vacuum. We find that the SFE drops by tens of percent with increasing temperature or shifting to more complex silicate compositions. More dramatically, we find that the values of the SFE in a vacuum are two orders of magnitude higher than those usually measured in terrestrial laboratories. Our results confirm previous work that suggests that hydroxylation by monolayers of water produces this reduction in SFE in experiments. The coagulation of dust grains thus appears to depend critically on the cleanliness of their surfaces, as well as their temperature and composition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The TeV emission of 3C273: inverse Compton radiation from shear-accelerated high-energy electrons in the large-scale jet?</a><span class="id">[2511.04433]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The VERITAS Collaboration recently reported the detection of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission from the prototypical radio quasar 3C273. The temporal and the spectral properties of this component do not appear compatible with the extrapolation of the beamed blazar-like emission of the inner, pc-scale jet. We explore the possibility that the VHE component is produced in the jet at kpc scale through the inverse Compton emission of a population of ultra-high energy electrons (with Lorentz factor $\gamma\sim 10^8$). In the model these electrons are accelerated through the shear acceleration mechanism, and they also account for the still puzzling X-ray emission of knots detected by {\it Chandra} in the large-scale jets of several powerful quasars (including 3C273). In our scenario the VHE component can be interpreted as the integrated emission from the two brightest knots of the 3C273 jet. We speculate that the decay of the emission on the timescale of $\sim 3$ years could be accounted for by the scenario if the VHE radiation is produced in some compact regions in the downstream flow of a recollimation shock.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Study the nature of dynamical dark energy by measuring the CMB polarization rotation angle</a><span class="id">[2511.04459]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) support the dynamical dark energy. Intriguingly, the data favor a transition of the dark energy equation of state across $w=-1$, a hallmark of the Quintom scenario. In this paper, we consider a different approach to the dynamical nature of dark energy by investigating its interaction with ordinary matters, specifically the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction with photons. In cosmology, this interaction rotates the polarized plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, which induces non-zero polarized TB and EB power spectra. We forecast this measurement with the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) experiment. We take the best-fit value of the isotropic rotation angle from Planck data as our fiducial input. We project that 11 module-year (modyr) of observations will yield an improved detection sensitivity with a significance $\sim 5\sigma$, given a calibration precision of $0.1^\circ$ in the polarization angle. We also forecast AliCPT's sensitivity to the amplitude of a scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropic polarization rotation field. With $50$ modyr of observations, the large-aperture configuration is expected to reach $\sigma_{A_{\mathrm{CB}}}\sim10^{-2}$, offering a sixfold improvement over the small-aperture design and enabling competitive tests of spatial fluctuations in the dark energy field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Environmental effects in stellar mass gravitational wave sources II: Joint detections of eccentricity and phase shifts in binary sub-populations</a><span class="id">[2511.04540]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We demonstrate that the properties of eccentric gravitational wave (GW) signals enhance the detectability of GW phase shifts caused by environmental effects (EEs): The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEs can be boosted by up to $\ell_{\rm max}^{1 - n}$ with respect to corresponding circular signals, where $\ell_{\rm max}$ is the highest modeled eccentric GW harmonic and $n$ is the frequency scaling of the GW dephasing prescription associated to the EE. We investigate the impact on a population level, adopting plausible eccentricity distributions for binary sources observed by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (A+ and A\# sensitivities), as well as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). For sources in the high eccentricity tail of a distribution ($e \gtrsim 0.2$ at 10 Hz), phase shifts can systematically be up to $\ell_{\rm max}^{1 - n}$ times smaller than in a corresponding circular signal and still be detectable. For typical EEs, such as Roemer delays and gas drag, this effect amounts to SNR enhancements that range from $10^2$ up to $10^5$. For CE and ET, our analysis shows that EEs will be an ubiquitous feature in the eccentric tail of merging binaries, regardless of the specific details of the formation channel.

Here, complex radiation hydrodynamic processes affect the structure of the atmosphere as well as the formation of spectral lines. In quantitative spectroscopic analysis, the effects of these processes are often parametrized with ad hoc techniques and values. This work is aimed at exploring how variation of basic atmospheric parameters affects the dynamics within the subsurface turbulent zone. We also explore how this turbulence relates to absorption lines formed in the photosphere for a broad range of O stars at solar metallically. The work in this paper centers around a grid of 2D, radiation-hydrodynamic O-star atmosphere and wind simulations, where the turbulent region is an emergent property of the simulation. For each of the 36 models in the grid, we derived the turbulent properties and correlated them to an estimate of turbulent line broadening imposed by the models' velocity fields. Our work suggests that the subphotospheric turbulent velocity in O-stars scales approximately with the square of the Eddington arameter, $\Gamma_{\rm e}$. We also find a linear correlation between subphotospheric turbulent velocity and the line broadening of several synthetic photospheric absorption lines. Radiation carries more energy than advection throughout the atmosphere for all models in the grid; however, for O-type supergiants, the latter can account for up to 30 \% of the total flux at the peak of the iron bump.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parameterizing Noise Covariance in Maximum-Likelihood Component Separation</a><span class="id">[2511.04546]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a noise-aware extension to the parametric maximum-likelihood framework for component separation by modeling correlated $1/f^\alpha$ noise as a harmonic-space power law. This approach addresses a key limitation of existing implementations, for which a mismodelling of the statistical properties of the noise can lead to biases in the characterization of the spectral laws, and consequently biases in the recovered CMB maps. We propose a novel framework based on a modified ridge likelihood embedded in an ensemble-average pipeline and derive an analytic bias correction to control noise-induced foreground residuals. We discuss the practical applications of this approach in the absence of true noise information, leading to the choice of white noise as a realistic assumption. As a proof of concept, we apply this methodology to a set of simplified, idealized simulations inspired by the specifications of the proposed ECHO (CMB-Bh$\overline{a}$rat) mission, which features multi-frequency, large-format focal planes. We forecast the $95 \%$ upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{95}$, under a suite of realistic noise scenarios. Our results show that for an optimistic full sky observation, ECHO can achieve $r_{95}\leq 10^{-4}$ even in the presence of significant correlated noise, demonstrating the mission's capability to probe primordial gravitational waves with unprecedented sensitivity.

To assess CME geoeffectiveness, among other scientific goals, it is necessary to reliably identify and characterize their morphology and kinematics in coronagraph images. Current methods of CME identification are either subjected to human biases or perform a poor identification due to deficiencies in the automatic detection. In this approach, we have trained the deep convolutional neural model Mask R-CNN to automatically segment the outer envelope of one or multiple CMEs present in a single difference coronagraph image. The empirical training dataset is composed of 10^5 synthetic coronagraph images with known pixel-level CME segmentation masks. It is obtained by combining quiet coronagraph observations, with synthetic white-light CMEs produced using the GCS geometric model and ray-tracing technique. We found that our model-based trained Mask R-CNN infers segmentation masks that are smooth and topologically connected. While the inferred masks are not representative of the detailed outer envelope of complex CMEs, the neural model can better differentiate a CME from other radially moving background/foreground features, segment multiple simultaneous CMEs that are close to each other, and work with images from different instruments. This is accomplished without relying on kinematic information, i.e. only the included in the single input difference image. We obtain a median IoU=0.98 for 1.6*10^4 synthetic validation images, and IoU=0.77 when compared with two independent manual segmentations of 115 observations acquired by the COR2-A, COR2-B and LASCO C2 coronagraphs. The methodology presented in this work can be used with other CME models to produce more realistic synthetic brightness images while preserving desired morphological features, and obtain more robust and/or tailored segmentations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04592" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pre-Outburst Properties of the FU Ori Object HBC 722</a><span class="id">[2511.04592]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>FU Ori outbursts are thought to play an important role in stellar assembly and the evolution of protoplanetary disks. However, the progenitor young stellar objects are largely uncharacterized. We obtained a low-resolution optical spectrum of HBC 722 before its FU Ori outburst as part of a survey of young stellar objects in the North America Nebula. The spectrum yields a spectral type of M3.3$\pm$0.4, which when combined with archival photometry allows us to measure the stellar and accretion properties of a young star prior to its FU Ori outburst. The pre-outburst accretion rate of $7\times10^{-9}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is high for a protoplanetary disk around an M3-M3.5 star, though about 15,000 times weaker than the accretion rate during the outburst. The pre-outburst variability, inferred from archival B-band photometry, is about a factor 5 with a standard deviation of 0.16 dex and is consistent with variable accretion onto young low-mass stars. The stellar radius is larger than the radius of accreting young stars of similar spectral type by a factor of two. The extinction to HBC 722 is $\sim 1.45\pm0.3$ mag, lower than the 2.5–3.7 mag extinction values measured during the outburst. The u-band photometry plays an especially important role in constraining the veiling at longer wavelengths and therefore also the extinction and photospheric luminosity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peculiarities in the infrared emission of PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts</a><span class="id">[2511.04606]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The coexistence of PAHs and the C$_{60}$ fullerene in different astrophysical environments can give rise to the formation of new complex species denoted as PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, which may contribute to the infrared (IR) emission observed.

These experimental data are used to correct their harmonic scaled spectra, as obtained from quantum-chemistry calculations performed at the DFT level under the B3LYP-GD3/6-31+G(d) approach. This way, we simulate the IR ($\sim$3$-$25 $\mu$m) spectra of multiple PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, composed by a different number of PAH units: mostly one or two units. In addition, the chemical kinetics data available in the literature are used to tentatively estimate the possible order of magnitude of the abundances of these PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts using the available observational data. Essentially, our results reveal a possible strong modification of the IR spectra when astronomically estimated abundances are considered. Several spectral peculiarities are observed, such as a broad $\sim$3.4-3.6 $\mu$m feature, and important modifications in the 6-10 and 12-16 $\mu$m spectral regions together with contributions to the C$_{60}$ features at 7.0 and 18.9 $\mu$m. Interestingly, these PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts lack aliphatic CH bonds, but they display IR features around 3.4 $\mu$m, challenging previous interpretations of this astronomical feature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addressing the DESI DR2 Phantom-Crossing Anomaly and Enhanced $H_0$ Tension with Reconstructed Scalar-Tensor Gravity</a><span class="id">[2511.04610]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent cosmological data, including DESI DR2, highlight significant tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. When analyzed in the context of General Relativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE) equation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$. However, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck 2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom crossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar fields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of freedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in the context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line within a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be achieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular, Scalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable feature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI DR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple parametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\mu_G(z) \equiv G_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$. This MG framework significantly alleviates the tension, leading to a higher inferred value of $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.7 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also present a systematic, data-driven reconstruction of the required underlying ST Lagrangian and provide simple, generic analytical expressions for both the non-minimal coupling $F(\Phi) = 1+\xi\Phi^{2}e^{n\Phi}$ and the scalar potential $U(\Phi) = U_{0}+ae^{b\Phi^{2}}$, which well-describe the reconstructed functions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04642" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Masses of Young Stellar Multiple Systems with the VLBA (DYNAMO-VLBA)</a><span class="id">[2511.04642]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) provides high angular resolution images and has been used for stellar astrometry for decades. The DYNAMO-VLBA project utilizes the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to study tight binary and multiple pre-main sequence stars, whose components have detectable radio emission and typical separations on the order of milli-arcseconds. Such systems cannot be resolved by Gaia, making VLBI an essential tool for the study of their orbital parameters and, eventually, the determination of their mass. Here, we report VLBA dynamical mass measurements of the individual stars in the S1 system in Ophiuchus and EC 95 in Serpens. S1 is the most luminous and massive stellar member of the nearby Ophiuchus star-forming region. We find that the primary component, S1A, has a mass of $4.11 \pm 0.10\,M_{\odot}$. This is significantly less than the value of $\sim6\,M_{\odot}$ expected from theoretical models given the location of S1A on the HR diagram. The secondary, S1B, has a mass of $0.831 \pm 0.014\,M_{\odot}$ and is most likely a T Tauri star. In the Serpens triple system EC 95, we measure the masses of EC 95A and EC 95B, finding $2.15\pm0.10$ M$_\odot$ and $2.00\pm0.12$ M$_\odot$, respectively. In this case, the measured masses agree with the location of the stars in the HR diagram for very young 2 $M_\odot$ stars. For the first time, we also estimated the mass of tertiary, EC 95C, to be 0.26 $^{+0.53}_{-0.46}$ M$_\odot$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intermittency in Collisionless Large-Amplitude Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2511.04663]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large-amplitude turbulence – characterized by a fluctuating magnetic field component, $\delta B$, that is stronger than the mean component, $B_0$ – is generically intermittent, populated with intense localized structures such as sharp field-line bends and rapid field reversals. Recent MHD simulations suggest that these structures play an important role in particle transport and acceleration; however, MHD is inapplicable in most of our Universe, where the plasma is so hot or diffuse that Coulomb collisions are negligible. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the intermittent properties of collisionless large-amplitude turbulence in electron-positron plasmas via fully kinetic 3D simulations, exploring a wide range of $\delta B / B_0$ and scale separations between the turbulence driving scale, $L$, and kinetic scales, $c/\omega_{\rm p}$. The steady-state collisionless turbulence in our simulations broadly resembles that of MHD, but the development of pressure anisotropy steepens the scaling between magnetic field strength, $B$, and scalar field-line curvature, $K_\parallel$ – yielding $B \propto K_\parallel^{-3/4}$ – and consequently modifies the power-law slope of the probability density function of $K_\parallel$; this slope hardens from $K_\parallel^{-2.5}$ to $K_\parallel^{-2.0}$ as $\delta B / B_0$ increases from 4 to 140. Pressure anisotropy also triggers mirror and firehose instabilities, with the volume-filling fractions of these fluctuations increasing with $\delta B / B_0$; for our largest $\delta B / B_0$, $20\%$ of the volume is mirror-unstable and $6\%$ is firehose-unstable. Both the curvature and the Larmor-scale fluctuations in collisionless large-amplitude turbulence are expected to significantly influence cosmic ray transport and acceleration in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy and the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04676" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KGB-evolution: a relativistic $N$-body code for kinetic gravity braiding models</a><span class="id">[2511.04676]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present KGB-evolution, a relativistic $N$-body simulation code that extends the $k$-evolution code by incorporating an effective field theory parameterization of kinetic gravity braiding, while also including the $k$-essence model as a limiting case.

This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI) pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level. Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs. Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\Omega_m - S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03788" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boson Stars Hosting Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2511.03788]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study a system of a self-gravitating condensate, a boson star, formed from scalar ultra-light dark matter (ULDM), with a black hole hosted at its center.

Our topological analysis reveals that the STVG coupling parameter $\alpha$ bolsters thermal stability while electromagnetic charge $Q$ weakens it. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we find that $\alpha$ amplifies light deflection and enlarges shadow silhouettes, with $Q$ generating opposite effects. Our quantum-corrected models with exponential entropy terms pinpoint phase transitions in the microscopic regime, modifying conventional thermodynamic relationships. Calculations of strong gravitational lensing, shadow geometry, and Hawking emission show clear STVG signatures that diverge from Einstein's predictions. Notably, our accretion disk analysis uncovers an intriguing phenomenon: specific combinations of $\alpha$ and $Q$ can produce radiation patterns resembling spinning Kerr black holes, creating potential identification challenges for observers. These findings establish concrete observational tests for STVG theory through next generation astronomical imaging and lensing campaigns.

Though nominally congruent, here we highlight impact of implicit assumptions embedded in joint analysis of these messengers and their systematic impact on EoS inference. We show that astrophysical assumptions and EoS framework can have a larger effect on inferred EoS than individual contemporary neutron star observations. Performing a proof-of-concept demonstration using the chronologically first few observational constraints, after the application of 5 to 6 observational constraints, additional observations provided diminishing returns and modified the inferred EoS by shifting the radius of a 1.4 $\unit{M_\odot}$ NS by $\sim$ 0.1 km. By contrast, astrophysical priors, specifically the spin and mass ratio motivated by astrophysical source population uncertainties, and EoS framework tend to impact EoS inference much more substantially by shifting the 1.4 $\unit{M_\odot}$ NS radius by $\sim$ 0.5 km and by modifying shape of inferred mass-radius relationship. The inferred EoS depends strongly on the adopted choice of spectral parameterizations: when we employ a framework which explicitly enforces causality, we find a strong phase-transition-like feature at $\sim 10^{14.5}$ g cm$^{-3}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coronal hole picoflare jets are progenitors of both fast and Alfvénic slow solar wind</a><span class="id">[2411.16513]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar wind, classified by its bulk speed and the Alfvénic nature of its fluctuations, generates the heliosphere.

We performed $&gt;6,000$ Type-I simulations of multi-planet systems that mimic the observed {\it Kepler} sample in terms of stellar mass, planet size, multiplicity, and intra-system uniformity over a parameter space encompassing transitional and truncated disks. We found that Type-I migration coupled with a disk inner edge can indeed produce second- and third-order resonances (in a state of libration) in $\sim 10\%$ and 2\% of resonant-chain systems, respectively. Moreover, the relative occurrence of first- and second-order MMRs in our simulations is consistent with observations (e.g. 3:2 is more common than 2:1; while second-order 5:3 is more common than 7:5). The formation of higher-order MMRs favors slower disk migration and a smaller outer planet mass. Higher-order resonances do not have to form with the help of a Laplace-like three-body resonance as was proposed for TRAPPIST-1. Instead, the formation of higher-order resonance is assisted by breaking a pre-existing first-order resonance, which generates small but non-zero initial eccentricities ($e\approx10^{-3}$ to 10$^{-2}$). We predict that 1) librating higher-order resonances have higher equilibrium $e$ ($\sim 0.1$); 2) are more likely found as an isolated pair in an otherwise first-order chain; 3) more likely emerge in the inner pairs of a chain.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-minimal light-curvature couplings and black-hole imaging</a><span class="id">[2505.21431]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field strength and the spacetime curvature are part of the effective field theory of gravity and matter.

The dominant source of scattering for most FRBs is expected to be within their host galaxies, an assumption which can be tested by examining potential correlations between properties of the FRBs and global properties of their hosts. Using results from the CRAFT survey, we investigate correlations across a range of host galaxy properties against attributes of the FRB that encode propagation effects: scattering timescale tau, polarisation fractions, and absolute Faraday rotation measure. From 21 host galaxy properties considered, we find three correlated with tau, including the stellar surface density (or compactness; Pearson p-value p = 0.002 and Spearman p = 0.010), mass-weighted age (Spearman p-value p = 0.009), and a weaker correlation with gas-phase metallicity (Spearman p = 0.017). Weakly significant correlations are also found with Halpha equivalent widths and gravitational potential. From 10,000 trials of reshuffled datasets, we expect 2 strong Spearman correlations only 2% of the time, and three weaker correlations in 6.6% of cases. Compact host galaxies may have more ionised content which scatters the FRB further. No correlation is seen with host galaxy inclination, which weakens the case for an inclination bias, as previously suggested for samples of localised FRBs. A strong (p = 0.002) correlation is found for absolute rotation measure with optical disc axis ratio b/a; greater rotation measures are seen for edge-on host galaxies. Further high-time resolution FRB detections, coupled with localisation and detailed follow-up on their host galaxies, are necessary to corroborate these initial findings and shed further light into the FRB mechanism.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23571" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The validity of separate-universe approach in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation</a><span class="id">[2506.23571]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the breakdown of the separate-universe approximation during transitions in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation by analyzing the evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal R}$ and its conjugate momentum $\Pi$. It is well known that spatial gradient terms lead to a failure of this approximation, particularly at the transition from slow-roll to ultra-slow-roll phase. We show that a similar breakdown also occurs during the second transition back to slow-roll when considering the evolution of $\Pi$. Interestingly, while the homogeneous solution for $\Pi$ accurately captures the dynamics across the first transition, it is the homogeneous solution for ${\cal R}$ that becomes valid across the second. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spatial curvature term introduced in the extended $\delta N$ formalism of \cite{Artigas:2024ajh} can be interpreted as arising from the contribution of $\Pi$ to the energy density perturbation. Importantly, this modification of the local Hubble parameter is valid only when the first slow-roll parameter is both small and strictly constant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05161" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hubble constant constraint using 117 FRBs with a more accurate probability density function for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$</a><span class="id">[2508.05161]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are among the most mysterious astronomical transients. Due to their short durations and cosmological distances, their dispersion measure (DM) - redshift ($z$) relation is useful for constraining cosmological parameters and detecting the baryons in the Universe. The increasing number of localized FRBs in recent years has provided more precise constraints on these parameters. However, the larger dataset reveals limitations in the widely used probability density function ($p_{\rm diff}$) for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$, which refers to the diffuse electron term of FRB DM. In this project, we collect 117 of the latest, localized FRBs, discuss the effect of a more accurate $\sigma_{\rm diff}$, which is a parameter in $p_{\rm diff}$ and once thoughts as “effective standard deviation”, and more clearly rewrite their likelihood to better constrain the parameters above. We find that the widely used approximation $\sigma_{\rm diff} \sim F/\sqrt{z}$ only works under contrived assumptions and shows the greatest deviation from the true standard deviation in low redshift. In general, one should use an accurate method to derive this parameter from $p_{\rm diff}$. Our method yields better constraints on $H_0\Omega_b f_{\rm diff} = 2.813_{-0.258}^{+0.250}\;{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ or $H_0 = 66.889_{-5.459}^{+6.754} \;{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ when combining the FRB data with CMB measurements and taking $f_{\rm diff} = 0.84$. This fully analytical correction helps us better constrain cosmological parameters with the increasing number of localized FRBs available today.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glitch analysis and asteroseismic modelling of subgiant $μ$ Herculis: confirming and interpreting the $Γ_1$ peak as the helium glitch</a><span class="id">[2509.01577]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The measurements of pressure-mode and mixed-mode oscillation frequencies in subgiant stars offer a unique opportunity to probe their internal structures – from the surface to the deep interior – and to precisely determine their global properties. We have conducted a detailed asteroseismic analysis of the benchmark subgiant $\mu$ Herculis using eight seasons of radial velocity observations from the SONG-Tenerife, and have determined its mass, radius, age, and surface helium abundance to be $1.105_{-0.024}^{+0.058}$ M$_\odot$, $1.709_{-0.015}^{+0.030}$ R$_\odot$, $8.4_{-0.1}^{+0.4}$ Gyr, and $0.242^{+0.006}_{-0.021}$, respectively. We have demonstrated that simultaneously fitting the helium glitch properties, oscillation frequencies, and spectroscopic observables yields a more accurate inference of the surface helium abundance and hence stellar age. A significant discrepancy between the observed extent of the helium ionization zone and that predicted by stellar models is identified and examined, underscoring potential limitations in the current modelling of stellar interiors. Our analysis confirms that the helium glitch originates from the region between the two stages of helium ionisation, i.e. from the $\Gamma_1$ peak, rather than from the second helium ionisation zone itself. Within the conventional formalism, this implies that the glitch analysis characterises the region located between the two helium ionisation zones.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13749" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The SPAr burning: proton captures powering carbon-oxygen shell mergers in massive stars</a><span class="id">[2509.13749]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Carbon-oxygen (C-O) shell mergers in massive stars play a crucial role in both nucleosynthesis and the final stages of stellar evolution. These convective-reactive events significantly alter the internal structure of the star shortly before core collapse. We investigate how the enhanced production of light particles (especially protons) during a C-O shell merger, relative to classical oxygen shell burning, affects the energy balance and evolution of the convective shell. We derive the budget for direct and reverse nucleosynthesis flows across all relevant nuclear reactions from stellar evolution models, and we assess the relative energy produced. We find that proton capture reactions on 32,34S, 31P, and 38Ar (SPAr) dominate the nuclear energy production in typical C-O shell mergers as predicted by 1D stellar models. Their combined energy output is approximately 400 times greater than that of C and O fusion under the same conditions. Our results highlight the critical importance of including these proton-capture reactions in simulations of convective-reactive burning. This work suggests that excluding their contribution can lead to inaccurate modeling of the dynamics and nucleosynthesis in advanced stellar evolutionary phases. Such results will need to be confirmed by new 1D stellar simulations and 3D hydrodynamics models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optical/infrared observations of the extraordinary GRB 250702B: a highly obscured afterglow in a massive galaxy consistent with multiple possible progenitors</a><span class="id">[2509.22784]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRB 250702B was the longest gamma-ray burst ever detected, with a duration that challenges standard collapsar models and suggests an exotic progenitor. We collected a rich set of optical and infrared follow-up observations of its rapidly fading afterglow using a suite of telescopes including the W. M. Keck Observatory, the Gemini telescopes, the Magellan Baade Telescope, the Victor M. Blanco 4-meter telescope, and the Fraunhofer Telescope at Wendelstein Observatory. Our analysis reveals that the afterglow emission is well described by forward shock emission from a highly obscured relativistic jet. Deep photometric observations of the host galaxy reveal a massive (10^10.66 solar masses), dusty, and extremely asymmetric system that is consistent with two galaxies undergoing a major merger. The galactocentric offset, host galaxy properties, and jet characteristics disfavor a jetted TDE around a supermassive black hole but do not definitively distinguish between competing progenitor scenarios. We find that the afterglow and host are consistent with a range of progenitors including an atypical collapsar, a merger between a helium star and a stellar mass black hole, the disruption of a star by a stellar mass compact object (micro-TDE), and the tidal disruption of a star by an off-nuclear intermediate mass black hole.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited: II.

Paradoxically, it has allowed one to explain and reproduce all halo properties found in cosmological simulations except their rotation, which remains to be understood. With the present two Papers we remedy this anomaly. In Paper I we derived the angular momentum (AM) of protohalos centered on triaxial peaks of suited scale, taking into account that, to leading order, their density profile is smooth and homogeneous. Here we use that result to derive the AM of these objects, accounting for the fact that their actual density profile is slightly outward decreasing and lumpy so that they do not collapse monolithically at once, but progressively from inside out, undergoing mergers during the process. By monitoring in detail their resulting mass and AM growth, we characterize the spin distribution of final halos and the precise mass and radial distribution of their inner mean specific AM. The results obtained explain and reproduce the rotational properties of simulated halos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mass-radius relationship and gravitational wave emission from magnetized spheroidal quark stars</a><span class="id">[2510.20459]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we investigate the structure and gravitational wave (GW) signatures of strongly magnetized, oblate spheroidal quark stars by employing an anisotropic equation of state (EoS) derived from the MIT Bag model, extended to include the effects of density-dependent strong magnetic fields and the resulting pressure anisotropy arising from the breaking of spatial symmetry. Both magnetized strange quark matter (MSQM) and magnetized color-flavor locked (MCFL) phases are examined within the framework of the $\gamma$-metric formalism, which captures the deviation from spherical symmetry. We compute the mass-radius relation, ellipticity, gravitational redshift, mass quadrupole moment and tidal deformability for representative bag constants of $\rm{65\,MeV/fm^3}$ and $\rm{75\,MeV/fm^3}$. Using the obtained quadrupole moments, we further estimate the continuous gravitational wave strain amplitude ($h_{0}$) for isolated deformed rotating quark stars.

Using photometric data from the TESS Full-Frame-Images we have performed a transit search for exoplanets with post-main sequence hosts to search for the imprints of these impacts on the giant planet population. We detect 130 short period planets and candidates, thirty-three of which are newly discovered candidates, from a sample of 456,941 post-main sequence stars spanning the evolutionary stages from the end of the main sequence to the bottom of the red giant branch. We measure an occurrence rate of $0.28 \pm 0.04$% for short period giant planets orbiting post-main sequence stars. We also measure occurrence rates for two stellar sub-populations, measuring values of $0.35 \pm 0.05$% for a sub-population representing the earliest stages of post-main sequence evolution and $0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$% for a sub-population of more evolved stars. We show that the giant planet occurrence rate decreases with increasing stellar evolution stage, with a larger occurrence rate decrease observed for shorter period planets. Our results are clear evidence that the population of short period giant planets is being sculpted by the post-main sequence evolution of the host stars, and we conclude that this is most likely through the destruction of these giant planets through the increased strength of planet-star tidal interactions resulting in the rapid tidal decay of the planets' orbits.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Study of Four nulling pulsars with FAST</a><span class="id">[2511.03150]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an analysis of 4 nulling pulsars with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST).

In this paper, we search for neutrinos from this failed supernova using data from Super-Kamiokande (SK). Based on the estimated time of black hole formation inferred from optical and infrared observations, we define a search window for neutrino events in the SK data. Using this window, we develop a dedicated analysis method for failed supernovae and apply it to M31-2014-DS1, by conducting a cluster search using the timing and energy information of candidate events. No significant neutrino excess is observed within the search region. Consequently, we place an upper limit on the electron antineutrino luminosity from M31-2014-DS1 and discuss its implications for various failed SN models and their neutrino emission characteristics. Despite the 18 MeV threshold adopted to suppress backgrounds, the search remains sufficiently sensitive to constrain the Shen-TM1 EOS, yielding a 90% confidence level upper limit of 1.76 \times 10^{53} erg on the electron antineutrino luminosity, slightly above the expected value of 1.35 \times 10^{53} erg.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospects for Probing Sub-GeV Leptophilic Dark Matter with the Future VLAST</a><span class="id">[2505.05359]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The proposed Very Large Area Space Telescope (VLAST), with its expected unprecedented sensitivity in the MeV-GeV range, can also address the longstanding &quot;MeV Gap&quot; in gamma-ray observations.

In particular, we focus on the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which imposes an upper bound on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves predicted by large-field inflation scenarios. This provides a striking contrast with the well-known Lyth bound, which yields a lower bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such models. The two bounds thus play complementary roles in assessing the viability of inflationary scenarios. We demonstrate that, for certain representative large-field inflation models, the Swampland Distance Conjecture alone can impose more stringent upper limits on the tensor-toscalar ratio than current observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background. These findings highlight the utility of Swampland criteria as a theoretical discriminator among competing inflationary models, independent of empirical data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nuclear chiral density wave in neutron stars?</a><span class="id">[2509.10135]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Anisotropic phases potentially play a role in the internal composition of neutron stars, the main laboratory for the phase structure of QCD at high baryon densities.

The ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements derived from GPS receivers covering the Antarctic region are used for probing the electron density perturbations during these events. Auroral precipitation maps are shown to illustrate the locations of the GPS stations relative to particle precipitation. SuperDARN maps are shown to understand the effects of plasma convection over these locations. Correlation between the enhanced TEC observations with the auroral precipitation (R $\sim$ 0.31) and the plasma convection (R $\sim$ 0.88) reveals that the latter is more responsible for causing significant enhancements in the diurnal maximum values of TEC over the Antarctic region in comparison to the former. Therefore, this work shows correlation studies between two physical processes and ionospheric density enhancements over the under-explored south polar region under strong levels of geomagnetic activity during 2023.</p></div></details></article></body>
