Both exhibit transient radio emission beginning shortly after optical discovery and persisting for several years. For AT 2020zso, we identify two distinct radio flares. The first arises soon after the optical peak, reaching a maximum $\sim1$ year post-discovery before fading. The second flare appears $\sim800$ days after discovery and results in the brief presence of two distinct components in the radio spectra, providing strong evidence for physically separate outflows. Both flares are consistent with non-relativistic outflows, with velocities $v\approx0.1-0.2c$ and energies $E\sim10^{49}$ erg, propagating through a Bondi-like circumnuclear medium. Our analysis supports a scenario in which the first outflow is accretion-driven, launched while the TDE disk is accreting at a relatively high Eddington fraction, whereas the second outflow is associated with a transition to an advection-dominated accretion flow. In contrast, the radio emission from AT 2021sdu is best explained by a slower ($v\approx0.03c$), less energetic outflow ($E\sim10^{48}$ erg), combined with diffuse, non-variable host emission that becomes dominant $\sim500$ days after discovery. Assuming free expansion, we infer an outflow launch date preceding the optical discovery date. This suggests that the outflow may originate from either the unbound stellar debris ejected during disruption or, alternatively, from a decelerating outflow. Our findings demonstrate the diversity of outflow properties in TDEs and highlight the observational challenges of interpreting late-time radio variability in the presence of host galaxy contamination.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Orbital Constraints for YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B from High-Precision Astrometry and Planetary Radial Velocities</a><span class="id">[2509.14321]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new VLTI/GRAVITY astrometry and updated orbit fits for the directly imaged companions YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B, substellar objects straddling the planet-brown dwarf boundary. Using high-precision astrometry, radial velocity (RV) data, and proper motions, we derive revised orbital parameters with orbitize! arXiv:1910.01756 . For YSES 1 b, the inclusion of GRAVITY astrometry and a relative radial velocity measurement from arXiv:2409.16660 overcomes the traditional challenge of constraining eccentricities for distant companions, enabling the first orbit fit and yielding a constrained eccentricity of 0.44 (0.20). This represents the first full orbit fit for the system. Additionally, we calculate a median line-of-sight stellar obliquity of 12 (+11, -8) degrees, providing further insight into the system's dynamical architecture. For HR 2562 B, our analysis agrees with arXiv:2302.04893 , confirming a low-eccentricity orbit (0.34 (0.20)) and an inclination of 87 (1) degrees. We find HR 2562 B's orbit to be nearly coplanar with the debris disk, with a mutual inclination of 3.7 (0.3) degrees. For both YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B the lower eccentricities favor an in situ formation scenario over extreme scattering or cloud fragmentation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the limits of cosmological information from the Lyman-$α$ forest 2-point correlation functions</a><span class="id">[2509.14322]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The standard cosmological analysis with the Ly$\alpha$ forest relies on a continuum fitting procedure that suppresses information on large scales and distorts the three-dimensional correlation function on all scales. In this work, we present the first cosmological forecasts without continuum fitting distortion in the Ly$\alpha$ forest, focusing on the recovery of large-scale information. Using idealized synthetic data, we compare the constraining power of the full shape of the Ly$\alpha$ forest auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with quasars using the baseline continuum fitting analysis versus the true continuum. We find that knowledge of the true continuum enables a $\sim10\%$ reduction in uncertainties on the Alcock-Paczyński (AP) parameter and the matter density, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. We also explore the impact of large-scale information by extending the analysis up to separations of $240\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ along and across the line of sight. The combination of these analysis choices can recover significant large-scale information, yielding up to a $\sim15\%$ improvement in AP constraints. This improvement is analogous to extending the Ly$\alpha$ forest survey area by $\sim40\%$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pbhstat: A Python package for calculating the primordial black hole abundance</a><span class="id">[2509.14326]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present pbhstat, a publicly available Python package designed to compute the mass function and total abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) from a given primordial power spectrum.

As a consequence of the encounter, both the X-ray and radio emission from the gas are expected to be enhanced by shocks and turbulence, facilitating their detection. PSZ2 G279.79+39.09 is likely an off-axis merging system at $z = 0.29$, with its two main components observed shortly after pericenter passage. In this paper, we investigate the presence of diffuse radio emission in this system. We observed the cluster pair with the MeerKAT UHF band (544-1088 MHz) for 7.5 h and uGMRT band 3 (300-500 MHz) for 8 h. These are the first targeted radio observations of this system. We discover diffuse synchrotron emission in the system, with indication of enhanced emission in the region bridging the cluster pair. The detection is based on MeerKAT UHF data, while uGMRT band 3 observations do not allow us to derive a stringent limit on the spectral index of the source. This emission is likely generated by the turbulence injected in the early stage after the cluster-cluster encounter. However, the study of its physical properties is limited by the current data. As other systems with multiple cluster components studied in recent years, this cluster pair represents an appealing target to probe nonthermal phenomena beyond the well-studied denser regions of the intracluster medium. While we report a new detection, our analysis highlights the need for multi-band observations to fully understand these sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14465" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A multiwavelength study of the new Galactic center black hole candidate MAXI J1744-294</a><span class="id">[2509.14465]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For the first time in nearly a decade, a new, bright transient was detected in the central parsec (pc) of the Galaxy. MAXI J1744-294 was never observed in outburst prior to January 2025. We present the results of a broadband, multi-wavelength study of this enigmatic source, including data from the NuSTAR, Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NICER X-ray telescopes, as well as complementary radio and near-infrared observations. We find that MAXI J1744-294 remained in the bright/soft state throughout the first months of 2025. Spectral hardening was observed in April 2025, followed by a decline in flux. Based on the spectral and temporal characteristics of the source, we identify MAXI J1744-294 as a candidate black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) $-$ the fourth candidate BH transient discovered within a (projected) distance of one pc from the Galactic supermassive black hole Sgr A*. This discovery provides further evidence for a cusp of BH-LMXBs in the central pc of our Galaxy, as argued for in previous observational work and suggested by analytical and theoretical work. Our multi wavelength study, involving a complementary range of observatories and spanning different outburst states, can serve as a model for future time domain astrophysics research.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Detection of X-ray Polarization and Its Short-term Increase Pre- and Post-Eclipse in HMXB 4U 1700-377</a><span class="id">[2509.14494]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the first statistically significant detection of X-ray polarization from the high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) 4U 1700-377, observed using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). A polarization degree exceeding 10% was detected above 5 keV, placing it among the highest polarization observed in HMXBs to date. The observation was conducted over a full orbital period of the binary system, during which several sporadic and instantaneous flares were detected. We identify a clear correlation between the polarization degree and orbital phase, with the highest polarization occurring just before and after the eclipse, reaching over 20% for a few tens of ks. These results suggest that the scattering medium responsible for the observed polarization is spatially localized between the compact object and the O-type companion star, likely created by large-scale inhomogeneities in the stellar wind and its interaction with the compact star's emission. We also explore the roles of disk winds and orbital reflection in the observed polarization variability. While both mechanisms contribute to the polarization, the substantial increase in polarization before and after the eclipse cannot be fully explained by these models alone, suggesting that the involvement of additional factors. The properties of the X-ray polarization observed by IXPE provide new insights into the accretion processes, X-ray emission, and wind structure in 4U 1700-377, advancing our understanding of their complex environments and the nature of the compact objects within.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14539" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infall and Disk Processes - the Message from Meteorites</a><span class="id">[2509.14539]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>How do planetary systems, in general, and our own Solar System (SS), in particular, form? In conjunction, Astronomy and Isotope Cosmochemistry provide us with powerful tools to answer this age-old question. In this contribution, we review recent advances in our understanding of circumstellar disk evolution, including infall and disk processes, as explored through astrophysical models and nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies of SS materials. Astronomically, filamentary structures and anisotropy are observed across the dynamic range of star formation and disk substructures are found to be ubiquitous, highlighting how star- and planet-forming environments are far more complex and dynamic than previously thought. Isotopically, two decades of investigation of nucleosynthetic anomalies in bulk meteorites and refractory inclusions have produced a rich dataset, revealing the existence of pervasive heterogeneity in the early SS, both at the large- (i.e., NC-CC dichotomy) and fine-scale (i.e., trends within the NC group). Using an updated data compilation, we review the systematics and emerging structures of these anomalies as a function of their nucleosynthetic origin. We present the two main families of models - inheritance vs. unmixing - that have been proposed to explain the origin of the observed isotope heterogeneities, and discuss their respective implications for cloud infall and thermal processing in the disk. We also discuss how the extension of nucleosynthetic anomaly analyses to other chondritic components (Ameboid Olivine Aggregates, chondrules, matrix) has started to yield insights into transport, processing and mixing of dust in the disk. Limitations, open questions and key avenues for future work are presented in closing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14555" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stratified wind from a super-Eddington X-ray binary is slower than expected</a><span class="id">[2509.14555]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accretion discs in strong gravity ubiquitously produce winds, seen as blueshifted absorption lines in the X-ray band of both stellar mass X-ray binaries (black holes and neutron stars), and supermassive black holes. Some of the most powerful winds (termed Eddington winds) are expected to arise from systems where radiation pressure is sufficient to unbind material from the inner disc ($L\gtrsim L_{\rm Edd}$). These winds should be extremely fast and carry a large amount of kinetic power, which, when associated with supermassive black holes, would make them a prime contender for the feedback mechanism linking the growth of those black holes with their host galaxies. Here we show the XRISM Resolve spectrum of the Galactic neutron star X-ray binary, GX 13+1, which reveals one of the densest winds ever seen in absorption lines. This Compton-thick wind significantly attenuates the flux, making it appear faint, although it is intrinsically more luminous than usual ($L\gtrsim L_{\rm Edd}$). However, the wind is extremely slow, more consistent with the predictions of thermal-radiative winds launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disc, than with the expected Eddington wind driven by radiation pressure from the inner disc. This puts new constraints on the origin of winds from bright accretion flows in binaries, but also highlights the very different origin required for the ultrafast ($v\sim 0.3c$) winds seen in recent Resolve observations of a supermassive black hole at similarly high Eddington ratio.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The effect of collisional cooling of energetic electrons on radio emission from the centrifugal magnetospheres of magnetic hot stars</a><span class="id">[2509.14561]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper extends our previous study of gyro-emission by energetic electrons in the magnetospheres of rapidly rotating, magnetic massive stars, through a quantitative analysis of the role of Coulomb collisions with thermal electrons from stellar wind material trapped within the centrifugal magnetosphere (CM). For a dipolar field with aligned magnetic and rotational axes, we show that both gyro-cooling along magnetic loops and Coulomb cooling in the CM layer have nearly the same dependence on the magnitude and radial variation of magnetic field, implying that their ratio is a global parameter that is largely independent of the field. Analytic analysis shows that, for electrons introduced near the CM layer around a magnetic loop apex, collisional cooling is more important for electrons with high pitch angle, while more field-aligned electrons cool by gyro-emission near their mirror point close to the loop base. Numerical models that assume a gyrotropic initial deposition with a gaussian distribution in both radius and loop co-latitude show the residual gyro-emission is generally strongest near the loop base, with highly relativistic electrons suffering much lower collisional losses than lower-energy electrons that are only mildly relativistic. Finally, we briefly discuss the potential applicability of this formalism to magnetic ultracool dwarfs, for which VLBI observations indicate incoherent radio emission to be concentrated around the magnetic equator, in contrast to our predictions here for magnetic hot stars. We suggest that this difference could be attributed to either a lower ambient density of thermal electrons, or more highly relativistic non-thermal electrons, both of which would reduce the relative importance of the collisional cooling explored here.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Stochastic Dissipation Model for the Steady State Neutrino and Multi-Wavelength Emission of TXS 0506+056</a><span class="id">[2509.14587]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The blazar TXS 0506+056 has been suggested to be a potential high-energy neutrino source thanks to the observations of IceCube, which found outburst-like neutrino emissions during 2014-2015 and 2017 in the transient emission search, and a $3.5\sigma$ local significance in a 10-year time-integrated search. The conventional one-zone jet model cannot explain the observed neutrino flux during outbursts due to the constraint from the X-ray flux, leading to proposals of multi-zone models (e.g. two-zone model) with multiple radiation zones. In literature, it has been shown that multi-zone models may consistently explain the high-state neutrino emission and the multi-wavelength emission of TXS 0506+056, while the quasi-steady-state long-term emission has not been well studied. In this work, we investigate a physically based model for the quasi-steady-state neutrino and electromagnetic radiation under the same framework, and successfully reproduce the multi-messenger emission of TXS 0506+056.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Production Mechanism of the High-energy Emission Line in the Brightest Cosmic Burst</a><span class="id">[2509.14715]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As a characteristic feature of the spectrum, the emission line carries critical information on the underlying physics of the radiation. After extensive efforts in decades, the first high-significant detection of a series of emission lines evolving from 37 MeV to 6 MeV has been detected in the ever-bright gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A. However, the physical mechanism of the entire evolutionary trend of the lines remains elusive. To provide a self-consistent interpretation, we propose a novel scenario in which the photons of the line undergo a radiation transfer process called down-Comptonization after generation by the electron–positron pair annihilation. By incorporating the gamma-ray burst dynamical evolution, we systematically reproduce the observed evolution of the central energy, width, and flux of the emission line and further impose stringent constraints on the production of high-energy emission lines in general. Our study provides a new direction to the research of extreme cosmic bursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing initial isocurvature perturbation with 21cm one-point statistics</a><span class="id">[2509.14751]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Isocurvature perturbations expected from multi-field inflation models can leave unique signatures in the early Universe, but remain weakly constrained, especially on small scales. In this work, we investigate the constraining power of one-point statistics (variance and skewness) of the 21cm brightness temperature during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization, using semi-numerical simulations from 21cmFAST. We model both adiabatic and cold dark matter isocurvature modes, exploring their impact on the matter power spectrum, the timing of structure formation, and the evolution of neutral hydrogen. By varying astrophysical parameters as well as isocurvature fraction and spectral index, we quantify their respective effects on the 21cm power spectrum and on one-point statistics. Our results show that while variance is highly sensitive to the timing of cosmic events and provides tight constraints on isocurvature parameters, skewness is more strongly affected by astrophysical uncertainties and observational noise. Incorporating realistic instrumental noise based on SKA configurations, we perform a Fisher analysis and demonstrate that 21cm variance measurements can constrain the isocurvature fraction down to the sub-percent level, though a strong degeneracy with the spectral index remains. We discuss the importance of complementary probes, such as the 21cm forest and galaxy surveys, to break these parameter degeneracies. Our findings highlight the power of 21cm one-point statistics as robust and independent tools for probing early-Universe physics beyond what is accessible with traditional power spectrum analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14753" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lorentz invariance violation in the extragalactic propagation of ultra-high energy photons and in the development of showers in the Earth crust and atmosphere</a><span class="id">[2509.14753]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the effects of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on photon interactions, considering both intergalactic propagation (Breit-Wheeler process) and atmospheric interactions (Bethe-Heitler process). By incorporating LIV into the theoretical framework, we analyze how it modifies key quantities such as the cross section, threshold energy, and mean free path of photons traveling through intergalactic space. In addition, we study its impact on extensive air showers initiated by high-energy photons, demonstrating that LIV can alter the cross section of the primary interaction in the atmosphere. Additionally, we also test the photon interactions in the Earth crust, to evaluate if they can induce upward-going showers. Our results highlight the necessity of accounting for both propagation effects in intergalactic space and interactions in the atmosphere when evaluating LIV signatures. Even small deviations from Lorentz invariance can lead to measurable changes in astroparticle propagation and photon dynamics, offering new opportunities to test quantum gravity theories through high-energy astrophysical observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sibling Sub-Neptunes Around Sibling M Dwarfs: TOI-521 and TOI-912</a><span class="id">[2509.14782]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sub-Neptunes are absent in the Solar System, yet they are commonly found in our Galaxy. They challenge the internal structure models and prompt investigation on their formation, evolution, and atmospheres. We report the characterisation of new sub-Neptunes orbiting two similar M dwarfs, TOI-521 (T_eff=3544 K), and TOI-912 (T_eff=3572 K). Both stars host a candidate identified by TESS and are part of the THIRSTEE follow-up program, which aims at understanding the sub-Neptune population through precise characterisation studies on a population level. We analysed light curves, ground-based photometry and ESPRESSO, HARPS and IRD RVs to infer precise orbital and physical parameters. The two stars host nearly identical planets in terms of mass and radius. TOI-521 b is a transiting sub-Neptune in a 1.5-d orbit with radius and mass of R=1.98+/-0.14 R_e and M=5.3+/-1.0 M_e respectively. Moreover, we identified an additional candidate at 20.3 d, with a minimum mass of Msini=10.7+/-2.4 M_e currently not detected to transit. Similarly, TOI-912 b is a 4.7-d sub-Neptune with R=1.93+/-0.13 R_e and M=5.1+/-0.5 M_e. Interestingly, TOI-912 b likely has an unusually high eccentricity (e=0.58+/-0.02), and it is probably undergoing strong tidal dissipation. If such eccentricity is confirmed, it would make it one of the most eccentric sub-Neptunes known to date. TOI-521 b and TOI-912 b have very similar densities (4 g/cm^3) and they lie in the degenerate region of the mass-radius diagram where different compositions are plausible, including a volatile-rich composition, or a rocky core surrounded by a H-He envelope. Our sample supports the division of sub-Neptunes into two distinct populations divided by a density gap. Both planets are interesting targets for atmospheric follow-up in the context of understanding the temperature-atmospheric feature trend that starts to emerge thanks to JWST observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for Lorentz invariance violation with artificial neural networks</a><span class="id">[2509.14818]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) can have multiple consequences on very-high energy gamma rays' emission, propagation, and detection, such as energy-dependent photon group velocity, photon instability, vacuum birefringence, and modified electromagnetic interaction.

This framework provides a unified description of dark matter and dark energy, transitioning naturally from a matter-dominated phase at early times to a negative-pressure dark-energy phase at late times. In this scalar-field formulation, the GCG and MCG models are naturally applicable to both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. Extending this approach, we develop a systematic method to obtain a class of integrable scalar-field cosmological models. In this study, we use this method to construct a new scalar-field altered Chaplygin gas (ACG) model. To investigate the viability of Chaplygin-type models, we perform a likelihood analysis using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation together with Cepheid-calibrated distances. We examine four models, $\Lambda$CDM, GCG, MCG, and ACG, obtaining posterior constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$, the present-day effective equation of state $\omega_0$, the transition redshift $z^\star$, and the cosmic age $t_0$. With the Cepheid calibration fixing the absolute distance scale, the inferred $H_{0}$ remains nearly model-independent. The Chaplygin-type models predict an earlier onset of cosmic acceleration than $\Lambda$CDM and give a broader range for the inferred age of the Universe, reflecting their greater flexibility in late-time expansion histories. Among them, the ACG model provides tighter parameter constraints, while the GCG and MCG models produce broader posteriors due to parameter degeneracies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14867" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studying SNR-MC interactions as galactic PeVatrons in the era of CTAO and ASTRI Mini-Array</a><span class="id">[2509.14867]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) are widely recognized as key accelerators of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), supported by the detection of the characteristic pion bump in the gamma-ray spectra of several SNRs. However, the recent observation of ultra-high-energy (UHE, greater than 100 TeV) gamma-rays by LHAASO from sources such as W51 region challenges standard models, which predict CR acceleration up to PeV energies only during the early (  100 year) phase of SNR evolution. Given the older age of known SNRs, alternative mechanisms - such as the interaction of runaway CRs with nearby molecular clouds (MCs) - have been proposed to explain the persistent UHE emission. In this study, we focus on the W51 complex, particularly the W51C-B region, as a promising site for investigating SNR-MC interactions. Simulated observations with the CTAO and the ASTRI Mini-Array are presented to demonstrate their crucial role in bridging the energy gap between Fermi-LAT and LHAASO, especially in the 0.3-100 TeV range. Their improved angular resolution will also help disentangle emission components from the interaction zone and nearby sources. Our theoretical modelling suggests that accelerated particles at the shock can account for the radio and GeV data, while UHE emission could be best explained by the combined contribution from both acceleration and adiabatic compression of cloud material at the SNR-MC interface.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining gamma-ray burst parameters with the first ultra-high energy neutrino event KM3-230213A</a><span class="id">[2509.14895]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: The detection of the highest energy neutrino observed to date by KM3NeT, with an estimated energy of 220 PeV, opens up new possibilities for the study and identification of the astrophysical sources responsible for a diffuse flux of such ultra-high-energy neutrinos, among which gamma-ray bursts are longstanding candidates. Aims: Based on the event KM3-230213A, we derive constraints on the baryon loading and density of the surrounding environment in models of blastwaves in long-duration gamma-ray bursts. Methods: We compute the diffuse flux from gamma-ray burst blastwaves, either expanding in a constant density interstellar medium or developing in a radially decreasing density of a wind-like environment surrounding the gamma-ray burst progenitor star, by taking into account the expected neutrino spectra and luminosity function. We use a Poisson likelihood method to constrain the blastwave model parameters by calculating the expected number of neutrino events within the 90% confidence level energy range of KM3-230213A and by using the joint exposure of KM3NeT/ARCA, IceCube and Pierre Auger. Results: We constrain the baryon loading to be $\leq \{392, 131, 39, 13\}$ at 90% confidence level, which is inversely proportional to a varying interstellar medium particle density of $\{1, 3, 10, 30\}$ cm$^{-3}$. In the wind-like environment case, the baryon loading is $\leq \{20, 50, 100\}$ at 90% confidence level, which is proportional to the sixth power of a varying density parameter of $\{0.05, 0.06, 0.07\}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic activity and differential rotation of HIP12653</a><span class="id">[2509.14902]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a spectroscopic and photometric study of HIP12653 to investigate its magnetic cycle and differential rotation. Using HARPS archival spectra matched with MARCS-AMBER theoretical templates, we derive the stellar parameters (Teff, logg, FeH, and vsini) of the target. The S-index, an activity indicator based on the emission of the CaII H&amp;K lines, is fitted to determine the magnetic cycle and rotation periods. We refine the magnetic cycle period to 5799.20 \pm 0.88 d and suggest the existence of a secondary, shorter cycle of 674.6922 \pm 0.0098 d, making HIP12653 the youngest star known to exhibit such a short activity cycle. During the minimum activity phase, a rotation period of 4.8 d is estimated. This is notably different from the 7-day period obtained when measurements during minimum activity are excluded, suggesting that these two periods are rotation periods at different latitudes. To explore this hypothesis, we introduce a novel light curve fitting method that incorporates multiple harmonics to model different spot configurations. Applied to synthetic light curves, the method recovers at least two rotation periods close to the true input values in 92.1% of cases. The inferred rotation shear shows a median deviation of 0.0011 \pm 0.0003 and a standard deviation of 0.0177 \pm 0.0002 from the true value. Applying this approach to TESS photometric data from 2018 to 2023, we detect three distinct rotation periods, 4.8 d, 5.7 d, and 7.7 d, (along with a signal at 3.75 d interpreted as its first harmonic), consistent with spots located at different latitudes. Assuming a solar-like differential rotation, we estimate an inclination of 34.0 \pm 1.8^\circ and a rotational shear of \alpha = 0.38 \pm 0.01. These results confirm the 4.8-d period and demonstrate that differential rotation can be constrained by tracking rotation period changes across different phases of the magnetic cycle.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14928" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radial pulsation runaway in massive red supergiants in late evolutionary stage and implications to hydrogen-rich supernovae</a><span class="id">[2509.14928]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Performing a series of hydrodynamic stellar evolutionary simulations with \textsc{Mesa} (Module for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), we investigate the excitation and growth of radial pulsations of massive red supergiants (RSGs) with the initial mass range of $M_\mathrm{ini}=13$–$18\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We show that strong radial pulsations develop in the hydrogen-rich envelope in their late evolutionary stages, and eventually the surface radial velocity exceeds the escape velocity for higher-mass models. On the other hand, lower-mass models exhibit more moderate pulsations with finite velocity amplitudes and are expected to keep massive hydrogen-rich envelopes when they evolve toward the gravitational collapse of the iron core. While the latter group ends up as a familiar transient population of exploding RSGs, i.e., type IIP supernovae (SNe), the former group may expel a part of their envelopes and explode as different transients population. We investigate how the energy of the oscillating envelope is dissipated and released as radiation. We also empirically determine the condition for the pulsation-driven mass ejection in terms of the luminosity-to-mass ratio, $L/M&gt;10^{3.9}\mathrm{L}_\odot/\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The corresponding luminosity threshold for the explored mass range may explain the observationally inferred constraints on type IIP SN progenitors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No evidence for $H_0$ anisotropy from Tully-Fisher or supernova distances</a><span class="id">[2509.14997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Claims of anisotropy in the Hubble constant have been made based on direct distance tracers such as Tully-Fisher galaxies and Type Ia supernovae.

Our forward-modelling framework jointly calibrates the distance relation, marginalises over distances, and accounts for peculiar velocities using a linear-theory reconstruction. We compare the anisotropic and isotropic model using the Bayesian evidence. In the CosmicFlows-4 sample, we infer a zero-point dipole of amplitude $0.087 \pm 0.019$ mag, or $4.1\pm0.9$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. This is consistent with previous estimates but at higher significance: model comparison yields odds of $877\!:\!1$ in favour of including the zero-point dipole. In Pantheon+ we infer zero-point dipole amplitude of $0.049 \pm 0.013$ mag, or $2.3\pm 0.6$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. However, by allowing for a radially varying velocity dipole, we show that the anisotropic model captures local flow features (or possibly systematics) in the data rather than an actual linearly growing effective bulk flow caused by anisotropy in the zero-point or expansion rate. Inferring a more general bulk flow curve we find results fully consistent with expectations from the standard cosmological model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining Cosmology with Double-Source-Plane Strong Gravitational Lenses From the AGEL Survey</a><span class="id">[2509.15012]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Double-source-plane strong gravitational lenses (DSPLs), with two sources at different redshifts, are independent cosmological probes of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m}$.

From the joint posterior of $w$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ in the flat $w$CDM cosmology, we extract the following median values and 1$\sigma$ uncertainties: $w = -1.52^{+0.49}_{-0.33}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.192^{+0.305}_{-0.131}$ from AGEL0353 alone. Combining our measurements with two previously analyzed DSPLs, we present the joint constraint on these parameters from a sample of three, the largest galaxy-scale DSPL sample used for cosmological measurement to date. The combined precision of $w$ from three DSPLs is higher by 15% over AGEL0353 alone. Combining DSPL and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements improves the precision of $w$ from CMB-only constraints by 39%, demonstrating the complementarity of DSPLs with the CMB. Despite their promising constraining power, DSPLs are limited by sample size, with only a handful discovered so far. Although ongoing and near-future wide-area sky surveys will increase the number of known DSPLs by up to two orders of magnitude, these systems will still require dedicated high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic follow-ups like those presented in this paper.

In this work, we employ the Trans-Planckian Censorship Criterion (TCC) conjecture to test the viability of the coasting cosmology and propose an entropic dark energy (EDE) model within this framework. By applying the holographic principle to constrain the dark energy density and adopting the Bekenstein entropy and Tsallis entropy as the constraining entropies of the system, we find that, in a holographic coasting cosmological framework where dark energy and dark matter evolve independently, the Tsallis entropy satisfies certain general assumptions better than the Bekenstein entropy. Thus, there may be a fundamental relationship between Tsallis entropy and dark energy. We utilize observational data from Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) to constrain EDE model. The optimal Tsallis parameter obtained aligns well with theoretical expectations. To evaluate the model's fit to the observed data, we calculate the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Kullback Information Criterion (KIC), and compare these metrics with those derived from $\Lambda$CDM, under which the model shows some improvement.

We identify and classify variable white dwarfs using Gaia DR3 data and Zwicky Transient Facility DR23 observations. The objective is to construct a catalogue of pulsating white dwarf candidates with robust selection criteria. We define a new sample of candidate variable white dwarfs using Gaia DR3 astrometric and photometric data. We cross-match this sample with the ZTF DR23 catalogue and apply a multiband Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis to detect periodic variability. We then use the OPTICS unsupervised clustering algorithm to to group and classify the confirmed periodic stars. We identify 1423 variable white dwarfs candidates from Gaia DR3, with 864 having ZTF time series. 141 present significant periodicity. We classify these objects into known categories, including ZZ Ceti stars, GW Vir, V777 Her, and white dwarf-main sequence binaries. Our analysis yields several periodic stars, including three ZZ Ceti, 15 GW Vir, one V777 Her, and 24 WD-MS binaries. Furthermore, it reveals a significant population of potentialy variable stars, though without confirmed periodicity. Finally we publish our catalogue of candidate variable white dwarfs including variability status, periodicity, and classification information for the 864 sources with ZTF time series, 519 of them newly identified (including 83 new periodic stars).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parameterizing quasi-quintessence and quasi-phantom fields without the nearly flat potential approximation</a><span class="id">[2509.15146]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>An alternative dark energy description based on a generalized K-essence scenario is here explored. In particular, we consider a \emph{quasi-quintessence} and/or \emph{quasi-phantom} field, whose pressure does not depend on the kinetic energy, firstly discussed in the context of the cosmological constant problem. In so doing, we fix the background evolution and investigate the main observational signatures of its corresponding fluid-like representation. The corresponding scalar field can be parameterized independently from the potential form and without imposing the condition $\omega \sim -1$ used for quintessence and phantom fields. Additionally, we constrain the model parameters by performing Monte-Carlo Markov chain simulations through the adoption of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and perform separated analyses, employing different data catalogs. More precisely, as data sets we employ observational Hubble data, type Ia supernovae and the second data release from the DESI Collaboration, namely DESI DR2. We define a hierarchy among analyses and, precisely, in the first we adopt all three samples, while the second excludes the DESI data points, with the aim of facing its effect on corresponding bounds. Our findings suggest that the \emph{quasi-quintessence} scenario prefers Planck's value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, but suggesting that, when the DESI sample is excluded from our computations, $\omega_0$ enters the phantom regime, although still compatible at $1$-$\sigma$ confidence level with a cosmological constant. Remarkably, these results appear in tension than those found for a standard quintessence, explored within the context of the recent DESI release, likely indicating that the DESI data may furnish inconclusive results depending on the kind of scalar field involved into the computation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling TeV halos among unidentified extended TeV sources</a><span class="id">[2509.15168]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In recent years, the number of known sources emitting very- and ultra-high-energy gamma-rays has increased significantly thanks to facilities such as LHAASO and HAWC.

Some of these unidentified extended sources may be the result of the diffusion of leptons accelerated by the pulsar itself or in its nebula to energies exceeding 50 TeV. This new class of sources, called TeV halos, is characterized by a peculiar radial profile that, if properly resolved, is key to distinguishing them from other TeV sources that are associated with a pulsar, such as supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae. In this contribution, we consider all the pulsars which are spatially coincident with an unidentified extended TeV source, in order to quantify whether its spin-down power, age and distance allow the pulsar to produce a TeV halo with the observed flux and extension.

Now, with the spatial and spectral resolution of JWST/MIRI Medium-Resolution Spectrograph, we can observe and characterize this reservoir for wide-orbit planetary-mass companions for the first time. We present the mid-infrared spectrum from the CPD surrounding the young companion CT Cha b. The data show a carbon-rich chemistry with seven carbon-bearing molecules (up to C$_6$H$_6$) and one isotopologue detected and indicate a high gaseous C/O$&gt;$1 that is in contrast with the elemental abundance ratios typically measured in directly imaged gas giant atmospheres. This carbon-rich chemistry is also in stark contrast to the spectrum of the disk surrounding the host star, CT Cha A, which shows no carbon-bearing molecules. This difference in disk chemistry between the host disk and its companion indicates rapid, divergent chemical evolution on $\sim$million-year timescales. Nonetheless, the chemical properties of the CPD follow trends observed in isolated objects, where disks transition from an oxygen-rich to carbon-rich composition with decreasing host mass. Our results provide the first direct insight into the chemical and physical properties of material being accreted onto a gas giant analogue and into its potential moon system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15223" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parameter sensitivity of cosmic pairwise velocities in the non-linear regime of structure formation</a><span class="id">[2509.15223]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The peculiar velocities of dark matter tracers drive the growth of cosmic structures, providing a sensitive test of cosmological models and strengthening constraints on the nature of dark energy.

Using N-body dark matter-only simulations, we measure $v_{12}$ for pair separations up to 50 $h^{-1}$Mpc and model it by solving the pair conservation equation for a self-gravitating particle system, along with various prescriptions of the nonlinear matter power spectrum.

Our parameter inference analysis using MCMC shows sub-11% agreement with simulation data, with notable degeneracies, particularly between $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and $\sigma_8$. We further compute the stable clustering crossing scale across redshifts $z=0$, $0.5$, and $1$, assessing its dependence on cosmology. Among the tested power spectrum modeling approaches, we find that the CSSTEmu emulator provides the most accurate predictions, with deviations below 5% for $r &gt; 10$ $h^{-1}$Mpc at $z=0.5$.

Additionally, our results illustrate how collider experiments, when interpreted jointly with relic density constraints, can provide indirect hints of the Universe's thermal history, offering potential insights into the reheating temperature and the dynamics preceding Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Projective Plane Subdivision Method For Initial Orbit Determination</a><span class="id">[2509.14397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Initial Orbit Determination (IOD) is the classical problem of estimating the orbit of a body in space without any presumed information about the orbit.

It will be shown that when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of the magnetic field $\vec{B}$, there is a related field that evolves ideally. This field is $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (m_e/n e^2) \vec{j} \right)$ with $m_e$ the electron mass, $n$ the electron number density, and $\vec{j}$ the current density. Although the magnetic field is modified from its ideal evolution form by the electron inertia, the effect on particle trajectories, even electron trajectories, is small unless the current lies in thin sheets, which make $\vec{j}$ extremely large. The field $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ is closely related to Voigt normalized magnetic field, which is defined by a Laplacian smoothing of $\vec{B}$. The difference between $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ and $\vec{B}$ involves the relativistically invariant four-space Laplacian acting on $\vec{B}$ with a $c/\omega_{pe}$ smoothing distance; $\omega_{pe}$ is the plasma frequency.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14570" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Systematic Bayesian Evaluation of Resonance Parameters in 19Ne for the 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne and 18F(p,alpha)15O Reactions</a><span class="id">[2509.14570]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive evaluation of the nuclear structure properties of 19Ne using a novel and rigorous Bayesian statistical framework.

The effective potential for null geodesics exhibits a single unstable maximum corresponding to the photon sphere, and we study photon orbits classified according to the critical impact parameter into capture, escape, and unstable circular trajectories. Our analysis shows that the deflection angle decreases with increasing model parameter $(\alpha)$, resulting in weaker light bending compared to the Schwarzschild case. In addition, we examine the angular diameter of the black hole shadow as measured by a static observer, highlighting its dependence on the cosmological modification parameters.

Our semi-analytical method yields quantitative predictions for the axion-induced magnetic field near the Earth's surface, and we found that (i) at $m_{\rm a} \gtrsim 10^{-14}$ eV, the signal exhibits resonance structures aligned with Schumann resonances, and the magnetic field amplitude is especially enhanced at $m_{\rm a} \sim 3 \times 10^{-14}$ eV.

Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Refining the deep sub-barrier 12C+12C excitation function with STELLA</a><span class="id">[2509.14717]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Purpose: We have investigated the cross section around the lowest direct coincident gamma-particle measurements, where previously only limits could be established with the aim of obtaining a detailed description of the excitation function.

Conclusions: Our findings in the astrophysics RoI support reaction-rate models with a lower average S-factor trend, that deviates significantly from standard extrapolations between 2.2 MeV and 2.6 MeV, for stellar carbon burning simulations of up to 25 Msol stars. Based on our data, an overall increase of the S-factor at deep subbarrier energy cannot be confirmed. The extremely low ratio of the branching into the first excited state with proton over alpha emission of   2% at 3.23 MeV might indicate the presence of alpha cluster compound states in 24Mg.

We also introduce a novel formulation for calculating the Bayes factor for the F-statistic, enabling a quantitative assessment of its performance against standard full frequency-domain (FFD) Bayesian inference. Using the benchmark event GW150914, we demonstrate that the F-statistic method is not only approximately $70\%$ faster than FFD but is also statistically stable across different sampler configurations, with a log-Bayes factor between runs smaller than $0.1$. Furthermore, the F-statistic exhibits superior stability against changes in sampler configuration, yielding consistently lower Jensen-Shannon divergence values between analysis runs. While the F-statistic produces slightly broader constraints on some parameters, we argue this represents a more honest uncertainty quantification, particularly in high-dimensional parameter spaces with complex posterior structures.

The innumerable folds of this sheet in the inner regions of a galactic halo would appear on solar-system scales like an extremely large number of spatially overlapping streams of dark matter particles. Some of these streams may also receive amplified densities if dark matter undergoes enhanced clustering in the early Universe, as is the case for axions in the post-inflationary scenario. This ultra-fine-grained dark matter substructure is usually considered irrelevant and undetectable for most direct detection experiments, but for axion haloscopes, this may not be the case. We develop and explore several plausible models for the degree of fine-grained axion dark matter substructure so as to evaluate its impact on the detectability of axions. We find that not only is this substructure detectable in haloscope experiments, but that it may enhance the detectability of the axion if data is analysed with a high-enough frequency resolution. This conclusion motivates ongoing high-resolution analyses of axion data by haloscope collaborations, which have the potential to reveal evidence of the QCD axion even if their nominal experimental sensitivity does not reach the required level under the Standard Halo Model assumption.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heterotic Warm Inflation</a><span class="id">[2509.15125]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper we propose a two-field model of warm inflation motivated from a heterotic string construction.

This new variability pattern, which we name class $\psi$, is characterized by several periodic mini pulses superposed on another longer periodic pulse. The periods are around $\sim$130 seconds and $\sim$10 seconds for the main pulses and mini pulses respectively based on the analysis of power spectrum density (PSD) and step-wise filter correlation (SFC), where the SFC method has an advantage in finding the superimposed periodic components. The mini pulses become weak or disappear when the luminosity increases and the light curves change into the classical class $\kappa$. The class $\psi$ shows a softer spectrum with lower count rates compared to the class $\kappa$ during the main pulse.

We perform a Bayesian analysis of the cross-correlation data to constrain the model parameters characterizing the PBB spectrum. We find no evidence for a PBB-induced SGWB, with a Bayes factor of $0.03$ between the PBB and noise-only model, strongly favoring the noise-only hypothesis.

Compared with the result obtained in linear perturbation theory, it turns out that properly taking account of the $\delta\pi$ contribution is essential to reproduce the dip in the power spectrum. Namely, the curvature perturbation is proportional to a specific linear combination of $\delta\varphi$ and $\delta\pi$ at the linear order.

The cluster survey is conducted by the $eROSITA$ X-ray telescope aboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) space observatory. The cluster sample is X-ray-selected and optically confirmed with a negligibly low contamination rate ($\approx5%$). On a basis of individual clusters, the shear profiles of $96$ clusters are derived using the HSC Three-Year (HSC-Y3) weak-lensing data, while the BCG stellar masses of $101$ clusters are estimated using the SED template fitting to the HSC five-band ($grizY$) photometry. The observed X-ray photon count rate is used as the mass proxy, based on which individual halo masses are obtained at the given count rate in a population modelling while accounting for systematic uncertainties in the weak-lensing modelling through a simulation-calibrated weak-lensing mass-to-halo-mass relation. The count rate and BCG stellar mass relations are simultaneously constrained in a forward and population modelling. In agreement with the results based on the weak-lensing data from the DES and KiDS surveys, we obtain a count rate relation with a self-similar redshift scaling and a mass trend that is steeper than the self-similar prediction. Our results suggest that the BCG stellar mass at a fixed halo mass has remained stable with a moderate increase at a level of $\left(20\pm8\right)%$ since redshift $z\approx0.8$. This finding supports the picture of the “rapid-then-slow” BCG formation, where the majority of the stellar mass must have been assembled at much earlier cosmic time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reanalysis of Stage-III cosmic shear surveys: A comprehensive study of shear diagnostic tests</a><span class="id">[2505.03964]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In recent years, shear catalogs have been released by various Stage-III weak lensing surveys including the Kilo-Degree Survey, the Dark Energy Survey, and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program.

While there exists a generic set of tests that are designed to probe certain systematic effects, the implementations differ slightly across the individual surveys, making it difficult to make direct comparisons. In this paper, we use the TXPipe package to conduct a series of predefined diagnostic tests across three public shear catalogs – the 1,000 deg$^2$ KiDS-1000 shear catalog, the Year 3 DES-Y3 shear catalog, and the Year 3 HSC-Y3 shear catalog. We attempt to reproduce the published results when possible and perform key tests uniformly across the surveys. While all surveys pass most of the null tests in this study, we find two tests where some of the surveys fail. Namely, we find that when measuring the tangential ellipticity around bright and faint star samples, KiDS-1000 fails with a \chi^2$/dof of 121.1/16 and 257.7/16 for bins 4 and 5 for faint, weighted stars.

We assess the impacts on the $\Omega_{\rm m}$ - S$_{8}$ parameter space by comparing the posteriors of a simulated data vector with and without PSF contamination – we find negligible effects in all cases.

Validation using available CC measurements and forecasted redshift drift data from FAST, CHIME, SKA, and ELT demonstrates 1.9\% precision for optimal data combinations, yielding $H_0 = 66.26 \pm 1.26$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ while maintaining complete cosmological model independence. While no actual SL measurements currently exist, requiring us to rely on simulations for validation, our geometric constraints show superior resilience against sparse redshift coverage compared to Gaussian Process (GP) methods, which exhibit systematic biases and large uncertainties when datasets lack substantial overlap. This kinematic framework establishes geometric embedding as a robust tool for precision cosmological measurements, offering a fundamentally different approach to $H_0$ determination through pure observational analysis based on FLRW kinematic principles. The full potential of this method awaits implementation with real SL measurements from next-generation facilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospects for PBR detection of KM3-230213A-like events</a><span class="id">[2507.02246]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a scaled-down version of the Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) design, optimized to be flown as a payload on one of NASA's sub-orbital super pressure balloons circling the Earth above the southern oceans for a mission duration of more than 20 days. One of the main science objectives of PBR is to follow up astrophysical event alerts in search of neutrinos with very high energy ($10^8 \lesssim E_\nu /{\rm GeV} \lesssim 10^{10}$). Of particular interest for anticipated PBR observations, the KM3NeT Collaboration has recently reported the detection of the neutrino KM3-230213A with $10^{7.8} \lesssim E_\nu/{\rm GeV} \lesssim 10^{9.0}$. Such an unprecedented event is in tension with upper limits on the cosmic neutrino flux from IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory: for a diffuse isotropic neutrino flux there is a $3.5\sigma$ tension between KM3NeT and IceCube measurements, and about $2.6\sigma$ if the neutrino flux originates in transient sources. Therefore, if KM3-230213A was not beginner's luck, it becomes compelling to consider beyond Standard Model (BSM) possibilities which could lead to a signal at KM3NeT-ARCA but not at IceCube/Auger. We calculate the PBR horizon-range sensitivity to probe BSM physics compatible with observation at KM3NeT-ARCA and non-observation at IceCube/Auger. As an illustration, we consider a particular class of BSM physics models which has been described in the literature as a possible explanation of KM3-230213A.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Improving Air Shower Simulations by Tuning Pythia 8/Angantyr with Accelerator Data</a><span class="id">[2508.11458]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a combined analysis of the Pythia 8 event generator using accelerator data and evaluate its impact on air shower observables. Reliable simulations with event generators are essential for particle physics analyses, achievable through advanced tuning to experimental data. Pythia 8 has emerged as a promising high-energy interaction model for cosmic ray air shower simulations, offering well-documented parameter settings and a user-friendly interface to enable automatic tuning efforts. Using data from collider and fixed-target experiments, we first derive tunes for each domain separately, before tuning both domains simultaneously. To achieve this, we define a core set of observables and quantify their dependence on selected parameters. The tuning efforts are based on gradient descent and Bayesian methods, the latter providing a full uncertainty propagation of the parameters to the observables. Results for the impact of a combined analysis for the Pythia 8/Angantyr event generator on air shower observables, such as particle densities at ground level and energy deposit profiles, are presented.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18083" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GWTC-4.0: Population Properties of Merging Compact Binaries</a><span class="id">[2508.18083]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We detail the population properties of merging compact objects using 158 mergers from the cumulative Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0, which includes three types of binary mergers: binary neutron star, neutron star–black hole binary, and binary black hole mergers. We resolve multiple over- and under-densities in the black hole mass distribution: features persist at primary masses of $10\,M_\odot$ and $35\,M_\odot$ with a possible third feature at $\sim 20\,M_\odot$. These are departures from an otherwise power-law-like continuum that steepens above $35\,M_\odot$. Binary black holes with primary masses near $10\,M_\odot$ are more likely to have less massive secondaries, with a mass ratio distribution peaking at $q = 0.74^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$, potentially a signature of stable mass transfer during binary evolution. Black hole spins are inferred to be non-extremal, with 90\% of black holes having $\chi &lt; 0.57$, and preferentially aligned with binary orbits, implying many merging binaries form in isolation. However, we find a significant fraction, 0.24–0.42, of binaries have negative effective inspiral spins, suggesting many could be formed dynamically in gas-free environments. We find evidence for correlation between effective inspiral spin and mass ratio, though it is unclear if this is driven by variation in the mode of the distribution or the width.

We observe the stars over multiple nights and measure radial velocities for each night, which we combine with Gaia proper motions to identify multiplicity and cluster membership. We identify 95 single members, 14 binary members, 9 members with uncertain multiplicity, and 1 single likely member. We determine effective temperatures using empirical color-temperature relations, surface gravities from isochrones, and microturbulence from empirical relations for main-sequence stars. Our sample includes G and K dwarfs with temperatures between 6000 and 5300 K, which expands significantly on earlier observations. We find that lithium abundances in NGC 188 are lower than predictions from standard stellar evolution theory. As expected, stars in NGC 188 are more lithium-depleted than those in the younger Hyades and Praesepe clusters (650 Myr). However, their abundances are higher, or at least comparable, to those in the slightly younger cluster M67 (4.5 Gyr), challenging the idea that older stars have lower lithium than younger ones. Lithium depletion may depend on factors beyond age and mass, such as metallicity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transit Timing Variations in HIP 41378: CHEOPS and TESS confirm a non-transiting sixth planet in the system</a><span class="id">[2509.14156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In multiple-planet systems, gravitational interactions of exoplanets could lead to transit timing variations (TTVs), whose amplitude becomes significantly enhanced when planets are in or near mean-motion resonances (MMRs). In cases where both TTVs and radial velocity (RV) measurements are available, combined analysis can break degeneracies and provide robust planetary and system characterization, even detecting non-transiting planets. In this context, HIP 41378 hosts five confirmed transiting planets with periods ranging from 15 to over 542 days, providing a unique dynamical laboratory for investigating wide multi-planet systems analogous to the Solar System. In this study, we present an intensive space-based photometric follow-up of HIP 41378, combining 15 new CHEOPS observations with eight TESS sectors, alongside data from K2, Spitzer, HST, and HARPS. We dynamically modeled the TTVs and RV signals of the two inner sub-Neptunes via N-body integration. These planets, HIP 41378 b ($P_{b}$ = 15.57 days) and HIP 41378 c ($P_{c}$ = 31.71 days), are close to ($\Delta\sim1.8$ %) a 2:1 period commensurability. We report a clear detection of TTVs with amplitudes of 20 mins for planet b and greater than 3 hrs for planet c. We dynamically confirm the planetary nature of HIP 41378 g, a non-transiting planet with a period of about 64 days and a mass of about 7 $M_{\oplus}$, close to a 2:1 commensurability with planet c, suggesting a possible MMR chain in the inner system. Our precise determination of the masses, eccentricities, and radii of HIP 41378 b and c enabled us to investigate their possible volatile-rich compositions. Finally, by leveraging on the last TESS sectors we constrained the period of HIP 41378 d to three possible aliases ($P_{d} =$ 278, 371, and 1113 days) suggesting that the system could be placed in a double quasi resonant chain, highlighting its complex dynamical architecture.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minimal targets for dilaton direct detection</a><span class="id">[2408.16816]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fifth force and equivalence principle tests search for new interactions by precisely measuring forces between macroscopic collections of atoms and molecules and their properties under free fall.

We use known expressions for the pressure of the Standard Model during its various epochs to compute the scalar effective potential, and find that the cosmological dynamics of this scalar are very sensitive to the reheat temperature of the Universe.

Focusing on the dry and wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals, we establish the theoretical expectation of these observables in each formation channel.
