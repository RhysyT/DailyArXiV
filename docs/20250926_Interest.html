<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is string field theory background independent?</a><span class="id">[2509.21159]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>String field theory is supposed to stand to perturbative string theory as quantum field theory stands to single-particle quantum theory; as such, it purports to offer a substantially more general and powerful perspective on string theory than the perturbative approach. In addition, string field theory has been claimed for several decades to liberate string theory from any fixed, background spatiotemporal commitments – thereby (if true) rendering it `background independent'. But is this really so? In this article, we undertake a detailed interrogation of this claim, finding that the verdict is sensitive both to one's understanding of the notion of background independence, and also to how one understands string field theory itself. Although in the end our verdicts on the question of the background independence are therefore somewhat mixed, we hope that our study will elevate the levels of systematicity and rigour in these discussions, as well as equip philosophers of physics with a helpful introduction to string field theory and the variety of interesting conceptual questions which it raises.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI-Guided Quantum Material Simulator for Education. Case Example: The Neuromorphic Materials Calculator 2025</a><span class="id">[2509.20372]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Teaching and learning in advanced materials science are often limited by two barriers: the technical complexity of quantum-mechanical simulations and the lack of individualized support in inquiry-based education. Here, we introduce the Neuromorphic Materials Calculator 2025 (NMC2025), a command-line platform that integrates a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) tutor with automated simulation workflows. NMC2025 combines large language model (LLM) guidance, real-time literature feedback, and domain-specific computation to create an adaptive learning environment. The system includes modular Python components for material discovery, simulation parameter optimization, and automated input generation for Quantum ESPRESSO (QE). Grounded in constructivist pedagogy, the tool enables students to carry out authentic research tasks such as identifying candidate materials for neuromorphic memristors or tuning density functional theory (DFT) inputs, while receiving context-aware explanations from the AI tutor. A case study illustrates how iterative, AI-guided refinement of hypotheses and calculations enhances both accuracy and understanding. NMC2025 fosters deeper conceptual insight, independent exploration, and smooth transfer of research methods into the classroom. This approach highlights the potential of AI-augmented education to reduce barriers to complex simulations and to expand access to computational modeling across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20406" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Female Student Population at Kabul University Before the 2021 Ban: Trends, Gender Parity, and Faculty-Level Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2509.20406]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For nearly two decades after 2001, Afghanistan's higher education sector expanded rapidly, with Kabul University serving as a central site of women's academic participation. Drawing on administrative records of student populations from 2016-2019 (Islamic calendar 1395-1398), this study examines gender distributions across shifts, faculties, and departments, with particular attention to STEM versus non-STEM fields. At Kabul University, the morning shift refers to the main daytime cohort (including some midday classes), while the evening shift is a separate program with its own classes and students; the two cohorts are administratively and academically distinct. Results show steady growth in the overall female student population, but with marked disparities between morning and evening shifts. Women were concentrated in non-STEM and &quot;socially acceptable&quot; disciplines such as literature, law, and psychology, while within STEM they were relatively well represented in the life sciences but remained significantly underrepresented in technical fields such as engineering, computer science, and physics. Gender parity improved modestly across most faculties, yet the Gender Parity Index (GPI) rarely approached 1.0, and the STEM GPI consistently remained below 0.5. These findings highlight both progress and persistent structural inequalities, documenting a critical historical benchmark before the 2021 ban on women's university education.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hybrid Strategy for Coordinated Interstellar Signaling: Linking the Galactic Center and Extragalactic Bursts</a><span class="id">[2509.20718]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is largely limited by the vastness of the signaling parameter space. The concurrent signaling scheme offers a framework in which civilizations can coordinate their transmission and reception by referring to a common astrophysical event. Building on this idea, I propose a hybrid strategy that combines the Galactic Center as a spatial reference with an extragalactic burst as a temporal marker. If such a scheme is indeed employed, the sky area to be surveyed in SETI could be reduced by more than two orders of magnitude, based solely on existing astronomical data. I examine records of three types of extragalactic bursts (supernovae, neutron star mergers, and gamma-ray bursts [GRBs]) to identify suitable temporal markers. Among them, GRB 221009A is particularly notable due to its high fluence and favorable sky location.</p></div></details></article></body>
