<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">De-Idealizing De-Idealization: Beyond Full Reversal</a><span class="id">[2602.21324]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There is a question of whether de-idealization is needed for justified use of – for 'checking' – idealizations. We argue that the standard philosophical account of de-idealization has become too idealized, but that this does not preclude the possibility of justificatory practices which show how models can be used to make inferences about the world. In turn, motivated by examples in physics, we provide a more expansive and practice-driven account of de-idealization by relaxing the standards for closeness to more realistic theoretical items, identifying at least three kinds of procedures for de-idealization: intra-model, inter-model, and measurement de-idealizations. These examples highlight how idealizations can be – and indeed have been – scrutinized within physics without appealing to the philosopher's idealized notion of de-idealization.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tinkering in Primary School: From Episode to Science Practice</a><span class="id">[2602.21776]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study discusses the opportunity to integrate tinkering, a constructionist practice, into formal education, highlighting its potential and challenges. We propose a model through which teachers can blend the open exploratory nature of tinkering with structured learning in primary school classrooms, focusing on Physics Education. Despite pandemic-induced limitations, feedback from 20 teachers and analysis of fishbowl protocols revealed the positive impact of tinkering on classroom dynamics, teacher engagement, and student access to knowledge. Our findings indicated that tinkering can surface relevant scientific questions. Nevertheless, teachers feel unprepared to tackle them in the classroom. This evidence will guide our future co-designs to enhance learning experiences and address the complexities of incorporating tinkering into formal education.</p></div></details></article></body>
