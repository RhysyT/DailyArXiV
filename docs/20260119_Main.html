To this end, we have developed Metal Pipe, a new code for determining stellar parameters and abundances, which is designed for use across a wider range of spectral types than many commonly used codes. It combines the widely-used package MOOG with photometric stellar parameters, a user-supplied high-resolution spectrum, and a newly curated list of spectral lines. Metal Pipe outputs values for $T_{\rm{eff}}$, $\log{(g)}$, $M_*$, $R_*$, and $L_*$ from isochrones, and abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, and Fe from MOOG. In this paper, we describe the Metal Pipe algorithm and tests of Metal Pipe against previous abundance measurements on archival HIRES spectra of 503 F, G, and K type stars. We find RMS scatters of  100 K in $T_{\rm{eff}}$,  0.10 dex in $\log{(g)}$, and  0.10 dex for all measured abundances. These values are comparable to estimated measurement uncertainties, verifying Metal Pipe for continued use in building a detailed abundance catalog. Future papers in this series will test Metal Pipe's applicability to late K and M dwarf stars, and provide other improvements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10798" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">POLAMI Multi-Wavelength Polarization Study of AGN Jets: A Millimeter-Optical Comparison</a><span class="id">[2601.10798]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Millimeter-band polarimetry offers a powerful probe of AGN jets, accessing regions less affected by opacity and Faraday rotation than at longer radio wavelengths. As part of the POLAMI program, we have conducted 14 years of 1 mm and 3 mm polarization monitoring of a sample of gamma-ray-bright blazars with the IRAM 30-m telescope, complemented here with long-term optical polarimetric observations from multiple facilities. We aim to test whether current models of parsec-scale jet physics are consistent with observed multi-band polarization behavior. Using a Bayesian framework, we derive intrinsic mean flux densities and modulation indices for total flux and fractional polarization, and characterize EVPA variability using circular statistics. We then examine how these quantities reflecting variability properties across millimeter and optical bands relate to synchrotron peak frequency, jet orientation, and radio/gamma-ray luminosities. BL Lac objects exhibit, on average, higher fractional polarization and lower EVPA variability than FSRQs at all wavelengths. Fractional polarization increases with frequency, consistent with increasingly ordered magnetic fields at shorter wavelengths. BL Lacs also show more frequent alignment of EVPAs between optical and millimeter bands, whereas FSRQs display weaker coherence. EVPA variability correlates positively with radio and gamma-ray luminosities and negatively with synchrotron peak frequency, most strongly in the optical. We further find a positive correlation between EVPA spread and fractional polarization variability, suggesting a direct link between magnetic-field structure and polarization dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of disc photoevaporation on the long-term evolution of giant planets in mean motion resonances</a><span class="id">[2601.10811]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the long-term impact of disc photoevaporation on the dynamical stability and evolution of giant planet pairs in mean motion resonances. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, in which we have included mass-loss due to photoevaporation, we explore a parameter space covering disc mass, viscosity, planet mass, and resonance type. We find that strong photoevaporation depletes gas in the common gap between the planets, slowing migration and suppressing planet-disc interactions that typically lead to resonance breaking and eccentricity damping. This stabilising effect is most significant for 3:2 resonances, which are more prone to disruption due to the reduced planet spacing. In contrast, 2:1 resonances are generally more robust but can still be destabilised at high disc mass and moderate-to-strong photoevaporation due to asymmetric torques. Photoevaporation can therefore stabilise resonances that would otherwise break, or conversely disrupt resonances that are natively more stable. Even in cases where photoevaporation does not directly affect resonance stability, it typically results in increased planetary eccentricities. These results highlight the complex, system-dependent nature of resonance evolution, with implications for the final orbital architectures of giant planet systems and their detectability via astrometry from missions such as Gaia.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10817" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Closer Look at the Dynamical State of the High-redshift Galaxy Cluster SPT-CL J2215-3537</a><span class="id">[2601.10817]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive reanalysis of the dynamical state of the high-redshift galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2215-3537 (z = 1.16), using the full set of available Chandra observations to characterize the thermodynamic and morphological properties of the intracluster medium. Although previously identified as one of the most distant dynamically relaxed systems based on X-ray morphological statistics, we find compelling evidence that SPT-CL J2215-3537 displays some level of dynamical activity. This includes temperature anisotropies consistent with the first detection of a pair of core-sloshing cold fronts at z &gt; 1. We identify a ghost cavity candidate and estimate its mechanical power as log10(Pcav/10^42 erg s^-1) = 2.66 +- 0.23, confirming that radiative cooling strongly exceeds active galactic nucleus feedback heating. We show that SPT-CL J2215-3537 is likely in a short transient phase preceding the onset of a self-regulated cooling-feedback cycle. We recalculate traditional X-ray morphological parameters and discuss how non-self-similar evolution of parameters sensitive to the surface brightness cuspiness can bias dynamical classifications at high redshift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracking the Evolution of Plasma Instabilities from the Prominence-Corona Transition Region into Interplanetary Space with Total Solar Eclipse and WISPR/PSP White Light Images</a><span class="id">[2601.10818]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-resolution total solar eclipse (TSE) white light (WL) images are the only observations at present to capture coronal structures over an uninterrupted field of view (FoV) of at least 10 solar radii (Rs) starting from the solar limb. They were the first to report the presence of vortex rings originating within the prominence-corona transition region (PCTR). They also captured CMEs and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities at different phases of their evolution. While the evolution of CMEs and KH waves is relatively well-documented, little is known about the survivability of vortex rings beyond the FoV of the TSE images. In this study, we use seven TSE images and non-contemporaneous WL images acquired by the Wide-Field Imager for Parker Solar PRobe (WISPR) to track the spatial evolution of vortex rings, KH waves, and CMEs. The size trend versus radial distance for vortex rings and KH waves are found to be shallower below 1.5 Rs than beyond 3 Rs, while the CMEs observed beyond 3 Rs show a unique slope. The WISPR time series yield an average speed of 249.02 +/- 25.3 km/s for the vortex rings beyond 3 Rs, that when combined with their size yields a speed of 19.39 +/- 3.20 km/s below 1 Rs. These values are remarkably consistent with the acceleration profile of the slow solar wind over the same distance. This study provides strong empirical evidence that vortex rings, which originate at the PCTR with complex magnetic structures, do not dissipate as they expand away from the Sun with the solar wind.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10831" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asteroseismology of the ZZ Ceti star WD 1310+583 using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a><span class="id">[2601.10831]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aims. By analysing the light curves of the ZZ Ceti star WD 1310+583, we aim to determine its pulsational frequencies and to give constraints on the main stellar parameters using the tools of asteroseismology. Methods. We performed the Fourier analysis of the TESS light curves of WD 1310+583 and selected the possible pulsational modes. We also used spectroscopic data collected with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph of the Hubble Space Telescope to give constraints for the asteroseismic analysis. We perform the latter with period-to-period fits using fully evolutionary white dwarf models. Results. The star presented in this paper shows a particularly large number (41) of pulsational frequencies, which provides a potential opportunity for detailed asteroseismic investigations. We found a mean period spacing of  40.5 seconds, which allows us to state that the stellar mass of WD 1310+583 would be larger than  0.57 M_Sun. We also attempted an asteroseismological analysis by performing period-to-period fits, but we were unable to find a single statistically significant asteroseismological solution. We adopted a tentative solution consisting of a white dwarf model with M* = 0.632 M_Sun, Teff = 11 702 K, and an asteroseismic distance d = 27.75 +0.17/-0.15 pc, which is significantly smaller than the one predicted by Gaia (d = 30.79 +/- 0.2 pc). We also determined that the rotational period of our target is 1.18 d.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From a Network to a Networking: The Evolution of the Latin American Giant Observatory</a><span class="id">[2601.10893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) is a collaborative initiative that deploys a network of low-cost, autonomous Water Cherenkov Detectors across Latin America and Spain. Initially focused on detecting gamma-ray bursts at high-altitude sites, LAGO has evolved into a multidisciplinary forum for astroparticle physics, space weather studies, and environmental monitoring. Its detectors operate from sea level to over 4300 meters above sea level (m a.s.l.) in diverse geomagnetic and atmospheric conditions. The ARTI-MEIGA simulation framework is a key development that models the entire cosmic-ray interaction chain, enabling site-specific simulations to be integrated into FAIR-compliant workflows. LAGO also plays a significant role in regional education and training through partnerships with ERASMUS+ projects, positioning itself as a hub for research capacity building. New contributions emerging from the collaboration include volcano muography, neutron hydrometry for precision agriculture, and space weather monitoring in the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly. LAGO demonstrates how Cherenkov-based detection and open science can drive scientific discovery and practical innovation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pink Dwarfs and the Paths to Stardom: How Brown Dwarfs Pushed Above the Hydrogen Burning Limit Evolve</a><span class="id">[2601.10908]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Brown dwarfs that gain mass through binary interactions may be pushed above the boundary that divides brown dwarfs from low-mass stars: the hydrogen burning limit (HBL). Some of these objects will make their way to the main sequence and may eventually be indistinguishable from ordinary low-mass stars, while others will remain brown dwarf-like, unable to burn hydrogen at a high enough rate to power their surface luminosity. We study the evolution of both types of object to provide a taxonomy and testable observational predictions for these objects depending on their evolutionary path. Using MESA simulations, we find that a subset of the objects that will eventually become stars experience an extended luminosity plateau, where their surface luminosity remains nearly constant on 100 Myr - Gyr timescales. We find that the plateau timescale is set by the amount of energy required to re-heat the cores of these objects to a level sufficient to sustain convection. The timescales required for the cores of these objects to &quot;unfreeze&quot; and arrive at the main sequence is long enough that surveys may be able to find objects in this evolutionary stage. These objects, along with those that never reach the main sequence, occupy a unique space in a mass-luminosity diagram, and would provide a unique constraint on binary mass transfer physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10928" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray and radio observations of the AMXP MAXI J1957+032 covering the 2022-2025 outbursts</a><span class="id">[2601.10928]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We presented a comprehensive multi-epoch timing and multiwavelength analysis of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar MAXI J1957+032, covering two major outbursts in 2022 and 2025. By reanalyzing the 2022 outburst data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), we found the spin frequency and orbital parameters from the observations in 0.3-5 keV. For the 2025 outburst, we reported the detection of pulsations with the Einstein Probe (EP). Based on the $\sim$3-year baseline between these two outbursts, we measured a significant long-term spin-down rate of $\dot\nu = (-5.73 \pm 0.28) \times 10^{-14}~{\rm Hz~s^{-1}}$. Assuming that the quiescent spin-down is driven by magnetic dipole radiation, we inferred a spin-down luminosity of $L \approx 1.1 \times 10^{36}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$ and a surface dipolar magnetic field of $B \approx (7.3 - 10.4) \times 10^8$ G. Furthermore, we conducted a deep radio pulsation search with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) during the X-ray quiescent state in 2024, resulting in a non-detection with a 7$\sigma$ flux density upper limit of 12.3 $\mu$Jy. This corresponds to a radio efficiency upper limit of $\xi &lt; 2.8 \times 10^{-10}$, which is significantly lower than that of typical millisecond pulsars with a similar spin-down power. This profound radio pulsation faintness can be explained by two primary scenarios: either a geometric effect, wherein the pulsar's radio beam is directed away from our line of sight, or a physical suppression of the emission mechanism, potentially caused by a persistent low-level accretion flow during the X-ray quiescent state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiative Cooling Effects on Plasmoid Formation in Black Hole Accretion Flows with Multiple Magnetic Loops</a><span class="id">[2601.10968]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. We investigate the physics of black hole accretion flows, particularly focusing on phenomena like magnetic reconnection and plasmoid formation, which are believed to be responsible for energetic events such as flares observed from astrophysical black this http URL . We aim to understand the influence of radiative cooling on plasmoid formation within black hole accretion flows that are threaded by multi-loop magnetic field this http URL . We conducted two- and three-dimensional two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. By varying the magnetic loop sizes and the mass accretion rate, we explored how radiative cooling alters the accretion dynamics, disk structure, and the properties of reconnection-driven plasmoid this http URL . Our results demonstrate that radiative cooling suppresses the transition to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state by reducing magnetic flux accumulation near the horizon. It significantly modifies the disk morphology by lowering the electron temperature and compressing the disk, which leads to increased density at the equatorial plane and decreased magnetization. Within the current sheets, radiative cooling triggers layer compression and the collapse of plasmoids, shortening their lifetime and reducing their size, while the frequency of plasmoid events increases. Moreover, we observe enhanced negative energy-at-infinity density in plasmoids near the ergosphere, with its peaks corresponding to plasmoid this http URL . Radiative cooling plays a critical role in shaping both macroscopic accretion flow properties and microscopic reconnection phenomena near black holes. This suggests that radiative cooling may modulate black hole energy extraction through reconnection-driven Penrose processes, highlighting its importance in models of astrophysical black holes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curvature Effect on the Speed of Sound</a><span class="id">[2601.11005]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The speed of sound refers to the rate at which information travels from one point to another. It is a positive quantity and bounded by causality. It is defined as the rate of change of pressure with respect to the system's density. In this article, we derive a covariant equation for the sound wave and demonstrate how the wave equation is modified in the general relativistic formalism. One can then define an effective speed of sound by attenuating the usual definition of sound speed with the gravitational metric potential. The general relativistic curvature effect is observed to reduce the speed of sound when computed inside a neutron star. This effectively makes the star relatively softer (according to the equation of state). The change in the effective sound speed can be easily visualised if one redefines the non-radial modes in terms of it. The modes do not change, but the space-time curvature reduces the amplitude of the oscillation modes. The formalism is suited for studying astrophysical compact objects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An 11-Year Catalog of Gamma-Ray Transients: A Comprehensive Search with Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor Data</a><span class="id">[2601.11032]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has produced the largest database of all-sky observations in gamma rays with its continuous data with high time and energy resolutions. These data contain a wealth of unidentified transient events that did not trigger the detectors for various reasons. We conducted extensive searches to identify such untriggered transient events observed with GBM in 11 years (July 2010 - June 2021). In particular, we employed four different search modes with various energy ranges (mainly below 300 keV) and time resolutions (from 8 ms to 2 s), utilizing three statistical methods (signal-to-noise ratio, Poisson, and Bayesian statistics), each with different effectiveness in identifying specific classes of transients. Moreover, we developed algorithms for known-event flagging as well as unknown-event classification for our candidate events found in the searches. In this paper, we present our search methodologies, event flagging and classification algorithms and the resulting comprehensive event catalog. The catalog contains more than a million events in total, including known events such as gamma-ray bursts, soft-gamma repeater bursts, galactic X-ray source activities, terrestrial gamma flashes, and solar flares. For each candidate event, the catalog presents the event time, detection significance, event duration, hardness ratios, known-event flagging results, and classification probabilities. Our short-transient catalog significantly expands the currently-existing list of known events and complements the GBM trigger catalog. The event database with filtering capabilities is also publicly available at this https URL , which allows users to retrieve event information based on their input queries along with the event lightcurves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11068" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Portrait of the Cosmic Reionisation History in the Context of the Early Dark Energy Model</a><span class="id">[2601.11068]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent JWST observations of Lyman-$\alpha$ emission at $z \sim 11-6$ indicate a rapid reionization of the intergalactic medium within the first $\sim700$ Myr. The required Lyman continuum (LyC) photon budget may naturally arise from the unexpectedly high galaxy number densities revealed by JWST, reducing the need for scenarios invoking very high LyC escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc}\gtrsim0.2$) or dominant contributions from ultra-faint galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}&gt;-15$) in the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework. In this work, we model the reionization history under the Early Dark Energy (EDE) paradigm – originally proposed to ease the Hubble tension – which also explains the observed over-abundance of high-$z$ galaxies without extreme star formation efficiencies. The EDE model yields reionization histories consistent with current constraints while requiring only moderate LyC escape fractions and UV luminosity densities ($f_{\rm esc}\sim 0.05-0.1$, $M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -17$ to $-15$). Our results suggest that, once key astrophysical parameters are better constrained, the reionization history could serve as an independent and complementary probe of EDE cosmologies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multifrequency evolution of the Integrated pulse profile of radio pulsars by implementing the inverse Compton mechanism</a><span class="id">[2601.11070]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Main Aim of this paper is to explain the emergence of new components of pulsars at higher radio bands by implementing the Inverse Compton Scattering Mechanism. From pulsar radio observation, it is seen that a couple of pulsars reveal new emission components at higher radio frequencies, although they show single-component emission at lower frequencies. We develop a brief outline, fostering inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of the low-frequency radio photons as a vulnerable source of scattering, susceptible to explaining the evolution of new components of some radio pulsars at higher bands. We couple the conventional curvature radiation (CR) mechanism and ICS, and suggest that the spectral convolution of the flux component individually from CR and the modulated template due to the ICS scattered component can be combined to reproduce such signatures associated with the diverse morphology of the integrated pulse profile. We reproduce the beam frequency diagram, the geometrical variation of different parameters of the emission geometry, as well as the multi-frequency evolution from theory. We have suitably tuned the input parameter space and given the combination of parameters that can tune to a particular scattered frequency in tabulated form. We conclude that ICS may be a responsible process for describing the emergence of new components in higher radio emission bands.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating Pulsar Wind Nebula DA 495: Insights from LHAASO and Multi-Wavelength Observations</a><span class="id">[2601.11071]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar wind nebula DA 495 (G65.7+1.2) has been extensively observed from radio to TeV $\gamma$-ray bands. We present LHAASO observations of DA 495, revealing an energy-dependent morphology, where an extended source with $r_{39}=0.19^{\circ}\pm0.02^{\circ}$ is detected by WCDA (0.4-15 TeV), and a point-like source with a 95\% upper limit of $r_{39}=0.11^{\circ}$ is observed by KM2A ($&gt;25~\mathrm{TeV}$). The spectrum of the source extends beyond 100 TeV with a break or cutoff at a few tens of TeV. Our X-ray data analysis, based on Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, shows that the X-ray emission of DA 495 extends well to $\sim 6^{\prime}$, significantly larger than the size previously reported. The broadband spectral energy distribution across radio, X-ray and TeV $\gamma$-ray bands is phenomenologically described by a one-zone leptonic model, yielding an average magnetic field of $\sim$ 5 $\mathrm{\mu G}$, while Fermi-LAT spectral analysis indicates a likely presence of a $\gamma$-ray pulsar within the system. A time-dependent model, in which particle transport is convection-dominated in the inner region (within $\sim100^{\prime\prime}$) and diffusion-dominated in the outer region, successfully reproduces the observed radial profiles of X-ray surface brightness and spectral index, and also accounts for the TeV $\gamma$-ray emission detected by LHAASO, suggesting that DA 495 represents an evolved PWN with ongoing particle escape that gives rise to a TeV halo component – that is, a PWN+halo system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic Topology and Loop Statistics in Observed Coronal Holes Using Potential Field Modeling</a><span class="id">[2601.11080]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) models are widely used to study the solar corona and form the basis for solar wind forecasting, yet often fail to reproduce observed properties of coronal holes. We analyze 702 observed coronal holes between 2010 and 2019 and compute corresponding PFSS magnetic field extrapolations to examine their magnetic topology and loop statistics, comparing them with quiet Sun regions. Our goal is to determine how observed coronal holes are represented in a PFSS model and to identify sources of known discrepancies. We find that low-lying loops covering the weak, balanced background field in coronal holes are statistically smaller and narrower than in quiet Sun regions, with a median height strongly correlated to the coronal holes mean magnetic flux density (cc_Pearson = 0.81). This suggests that at low altitudes, the coronal hole magnetic topology is primarily governed by its flux density, unlike in quiet Sun regions. Coronal holes also contain loops extending much higher into the corona than typical quiet Sun loops, although it is unclear if these are truly closed or reflect source surface height limitations. Overall, differences in modeled magnetic structures of coronal holes and quiet Sun regions are evident, even when the PFSS model does not indicate any open fields. These results suggest that observed coronal holes correspond to distinct photospheric magnetic structures, and that discrepancies with PFSS models reflect modeling limitations rather than the absence of coronal holes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Broadband study of the Be/X-ray binary pulsar eRASSU J012422.9-724248 in the Magellanic Bridge, near the Eastern Wing of the Small Magellanic Cloud</a><span class="id">[2601.11120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The first four all-sky surveys with eROSITA the soft X-ray instrument on board the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) satellite revealed a new X-ray source, eRASSU J012422.9-724248, in the Magellanic Bridge, near the Eastern Wing of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We performed a broadband timing and spectral analysis using the optical and X-ray data of eRASSU J012422.9-724248. Using the X-ray observations with eROSITA, Swift, NuSTAR and optical data from the optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO), we confirm the nature of eRASSU J012422.9-724248 as a Be/X-ray binary (BeXRB) pulsar in the Magellanic bridge. The position is coincident with that of an early-type star (OGLE ID SMC732.10.7). We detect the spin period at 341.71 s in NuSTAR data and infer a period of 63.65 days from the 15 year monitoring with OGLE, that we interpret as the orbital period of the system. A tentative CRSF at  12.3 keV is identified in NuSTAR spectra with  1.8-sigma. The source appears to show a persistent X-ray luminosity and an optical magnitude transition on the long timescale. We propose eRASSU J012422.9-724248 is a new member of the class of persistent BeXRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Role of Plasma Lensing in Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2601.11122]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Growing evidence indicates that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) reside in dense, magneto-ionic environments where extrinsic propagation effects can substantially reshape the observed signal. Within a 1D Gaussian plasma-lens framework, we show that small, monotonic variations in the incidence angle of the FRB wavefront naturally generate both downward and upward sub-burst frequency drifts. We further demonstrate that distinct lensed paths that probe different rotation measures (RMs), can produce orthogonal polarization-angle (PA) jumps at gigahertz frequencies. In this picture, a $\sim 90^\circ$ PA transition requires only a modest RM contrast of order a few $\times10~\rm{rad~m^{-2}}$ between the multiple images. The chromatic activity of FRB 20180916B-earlier and narrower activity windows at higher frequencies-can be explained as preferential magnification near the outer caustic. Finally, the intrinsic resolution of a plasma lens provides an upper limit on the transverse emission size: lenses located close to the source yield magnetospheric-scale constraints and offer a practical means of discriminating between inner- and outer-magnetospheric emission scenarios. These results suggest that plasma lensing could account for multiple complex observational features of FRBs and may play a non-negligible role in modulating their observable properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Study of the anisotropy of cosmic expansion on ZTF type Iasupernovae simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.11139]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmological principle assumes the isotropy of the Universe at large scales. It is a foundational assumption in the $\Lambda$CDM model, which is the current standard model of cosmology. Recent tensions give legitimacy to investigating the possibility of anisotropies in the Universe. The large sky coverage achieved by the Zwicky Transient Facility survey (ZTF) allows us to test the veracity of the cosmological principle using observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). In this article, we develop a methodology to measure potential anisotropies in the Hubble constant $H_0$. We test our method on realistic simulations of the second data release (DR2) of ZTF SNe Ia in which we introduce a dipole. We develop an unbiased method both to introduce a dipole in the simulations and to recover it. We test a potential $H_0$ dependency of our method while varying the dipole amplitude. We analyse the impact of introducing large-scale structures in the simulations and the efficiency of using a volume-limited sample, which is an unbiased subsample of the ZTF SNe Ia sample. Finally, we build an error model applied to the recovered dipole amplitude ($\Delta H_0$) and its direction ($\alpha_0$, $\delta_0$). Our analysis allows us to recover a dipole with an error on the amplitude of $0.33\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, and uncertainties of $3.4^\circ$ and $6.1^\circ$ on the right ascension and declination, respectively, for an initial dipole amplitude of $\Delta H_0 = 3\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. The resulting dipole is independent of the chosen $H_0$ value and sky coverage. This paper paves the way for a future precise ZTF dipole investigation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayesian optimisation for Bayesian evidence (BOBE) – a fast and efficient likelihood emulator for model selection</a><span class="id">[2601.11150]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formalism of Bayesian model selection provides a very elegant way of ranking different physical models in terms of how compatible they are with a given set of observed data. However, its practical application is often hampered by the challenge of having to compute the Bayesian evidence - a multi-dimensional integral over the product of likelihood and prior probability. This usually necessitates a large number of function calls to the likelihood, which may become prohibitive in case of &quot;slow&quot;, costly to evaluate likelihoods. A possible solution to this problem lies in approximating the slow full likelihood by a fast emulated likelihood. In this paper, we introduce BOBE (Bayesian Optimisation for Bayesian Evidence), a method to construct a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-based emulator. BOBE utilises a Bayesian Optimisation algorithm designed specifically to (i) provide a realistic estimate of the emulator's uncertainty and its impact on the evidence calculation, and (ii) minimise the number of likelihood evaluations required in order to meet a given evidence accuracy goal. We apply it to a number of toy examples as well as actual cosmological likelihoods, and demonstrate that training the emulator to a sufficient accuracy takes a factor of $O(10^3)$ fewer direct likelihood evaluations than would be needed if one were to directly compute the evidence integral via nested sampling. BOBE's overhead is independent of the likelihood computation time $t_L$, making it particularly useful for &quot;expensive&quot; likelihoods with $t_L \gtrsim 1$ s. BOBE is written in Python, supports MPI parallelisation, takes advantage of automatic differentiation and just-in-time-compilation provided by JAX, can straightforwardly be implemented with cosmological data analysis frameworks such as Cobaya, and is available for download from this https URL .</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral evolution of hot hybrid white dwarfs: II.

By examining archival light curves for periodic signals, we identify that four of the 32 objects ($13^{+8}_{-4}$%) exhibit photometric variability. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting allowed us to derive radii, luminosities, and gravity masses, as well as to characterise the infrared excesses observed in six sources. A notable discovery is the identification of a 1.87 d period in the ZTF light curves of WD1342+443 and weak emission lines in the optical spectra of this star, which strongly indicate an irradiation effect system. Our SED fit indicates the presence of cool dust, which must be located farther from the star, and that any companion with a spectral type earlier than L2.0 would appear in the SED. This leads us to speculate that WD1342+443 might have an irradiated, sub-stellar companion. We also highlight that we uncovered, for the first time, a 4.23 d photometric period in the well-known, close DA+dM binary WD0232+035, based on TESS data. We find that the phase and amplitude of the light curve variations are consistent with expectations from an irradiation effect. Intriguingly, we detected an additional, mysterious period at 1.39 d, which is approximately one-third of the orbital period. Moreover, we revisited the longstanding discrepancy between Kiel and gravity masses for the hottest WDs. To address this, we explored fully metal line blanketed model atmospheres as a potential solution, contrasting them with the results from pure H and H+He models. Our results show that including metal opacities does not resolve the discrepancy - in fact, it slightly deteriorates the agreement. Finally, we reaffirm the previously observed correlation between He abundance and luminosity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11203" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Red Dots as Hidden Neutrino Sources</a><span class="id">[2601.11203]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Little Red Dots (LRDs) are enigmatic, compact, red galaxies at high redshift, $z\sim 4$-$7$, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope. Broad emission lines in the absence of X-ray and radio counterparts suggest that they host accreting supermassive black holes embedded in dense gaseous envelopes. This black-hole-envelope configuration facilitates efficient photohadronic interactions and neutrino production. Remarkably, their observed source number density and luminosity are compatible with the energetics of the diffuse neutrino background. We consider that relativistic jets and outflows are launched from the black hole and propagate through low-density polar funnels within envelopes, where particle acceleration and neutrino emission occur. This leads to LRDs being effectively hidden sources. Our analytic and numerical calculations show that, in an optimistic scenario, LRDs can contribute $\sim 30\%$ of the observed diffuse background at TeV$-$sub-PeV energies, predominantly through photomeson production. At high neutrino energies, $\gtrsim 10^{5.5}~{\rm GeV}$, inverse-Compton cooling of muons modifies the resulting flavor ratio, providing a distinctive diagnostic for IceCube-Gen2 and other upcoming neutrino telescopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11223" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KiDS-Legacy: WIMP dark matter constraints from the cross-correlation of weak lensing and Fermi-LAT gamma rays</a><span class="id">[2601.11223]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter dominates the matter content of the Universe, and its properties can be constrained through large-scale structure probes such as the cross-correlation between the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) and weak gravitational lensing.

The measurements were performed using angular power spectra estimated with the pseudo-$C_\ell$ method. No significant cross-correlation is found. Based on this non-detection, we present 95% upper bounds on the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) decay rate $\Gamma_{\rm dec}$ and velocity-averaged annihilation cross-section $\langle\sigma_{\rm ann} v\rangle$ as functions of mass. We compare our results with bounds from other cosmological tracers and from local probes, and found them to be complementary, particularly at low masses ($\rm GeV/TeV$).

We find that the extrapolated linear density contrast computed from the spherical collapse model is suppressed when the strength of momentum transfer is increased. Using the Sheth-Tormen mass function, the cluster number counts are computed. The minimum mass limit in the mass integration for each redshift bin is determined by matching the predicted number counts from the $\Lambda$CDM model with the result from eROSITA surveys. We find that the number of clusters is maximal at a higher redshift bin, and the number of clusters in a maximum redshift bin is enhanced when the strength of momentum and energy transfers increases due to the reduction of extrapolated linear density contrast. Setting the parameters of the dark energy model with momentum coupling according to the observational constraints in \cite{bestfit}, the predicted number counts from the coupled dark energy is larger than the result from eROSITA surveys. The statistical analysis yields a $p$-value of 0.189 for the proposed model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Consequently, there is no statistically significant evidence of an improved fit over the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework based on the eROSITA cluster number counts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11272" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suppression of Fast Flavor Conversion by Red Turbulence in Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2601.11272]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast flavor conversions (FFCs) in supernovae, driven by neutrino-neutrino refraction, can catastrophically equilibrate flavors and potentially affect the neutrino-driven explosion. We present a pivotal insight: matter density fluctuations characterized by red spectra ($\nu&lt;0$), naturally arising in stratified supernova environments, can suppress such instabilities by inducing accelerated decoherence. By deriving exact analytical solutions for two-flavor evolution in red turbulent matter-where correlations grow as $t^{|\nu|}$-we uncover a novel acceleration of coherence loss. This dynamical decoherence mechanism raises an effective energy barrier against the collective growth of flavor instabilities. Translating our master-equation results into an effective damping rate for FFC linear analysis, we find that realistic red turbulence ($\nu \sim -1$, fluctuation strength $\xi_\nu \sim 0.1$) can elevate the FFC threshold by a factor of $\sim 3-5$, potentially stabilizing regions that would otherwise undergo explosion-killing flavor equilibration (or vice versa). Our work provides the first analytical criterion for FFC suppression in turbulent media and identifies red turbulence as a critical, physics-grounded ingredient missing from current supernova models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of four cold Jupiters through combined analyses of radial velocity and astrometry data</a><span class="id">[2601.11280]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cold Jupiters play a crucial role in planet formation and dynamical evolution. Since their initial discovery around 47 UMa, they have attracted significant interest, yet their formation mechanisms remain uncertain, underscoring the need to expand the known population. In this work, we combine RV data with Gaia astrometry using Hipparcos-Gaia proper-motion anomalies over a 25-year baseline. By jointly modeling both datasets with the MCMC framework, we constrain planetary masses, orbital inclinations, and three-dimensional orbital architectures. This reduces RV degeneracies and improves mass determinations. Four cold Jupiters are reported: HD 68475 b and HD 100508 b are each the first confirmed planet in their systems, with orbital periods $7832_{-323}^{+463}$ d and $5681\pm42$ d and dynamical masses of $5.16_{-0.47}^{+0.53} M_{\text{Jup}}$ and $1.2_{-0.18}^{+0.30} M_{\text{Jup}}$, respectively. In multi-planet systems, HD 48265 c has a period of $10418_{-1400}^{+2400}$ d and a mass of $3.71_{-0.43}^{+0.68} M_{\text{Jup}}$, while HD 114386 c orbits at $444.00_{-0.88}^{+0.93}$ d with a minimum mass of $0.37 \pm 0.03 M_{\text{Jup}}$. The two planets in the HD 48265 system may exhibit a significant mutual inclination, making it a target for testing the von-Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov mechanism. HD 68475 b is a promising candidate for future direct imaging with ELT/METIS. We identified a Jupiter analog with the longest known orbital period among planets with masses between 0.5 and 2 $M_{\text{Jup}}$, implying that a substantial population of cold Jupiters likely awaits discovery by Gaia. This study expands the sample of cold Jupiters with constrained orbits and dynamical masses, demonstrating the value of combining radial velocity and astrometry in exoplanet research.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aligned, Misaligned and Polar Orbits of Hot Jupiters: Measuring Spin-Orbit Angles via Doppler Tomography with HARPS-N</a><span class="id">[2601.11313]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although the migration of hot Jupiters is not yet fully understood, measurements of the projected spin-orbit angle {\lambda} help shed light on the processes involved.

We catalog diffraction effects on the flash with point-like stars, monochromatic waves and spherical transparent atmosphere. Diffraction involves the Huygens principle, the Sommerfeld lemma and the stationary phase method, while finite stellar diameter cases involve Clausius' theorem. For point-like stars, the central flash shape is that of the classical Poisson spot, but with larger height. For tenuous atmospheres that cannot focus the stellar rays at shadow center, the flash is amplified by the factor (R_0/r_0)^2 compared to the Poisson spot, where R0 and r0 are the object and the shadow radii, respectively. For denser atmospheres that can focus the rays at shadow center, the flash peaks at 2[(pi*R/lambda_F})^2]*phi0, where R is the central flash layer radius, lambda_F is the Fresnel scale and phi0 is the flux that would be observed at shadow center without focusing. For isothermal atmospheres with scale height H, the height is 2(R*H)(pi/lambda_F)^2. Fringes surrounding the central flash are separated by lambda_P=lambda_F^2/R, related to the separation between the primary and secondary stellar images. For a projected stellar diameter D*&gt;lambda_P, the flash is described by complete elliptic integrals, and has full width at half maximum of 1.14D* and peak value 8H/D*. For Earth-based occultations by Pluto and Triton observed in the visible with point-like stars, diffraction causes flashes with very large heights  10e4-10e5, spread over a very small meter-sized region in the shadow plane. In practice, the flash is usually smoothed by the stellar diameter, but still reaches high values of  50 and  200 during Pluto and Triton occultations, respectively. Diffraction dominates when using millimeter wavelengths or longer. Effects of departure from sphericity, atmospheric waves and stellar limb darkening are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11485" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytical approaches to the study of the phase of the visibility function</a><span class="id">[2601.11485]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In radio interferometric observations, the main source of information is the complex visibility function, which includes amplitude and phase.

The double-peaked X-ray light curves from these shocks have been well characterized in several spider systems. In this paper, we analyze Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of the redback pulsar J1723$-$2837 to examine the expected synchrotron polarization. Using advanced extraction methods that include spatial, temporal, and particle background weights, we constrain the polarization of the IBS. We compare different models for the magnetic field in the radiation zone and find that the best fit prefers a striped pulsar wind model over other polarized models, with maximum polarization degree of the IBS emission component $\Pi_{\rm IBS}=36^{+16}_{-15}\%$, in addition to an unpolarized non-IBS component. Since this is only 2.4$\sigma$, we cannot claim strong preference over an unpolarized model; we report a $99\%$ confidence level upper limit on the total polarization of both IBS and non-IBS components $\Pi_{99}&lt;36\%$, which is improved over the $50\%$ limit obtained in previous work.

This computational cost increases significantly in the time domain, which requires non-diagonal covariance matrices to compute the likelihood. Consequently, parameter estimation of long-duration gravitational wave signals, such as binary neutron star mergers, becomes computationally infeasible in time domain. In this work, we detail a framework for the heterodyned likelihood that enables rapid inference in the time domain. Our method is applicable to signals with arbitrary mode content, and leverages the smoothness of the ratio of complex-valued waveform modes, approximating the ratio as a linear function within appropriately chosen time bins. This allows downsampling of the waveform modes and a reformulation of the likelihood, such that it depends only on the bin edges. We demonstrate that this likelihood recovers posteriors that are indistinguishable from those obtained using the standard likelihood in the time domain. We also observe dramatic improvement in speed - for a 128 seconds-long gravitational wave signal, our method is at least $\sim 400$ times faster than the standard time-domain analysis, reducing the wall clock time to just a few hours. We also demonstrate the reliability and unbiasedness of the likelihood using percentile-percentile tests for binary black hole and binary neutron star injections. We use the Gohberg-Semencul representation of the inverse of Toeplitz covariance matrix to accelerate matrix-vector products, which has potential applications even in non heterodyned time-domain inference.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15652" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Circumbinary disks in post common envelope binary systems with compact objects</a><span class="id">[2411.15652]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We conduct a population synthesis study using the binary population synthesis code compas to explore the formation of circumbinary disks (CBDs) following the common envelope evolution (CEE) phase of a giant star and a neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH). We focus on massive binary systems that evolve into double compact object (DCO) binaries after the exposed core of the giant collapses to form a second NS or BH. A CBD around the binary system of the giant's core and the compact object alters the orbital evolution of the binary. We parameterize the conditions for CBD formation in post-CEE binaries and present characteristics of DCO progenitors that are likely or unlikely to form CBDs. We find that CBD formation is most common in BH-BH binaries and NS-NS binaries that are expected to merge within Hubble time. Furthermore, we find that the interaction of the CBD with the core - NS/BH system at the termination of the CEE reduces the expected rate of DCO mergers, regardless of whether these binaries tighten or expand due to this interaction. If the binary system loses angular momentum to the CBD, it may produce a luminous transient due to a merger between the NS/BH and the core of the giant rather than gravitational wave sources. Thus, accounting for post-CEE CBD formation and its interaction with the binary system in population synthesis studies is significant for obtaining reliable predictions of the gravitational wave event rates expected by current detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Current Theories of Lunar Ice</a><span class="id">[2502.06056]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The classical theory of cold-trapped ice on the Moon and some modern theories are reviewed and compared with observational constraints.

Each of these surveys individually provides lensing measurements with similarly high statistical power, achieving signal-to-noise ratios of approximately 40. The combined lensing bandpowers represent the most precise CMB lensing power spectrum measurement to date with a signal-to-noise ratio of 61 and an amplitude of $A_\mathrm{lens}^\mathrm{recon} = 1.025 \pm 0.017$ with respect to the theory prediction from the best-fit CMB \textit{Planck}-ACT cosmology. The bandpowers from all three lensing datasets, analyzed jointly, yield a $1.6\%$ measurement of the parameter combination $S_8^\mathrm{CMBL} \equiv \sigma_8\,(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.25} = 0.825^{+0.015}_{-0.013}$. Including Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data improves the constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations to $\sigma_8 = 0.829 \pm 0.009$ (a $1.1\%$ determination). When combining with uncalibrated supernovae from \texttt{Pantheon+}, we present a $4\%$ sound-horizon-independent estimate of $H_0=66.4\pm2.5\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}} $. The joint lensing constraints on structure growth and present-day Hubble rate are fully consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM model fit to the primary CMB data from \textit{Planck} and ACT. While the precise upper limit is sensitive to the choice of data and underlying model assumptions, when varying the neutrino mass sum within the $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological model, the combination of primary CMB, BAO and CMB lensing drives the probable upper limit for the mass sum towards lower values, comparable to the minimum mass prior required by neutrino oscillation experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of a dwarf planet candidate in an extremely wide orbit: 2017 OF201</a><span class="id">[2505.15806]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of a dwarf planet candidate, 2017 OF201, currently located at a distance of 90 au.

Understanding SN Ia standardisation across wavelength improves methods for correcting SN Ia magnitudes. Using 150 SNe Ia from the Foundation Supernova Survey and Young Supernova Experiment, we present the first study focusing on SN Ia standardisation properties in the z band. Straddling the optical and near-infrared, SN Ia light in the z band is less sensitive to dust extinction and can be collected alongside the optical on CCDs. Pre-standardisation, SNe Ia exhibit less residual scatter in z-band peak magnitudes than in the g and r bands. SNe Ia peak z-band magnitudes still exhibit a significant dependence on light-curve shape. Post-standardisation, the z-band Hubble diagram has a total scatter of RMS $ = 0.195$ mag. We infer a z-band mass step of $\gamma_{z} = -0.105 \pm 0.031$ mag, which is consistent within $1\sigma$ of that estimated from gri data, assuming $R_{V} = 2.61$. When assuming different $R_{V}$ values for high and low mass host galaxies, the z-band and optical mass steps remain consistent within $1\sigma$. Based on current statistical precision, these results suggest dust reddening cannot fully explain the mass step. SNe Ia in the z band exhibit complementary standardisability properties to the optical that can improve distance estimates. Understanding these properties is important for the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory and Nancy G. Roman Space Telescope, which will probe the rest-frame z band to redshifts 0.1 and 1.8.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optical and near-infrared nebular-phase spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi: constraints on the structure of the inner ejecta, progenitor mass, and dust</a><span class="id">[2508.02656]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type II supernova SN 2024ggi from 250 and 420 days after the explosion. Comparing the evolution of the [\ion{O}{1}] at 6300, 6363 \textÅ doublet normalized to the continuum with spectral models from the literature, we estimate a progenitor star zero-age main-sequence mass ($M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$) of $\approx 14$ M$_\odot$. This value is consistent with $M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$ reported in the literature from independent methodologies. The nebular spectra are used to study the structure of the inner ejecta. The broad H$\alpha$ line has a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\simeq 3900$ km s$^{-1}$, with small deviations from a symmetric Gaussian profile centred at zero velocity, and the [\ion{O}{1}] doublet is blue-shifted by $\approx -940$ km s$^{-1}$. In the NIR, the nebular spectra reveal double-peaked emission features of \ion{Mg}{1} and [\ion{Fe}{2}] lines, suggesting a bipolar distribution of intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the line-of-sight. Such a double-peaked feature in these NIR lines has not been previously reported. No corresponding asymmetries are observed in the hydrogen lines, suggesting that the asymmetry is mostly confined to intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the innermost core of the supernova ejecta.

To enhance sensitivity to this targeted population, we incorporate a redshift-corrected population model informed by radio observations of Galactic double neutron star systems. The search identifies a significant trigger with a false-alarm rate of one per fifty years and a network signal-to-noise ratio of 9.7. This trigger was first reported in low-latency processing as S231109ci and subsequently listed in the GWTC-4.0 catalog as GW231109_235456, a subthreshold candidate. Accounting for a trials factor of five arising from four previous searches in GWTC-4.0 and this new search, the false-alarm rate of the candidate is approximately one per ten years. If the event is of astrophysical origin, the inferred source properties indicate component masses of 1.40 to 2.24 solar masses for the primary and 0.97 to 1.49 solar masses for the secondary, yielding a total mass of 2.95 solar masses with an uncertainty of plus 0.38 and minus 0.07 solar masses. The event is localized to a region of 450 square degrees enclosing ninety percent probability at a luminosity distance of 165 megaparsecs with an uncertainty of plus 70 and minus 69 megaparsecs.

So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\log B\simeq 6.5$).

Within the context of an automated search for X-ray sources showing flux variability in the \textit{Chandra} archive, we identified peculiar variability patterns in 2MASX J12571076+2724177 (J1257), a SMBH in the Coma cluster, during observations performed in 2020. We investigated the long-term evolution of the flux, together with the evolution of the spectral parameters throughout the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, which cover a time span of approximately 20 years. We found that J1257 has repeatedly shown peculiar variability over the last 20 years, on typical timescales of $\simeq20-30$ ks. From our spectral analysis, we found hints of a softer-when-brighter behaviour and of two well-separated flux states. We suggest that J1257 might represent a new addition to the ever-growing size of relatively low mass SMBHs ($M\simeq10^6-10^7\mathrm{M}_\odot$) showing extreme, possibly quasi-periodic X-ray variability on short time scales. The available dataset does not allow for a definitive classification of the nature of the variability.

Here, we compile a homogeneous library of all exoplanet and brown dwarf K-band spectra observed by GRAVITY thus far. We re-reduced all the available GRAVITY dual-field high-contrast data and, where companions are detected, extract their  2.0-2.4 $\mu$m K-band contrast spectra. We then derived stellar model atmospheres for all employed flux references, which we used to convert the companion contrast into companion flux spectra. Solely from the resulting GRAVITY spectra, we extracted spectral types, spectral indices, and bulk physical properties for all companions. Finally, and with the help of age constraints from the literature, we also derived isochronal masses for most companions using evolutionary models. The resulting library contains R   500 GRAVITY spectra of 39 substellar companions from late M to late T spectral types, including the entire L-T transition. Throughout this transition, a shift from CO-dominated late M- and L-type dwarfs to CH4-dominated T-type dwarfs can be observed in the K-band. The GRAVITY spectra alone constrain the objects' bolometric luminosity to typically within $\pm$0.15 dex. The derived isochronal masses agree with dynamical masses from the literature where available, except for HD 4113 c for which we confirm its previously reported potential underluminosity. Medium-resolution spectroscopy of substellar companions with GRAVITY provides insight into the carbon chemistry and the cloudiness of these objects' atmospheres. It also constrains these objects' bolometric luminosities which can yield measurements of their formation entropy if combined with dynamical masses, for instance from Gaia and GRAVITY astrometry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02067" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A JWST Transit of a Jupiter Analog I: Constraints on the Oblateness of Kepler-167e</a><span class="id">[2511.02067]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In October 2024 JWST observed a transit of Kepler-167e, a Jupiter-analog planet on a 1000+ day orbit. These observations, recorded over a long baseline of nearly 60 hours, were designed to search for signatures of planetary oblateness and/or exomoons comparable to Ganymede. In this first in a series of studies analyzing these data we report on constraints on Kepler-167e's oblateness. We explored a large grid of data reduction pipelines and modeling choices, including a new entirely independent reduction pipeline (&quot;katahdin&quot;) and two new treatments for limb darkening. We find that under a Bayesian model comparison framework the data are fit equally well by both spherical and oblate planet models, and that our ability to constrain the oblateness is negatively impacted by the influence of exposure-long trends. Using the most conservative of our posteriors, we place a 95% upper bound on the projected oblateness of $f&lt;0.097$, which corresponds to a rotation period of $P\geq7.11$ hours if the planet's spin axis is aligned with the sky plane. We note, however, that the final bound depends on the choice of reduction pipeline and systematics model, and that our suite of end-to-end analyses produced bounds as low as $f&lt;0.065$ at 95%. We conclude that leveraging JWST to make tighter constraints on planetary oblateness will require further investigation into mitigating exposure-long trends and correlated noise.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04099" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Cosmological Constraints of the Void-Lensing Cross-Correlation in the CSST Photometric Survey</a><span class="id">[2511.04099]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the cosmological constraints from the void-lensing cross-correlation assuming the $w$CDM model for the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) photometric survey.

Using realistic luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE) functions derived from observed gamma-ray luminosity functions for FSRQs and BL Lacs, we calculate the redshift evolution of the cosmic ray source population through integrated luminosity functions. The diffuse UHECRs flux from these sources is modelled by propagating nuclei through extragalactic space, including energy losses from interactions with cosmic photon backgrounds. The resulting UHECRs spectra are compared with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array, with fluxes normalised at reference energies. We also construct illustrative full skymaps of the integral UHECRs flux from $10$ EeV to $100$ EeV using the \textsc{HEALPix} framework, assuming a uniform distribution of synthetic sources and including energy-dependent magnetic diffusion. The regions of higher flux in the maps arise naturally from propagation effects and the limited UHECRs horizon.

In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of flare emission of GRB 221009A, which is composed of a series of flares. Among them, we identify an exceptionally bright flare with a record-breaking isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso} = 1.82 \times 10^{53}$ erg of GRB flares. It exhibits the highest peak energy ever detected in GRB flares, $E_{\rm peak} \sim 300$ keV, making it a genuine gamma-ray flare. It also shows rapid rise and decay timescales, significantly shorter than those of typical X-ray flares observed in soft X-ray or optical band, but comparable to those observed in prompt emissions.

Building on the transformative success of optical redshift surveys, the emerging technique of neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping (IM) offers a novel probe of large-scale structure (LSS) growth and the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe. Aims. We present cosmological forecasts for the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations (BINGO), a pioneering HI IM experiment, quantifying its potential to constrain the Planck-calibrated $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and extensions to the $w_0w_a$CDM dark energy model. Methods. For BINGO's Phase 1 configuration, we simulate the HI IM signal using a lognormal model and incorporate three dominant systematics: foreground residuals, thermal noise, and beam resolution effects. Using Bayesian inference, we derive joint constraints on six cosmological parameters ($\Omega_b h^2$, $\Omega_c h^2$, $100\theta_s$, $n_s$, $\ln 10^{10} A_s$, and $\tau_r$) alongside 60 HI parameters ($b_{\rm HI}^i$, $\Omega_{\rm HI}^i b_{\rm HI}^i$) across 30 frequency channels. Results. Our results demonstrate that combining BINGO with the Planck 2018 CMB dataset tightens the confidence regions of cosmological parameters to $\sim$40\% the size of those from Planck alone, significantly improving the precision of parameter estimation. Furthermore, BINGO constrains the redshift evolution of HI density and delivers competitive measurements of the dark energy equation of state parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$). Conclusions. These results demonstrate BINGO's potential to extract significant cosmological information from the HI distribution and provide constraints competitive with current and future cosmological surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Step in Flux to Suppress Axion Isocurvature</a><span class="id">[2507.12519]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The QCD axion in the pre-inflation scenario faces a stringent isocurvature constraint, which requires a relatively low Hubble scale during inflation. If the axion was heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, its isocurvature is suppressed and the constraint disappears. We point out a novel mechanism for achieving this, relying on the topological nature of a BF-type (monodromy) mass for the axion. Such a mass term has an integer coefficient, so it could naturally have been very large during inflation and exactly zero by the time of the QCD phase transition. This integer can be viewed as a quantized flux, which is discharged in a first-order phase transition that proceeds by the nucleation of charged branes. This mechanism can be embedded in cosmology in several different ways, with tunneling during, at the end of, or after inflation. We provide a detailed case study of the scenario in which the tunneling event occurs during inflation. We also comment briefly on possible UV completions within extra-dimensional gauge theories and string theory. Intriguingly, the phase transition could be accompanied by the emergence of the chiral Standard Model field content from a non-chiral theory during inflation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08750" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Challenging a binary neutron star merger interpretation of GW230529</a><span class="id">[2508.08750]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GW230529_181500 represented the first gravitational-wave detection with one of the component objects' mass inferred to lie in the previously hypothesized mass gap between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest observed black holes.

However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the known waveform degeneracy between the spin and mass ratio in the employed gravitational-wave models, GW230529_181500 could also be interpreted as a merger of two heavy ($\gtrsim 2 \mathrm{M}_\odot$) neutron stars with high spins. We investigate the distinguishability of these scenarios by performing parameter estimation on simulated signals obtained from numerical-relativity waveforms for both neutron star-black hole and binary neutron star systems, with parameters consistent with GW230529_181500, and comparing them to the analysis of the real event data. We find that GW230529_181500 is more likely to have originated from a neutron star-black hole merger, though the possibility of a binary neutron star origin can not be ruled out.

In particular, we demonstrate that nonthermally produced particles (such as the Standard Model Higgs) during preheating can generate such an effective negative mass term, allowing the scalar field to follow a time-dependent minimum even in renormalizable models with a quartic coupling.

The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reinforcement Learning to Discover a NorthEast Monsoon Index for Monthly Rainfall Prediction in Thailand</a><span class="id">[2601.10181]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Climate prediction is a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal patterns within Earth systems. Global climate indices, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.</p></div></details></article></body>
