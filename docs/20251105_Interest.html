<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01930" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPR Revisited: Context-Indexed Elements of Reality and Operational Completeness</a><span class="id">[2511.01930]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We reframe the EPR argument through an operational lens, replacing the notion of fixed &quot;elements of reality&quot; with context-indexed conditional states - what's often referred to as a measurement assemblage. This move deliberately sidesteps the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our updated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures observable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional state that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context. Crucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum mechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now, in any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided no-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed inferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed values across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction. To ground the argument, we offer examples: the qubit singlet scenario using Pauli settings and CJWR thresholds, a continuous-variable case based on the Reid criteria, and a counterexample in the spirit of the PR box, which highlights the boundaries of what quantum theory can actually reach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emergence: from physics to biology, sociology, and computer science</a><span class="id">[2508.08548]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Newtonian limit of orthonormal frames in metric theories of gravity</a><span class="id">[2410.01800]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extend well-known results on the Newtonian limit of Lorentzian metrics to orthonormal frames. Concretely, we prove that, given a one-parameter family of Lorentzian metrics that in the Newtonian limit converges to a Galilei structure, any family of orthonormal frames for these metrics converges pointwise to a Galilei frame, assuming that the two obvious necessary conditions are satisfied: the spatial frame must not rotate indefinitely as the limit is approached, and the frame's boost velocity with respect to some fixed reference observer needs to converge.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code in Motion: Integrating Computational Thinking with Kinematics Exploration</a><span class="id">[2503.03850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although physics has become increasingly computational, with computing even being considered the third pillar of physics, it is still not well integrated into physics education. Research suggests that integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into physics enhances conceptual understanding and strengthens students' ability to model and analyze phenomena. Building on this, we designed a didactic sequence for K9 students to foster specific CT practices while reinforcing fundamental kinematics concepts. The activity revealed students' ability to apply CT skills and is well suited for use in introductory kinematics courses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhancing Kinematics Understanding through a Video Game Based on Real-Time Motion Graphs</a><span class="id">[2508.19119]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interpreting kinematic graphs remains a significant challenge in physics education. The MissionMotion Project addresses this issue by providing a gamified physical-computational environment combining low-cost sensors, physical activity, computational thinking, and real-time visualization of motion graphs. This paper presents the design, development, and implementation of the project, with a particular focus on the pilot phase conducted with high school students in Uruguay. During this phase, we primarily used the MEEGA+ questionnaire to evaluate the gaming experience, usability, and motivation of the participants. Our analysis of the results shows high levels of satisfaction, perceived learning, and engagement, supporting the proposal's viability. Finally, we plan to conduct a large-scale conceptual evaluation to analyze how the proposal impacts understanding of kinematic graphs using standardized assessment tools.</p></div></details></article>
