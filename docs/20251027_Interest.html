<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20865" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philip Warren Anderson</a><span class="id">[2510.20865]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Philip Warren Anderson was a pioneering theoretical physicist whose work fundamentally shaped our understanding of complex systems. Anderson received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 for his groundbreaking research on localization and magnetism, yet he did so much more. His work on magnetism included antiferromagnetism, superexchange, the Kondo problem and local magnetic moments in metals. Anderson pointed out the importance of disorder through his work on localization, non-crystalline solids and spin glasses. In superconductivity, he is known for the dirty superconductor theorem, showing the gauge-invariance of the BCS theory, his study of flux creep, and for his collaboration with experimentalists to realize the Josephson effect. Anderson's resonating valence bond theory may yet play an important role in high temperature superconductivity. Anderson was also fascinated by broken symmetry, and he laid the theoretical groundwork for what is now known as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, showing how gauge bosons can acquire mass - an insight that played a foundational role in the Standard Model of particle physics. In his seminal &quot;More is Different&quot; paper, Anderson argued that the collective emergent phenomena that arise in complex interacting systems cannot be deduced from their fundamental parts. Anderson's legacy endures not only through the lasting impact of his scientific work but also through his influence on generations of physicists who continue to explore the rich landscape of collective behavior in nature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum Interference and the Limits of Separability</a><span class="id">[2510.21015]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quantum theory implies, and empirical evidence confirms, that while particles $\textit{can}$ exhibit wave-like behavior in interferometric experiments, this behavior is so limited as $\textit{not}$ to allow for third- and higher-order interference. The article at hand shows that this possibility-impossibility structure suggests the universal validity of a principle that regulates statistical correlations between spatiotemporally localized events, $\textit{independently}$ of the nature of the objects that may or may not partake in these events. Roughly, the said principle mandates that $\textit{any}$ joint influence of $m$ mutually spacelike separated events on $\textit{another}$ event, be such, that it can be separated by $\textit{at least}$ $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$ mediating events, and in some cases, by $\textit{no more}$ than $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$ mediating events. The structure of quantum interference thus teaches us that events can influence each other in a non-separable fashion, but that this non-separability has a certain exactly quantifiable limit.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analyzing Students Critical Thinking as a Basis for Developing Interactive Physics Multimedia with Generative Learning and Cognitive Conflict Strategies</a><span class="id">[2510.21344]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The increasing complexity of abstract concepts in physics education and the low level of students critical thinking skills demand innovative instructional strategies aligned with 21st century competencies. This study aims to analyze students critical thinking skills as the foundation for developing physics interactive multimedia using a generative learning model integrated with a cognitive conflict strategy. The research was conducted in three public high schools in Lima Puluh Kota Regency using a quantitative descriptive survey method, involving 125 eleventh-grade students. Data were collected using five validated instruments: teacher questionnaires on instructional practices and critical thinking, student learning style and attitude surveys, a multimedia needs assessment, and a critical thinking skills test. Results show that current instruction relies heavily on static and non-interactive media such as PowerPoint and videos, failing to support students varied learning styles especially the dominant visual preference (53.06). While students exhibit moderately positive attitudes toward physics learning (65.69), their critical thinking skills are critically low (average score 27.80), particularly in inference (24.00) and evaluation (28.00) indicators. These findings underscore the urgent need to develop visual and interactive multimedia that facilitates cognitive conflict and deeper reflection. The novelty of this study lies in linking multimedia design with cognitive strategies tailored to enhance critical thinking in physics. The study contributes to physics education by offering empirical evidence for the pedagogical integration of generative learning and cognitive conflict approaches in digital environments, paving the way for targeted multimedia interventions that promote critical reasoning in conceptually demanding physics topics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subatomic Heroes</a><span class="id">[2510.21494]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sharing the amazing achievements of the (particle) physics world with the general public is at the heart of the mission of the Subatomic Heroes, based at the University of Siegen, Germany. Originally this started out as an endeavor of theoretical particle physics, now we are steadily spreading out to cover and include more branches of physics and science. Our activities range from merging art with public physics lectures via marvelous artistic performances at the local theater, over dedicated events for high-school students, to our Subatomic Heroes channel on Instagram and TikTok where you may also find out when and where our famous &quot;hadronic ice-cream&quot; will be served next! So follow us on this https URL and this https URL .</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21123" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Navigating Through Turbulence: Blueprint for the Next Generation of Weather-Climate Scientists</a><span class="id">[2510.21123]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The field of weather and climate science is at a pivotal moment, defined by the dual forces of unprecedented technological advancement. While a shifting research and employment landscape has created career uncertainty, leading to a significant migration of talent toward the private sector, it has simultaneously spurred an expansion of the ecosystem through the emergence of new computational tools and the growing role of industry innovators and stakeholders. This perspective paper argues that this new, expanded ecosystem presents extraordinary opportunities for students and early-career professionals. We outline the emerging scientific frontiers powered by high-resolution simulations and artificial intelligence, suggest a practical path for navigating a more fluid career landscape, and propose how education and training must evolve to equip the next generation for success.</p></div></details></article></body>
