This approach reduces reliance on external priors and improves the robustness of parameter estimation. Within this joint analysis, $\Lambda$CDM parameters exhibit remarkable stability with respect to variations in foreground modelling. Extended cosmological parameters are more sensitive to these assumptions, with uncertainties increasing by up to 35%. Despite this, the combined constraints show no significant deviation from $\Lambda$CDM expectations, and several previously reported tensions – such as the preference for non-zero curvature or the excess of lensing amplitude A_L – are significantly reduced or resolved. In contrast, the determination of foreground parameters more severely depends on the assumptions made about the underlying models. Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of a fully joint analysis of current CMB experiments, and emphasizes the importance of consistent and accurate foreground modelling for the scientific goals of next-generation, high-sensitivity CMB surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large-Scale Structure Probes of the Post-Inflationary Axiverse</a><span class="id">[2511.04734]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the cosmology of axions in the post-inflationary scenario, where random initial conditions and the ensuing string-domain-wall network generate an isocurvature power spectrum. Axions radiated from strings behave as warm, wave-like dark matter: when they constitute the full dark matter abundance, free streaming sets the strongest bounds on their mass. For subdominant fractions, despite being warm, they still lead to an overall enhancement of structure growth in the dominant component, seeded by the axion white-noise fluctuations. We search for this effect using the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies at $z=4$-$10$, probing $k\simeq0.5$-$10\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Combining the UVLF analysis with Lyman-$\alpha$ and CMB data yields the leading cosmological limits on post-inflationary axion dark matter, sensitive to tiny fractions for $m_a\lesssim10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$. As a byproduct, we obtain new constraints on generic white-noise power spectra from the UVLF. These results apply broadly to scenarios that generate similar isocurvature perturbations, linking early-universe field dynamics to high-redshift structure formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04738" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SRGt 062340.2-265751 confirmed as a nova-like cataclysmic variable with a possible magnetic nature</a><span class="id">[2511.04738]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>SRGt 062340.2-265751, a cataclysmic variable identified by SRG/eROSITA due to its significant X-ray variability, remains poorly characterised despite multi-wavelength follow-up. We present spectral and timing analyses from the first dedicated X-ray and ultraviolet observations with XMM-Newton, complemented by SRG/eROSITA data from four all-sky surveys (eRASS1-4) and ASAS-SN optical photometry. Our timing analysis reveals a &gt;8$\sigma$-significant modulation at 3.6 $\pm$ 0.5 hours, likely representing the orbital period. Long-term ASAS-SN monitoring confirms the source as a VY Sculptoris-type nova-like system, while short-timescale X-ray and ultraviolet variability, down to a few minutes, suggests a possible underlying magnetic white dwarf. Two additional significant X-ray modulations at 43 $\pm$ 1 min and 36.0 $\pm$ 0.7 min tentatively point to the spin period of an intermediate polar. The best-fit XMM-Newton energy spectra reveal a multi-temperature thermal plasma ($kT$ = 0.23, 0.94, and 5.2 keV), while the SRG/eROSITA spectra are consistent with a single-temperature thermal plasma of a few keV. We estimate unabsorbed X-ray luminosities of $\gtrsim$$10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.2-12 keV). Broadband spectral energy distribution modelling, from near-ultraviolet to infrared, indicates a disc-dominated system consistent with a nova-like classification. We discuss these results in the context of the source's confirmed nova-like classification and its possible magnetic nature, a scenario increasingly supported by discoveries of intermediate polars exhibiting VY Sculptoris-type nova-like features.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HiSAXy: A fast methodology for solar wind structure identification in millions of time series</a><span class="id">[2511.04759]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a hybridized unsupervised clustering algorithm Hisaxy as a novel way to identify frequently occurring magnetic structures embedded in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) carried by the solar wind. The Hisaxy algorithm utilizes a combination of indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (iSAX) and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to efficiently identify clusters of patterns embedded in time series data. We utilized Hisaxy to identify small-scale structures, known as discontinuities, embedded in time series measurements of the IMF. In doing so, we demonstrate the capability of the algorithm to significantly reduce the amount of human analysis hours required to identify these structures, all the while maintaining a high degree of self similarity within a given cluster of time series data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secondary small-scale dynamics of a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable solar prominence</a><span class="id">[2511.04764]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quiescent solar prominences show distinct small-scale dynamics in observations. Their internal density contrasts with the surrounding corona make them susceptible to Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities, leading to vertically structured prominence morphologies when observed at the solar limb. As a result, prominences develop bubbles and plumes, along with secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) roll-ups along their edges. Recent observations also suggest magnetic reconnection events within the RT-driven turbulent flows. We perform high-resolution 2.5D resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code, reaching a spatial resolution of $\sim 11.7$ km in a 2D domain of size 30 Mm$\times$30 Mm and evolving the system for approximately 10 minutes of solar time. A dense, magnetic pressure supported prominence serves as the initial state, which becomes unstable at the prominence-corona interface. The resulting interaction between RT and KH instabilities leads to the formation of current sheets and localized reconnection events. The reconnection-driven outflows form energetic jets that enhance energy transport and dissipation across the prominence. We analyze our high-resolution prominence simulation using synthetic images of the broadband SDO/AIA 094, 171, and 193 Å and narrowband H$\alpha$ filters, to compare the developing fine-scale structures with their observational counterparts. Most secondary instabilities emerge in the hotter coronal regions surrounding the cooler prominence core. While our simulated features match observed scales, speeds, and duration, the simulated activity remains concentrated in hot, surrounding coronal plasma rather then the cool prominence material, implying that key physical ingredients may be missing. Future 3D studies in more realistic magnetic configurations are required to address these limitations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning-Driven Analysis of kSZ Maps to Predict CMB Optical Depth $τ$</a><span class="id">[2511.04770]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Upcoming measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, which results from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons scattering off moving electrons, offer a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The kSZ signal contains key information about the timing, duration, and spatial structure of the EoR. A precise measurement of the CMB optical depth $\tau$, a key parameter that characterizes the universe's integrated electron density, would significantly constrain models of early structure formation. However, the weak kSZ signal is difficult to extract from CMB observations due to significant contamination from astrophysical foregrounds. We present a machine learning approach to extract $\tau$ from simulated kSZ maps. We train advanced machine learning models, including swin transformers, on high-resolution seminumeric simulations of the kSZ signal. To robustly quantify prediction uncertainties of $\tau$, we employ the Laplace Approximation (LA). This approach provides an efficient and principled Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution over the model's weights, allowing for reliable error estimation. We investigate and compare two distinct application modes: a post-hoc LA applied to a pre-trained model, and an online LA where model weights and hyperparameters are optimized jointly by maximizing the marginal likelihood. This approach provides a framework for robustly constraining $\tau$ and its associated uncertainty, which can enhance the analysis of upcoming CMB surveys like the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Low Can You Go: Constraining the Effects of Catalog Incompleteness on Dark Siren Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2511.04786]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves (GWs) serve as standard sirens by directly encoding the luminosity distance to their source. When the host galaxy redshift is known, for example, through observation of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart, GW detections can provide an independent measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0$. However, even in the absence of an EM counterpart, inferring $H_0$ is possible through the dark siren method. In this approach, every galaxy in the GW localization volume is considered a potential host that contributes to a measurement of $H_0$, with redshift information supplied by galaxy catalogs. Using mock galaxy catalogs, we explore the effect of catalog incompleteness on dark siren measurements of $H_0$. We find that in the case of well-localized GW events, if GW hosts are found in all galaxies with host halo masses $M_h &gt; 2 \times10^{11} M_{\odot}h^{-1}$, catalogs only need to be complete down to the 1% brightest magnitude $M_i &lt; -22.43$ to draw an unbiased, informative posterior on H0. We demonstrate that this is a direct result of the clustering of fainter galaxies around brighter and more massive galaxies. For a mock galaxy catalog without clustering, or for GW localization volumes that are too large, using only the brightest galaxies results in a biased $H_0$ posterior. These results are important for informing future dark siren analyses with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA as well as next-generation detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comprehensive Listing of 208 Nova White Dwarf Masses As the Primary Determinant of Spectral-Class and Light-Curve-Class</a><span class="id">[2511.04787]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For Galactic novae, I calculate and collect a comprehensive catalog of 208 measures of white dwarf (WD) masses ($M_{\rm WD}$) and 232 measures of average $V$ magnitudes in quiescence ($V_q$). These are collected into a comprehensive catalog of most fundamental properties of all 402 known Galactic novae. The nova light curve and spectral classes are determined primarily by $M_{\rm WD}$. With an apparently clean cutoff, nova with light curve shapes in the S, P, O, and C classes have $&gt;$0.95 $M_{\odot}$, while the J, D, and F class novae have $&lt;$0.95 $M_{\odot}$. The speed class of the light curves is $t_3$=$10^{(-1.73M_{\rm WD})}$$\times$1900 days. The spectral class of novae is Fe II below 1.15 $M_{\odot}$, is He/N above 1.15 $M_{\odot}$, and the Hybrid novae are spread around this division. Neon novae have WD masses ranging from 0.53–1.37 $M_{\odot}$, with 76\% being measured to be below their minimum formation mass of 1.2 $M_{\odot}$, demonstrating that most are losing mass over each eruption cycle. The FWHM velocity of the Balmer line profiles is close to 0.23 times the WD escape velocity, or roughly $10^{(M_{\rm WD}/2)}$$\times$500 km s$^{-1}$ for $&lt;$1.3 $M_{\odot}$. And all the known Galactic recurrent novae are $&gt;$1.2 $M_{\odot}$. For issues involving the late expansion of the ejecta, I find that the visibility of shells is strongly biased towards novae with orbital periods $&lt;$0.33 days, and that the visibility of $\gamma$-rays from the shells are strongly biased towards novae with fast declines, with $t_3$ a proxy for the $\gamma$-ray luminosity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04793" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comparative Analysis of 10 - 50 MeV Solar Proton Events at Lagrange Point 1 and the Geostationary Orbit</a><span class="id">[2511.04793]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar proton events (SPEs) pose radiation hazards, disrupt technology, and impact operations on Earth and in space, making continuous monitoring essential. We compare 10-50 MeV proton flux measurements from SOHO/EPHIN at Lagrange Point 1 (L1) with those from NOAA/GOES in geostationary orbit (GEO) during Solar Cycle 23 and most of Cycle 24. We identify 83 &gt;=10 pfu SPEs observed at both locations and classify them into S1-S4 categories (comparable to NOAA's solar radiation storm scales). EPHIN detected earlier onsets and longer durations across all categories, along with earlier peaks and ends for S1-S3, while GOES recorded slightly earlier peak and end times for S4. S1 median timing offsets (EPHIN relative to GOES) were -20 +/- 50 min (onsets), -1.00 +/- 1.42 hr (peaks), and -1.08 +/- 2.21 hr (ends), with similar trends for S2-S3 and near-simultaneity for S4 (peaks   -0.17 +/- 1.62 hr; ends   +0.04 +/- 3.33 hr). Flux comparisons show that EPHIN measurements modestly exceed GOES for S1 (median ratios  1.11 for peaks and  1.06 for fluence) and are lower than GOES for stronger events (peaks  0.97 +/- 0.29, 0.84 +/- 0.21; fluence  0.84 +/- 0.16, 0.75 +/- 0.16 for S2-S3). The EPHIN-to-GOES peak flux and fluence ratios reach 0.16 +/- 0.03 and 0.29 +/- 0.07, respectively, for S4 events, originating from contamination of lower-energy GOES channels. Correlation analyses show no significant flux dependence on geomagnetic indices, field strength, or spacecraft position, suggesting minimal near-Earth modulation of &gt;=10 MeV proton access at GEO. These results highlight systematic differences in how SPEs manifest at L1 versus GEO and offer practical guidance for forecasting beyond Earth's magnetosphere, supporting mission planning for near-Earth and cislunar exploration, including Artemis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using ML-based Regression Techniques to Mitigate GOES Energetic Proton Flux Data Contamination and Magnetospheric Effects</a><span class="id">[2511.04821]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Positioned at geostationary orbit (GEO)  36,000 km above Earth, NOAA's GOES series has recorded real-time energetic proton flux measurements crucial for space weather monitoring for over three decades. Although machine learning models have advanced solar energetic particle (SEP) event prediction using GOES data, the sudden yet sparse nature of SEP events necessitates high-quality proton flux measurements. Previous studies have identified contamination issues in GOES data, when the presence of higher-energy protons can cause parasitic signals in lower-energy GOES channels and lead to artificially elevated fluxes in lower energy ranges (e.g., 10 - 50 MeV). As of now, no universal correction method has been implemented for the publicly available NOAA data. In addition, the effects of Earth's magnetosphere on the 10 - 50 MeV particles are not fully understood yet. This study assesses a reconstruction method using concurrent solar proton event (SPE) measurements from SOHO-EPHIN, which align well with GOES measurements of SPEs across solar cycles 23 and the bulk of cycle 24, but represent the off-magnetospheric environment of the Lagrange 1 point. We train regression models on GOES proton fluxes across multiple energy bins, employing EPHIN fluxes as prediction targets. We expect that similar approaches can allow us to derive non-contaminated flux proxies that preserve valuable data and more accurately capture the characteristics of SPEs, providing a more stable dataset for analyzing SEP behavior and potentially improving SEP event prediction models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Empirical measures of the largest amounts of magnetically-induced radius inflation in low-mass stars</a><span class="id">[2511.04832]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Access to precise empirical estimates of stellar radii in recent decades has revealed that the radii of certain low-mass stars are inflated relative to stellar structure predictions. The largest inflations are found in magnetically active stars. Although various attempts have been made to incorporate magnetic effects into stellar structure codes, a major source of uncertainty is associated with our lack of knowledge as to how the field strength varies inside the star. Here, we point out that a recent study of 44 eclipsing binaries in the Kepler field by Cruz et al. may enable us for the first time to set an upper limit Bc on the field strengths inside the 88 stars in the sample. According to our magneto-convective model, the largest empirical inflations reported by Cruz et al. can be replicated if Bc is about 10 kG inside stars with masses greater than 0.65 MSun. On the other hand, in lower mass stars, especially those with masses less than 0.4 MSun, our model predicts that the largest empirical inflations may require significantly stronger fields, i.e. Bc approximately 100-300 kG.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dual Nature of Solar Wind Structuring: Resonant Standing Waves and Laval Nozzle Dynamics in Coronal Streamers</a><span class="id">[2511.04850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Periodic Density Structures (PDS) observed in white-light coronagraphs represent a fundamental challenge to conventional solar wind paradigms. Through systematic analysis of multi-instrument observations and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that coronal streamers operate as dual-nature systems: magnetohydrodynamic resonators that establish global periodicity through standing waves (122, 61, 41 minutes) and Laval nozzles that generate local flow structures through shock-driven oscillations (93, 47, 31, 23 minutes). The resonant mechanism dominates PDS formation, explaining their universal occurrence across 85\% of streamers, coherence over 10+ cycles, and persistence to 1 AU with only 0.1\% energy loss. Nozzle oscillations, while limited to 35\% of overexpanded streamers and maintaining only 1-2 cycle coherence, play crucial secondary roles in vortex formation and provide the essential converging-diverging geometry for supersonic solar wind acceleration. This dual-mechanism framework resolves longstanding puzzles in solar wind structuring while revealing the hierarchical organization of standing-wave and flow processes in astrophysical plasmas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04857" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCATTER Common Envelope Formalism for Triples</a><span class="id">[2511.04857]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many stars are components of triple-star systems, or of higher-order multiples. In such systems mass transfer is common, and when the transfer is dynamically unstable, a common envelope forms. As such, it is important to be able to compute the post-common-envelope orbital separations among the various stars comprising the system, and to determine whether the common envelope induces mergers and/or makes later mergers inevitable. In this paper we compute the results of common-envelope evolution for triples. We employ the SCATTER formalism, a new approach to the computation of post-common-envelope separations. This work has applications to gravitational mergers, Type Ia supernovae, and a broad range of highly energetic phenomena.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04874" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calcium Excess in Novae: Beyond Nuclear Physics Uncertainties</a><span class="id">[2511.04874]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine Ca abundances in classical novae from spectroscopic observations spanning 65 years and investigate whether they are systematically high compared to those predicted by nova models. For the first time, we perform Monte Carlo simulations assessing the impact of nuclear reaction rate uncertainties on abundances predicted by multi-zone nova models. While the Ca abundances in the models are sensitive to variations of rates of the reactions 37Ar(p,gamma)38K and 38K(p,gamma)39Ca, the nuclear physics uncertainties of these reactions cannot account for the discrepancy between the observed and predicted Ca abundances in novae. Furthermore, the overabundance of Ca has important implications for measuring 7Be in nova ejecta, as Ca lines are used to estimate 7Be abundances. If the Ca abundance is incorrectly determined, it could lead to inaccurate 7Be abundance estimates. Possible alternative explanations for the observed Ca overabundance are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Energetic Role of Forward Neutrino Scattering in Core-Collapse Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2511.04896]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit neutrino-matter coupling in the post-shock region of core-collapse supernovae by restoring nuclear recoil in coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS). The resulting local energy transfer (a few keV per  10 MeV neutrino) accumulates across the  100 km stalled-shock layer, yielding a total heating of 10^49-10^50 erg, comparable within an order of magnitude to the increment required to trigger shock revival in current multidimensional simulations. This indicates that the long-standing failure of isoenergetic transport schemes to revive the shock originates from their neglect of recoil kinematics. Because the momentum exchange in each scattering is tiny, the emergent neutrino spectra and lepton-number balance remain essentially unchanged. The result highlights nuclear recoil as a minimal yet physically grounded correction to standard neutrino transport, providing a self-consistent route toward reliable explosion modeling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigation on the Predictive Potentiality of Photospheric Magnetic Parameters for Distinguishing Confined from Eruptive Solar Flares</a><span class="id">[2511.04955]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A question often arises as to why some solar flares are confined in the lower corona while others, termed eruptive flares, are associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Here we intend to rank the importance of pre-flare magnetic parameters of active regions in their potentiality to predict whether an imminent flare will be eruptive or confined. We compiled a dataset comprising 277 solar flares of GOES-class M1.0 and above, taking place within 45 deg from the disk center between 2010 and 2023, involving 94 active regions. Among the 277 flares, 135 are confined and 142 are eruptive. Our statistical analysis reveals that the magnetic parameters that are most relevant to the flare category are: total unsigned magnetic flux $\Phi$, mean magnetic shear angle $\Theta$ along the polarity inversion line (PIL), photospheric free magnetic energy $E_f$, and centroid distance $d$ between opposite polarities. These four parameters are not independent of each other, but in combination, might be promising in distinguishing confined from eruptive flares. For a subset of 77 flares with high-gradient PILs, the area of high free energy regions ($A_{\mathrm{Hi}}$) becomes the most effective parameter related to the flare type, with confined flares possessing larger $A_{\mathrm{Hi}}$ than eruptive ones. Our results corroborate the general concept that the eruptive behavior of solar flares is regulated by an interplay between the constraining overlying flux, which is often dominant in both $\Phi$ and $E_f$ and related to $d$, and the current-carrying core flux, which is related to $\Theta$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Precise Measurement of Cosmic Ray Light and Helium Spectra above 0.1 Peta-electron-Volt</a><span class="id">[2511.05013]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report a measurement of the cosmic ray helium energy spectrum in the energy interval 0.16 – 13 PeV, derived by subtracting the proton spectrum from the light component (proton and helium) spectrum obtained with observations made by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) under a consistent energy scale. The helium spectrum shows a significant hardening centered at $E \simeq$ 1.1 PeV, followed by a softening at $\sim$ 7 PeV, indicating the appearance of a helium `knee'. Comparing the proton and helium spectra in the LHAASO energy range reveals some remarkable facts. In the lower part of this range, in contrast to the behavior at lower energies, the helium spectrum is significantly softer than the proton spectrum. This results in protons overtaking helium nuclei and becoming the largest cosmic ray component at $E \simeq$ 0.7 PeV. A second crossing of the two spectra is observed at $E \simeq$ 5 PeV, above the proton knee, when helium nuclei overtake protons to become the largest cosmic ray component again.

SMC X-1 is a high-mass X-ray binary exhibiting a 0.7 s X-ray pulsar and a non-stationary superorbital modulation with periods ranging from approximately 40 to 65 days. Its peak luminosity of $1.3\times10^{39}$ \lumcgs\ makes it a local analogue of ultraluminous X-ray pulsars powered by supercritical accretion. We find that the spin-up rate during the high state remains consistent with the long-term average, with no significant correlation between spin-up rate and flux. This result indicates that the modulation is primarily geometric rather than accretion-driven. The hardness ratio and spectral shape are stable throughout the entire superorbital cycle, supporting obscuration by optically thick material or energy-independent scattering. In addition, the 2–20 keV pulse profile varies with superorbital phase, which may be explained either by variable covering fraction due to geometric obscuration, or by free precession of the neutron star. This represents the first complete measurement of spin-up rate and spectral evolution across a single superorbital cycle in SMC X-1, highlighting the scientific capability of CubeSat-based observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Lorentz Invariance Violation at High Energies Using LHAASO Observations of GRB221009A via DisCan Algorithm</a><span class="id">[2511.05062]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) predicted by some quantum gravity theories would manifest as an energy-dependent speed of light, which may potentially distort the observed temporal profile of photons from astrophysical sources at cosmological distances. The dispersion cancellation (DisCan) algorithm offers a powerful methodology for investigating such effects by employing quantities such as Shannon entropy, which reflects the initial temporal characteristics. In this study, we apply the DisCan algorithm to search for LIV effects in the LHAASO observations of GRB 221009A, combining data from both the WCDA and KM2A detectors that collectively span an energy range of $\sim 0.2-13$ TeV. Our analysis accounts for the uncertainties from both energy resolution and temporal binning.

Theoretical studies suggest that this system originated from a neutron star (NS) intermediate-mass or high-mass X-ray binary that underwent common envelope (CE) evolution, leading to the successful ejection of the giant envelope. The traditional view is that hypercritical accretion during the CE phase may have recycled the NS. However, the specific mechanism responsible for accelerating its spin period remains uncertain due to the complex processes involved in CE this http URL this study, we investigate the influence of Roche lobe overflow (RLO) accretion that takes place prior to the CE phase on the spin evolution of NSs. Our primary objective is to clarify how this process affects the spin characteristics of pulsars. We utilized the stellar evolution code \texttt{MESA} and the binary population synthesis code \texttt{BSE} to model the formation and evolution of NS-He star binaries. We calculated the distributions of the orbital period, He star mass, NS spin period, and magnetic field for NS + He star systems in the Galaxy. Our results indicate that RLO accretion preceding the CE phase could spin up NSs to millisecond periods through super-Eddington accretion. Considering a range of CE efficiencies $\alpha_{\rm CE}$ from 0.3 to 3, we estimate the birthrate (total number) of NS + He star systems in our Galaxy to be 9.0$\times 10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ (626 systems) to 1.9$\times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ (2684 systems).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05093" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sym-EFT: Accelerating Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure with Symbolic Regression</a><span class="id">[2511.05093]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an emulator suite for the one- and two-loop cold dark matter power spectrum from the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS).

The nature of the jet and the configuration of the local magnetic fields are still unclear, with the distinction between different models possibly provided by the detection of early-time polarisation. Past observations do not agree on a universal scenario describing early-time polarisation in GRB afterglows, and new studies are necessary to investigate this open question. We present here the discovery of GRB 240419A, its redshift determination of $z=5.178$, its early-time optical polarimetry observations, and the multi-wavelength monitoring of its afterglow. We analysed three epochs of polarimetric data to derive the early-time evolution of the polarisation. The multi-wavelength light curve from the X-rays to the near-infrared band was also investigated to give a broader perspective on the whole event. We find a high level of polarisation, $P=6.97^{+1.84}_{-1.52}$ \%, at 1740 s after the GRB trigger, followed by a slight decrease up to $P=4.81^{+1.87}_{-1.53}$ \% at 3059 s. On the same timescale, the polarisation position angle is nearly constant. The multi-band afterglow at the time of the polarisation measurements is consistent with a forward shock (FS), while the earlier evolution at $t-t_0\lesssim700$ s can be associated with the interplay between the forward and the reverse shocks or with energy injection. The detected polarised radiation when the afterglow is FS-dominated and the stable position angle are consistent with an ordered magnetic field plus a turbulent component driven by large-scale magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. The lack of a jet break in the light curve prevents a comparison of the polarisation temporal evolution with theoretical expectations from magnetic fields amplified by microscopic-scale turbulence, limiting ...</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for Electromagnetic Counterpart Candidates to GW231123</a><span class="id">[2511.05144]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of GW231123, a gravitational-wave (GW) event with exceptionally massive and rapidly spinning black holes, suggests the possible formation within an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, which provides a favorable environment for potentially generating an observable electromagnetic (EM) counterpart.

The orbital period ratio of the two outermost planets, namely TOI-282 c and d, is close to the 3:2 commensurability, suggesting that the planets might be trapped in a mean motion resonance. We combined space-borne photometry from the TESS telescope with high-precision HARPS and ESPRESSO Doppler measurements to refine orbital parameters, measure the planetary masses, and investigate the architecture and evolution of the system. We performed a Markov chain Monte Carlo joint analysis of the transit light curves and radial velocity time series, and carried out a dynamical analysis to model transit timing variations and Doppler measurements along with N-body integration.

To this end, we analysed 14 ARs with powerful flares and 14 ARs without powerful flares. For each event, images obtained in the 171 Åand 94 ÅAIA/SDO channels with 12-second cadence for 4 hours before the flare were retrieved and analysed. For ARs without powerful flares, arbitrary time intervals of similar duration were considered for comparison. Since the decayless oscillations have a very low amplitude (1-2 AIA/SDO pixels), we used the Motion Magnification technique to amplify the amplitude of these oscillations. Time-distance maps were constructed from the processed images in the 171 Åchannel, from which oscillatory patterns were extracted 'manually'. Wavelet analysis was performed to check for changes in the oscillation period. No systematic changes were found. No obvious differences in the behaviour of oscillations in ARs with and without powerful flares were detected either. Additional information was obtained on coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from ARs in the vicinity of the time intervals under consideration. Based on the results of the analysis of a small sample of events, we came to the preliminary conclusion that the registration and analysis of decayless kink oscillations of high (  100-600 Mm) coronal loops based on this methodology is not promising for predicting powerful flares and CMEs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Co-existence of Internal Gravity Waves and Tayler-Spruit Magnetic Fields in the Radiative Core of Low-mass Stars</a><span class="id">[2511.05181]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Tayler-Spruit dynamo (TSD) is able to generate a small-scale magnetic field in the differentially rotating stably stratified layers of stars and was recently observed in numerical simulations. In parallel, the propagation of internal gravity waves in stars can be modified in the presence of a magnetic field. Here we first want to estimate the interaction between a magnetic field generated by the TSD and internal gravity waves in the radiative core of low-mass stars. This allows us to then characterise the effect of this interplay on the observed standing modes spectrum and on the internal transport of angular momentum by progressive waves. To do this, we use the STAREVOL evolution code to compute the structure of low-mass rotating stars along their evolution. In particular, we implement a formalism to describe the TSD and estimate the regions where the generated magnetic field is strong enough to change the identity of internal gravity waves to magneto-gravity waves. In addition, we evaluate the possible limitation of angular momentum transport by the combined action of rotation and magnetism. We show that along the pre-main sequence and main-sequence evolution, the lowest frequencies of the excited gravity wave spectrum could be converted to magneto-gravity waves by the magnetic field generated by the TSD. During the red-giant branch we find that most of the excited spectrum of progressive internal gravity waves could be converted into magneto-gravity waves in the very central region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05248" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiplicity of stellar systems in the solar neighbourhood, wide binaries, and planet-hosting stars</a><span class="id">[2511.05248]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This doctoral thesis studies stellar multiplicity in the solar neighborhood (d &lt; 10 pc) and in systems hosting planets (d &lt; 100 pc). Using data from the Washington Double Star Catalogue, Gaia DR3, and a comprehensive literature review, it builds the most complete and homogeneous sample of multiple systems within 10 pc. Multiplicity and companion fractions are derived with reduced uncertainties, providing improved statistical reliability. The analysis of orbital periods from one day to millions of years shows that the log-normal cumulative distribution can be seen as a modern revision of Öpik's law. A key contribution is the study of wide binaries ({\rho} &gt; 1000 arcsec) with Gaia DR3, expanding the known sample by over an order of magnitude and improving astrometric precision. Newly identified companions, including ultracool dwarfs at the M-L boundary and a hot white dwarf, refine the distinction between true binaries and unrelated young moving-group members. The thesis also explores the effect of multiplicity on exoplanetary systems within 100 pc. New stellar companions are found in known planetary systems, with separations for over 200 pairs and parameters compiled for 276 exoplanets. Compared to single-star systems, multiple systems host more massive, short-period, and high-eccentricity planets. About 22% of exoplanetary systems have stellar companions, with significant (&gt; 4 {\sigma}) correlations between high eccentricities and small projected separations, and a weaker (&gt; 2 {\sigma}) trend showing that massive planets (M &gt; 40 M_Earth) orbit closer in multiple systems. Finally, a review of Giovanni Battista Hodierna's 17th-century catalogues shows he compiled the first list of multiple systems over a century earlier than previously believed, advancing the understanding of stellar multiplicity and its influence on planetary formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Mass-Independent Damping Timescale in Black Hole Accretion Systems</a><span class="id">[2511.05268]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The scaling laws reveal the underlying structural similarities shared by astrophysical systems across vastly different scales. In black hole accretion systems, the scaling relations between the characteristic damping timescales (CDTs) of light curves and black hole mass offer valuable insights into the underlying physical structure of accretion disks. We investigate, for the first time, the long-term hard X-ray variability of black hole and neutron star accretion systems using light curves from the \textit{Swift} Burst Alert Telescope 157-month catalog. Applying a damped random walk model, we measure CDTs for 39 Seyfert galaxies, 17 blazars, 82 X-ray binaries, and one tidal disruption event. Unexpectedly, these CDTs span months to years but with a mass-independent feature, in contrast to well-established scaling laws. This puzzling phenomenon can be attributed to conductive timescales arising from disk–corona interactions, instead of the intrinsic accretion disk processes characterized by scaling laws, and it may further modulate jet emission in blazars. This result demonstrates thermal conduction as a key mechanism driving hard X-ray variability and offers new observational evidence for the disk–corona–jet connection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Focus Point on Tensions in Cosmology from Early to Late Universe: Part II: New Directions in the Light of Observations from the Most Modern Astronomical Facilities</a><span class="id">[2511.05279]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The papers included in this Focus Point collection are devoted to the studies on the cosmological tensions and challenges stimulated by the latest observational data.

Quadrupolar (l=2) mixed modes also contain information on the internal dynamics, but are very rarely characterised due to their low amplitude and the challenging identification of adjacent or overlapping rotationally split multiplets affected by near-degeneracy effects. We aim to extend broadly used asymptotic seismic diagnostics beyond l=1 mixed modes by developing an analogue asymptotic description of l=2 mixed modes, explicitly accounting for near-degeneracy effects that distort their rotational multiplets. We derive a new asymptotic formulation of near-degenerate mixed l=2 modes that describes off-diagonal terms representing the interaction between modes of adjacent radial orders. We implement the formalism within a global Bayesian mode-fitting framework, for a direct fit of all l=0,1,2 modes in the power spectrum density. We are able to asymptotically model the asymmetric rotational splitting present in various radial orders of l=2 modes observed in young red giant stars without the need for any numerical stellar modelling. Applied to the Kepler target KIC 7341231, our formalism yields core and envelope rotation rates consistent with previous numerical modelling, while providing improved constraints from the global and model-independent approach. We also characterise the new target KIC 8179973, measuring its rotation rate and mixed-mode parameters for the first time. The global fit allows for much better precision than standard methods, yielding better constraints for rotation inversions. We place the first observational constraints on the asymptotic l=2 mixed mode parameters (DPi_2,q_2,eps_g2), paving the way towards the use of asymptotic seismology beyond l=1 mixed modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A subpopulation of low-mass, spinning black holes: signatures of dynamical assembly</a><span class="id">[2511.05316]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational-wave observations of massive, rapidly spinning binary black holes mergers provide increasing evidence for the dynamical origin of some mergers. Previous studies have interpreted the mergers with primary mass $\gtrsim45\,M_\odot$ as being dominated by hierarchical, second-generation mergers, with rapidly spinning primaries being the products of previous black hole mergers assembled in dense stellar clusters. In this work, we reveal confident evidence of another subpopulation with rapid and isotropic spins at low mass containing the two exceptional events GW241011 and GW241110, consistent with a hierarchical merger hypothesis. Our result suggests the mass distribution of the second-generation black holes is peaked at low primary masses of $\sim16\,M_\odot$ rather than $\gtrsim45\,M_\odot$ in the pair-instability gap. Such low-mass second-generation black holes must be formed from the merger of even lighter first-generation black holes, implying that dense, metal-rich stellar environments contribute to the binary black hole population. By separating the contamination of higher-generation black holes, our result reveals the primary mass distribution of first-generation black holes formed from stellar collapse, which shows a significant dip between $\sim12\,M_\odot$ to $\sim20\,M_\odot$. This may indicate a dearth of black holes due to variation in the core compactness of the progenitor.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reviving Quadratic Inflation: Minimal Deformation for CMB Compatibility and Reheating Consistency</a><span class="id">[2511.05341]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit the quadratic inflationary potential by introducing a minimal higher-order correction obtained through a simple field redefinition, leading to the potential V(chi) = (1/2) m^2 * (chi - (gamma/14) * chi^7)^2. While the uncorrected quadratic model predicts n_s approximately 0.967 and r approximately 0.13, in strong tension with CMB data, the corrected potential yields n_s approximately 0.965 and r approximately 0.036, fully consistent with Planck 2018 constraints. Beyond inflationary observables, the deformation also impacts the reheating phase. In the quadratic case, reheating corresponds to a matter-like regime with w_reh = 0, whereas the corrected potential gives w_reh approximately -0.011, a slightly softer equation of state. This modification raises the reheating temperature by a factor of about 3.4 (for N_reh = 10), or equivalently extends the reheating duration at fixed temperature. Our results demonstrate that even a minimal higher-order correction is sufficient to reconcile the quadratic model with observations while providing a more consistent post-inflationary history, highlighting the relevance of controlled deformations of simple inflationary scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A scaling relationship for non-thermal radio emission from ordered magnetospheres - II. Investigating the efficiency of relativistic electron production in magnetospheres of BA-type stars</a><span class="id">[2511.05378]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic BA stars host dipole-like magnetospheres. When detected as radio sources, their luminosities correlate with the magnetic field and rotation. Rotation is crucial because the mechanism undergirding the relativistic electron production is powered by centrifugal breakouts. CBOs occur wherever magnetic tension does not balance centrifugal force; the resulting magnetic reconnection provides particle acceleration. To investigate how physical conditions at the site of the CBOs affect the efficiency of the acceleration mechanism, we broadly explore the parameter space governing radio emission by increasing the sample of radio-loud magnetic stars. High-sensitivity VLA observations of 32 stars were performed in the hope of identifying new centrifugal magnetospheres and associated CBOs. We calculated gyro-synchrotron spectra using 3D modeling of a dipole-shaped magnetosphere. We evaluated combinations of parameters. The number of relativistic electrons was constrained by the need to produce the emission level predicted by the scaling relationship for the radio emission from magnetic BA stars. About half of the observed stars were detected, with luminosities in agreement with the expected values, reinforcing the robust nature of the scaling relationship for CBO-powered radio emission. Comparing the competing centrifugal and magnetic effects on plasma locked in a rigidly rotating magnetosphere, we located the site of CBOs and inferred the local plasma density. We then estimated the efficiency of the acceleration mechanism needed to produce enough non-thermal electrons to support the radio emission level. Given a constant acceleration efficiency, relativistic electrons represent a fixed fraction of the local thermal plasma. Thus, dense magnetospheres host more energetic particles than less dense ones; consequently, with other parameters similar, they are intrinsically brighter radio sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling Solar Atmosphere Dynamics with MAGEC</a><span class="id">[2511.05380]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modeling the solar atmosphere is challenging due to its layered structure and multi-scale dynamics. We aim to validate the new radiative MHD code MAGEC, which combines the MANCHA and MAGNUS codes into a finite-volume, shock-capturing framework, and to test its performance through 2D simulations of magneto-convection. MAGEC is MPI-parallelized and includes improvements for coronal modeling, such as LTE radiative losses and a hyperbolic treatment of thermal conduction that mitigates restrictive time steps. We also estimated its numerical viscosity and resistivity. To assess robustness, we performed 2D simulations covering a domain from 2 Mm below the surface to 18.16 Mm into the corona, using both open and closed magnetic-field configurations. For each case, we analyzed steady-state temperature profiles and the contributions to the internal-energy balance at different heights. A separate experiment examined the role of perpendicular thermal conduction. MAGEC reproduced the expected temperature stratification set by boundary conditions and magnetic geometry, and all simulations reached thermal equilibrium. Open-field cases produced higher coronal temperatures than closed, arcade-like fields. Analysis of the explicit and implicit energy terms clarified their relative effects on heating and cooling. Perpendicular thermal conduction, often neglected in coronal models, was found to influence plasma dynamics near reconnection; although local effects are small, they can cumulatively modify the average coronal temperature. These results show that MAGEC is a reliable and efficient tool for radiative MHD simulations, well suited to capturing the shocks and dynamic processes of the solar atmosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charge-dependent spectral softenings of primary cosmic-rays from proton to iron below the knee</a><span class="id">[2511.05409]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In most particle acceleration mechanisms, the maximum energy of the cosmic rays can achieve is charge dependent. However, the observational verification of such a fundamental relation is still lack due to the difficulty of measuring the spectra of individual particles from one (kind of) source(s) up to very high energies. This work reports direct measurements of the carbon, oxygen, and iron spectra from   20 gigavolts to   100 teravolts (  60 teravolts for iron) with 9 years of on-orbit data collected by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE). Distinct spectral softenings have been directly detected in these spectra for the first time. Combined with the updated proton and helium spectra, the spectral softening appears universally at a rigidity of   15 teravolts. A nuclei mass dependent softening is rejected at a confidence level of &gt; 99.999%. Taking into account the correlated structures at similar energies in the large-scale anisotropies of cosmic rays, one of the most natural interpretations of the spectral structures is the presence of a nearby cosmic ray source. In this case, the softening energies correspond to the acceleration upper limits of such a source, forming the so-called Peters cycle of the spectra. The results thus offer observational verification of the long-standing prediction of the charge-dependent energy limit of cosmic ray acceleration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recovering Ion Distribution Functions: II. Gyrotropic Slepian Reconstruction of Solar Wind Electrostatic Analyzer Measurements</a><span class="id">[2511.05415]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Velocity distribution functions (VDF) are an essential observable for studying kinetic and wave-particle processes in solar wind plasmas. To experimentally distinguish modes of heating, acceleration, and turbulence in the solar wind, precise representations of particle phase space VDFs are needed. In the first paper of this series, we developed the Slepian Basis Reconstruction (SBR) method to approximate fully agyrotropic continuous distributions from discrete measurements of electrostatic analyzers (ESAs). The method enables accurate determination of plasma moments, preserves kinetic features, and prescribes smooth gradients in phase space. In this paper, we extend the SBR method by imposing gyrotropic symmetry (g-SBR). Incorporating this symmetry enables high-fidelity reconstruction of VDFs that are partially measured, as from an ESA with a limited field-of-view (FOV). We introduce three frameworks for g-SBR, the gyrotropic Slepian Basis Reconstruction: (A) 1D angular Slepian functions on a polar-cap, (B) 2D Slepian functions in a Cartesian plane, and (C) a hybrid method. We employ model distributions representing multiple anisotropic ion populations in the solar wind to benchmark these methods, and we show that the g-SBR method produces a reconstruction that preserves kinetic structures and plasma moments, even with a strongly limited FOV. For our choice of model distribution, g-SBR can recover $\geq90\%$ of the density when only $20\%$ is measured. We provide the package \texttt{gdf} for open-source use and contribution by the heliophysics community. This work establishes direct pathways to bridge particle observations with kinetic theory and simulations, facilitating the investigation of gyrotropic plasma heating phenomena across the heliosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05419" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crossing the veil of the brightest radio relic in the sky MACS J0717.6+3745</a><span class="id">[2511.05419]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-frequency, full-polarisation Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) radio data at X-band of the radio relic: MACS J0717.5+3745. Radio relics trace shock waves in the intracluster medium (ICM) produced during mergers. Understanding the physical characteristics of relics is important for determining their nature, whether for example they are thermal ICM electrons that are accelerated, or whether they are fossil electrons re-accelerated by a merger event. Radio spectropolarimetric analysis, such as the Stokes QU-fitting, provides a diagnostic of the nature and structure of the magnetized plasma internal or external to the source, with important implications for theoretical models. The high-frequency polarisation analysis presented here shows, for the first time, a change in the magneto-ionic structure compared to the low-frequency data available in the literature. These high-frequency, polarised data could be interpreted also with an internal depolarisation behaviour and this new finding may be used to investigate possible particle acceleration mechanism. If that is true, the change in the behaviour of the polarised signal could be tracing physical properties of a population of non-thermal particles that are undergoing to a re-acceleration of particles in the relic by large-scale internal shocks of Active Galactic Nuclei jet fossil particles ejected from the central Narrow Angle Tail radio galaxy. New upcoming broad-band VLA X- and Ku-bands data will clarify this. Finally, we conclude that high-frequency, high-sensitive, spectropolarimetric radio data should be explored further, as they can effectively trace shock fronts and thereby provide insights into the intrinsic magneto-ionic properties of radio components.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper Limits on Radio Emission from the K2-18 System</a><span class="id">[2511.05427]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar and planetary magnetic fields play a crucial role in the habitability of a planet and the integrity of its atmosphere. The recently claimed detection of biosignatures, methane, carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide/disulfide, in the atmosphere of K2-18 b, a sub-Neptune orbiting an M dwarf star present an intriguing question regarding the stellar magnetic environment and the resistance of the planet's magnetosphere (if it exists) to erosion by magnetic activity from the host. To probe for radio emission from the system, we have conducted observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at S, C and X-bands (2-4, 4.5-7.5 and 8-10 GHz respectively) to search for coherent and incoherent radio emission. We detect no radio emission associated with incoherent emission mechanisms. We report $3\sigma$ Stokes I upper limits of $49.8\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at S-band, $17.7\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$at C-band and $18.0\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at X-band and an upper limit of the ratio of the radio to the total bolometric luminosity of $\log L_\text{R}/\log L_\text{bol}&lt;-8.8$. We have also searched for short duration bursts associated with coherent emission mechanisms at C and X-bands . No signals above a $3\sigma$ significance threshold are detected. Although no signals are detected our radio observations offer constraints, albeit limited, on the stellar magnetic environment supporting recent X-ray observations indicating K2-18 is a very faint emitter. Our results also contextualise any planetary transmission spectra by providing constraints on the activity level of the host.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chemical Evolution and Kilonova Implications of Post-Merger Accretion Disk Winds</a><span class="id">[2511.05473]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Several gamma ray bursts have recently been associated with a kilonova emission. We study the mechanisms which could account for this effect, by means of radioactive decay of elements synthesized in accretion disk wind. We model the r-process nucleosynthesis in the accretion disk wind system, asscociated with the prompt GRB phase. We compute the time-dependent GR MHD evolution of a GRB central engine where the newly formed black hole is accreting the mass from post-merger remnant. We explore the wind properties, for a range of the initial parameters of the system, and study representative cases for compact binary merger progenitors. We compute a suite of 2D and 3D time-dependent General Relativistic numerical simulations with a tabulated 3-parameter equation of state that allows for evolution of chemical composition evolution of the accretion flow. The neutrino emission is accounted for by incorporating the leakage scheme, where neutrino optical depth is calculated along the radial rays. We parameterize the optically thick and thin tori with different values of the pressure maximum and entropy in the disk, while the strength of large-scale poloidal magnetic fields is parameterized according to the chosen gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio. To probe the winds, we follow the particle trajectories. Upon this, we derive the nucleosynthetic yields of heavy elements in the outflows, and we map the regions of Lanthanide rich and poor ejecta. We find that the outflow carries high mass of neutron rich material expanding with mildly relativistic velocities. Our accretion disks operating under the SANE mode can power the GRB jets via neutrino annihilation, if the disk to BH mass ratio is larger than about 0.01 and the black hole is spinning. Slowly spinning black holes surrounded by massive post-merger disks can power these jets, and also be the sites of efficient nucleosynthesis of Lanthanides.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-Gaussian Galaxy Stochasticity and the Noise-Field Formulation</a><span class="id">[2511.05484]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit the stochastic, or noise, contributions to the galaxy density field within the effective field theory (EFT) of large-scale structure.

We introduce an alternative formulation of the partition function in terms of such a noise field, and derive the corresponding field-level likelihood for biased tracers. This noise-field formulation can capture the complete set of stochastic contributions to the galaxy density at the field level in a normalized, positive-definite probability density which is suitable for numerical sampling.

Many astrophysical models and beyond the Standard Model physics scenarios have been proposed to explain these observations. We investigate, for the first time, the implications of dark matter (DM) scattering with baryons (protons and electrons) in light of the JWST UV luminosity function (UVLF) observations. These interactions suppress structure formation on galactic scales, which may have an observable effect on the UVLF measurements at high redshifts. Using a recent galaxy formation model designed to explain high-redshift observations, we obtain strong upper limits on DM-baryon scattering cross-sections and explore new regions of the parameter space. For DM-proton scattering with cross-section $\propto v^{-2}$ velocity dependence, we obtain the strongest limit for DM masses of $\sim$ 1 – 500 MeV. For other cases that we study (DM-proton scattering cross-section $\propto v^{0},\,v^{-4}$, and DM-electron scattering cross-section $\propto v^{0},\,v^{-2},\,v^{-4}$), our limits are competitive with those obtained from other cosmological observables. Our study highlights the potential of JWST observations as a novel and powerful probe of non-gravitational interactions of DM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Higgs inflation in Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity</a><span class="id">[2511.04732]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this short note we analyze the inflationary dynamics in Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity coupled to the Standard Model of particle physics.

The associated dark gauge boson, namely the dark photon, serves as a viable DM candidate, which we call dark photon dark matter (DPDM), whilst the dark Higgs field drives inflation. We explore a low-reheating scenario where DM production occurs during reheating, resulting in significant entropy dilution of the DPDM abundance. Both weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP) DM scenarios are explored, depending on the dark gauge coupling strength. For FIMP-type DM, the entropy dilution allows for stronger couplings whilst maintaining the correct relic abundance, potentially bringing these candidates within the reach of current and near-future detection experiments. Similarly, WIMP-type DM can be realised with weaker couplings. We perform a comprehensive parameter scan incorporating constraints from collider data, DM direct and indirect detection experiments, and cosmological observations. Taking quantum corrections and running of the couplings into account, we demonstrate that dark Higgs inflation yields predictions for the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ that are consistent with the Planck, BICEP/Keck, and ACT data. The nonminimal coupling of the dark Higgs inflaton field to gravity is shown to be much smaller than in the case of the SM Higgs inflation scenario, avoiding unitarity concerns. We show that reheating temperatures as low as 1 GeV and 1 MeV can be achieved through the decay and scattering processes of the inflaton, respectively, with the latter allowing for larger Higgs mixing angles and enhanced detection prospects. Our results establish that this minimal extension successfully unifies DM physics with inflationary cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05296" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exact Renormalisation Group Evolution of the Inflation Dynamics: Reconciling $α$-Attractors with ACT</a><span class="id">[2511.05296]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a non-perturbative framework for the dynamics of slow-roll inflation that consistently incorporates quantum corrections, based on an alternative functional renormalisation group (RG) approach.

Starting from a nonperturbative holomorphic inner product derived from the reality conditions of the self-dual Ashtekar variables, we show that the linearization, in terms of gravitons, of the CSK state is perturbatively normalizable for super-Planckian cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a rotation in phase space, a generalization of Thiemann's complexifier, can render the full perturbative state normalizable for all $\Lambda$ by analytically continuing the non-convergent modes in phase space. This provides the first concrete realization of a CPT-breaking, yet normalizable, gravitational vacuum state rooted in a nonperturbative quantum gravity framework.

One promising choice is to use the same galaxy sample as lenses and sources, which reduces the systematics parameter space that describes uncertainties related to galaxy samples. Such a “lens-equal-source” analysis significantly improves self-calibration of photo-z systematics leading to improved cosmological constraints. With the aim to enable a lens-equal-source analysis on small scales we investigate the halo-galaxy connection of DES-Y3 source galaxies. We develop a technique to construct mock source galaxy populations by matching COSMOS/UltraVISTA photometry onto {\sc{UniverseMachine}} galaxies. These mocks predict a source halo occupation distribution (HOD) that exhibits significant redshift evolution, non-trivial central incompleteness and galaxy assembly bias. We produce multiple realizations of mock source galaxies drawn from the {\sc{UniverseMachine}} posterior with added uncertainties in measured DES photometry and galaxy shapes. We fit a modified HOD formalism to these realizations to produce priors on the galaxy-halo connection for cosmological analyses. We additionally train an emulator that predicts this HOD to $\sim2\%$ accuracy from redshift $z = 0.1 - 1.3$ that models the dependence of this HOD on 1) observational uncertainties in galaxy size and photometry, and 2) uncertainties in the {\sc{UniverseMachine}} predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06874" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The distribution of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays along the supergalactic plane measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory</a><span class="id">[2407.06874]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are known to be mainly of extragalactic origin, and their propagation is limited by energy losses, so their arrival directions are expected to correlate with the large-scale structure of the local Universe.

Some massive ($M_{\rm ZAMS}\gtrsim20M_\odot$) Pop III stars are expected to suffer core-collapse and launch a relativistic jet that would power a GRB. In the collapsar scenario, a key requirement is that the pre-supernova star imparts sufficient angular momentum to the remnant black hole to form an accretion disc and launch a relativistic jet, which demands rapid initial rotation of the progenitor star and suppression of line-driven mass loss during its chemically homogeneous evolution. Here we explore a grid of stellar evolution models of Pop III stars with masses $20\leq M_{\rm ZAMS}/M_\odot \leq 100$, which are initially rotating with surface angular velocities $0.6\leq \Omega_0/\Omega_{\rm crit}\leq 0.9$, where centrifugally-driven mass loss ensues for $\Omega&gt;\Omega_{\rm crit}$. Realistic accretion and jet propagation models are used to derive the initial black hole masses and spins, and jet breakout times for these stars. The GRB production efficiency is obtained over a phase space comprising progenitor initial mass, rotation, and wind efficiency. For modest wind efficiency of $\eta_{\rm wind}=0.45-0.35$, the Pop III GRB production efficiency is $\eta_{\rm GRB}\sim10^{-5}-3\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot^{-1}$, respectively, for a top-heavy IMF. This yields an observable all-sky equivalent rate of $\sim2-40\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ by \textit{Swift}, with 75\% of the GRBs located at $z\lesssim8$. If the actual observed rate is much lower, then this would imply $\eta_{\rm wind}&gt;0.45$, which leads to significant loss of mass and angular momentum that renders isolated Pop III stars incapable of producing GRBs and favors a binary scenario instead.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10573" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on the progenitor and explosion of SN 2024ggi in harmony with pre-explosion detection and hydrodynamic simulations</a><span class="id">[2508.10573]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernova (SN) 2024ggi is a nearby Type II SN discovered by ATLAS, showing early flash-ionization features. The pre-explosion images reveal a red supergiant (RSG) progenitor with an initial mass of 10-17 M$_\odot$. In the present work, we perform detailed hydrodynamic modeling to refine and put robust constraints on the progenitor and explosion parameters of SN 2024ggi. Among the progenitor models in our study, the pre-SN properties of the 11 M$_{\odot}$ match the pre-explosion detected progenitor well. However, we find it difficult to completely rule out the 10 M$_{\odot}$ and 12 M$_{\odot}$ models. Thus, we provide a constraint of 11$^{+1}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ on the initial mass of the progenitor. To match the observed bolometric light curve and velocity evolution of SN 2024ggi, the favored model with an initial mass of 11 M$_{\odot}$ has a pre-SN radius of 800 R$_{\odot}$. This model requires an explosion energy of [0.7-0.8]$\times$10$^{51}$ erg, nickel mass of 0.049 M$_{\odot}$, ejecta mass of 9.1 M$_{\odot}$, and an amount of $\sim$ 0.5 M$_{\odot}$ of steady-wind CSM extended up to $\sim1.2\times10^{14}$ cm resulting from an eruptive mass-loss rate of 1.0 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We also incorporate the accelerated-wind CSM scenario, which suggests a mass-loss rate of 1.0$\times10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a CSM mass of $\sim$ 0.7 M$_{\odot}$ extended up to $\sim1.1\times10^{14}$ cm. This mass-loss rate falls within the range constrained observationally. Additionally, due to the constraint of 11$^{+1}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ on the initial mass, the range of pre-SN radius and ejecta mass would be [690-900] R$_{\odot}$, and [8.2-9.6] M$_{\odot}$, respectively.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renormalization-Free Galaxy Bias in Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory</a><span class="id">[2509.04142]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a renormalization-free framework for modeling galaxy bias based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). In this approach, the biased density fluctuation is built solely from Galileon-type operators associated with the intrinsic nonlinear growth of dark matter. This ensures the bias expansion is well defined at the field level, automatically satisfies statistical conditions of vanishing ensemble and volume averages, and removes the need for ad hoc renormalization. We derive analytic one-loop expressions for the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter power spectra and implement an efficient numerical algorithm using \texttt{FFTLog} and \texttt{FAST-PT}, enabling rapid and accurate evaluation. The model requires only a minimal set of bias parameters: three parameters are sufficient to describe correlation functions in configuration space, while four parameters are needed for power spectra in Fourier space. To test accuracy, we jointly fit halo auto- and cross-spectra from the \textit{Dark Emulator}, covering nine redshift-mass combinations with 100 cosmologies each. A single set of bias parameters reproduces both spectra within $\sim1\%$ up to $k \simeq 0.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for typical linear bias $b_1 \sim 0.8$-2, and to $k \simeq 0.2\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $b_1 \sim 3$. The same parameters also match two-point correlation functions down to $r \simeq 15\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. Moreover, ULPT predicts the relation $b_{K^2}^{\mathrm{E}} = -\tfrac{3}{4} b_2^{\mathrm{E}}$, validated against $N$-body results. These results demonstrate that ULPT provides a physically consistent and efficient model for nonlinear galaxy bias, with applications to redshift-space distortions, bispectra, and reconstruction.

We present self-consistent thermochemical disk models built with DiskMINT, which extends its initial framework to allow for spatially decoupled gas and dust distributions. DiskMINT calculates the gas temperature based on thermal equilibrium with dust grains, solves vertical gas hydrostatic equilibrium, and includes key processes for the CO chemistry, specifically selective photodissociation, and freeze-out with conversion CO/CO$_2$ ice. We apply DiskMINT to study the IM Lup disk, a large massive disk, yet with an inferred CO depletion of up to 100 based on earlier thermochemical models. By fitting the multi-wavelength SED along with the millimeter continuum, ${\rm C^{18}O}$ radial emission profiles, we find $0.02-0.08\,{\rm M_\odot}$ for the gas disk mass, which are consistent with the dynamical-based mass within the uncertainties. We further compare the derived surface densities for dust and gas and find that the outer disk is drift-dominated, with a dust-to-gas mass ratio of approximately 0.01-0.02, which is likely insufficient to meet the conditions for the streaming instability to occur. Our results suggest that when interpreted with self-consistent thermochemical models, ${\rm C^{18}O}$ alone can serve as a reliable tracer of both the total gas mass and its radial distribution. This approach enables gas mass estimates in lower-mass disks, where dynamical constraints are not available, and in fainter systems where rare species like ${\rm N_2H^+}$ are too weak to detect.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hubble Tension resolved by the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations Measurements</a><span class="id">[2509.17454]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological observations. However, severe challenges to the phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM model have emerged recently, including the Hubble constant tension and the significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration. Despite many explanations for the two challenges have been proposed, the origins of them are still intriguing mysteries. Here, we investigate the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) measurements to interpret the Hubble constant tension. Employing a non-parametric method, we find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift from DESI BAO data and type Ia supernovae. From the Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) is derived from $w(z)$ model-independently. We find that the values of $H_0$ show a descending trend as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant tension. Our study finds that the two unexpected challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM model can be understood in one physical framework, e.g., dynamical dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Not All Sub-Neptune Exoplanets Have Magma Oceans</a><span class="id">[2509.20429]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The evolution and structure of sub-Neptunes may be strongly influenced by interactions between the outer gaseous envelope of the planet and a surface magma ocean. However, given the wide variety of permissible interior structures of these planets, it is unclear whether conditions at the envelope-mantle boundary will always permit a molten silicate layer, or whether some sub-Neptunes might instead host a solid silicate surface. In this work, we use internal structure modeling to perform an extensive exploration of surface conditions within the sub-Neptune population across a range of bulk and atmospheric parameters. We find that a significant portion of the population may lack present-day magma oceans. In particular, planets with a high atmospheric mean molecular weight and large envelope mass fraction are likely to instead have a solid silicate surface, since the pressure at the envelope-mantle boundary is high enough that the silicates will be in solid post-perovskite phase. This result is particularly relevant given recent inferences of high-mean molecular weight atmospheres from JWST observations of several sub-Neptunes. We apply this approach to a number of sub-Neptunes with existing or upcoming JWST observations, and find that in almost all cases, a range of solutions exist which do not possess a present-day magma ocean. Our analysis provides critical context for interpreting sub-Neptunes and their atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar limb faculae: intensity contrast from two vantage points</a><span class="id">[2510.00320]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Small-scale magnetic flux concentrations contribute significantly to the brightness variations of the Sun, yet observing them - particularly their magnetic field - near the solar limb remains challenging. Solar Orbiter offers an unprecedented second vantage point for observing the Sun. When combined with observations from the perspective of Earth, this enables simultaneous dual-viewpoint measurements of these magnetic structures, thereby helping to mitigate observational limitations. Using such a dual-viewpoint geometry, we characterise the brightness contrast of faculae near the limb as a function of both their associated magnetic field strength and the observation angle. We analyse data from Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on board Solar Orbiter (SO/PHI), obtained during an observation program conducted in near-quadrature configuration with Earth, in combination with data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI). The High Resolution Telescope of SO/PHI observed a facular region located near disc centre as seen from its vantage point, while the same region was simultaneously observed near the solar limb by SDO/HMI. We identify faculae and determine their magnetic field strength from the disc-centre observations, and combine these with continuum intensity measurements at the limb to derive dual-viewpoint contrast curves. We then compare these with contrast curves derived from SDO/HMI alone. Using two viewpoints, we consistently find higher facular contrast near the limb than from a single-viewpoint.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10340" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Picoflares in the Quiet Solar Corona: Solar Orbiter Observations Halfway to the Sun</a><span class="id">[2510.10340]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray observations of the Sun led Eugene Parker to propose nanoflares as the basic energy-release units that heat the solar corona. Decades later, Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (HRIEUV), operating halfway between Earth and the Sun, revealed thousands of even smaller brightenings in the quiet corona - tiny &quot;campfires&quot; that are smaller and far more frequent than the fundamental nanoflares observed from 1 AU. We analyze over 12,000 of these events, deriving their thermal energies using multiple geometric models to account for volume uncertainties. Although absolute values vary, all models yield consistent power-law energy distributions and ranges, confirming their flare-like behavior. These picoflares, spanning $10^{20}$–$10^{24}$ erg, were detected by the Solar Orbiter EUI Imager while the spacecraft was at 0.56 AU from the Sun. They occur up to sixty times more often than nanoflares seen from Earth orbit and supply about 1\% of the quiet-Sun coronal heating power. This previously unseen energy source may be a missing component in the solar energy balance. Their discovery extends the flare energy spectrum to smaller scales, and future Solar Orbiter observations at 0.28 AU may reveal the most fundamental flare events that sustain the million-degree solar corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19132" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence of Energy Injection in the Short and Distant GRB 250221A</a><span class="id">[2510.19132]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical facilities COLIBRÍ, the Harlingten 50 cm Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the \textit{Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} and the \textit{Einstein Probe}, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+10$ ks (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the classification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the prompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB 250221A an unusual event and underscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the importance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Missing Mechanism: Picoflare Heating in the Solar Corona</a><span class="id">[2510.22822]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The coronal heating problem has been explored through wave heating and impulsive nanoflare paradigms.

Through systematic investigation of potential resonant cavities in the solar atmosphere, we demonstrate that traditional large-scale cavities yield fundamentally incompatible periods: photosphere-transition region (3.3 minutes), transition region-sonic point (10.3 hours), and transition region-heliopause (7.7 years). We establish that coronal streamers act as natural magnetohydrodynamic resonators, with calculated harmonic periods of 122, 61, and 41 minutes that precisely match observations. The physical mechanism involves slow magnetoacoustic standing waves that create periodic density enhancements through wave compression, with the streamer resonator having quality factor Q   10-100, enabling natural amplification of broadband coronal noise. At streamer cusps, these density enhancements trigger magnetic reconnection, releasing plasma blobs into the solar wind at resonant periods. The model provides complete energy budget calculations, wave amplitude estimates, and explains all key observational features including spatial localization, period coherence, and the relationship between remote sensing and in situ measurements. This work establishes streamer resonators as fundamental structures shaping solar wind variability and provides a new framework for understanding the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent astrophysical plasmas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12887" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Inner Crusts of Neo-Neutron Stars: exotic light nuclei, diffusional and thermodynamical stability</a><span class="id">[2504.12887]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Based on an extended nuclear statistical equilibrium model, we investigate the properties of non-accreted crusts of young and warm neo-neutron stars, i.e., of finite-temperature inhomogeneous dense matter in beta equilibrium.

A challenging question in such models is how to keep the shear under control in the contracting phase, as it is well-known that the shear grows as fast as $1/a^{6}$ toward the bounce, where $a$ is the average expansion factor of the universe. A common approach is to introduce a scalar field with an ekpyrotic-like potential which becomes negative near the bounce, so the effective equation of state of the scalar field will be greater than one, whereby it dominates the shear in the bounce region. As a result, a homogeneous and isotropic universe can be produced after the bounce. In this paper, we study how the ekpyrotic mechanism affects the inflationary phase in both loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I), because in these frameworks inflation is generic without such a mechanism. After numerically studying various cases in which the potential of the inflaton consists of two parts, an inflationary potential and an ekpyrotic-like one, we find that, despite the fact that the influence is significant, by properly choosing the free parameters involved in the models, the ekpyrotic-like potential dominates in the bounce region, during which the effective equation of state is larger than one, so the shear problem is resolved. As the time continuously increases after the bounce, the inflationary potential grows and ultimately becomes dominant, resulting in an inflationary phase. This phase can last long enough to solve the cosmological problems existing in the big bang model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The importance of being non-minimally coupled: scalar Hawking radiation from regular black holes</a><span class="id">[2510.12257]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In curved space-time, a scalar field $\phi$ is generically expected to couple to curvature, via a coupling of the form $\xi\phi^2R$. Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case $\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation. We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\xi$, the low-energy emission spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\xi fR&lt;0$ throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational waves from the sound shell model: direct and inverse phase transitions in the early Universe</a><span class="id">[2510.21439]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmological phase transitions are a frequent phenomenon in particle physics models beyond the Standard Model, and the corresponding gravitational wave signal offers a key probe of new physics in the early Universe.

In particular, we restrict our analysis to the osculating Barthel Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric function is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\alpha$ and of the one-form $\beta$. In this framework, we also consider the role of the conformal transformations of the metric, which allows us to introduce a family of conformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models obtained in this way are described by second-order field equations, in the presence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The generalized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the Riemannian metric $\alpha$ the Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker representation. In order to close the cosmological field equations, we assume a specific relationship between the component of the one-form $\beta$ and the conformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is determined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free parameter $\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel Kropina cosmological models are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of $\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM model is also performed. {Our results indicate that the conformal osculating Barthel Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple, alternative to standard cosmological models.</p></div></details></article></body>
