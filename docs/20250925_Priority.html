We investigate gas accretion during the assembly of massive halos with $M_{\rm h}\gtrsim 10^{10-11}~M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\simeq 4-10$, driving both rapid BH feeding and concurrent nuclear starbursts. As the BH grows to $\sim 10^{6-7}~M_\odot$ via super-Eddington accretion, the accretion power inflates a dense envelope whose effective temperature approaches the Hayashi limit at $T_{\rm eff}\simeq 5000~{\rm K}$, producing red optical emission, while a coeval young stellar population of $\sim 10^7~M_\odot$ provides blue UV emission. This early coevolving system naturally reproduces the characteristic spectral features of the so-called little red dots (LRDs), a population of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including the V-shaped UV-to-optical spectra and weakness of X-ray, infrared, and radio emission. Massive stars in the nuclear starburst soon explode as supernovae, injecting energy and momentum that expel gas from the nucleus, quench gas supply to the BH envelope, and ultimately drive a transition into normal AGN phases. For individual LRDs, the optical-to-UV luminosity ratio remains nearly constant at $L_{\rm opt}/L_{\rm UV}\simeq 2-10$ from the onset of accretion bursts for $\simeq 15~{\rm Myr}$, one-third of the Salpeter time, until quenching by stellar feedback. While this ratio is sustained for the LRD population at $z\simeq 4-8$, it declines toward lower redshifts as BHs can no longer maintain red envelopes, thereby losing the LRD characteristics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cosmic Rush Hour: Rapid Formation of Bright, Massive, Disky, Star-Forming Galaxies as Signatures of Early-Universe Physics</a><span class="id">[2509.19427]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Early JWST observations have revealed a high-redshift universe more vibrant than predicted by canonical galaxy-formation models within $\Lambda$CDM, showing an excess of ultraviolet(UV)-bright, massive, and morphologically mature galaxies. Departures from $\Lambda$CDM prior to recombination can imprint signatures on non-linear structure formation at high redshift. In this paper, we investigate one such scenario - Early Dark Energy, originally proposed to resolve the Hubble tension - and its implications for these high-redshift challenges. We present the first large-scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of these models. Modifications to the pre-recombination expansion history accelerate early structure formation and produce UV luminosity and stellar mass functions in excellent agreement with JWST measurements, requiring essentially no additional calibrations. Predictions converge to $\Lambda$CDM at lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 3$), thereby preserving all successes of $\Lambda$CDM. This model also accelerates the emergence of stellar and gaseous disks, increasing their number densities by $\sim 0.5$ dex at $z\simeq 6$-7, primarily due to the higher abundance of massive galaxies. Taken together, these results demonstrate how early-universe physics can simultaneously reconcile multiple high-redshift challenges and the Hubble tension while retaining the core achievements of $\Lambda$CDM. This opens a pathway to constraining a broad class of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models with forthcoming observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Playing CHESS with stars. I. Search for similar stars in large spectroscopic data sets</a><span class="id">[2509.19443]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: Massive amounts of spectroscopic data obtained by stellar surveys are feeding an ongoing revolution in our knowledge of stellar and Galactic astrophysics. Analysing these data sets to extract the best possible astrophysical parameters on short time scales represents a considerable challenge. Aims: The differential analysis method is known to return the most precise results in the spectroscopic analyses of F-, G-, and K-type stars. However, it can only be applied to stars with similar parameters. Our goal is to present a procedure that significantly simplifies the identification of spectra from stars with similar atmospheric parameters within extensive spectral datasets. This approach allows for the quick application of differential analyses in these samples, thus enhancing the precision of the results. Methods: We used projection maps created by the t-SNE dimensionality reduction algorithm applied directly to the spectra using pixels as dimensions. For testing the method, we used more than 7300 high-resolution UVES spectra of about 3000 stars in the field-of-view towards open and globular clusters. As reference, we used 1244 spectra of 274 stars with well-determined and high-quality atmospheric parameters. Results: We calibrated a spectral similarity metric that can identify stars in a t-SNE projection map with parameters that differ by $\pm$ 200 K, $\pm$ 0.3 dex, and $\pm$ 0.2 dex in effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities, respectively. We achieved completeness between 74-98 % and typical purity between 39-54 % in this selection. With this, we will drastically facilitate the detection of stars with similar spectra for a successful differential analysis. We used this method to evaluate the accuracy and precision of four atmospheric parameter catalogues, identifying the regions of the parameter space where spectral analysis methods needs improvement.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19444" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infrared fine-structure lines at high redshift</a><span class="id">[2509.19444]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Infrared (IR) fine-structure line (FSL) emission arises from the radiative de-excitation of collisionally-excited electrons in atoms and ions. Thanks to their high luminosities and relatively simple physics, IR FSLs have quickly become the workhorse for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies in the nearby and distant Universe. In this review, we introduce the physics of FSL emission and the diagnostics of the ISM that we can derive from them via first principle arguments. We summarize the history of FSL observations with a focus on the far-IR wavelengths and a particular emphasis on the on-going efforts aimed at characterizing galaxies at cosmic noon and beyond. We explore the dependence of emission line trends, such as those observed in `line deficits' or [CII]-SFR relations, as a function of redshift and galaxy types. Once selection biases are controlled for, IR FSLs are a powerful tool to constrain the physics of galaxies. The precise redshift information inferred from fine-structure line observations have enabled tracing their ISM properties across cosmic reionization. FSL observations have also led to estimates of the mass of different ISM phases, and of the SFR of distant galaxies. It is thanks to IR FSL observations that we have been able to measure the internal dynamics of high-z galaxies, which in turns has allowed us to test, e.g., the onset of black hole - host galaxy relations in the first billion years of the Universe and the presence of gas outflows associated with the baryon cycle in galaxies. Finally, FSLs have provided important clues on the physics of the ISM in the most distant galaxies known to date. We demonstrate the strength and limitations of using IR FSLs to advance our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the early universe, and we outline future perspective for the field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19447" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two-moment cosmic ray transport in RAMSES</a><span class="id">[2509.19447]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic rays (CRs) are an important source of feedback in a variety of astrophysical contexts. Magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations treating CRs as a fluid have shown that how their feedback operates is strongly dependent on their transport properties such as diffusion and streaming. In this paper we introduce the numerical implementation, in the adaptive-mesh-refinement MHD code RAMSES, of the grey two-moment formulation of CR fluid dynamics, which follows the energy density and its associated three-dimensional flux. This method is tested for CR diffusion, streaming, and advection in a series of multi-dimensional tests including shocks to check the robustness and stability of this numerical two-moment CRMHD solver. We finally use the new two-moment CR implementation in a complex simulation of an isolated galactic disc producing galaxy-wide outflows launched by small-scale supernova explosions, and compare it with a previously existing one-moment formulation in the same code.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Yin-Yang Galaxy Cluster Merger in Abell 1914 Revealed by XRISM</a><span class="id">[2509.19449]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hierarchical mergers of galaxy clusters play a key role in converting gravitational energy into thermal and kinetic energy in the local universe. Understanding this process requires the reconstruction of cluster merger geometry, with careful consideration of projection effects. With its unprecedented spectral resolution, XRISM enables the disentanglement of merging cluster components along the line-of-sight via X-rays for the first time. In this letter, we focus on the massive cluster A1914, a puzzling case wherein the galaxy and dark matter distribution appear to be in tension with the X-ray morphology. We present XRISM observations of A1914 focusing on the velocity structure of the intracluster medium (ICM). The Resolve full-array spectrum requires two merging components along the line-of-sight, with bulk velocities offset by $\sim$1000 km/s and velocity dispersions of $\sim$200 km/s. The sub-array maps of flux ratios, bulk velocity, and velocity dispersion show the two components are offset and overlapping in the plane of the sky, consistent with a major (mass ratio $\sim$3), near line-of-sight merger with a pericenter distance of $\sim$200 kpc. We conclude that the two subclusters create an overlapping spiral pattern, referred to as a ”yin-yang” merger. This scenario is further supported by tailored hydrodynamical simulations of the A1914 merger, demonstrating that this type of merger can broadly reproduce the observed X-ray morphology, gas temperature map, gas velocity maps, dark matter distribution, and galaxy velocities. This work demonstrates the power of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, provided by XRISM, to resolve complex cluster merger geometries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early galaxy evolution: The complex interstellar medium distribution of the z 7 galaxy A1689-zD1</a><span class="id">[2509.19475]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We observed the gravitationally lensed ($\mu = 9.6\pm0.19$) galaxy A1689-zD1 at $z = 7.1$ in bands 3, 6, and 8 of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. These high-resolution observations ($\approx 200$ pc) enabled us to separate the source into five components in the [CII] 158$\mu$m and [OIII] 88$mu$m emission lines within a projected distance of 2 kpc. Even though these components appear to vary strongly from one another in both their line, continuum, and optical characteristics, the assembly of components do not show ordered rotation and appear consistent with simulations of a galaxy system undergoing the process of assembly. The total dynamical mass of the galaxy ($2\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) is an order of magnitude larger than the spectrally estimated stellar mass, suggesting a near-complete optical obscuration of the bulk of the stellar component. Comparing the line ratios as well as the line properties to other properties such as the star formation rate, we find that A1689-zD1 is consistent with the relations derived from local star-forming galaxies. Even though A1689-zD1 lies on local star formation scaling relations and has a high dust and stellar mass estimate, the kinematics suggest it is in an early assembly stage, which could lead to it becoming a disk galaxy at a later stage.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19487" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The evolution of velocity dispersion in the Sco-Cen OB association</a><span class="id">[2509.19487]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study how stellar velocity dispersion within the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association (Sco-Cen) has evolved over approximately 20 million years, from its formation to the present day. Using data from the \textit{Gaia} mission along with supplementary stellar radial velocities, we identified a surprising sequence of abrupt jumps and intervening plateaus in the velocity dispersion correlating with star formation bursts. These changes in velocity dispersion coincide with the association expanding in size. We measure a present-day expansion rate of about 10–12 pc Myr$^{-1}$ and observe that younger star clusters within the association exhibit higher velocities compared to older ones. This result, along with the stepwise increase in both velocity dispersion and spatial extent over time, suggests a structured and sequential star formation process rather than a random one. This phased evolution strongly suggests that stellar feedback is the primary driver of Sco-Cen's star formation history, expansion, and eventual dispersal. Our findings emphasize the value of precisely characterizing stellar populations within OB associations, particularly through the creation of detailed, high-resolution age maps.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the Constancy of Type Ia Supernova Luminosities with Gaussian Process</a><span class="id">[2509.19494]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are central to studies of cosmic expansion, under the assumption that their absolute magnitude $M_B$ does not evolve with redshift. Even small drifts in brightness can bias cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $w$. Here we test this assumption using a non-parametric Gaussian Process (GP) reconstruction of the expansion history from cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, which provides a model-independent baseline distance modulus, $\mu_{\rm GP}(z)$. To propagate uncertainties, we draw Monte Carlo realizations of $H(z)$ from the GP posterior and evaluate them on a Chebyshev grid, which improves numerical stability and quadrature accuracy. Supernova observations are then compared to this baseline through residuals, $\Delta M_B(z)$, and their derivatives. Applying this method to Pantheon+ (1701 SNe Ia) and DES 5YR (435 SNe Ia), we find that SNe Ia are consistent with being standard candles within $1\sigma$, though both datasets exhibit localized departures: near $z \sim 1$ in Pantheon+ and at $z \sim 0.3$–$0.5$ in DES. The presence of similar features in two independent surveys suggests they are not purely statistical. Our results point toward a possible non-monotonic luminosity evolution, likely reflecting different physical drivers at different epochs, and highlight the need for a deeper astrophysical understanding of SN Ia populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the Bulge Morphology of Dual AGN Host Galaxies from the GOTHIC survey</a><span class="id">[2509.19548]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a structural analysis of bulges in dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. Dual AGN arise in galaxy mergers where both supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are actively accreting. The AGN are typically embedded in compact bulges, which appear as luminous nuclei in optical images. Galaxy mergers can result in bulge growth, often via star formation. The bulges can be disky (pseudobulges), classical bulges, or belong to elliptical galaxies. Using SDSS DR18 gri images and GALFIT modelling, we performed 2D decomposition for 131 dual AGN bulges (comprising 61 galaxy pairs and 3 galaxy triplets) identified in the GOTHIC survey. We derived sérsic indices, luminosities, masses, and scalelengths of the bulges. Most bulges (105/131) are classical, with sérsic indices lying between $n=2$ and $n=8$. Among these, 64% are elliptical galaxies, while the remainder are classical bulges in disc galaxies. Only $\sim$20% of the sample exhibit pseudobulges. Bulge masses span $1.5\times10^9$ to $1.4\times10^{12}\,M_\odot$, with the most massive systems being ellipticals. Galaxy type matching shows that elliptical–elliptical (E–E) and elliptical–disc (E–D) mergers dominate over disc–disc (D–D) mergers. At least one galaxy in two-thirds of the dual AGN systems is elliptical and only $\sim$30% involve two disc galaxies. Although our sample is limited, our results suggest that dual AGN preferentially occur in evolved, red, quenched systems, that typically form via major mergers. They are predominantly hosted in classical bulges or elliptical galaxies rather than star-forming disc galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper: The Index Diagram as a tool to disentangle the influence of the Host Galaxy in Quasar spectra</a><span class="id">[2509.19575]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit the Quasar Main Sequence (QMS) by investigating the impact of the stellar component from the host galaxy (HG) on the emission line spectra of the active galactic nuclei (AGN). We first detect spectra with broad emission lines using a line ratio method for a sample of $\sim$3000 high SNR ($&gt;$20) Black Hole Mapper objects (part of the fifth phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey). We then built the Index diagram, a novel diagnostic tool using the $z$-corrected spectra, model-free, designed to easily identify spectra with significant stellar HG contributions and to classify the AGN spectra into three categories based on AGN-HG dominance: HG-dominated (HGD), Intermediate (INT), and AGN-dominated (AGND) sources. A colour-$z$ diagram was used to refine the AGN-HG classification. We subtract the stellar contributions from the HGD and INT spectra before modeling the AGN spectrum to extract the QMS parameters. Our QMS reveals that HGD galaxies predominantly occupy the Population B region with no \rfe, %FWHM$\gtrsim$4000 \kms, with outliers exhibiting \rfe\ $&gt;$ 1, likely due to HG subtraction residuals and a faint contribution of \hbbc. INT and AGND spectra show similar distributions in the Population A %FWHM(\hbbc)$&lt;$4000 \kms\ region, while in Population B, %For broader lines, a tail of AGND sources becomes apparent. Cross-matching with radio, infrared, and X-ray catalogs, we find that the strongest radio emitters are associated with HGD and INT groups. Strong X-ray emitters are found in INT and AGND sources, also occupying the AGN region in the WISE colour diagram.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEXUS: A Search for Nuclear Variability with the First Two JWST NIRCam Epochs</a><span class="id">[2509.19585]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The multi-cycle JWST Treasury program NEXUS will obtain cadenced imaging and spectroscopic observations around the North Ecliptic Pole during 2024-2028. Here we report a systematic search for nuclear variability among $\sim 25\,$k sources covered by NIRCam (F200W+F444W) imaging using the first two NEXUS epochs separated by 9 months in the observed frame. Difference imaging techniques reach $1\sigma$ variability sensitivity of 0.18 mag (F200W) and 0.15 mag (F444W) at 28th magnitude (within 0&quot;.2 diameter aperture), improved to $0.01$ mag and $0.02$ mag at $&lt;25$th magnitude, demonstrating the superb performance of NIRCam photometry. The difference imaging results represent significant improvement over aperture photometry on individual epochs (by $&gt;30\%$). We identify 465 high-confidence variable sources among the parent sample, with 2-epoch flux difference at $&gt;3\sigma$ from the fiducial variability sensitivity. Essentially all these variable sources are of extragalactic origin based on preliminary photometric classifications, and follow a similar photometric redshift distribution as the parent sample up to $z_{\rm phot}&gt;10$. While the majority of these variability candidates are likely normal unobscured AGNs, some of them may be rare nuclear stellar transients and tidal disruption events that await confirmation with spectroscopy and continued photometric monitoring. We also constrain the photometric variability of ten spectroscopically confirmed broad-line Little Red Dots (LRDs) at $3\lesssim z \lesssim 7$, and find none of them show detectable variability in either band. We derive stringent $3\sigma$ upper limits on the F444W variability of $\sim 3-10\%$ for these LRDs, with a median value of $\sim 5\%$. These constraints imply weak variability in the rest-frame optical continuum of LRDs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Bolometric Luminosity Correction Recipe for AGN at Any Epoch</a><span class="id">[2509.19666]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding how active galactic nuclei (AGN) affect their host galaxies requires determining their total radiative power across all wavelengths (i.e., bolometric luminosities). We show how AGN accretion disk spectral energy distribution (SED) templates, parameterized by supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, Eddington ratio, spin, and inclination, can be used to estimate total radiated luminosities. Bolometric luminosities are calculated by integrating the accretion disk SEDs from 1$\mu$m to 10keV over $0^\circ$–$90^\circ$ inclinations, ensuring consistent treatment of wavelength gaps, avoiding double-counting reprocessed emission, and accounting for anisotropy of visible–UV emission at different inclinations. The SED, and resulting bolometric corrections, depend strongly on SMBH mass and Eddington ratio, but only weakly on spin and inclination. Increasing SMBH mass produces cooler disks peaking at lower frequencies, whereas higher Eddington ratios (and spins) yield hotter disks peaking at higher frequencies. Larger inclinations suppress the visible–UV portion of the SED, whereas X-ray emission remains nearly isotropic. Bolometric corrections in the visible–NUV range (5100Å-3000Å) show strong dependence on SMBH mass, while X-ray bolometric corrections depend strongly on the Eddington ratio. Near the SED peak (FUV; $\sim$1450Å), parameter dependencies are weak, making this band particularly robust for estimating bolometric corrections. The X-ray band is reliable, though dependence on the Eddington ratio introduces a wide dynamic range. Because our SEDs are intrinsic and defined in the rest-frame, their application to Type 1 AGN is straightforward. For other AGN, however, corrections for obscuration by the host galaxy and torus are required in many cases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winding Motion of Spirals in a Gravitationally Unstable Protoplanetary Disk</a><span class="id">[2509.19761]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of wide-orbit giant exoplanets has posed a challenge to our conventional understanding of planet formation by coagulation of dust grains and planetesimals, and subsequent accretion of protoplanetary disk gas. As an alternative mechanism, the direct in-situ formation of planets or planetary cores by gravitational instability (GI) in protoplanetary disks has been proposed. However, observational evidence for GI in regions where wide-orbit planets are formed is still lacking. Theoretical studies predict that GI induces spiral arms moving at the local Keplerian speed in a disk. Here, with multiple high angular resolution observations over a seven-year time baseline using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we report the evidence for spiral arms following the Keplerian rotation in the dust continuum disk around the young star IM Lup. This demonstrates that GI can operate in wide-orbit planet-formation regions, establishing it as a plausible formation mechanism for such planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Galaxy Zoo EMU: Harnessing Citizen Science and AI to Advance Open Science Catalogues</a><span class="id">[2509.19787]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the past decades, significant efforts have been devoted to developing sophisticated algorithms for automatically identifying and classifying radio sources in large surveys.

However, their relative contribution to the chemical evolution of galaxies remains to be quantified. To this end, in this work we study a sample of 510 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) having anomalously low-metallicity (ALM) regions selected from the MaNGA data available in the Data Release 17 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. ALM regions are defined as those having gas phase metallicities that are at least $\sim 2\sigma$ lower than the emprical relation between stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_{*}$) and gas phase metallicity, i.e., the $\Sigma_{*}-Z$ relation. We find that ALM galaxies have higher star formation rates and \Hi gas fractions than normal SFGs at fixed $M_*$. $\sim$25\% of the ALM galaxies exhibit tidal features, while the tidal fraction is only $\sim$12\% for normal SFGs, indicating that galaxy interaction is an important factor responsible for the ALM phenomenon. To explore the origin of non-tidal ALM galaxies, we compare their morphologies and environments with those of mass-matched normal SFGs. We find that non-tidal ALM galaxies tend to have more disk-dominated morphologies and reside in less-dense environment.

We calibrate the baryonic feedback to produce observationally consistent and realistic galaxy clusters across all simulations and simulate five models of velocity-independent SIDM targeting the expected sensitivity of future telescopes - $\sigma_{\rm DM}/m=0.,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2$ cm$^2$/g. We find the density profiles exhibit the characteristic core even in the smallest of cross-sections, with cores developing only at late times ($z&lt;0.5$). We investigate the dynamics of the brightest cluster galaxy inside the dark matter halo and find in SIDM cosmologies there exists a so-called wobbling not observed in collisionless dark matter. We find this wobble is driven by accreting mass on to a cored density profile with the signal peaking at $z=0.25$ and dropping thereafter. This finding is further supported by the existence of an anti-correlation between the offset between the BCG and the dark matter halo and its relative velocity in SIDM only, a hallmark of harmonic oscillation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supergiant GCIRS 22 in the Milky Way Nuclear Star Cluster: Revised alpha abundances</a><span class="id">[2509.20075]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: The chemical abundances of alpha-elements in Galactic Centre (GC) supergiants provide key insights into the chemical enrichment and star formation history of the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster. Previous studies have reported enhanced alpha-element abundances, raising questions about the chemical evolution of this unique region. Aims: We aim to reassess the alpha-element abundances in the GC supergiant GCIRS 22 using updated spectral modelling and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) corrections to resolve discrepancies from earlier abundance analyses. Methods: High-resolution near-infrared spectra of GCIRS 22 were analysed using contemporary line lists and precise stellar parameters derived from scandium line diagnostics. We applied comprehensive NLTE corrections to accurately determine the abundances of silicon and calcium. Results: Our analysis reveals solar-scale alpha abundances ([Ca/Fe] = 0.06 $\pm$ 0.07; [Si/Fe] = $-$0.08 $\pm$ 0.20) for GCIRS 22, significantly lower than previous LTE-based findings. NLTE corrections reduce the calcium abundance by approximately 0.3,dex compared to LTE estimates, aligning our results with recent studies and highlighting the importance of accurate NLTE modelling. Conclusions: The solar-scale alpha-element abundances observed in GCIRS 22 suggest that recent star formation in the region has not been dominated by Type II supernovae, such as those expected from a recent starburst. Our findings support a scenario of episodic star formation, characterized by intermittent bursts separated by extended quiescent phases, or potentially driven by gas inflows from the inner disk, funnelled by the Galactic bar. Future comprehensive NLTE studies of additional GC stars will be essential for refining our understanding of the region's chemical evolution and star formation history.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20079" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The distribution and origin of metals in simulated Milky Way-like galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.20079]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we investigate the distribution and origin of chemical elements in different stellar components of simulated Milky Way-like galaxies in relation to their mass assembly history, stellar age, and metallicity. Using a sample of 23 simulated galaxies from the Auriga project, we analysed the evolution of heavy elements produced by stellar nucleosynthesis. To study the chemical evolution of the stellar halo, bulge, and warm and cold discs of the model galaxies, we applied a decomposition method to characterise the distribution of chemical elements at $z=0$ and traced back their origin. Our findings indicate that each stellar component has a distinctive chemical trend despite galaxy-to-galaxy variations. Specifically, stellar haloes are $\alpha$-enhanced relative to other components, representing the oldest populations, with [Fe/H]   $-$0.6 and a high fraction of ex situ stars of   50%. They are followed by the warm ([Fe/H]   $-$0.1) and cold ([Fe/H]   0) discs, with in situ fractions of   90% and   95%, respectively. Alternatively, bulges are mainly formed in situ but host more diverse stellar populations, with [Fe/H] abundance extending over   1 dex around the solar value. We conclude that one of the main drivers shaping the chemical properties of the galactic components in our simulations is the age-metallicity relation. The bulges are the least homogeneous component of the sample, as they present different levels of contribution from young stars in addition to the old stellar component. Conversely, the cold discs appear very similar in all chemical properties, despite important differences in their typical formation times. Finally, we find that a significant fraction of stars in the warm discs were in the cold disc at birth. We discuss the possible connections of this behaviour with the development of bars and interactions with satellites.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fitting the Shadows: Star Formation Scaling Relations in the Low Surface Brightness Regime</a><span class="id">[2509.20080]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Classical low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies pose an important challenge to galaxy evolution models. While they are found to host large reservoirs of atomic hydrogen, they display low stellar and star-formation surface densities. Global star formation scaling relations characterize trends in the star formation behaviour of galaxies; when used to compare populations or classes of galaxies, deviations in the observed trends can be used to probe predicted differences in physical conditions. In this work we utilize the well-studied Star Forming Main Sequence and integrated Kennicutt-Schmidt Relations to characterize star formation in the LSB regime, and compare the observed trends to relations for a normal star-forming galaxies. Using a comprehensive cross-matched sample of 277 LSB galaxies from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog Release 2 and the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array Catalog, we gain an in-depth view of the star formation process in the LSB regime. HI-selected LSB galaxies follow very similar trends in atomic gas-to-stellar mass ratio and the star forming main sequence to their high surface brightness counterparts. However, while LSB galaxies host comparably large atomic gas reservoirs, they prove to be largely inefficient in converting this gas to stars with a median depletion time $t_{dep} \approx 18$ Gyr. These results are discussed in relation to previous studies which find that LSB galaxies host low atomic gas densities and are largely deficient in molecular gas, which suggest that the faint appearance of LSB galaxies may be the result of physical conditions on the sub-kpc scale.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Density constraint of the warm absorber in NGC 5548</a><span class="id">[2509.20143]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Ionized outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to influence the evolution of their host galaxies and super-massive black holes (SMBHs). Distance is important to understand the kinetic power of the outflows as a cosmic feedback channel. However, the distance of the outflows with respect to the central engine is poorly constrained. The density of the outflows is an essential parameter for estimating the distance of the outflows. NGC 5548 exhibits a variety of spectroscopic features in its archival spectra, which can be used for density analysis. Aims. We aim to use the variability of the absorption lines from the archival spectra to obtain a density constraint and then estimate the distance of the outflows. Methods. We used the archival observations of NGC 5548 taken with Chandra in January 2002 to search for variations of the absorption lines. Results. We found that the Mg XII Ly${\alpha}$ and the O VIII Ly${\beta}$ absorption lines have significant variation on the 144 ks time scale and the 162 ks time scale during the different observation periods. Based on the variability timescales and the physical properties of the variable components that dominated these two absorption lines, we derive a lower limit on the density of the variable warm absorber components in the range of $7.2-9.0{\times}10^{11} m^{-3}$, and an upper limit on their distance from the central source in the range of 0.2-0.5 pc.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20289" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MeerKAT discovery of 164 compact radio rings toward the Galactic Plane</a><span class="id">[2509.20289]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of 164 compact (radius &lt; 1 arcmin) radio rings using MeerKAT 1.3 GHz data from the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (l=2-60deg, 252-358deg, |b|&lt;1.5deg) and the Galactic Centre mosaic, from a search aimed at identifying previously uncatalogued radio sources. Within this sample, approximately 19 per cent of the rings contain a central point radio source. A multiwavelength analysis reveals a striking diversity: about 40 per cent of the rings enclose an isolated infrared point source, 50 per cent exhibit an extended counterpart in the mid- or far-infrared, and several are only detected in the radio band. We found that 17 per cent of the rings in the sample are positionally coincident (within 5 arcsec) with known entries in SIMBAD, including unclassified infrared sources, spiral galaxies, young stellar objects and long-period variable candidates. Based on these matches and exploiting ancillary multiwavelength data and catalogues, we explore several formation scenarios for the rings, such as HII regions, planetary nebulae, mass-loss relics from evolved massive stars, supernova remnants, nova shells, galaxies, galaxy cluster lenses and odd radio circles. Tentative classifications are proposed for nearly 60 per cent of the sample. These results highlight the potential of MeerKAT to uncover previously undetected compact radio structures and, particularly, recover missing Galactic radio-emitting objects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stars and ionized gas in UGCA 320: a nearby gas-rich, dwarf Irregular galaxy</a><span class="id">[2509.20359]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>UGCA 320 is a gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxy which belongs to a nearby, relatively isolated group of dwarf galaxies. Here, we combine multi-band HST imaging data with deep long-slit SALT/RSS and integral-field VLT/MUSE spectral data to study the stellar and ionized gas components of UGCA 320. Our imaging data analysis reveals a very blue (V-I 0.1 mag), flattened radial colour profile. We detect an abundance of ionized gas in UGCA 320 powered mostly by recent star formation. The stellar disc in UGCA 320 is populated predominantly by young ( 120 Myr) and metal-poor ( 15-30 per cent solar metallicity) stars and it rotates in the same sense as the ionized gas disc but with higher rotation velocities, and possibly in different planes. Our analysis reveals a sharp transition in the kinematic properties of the discs at radius  10&quot; ( 0.3 kpc) and distortions in the outer disc region. We show that these features are consistent with a recent tidal interaction most likely with its close neighbour - UGCA 319. We discuss our results in the context of interacting dwarf galaxies and also show that similar inferences can be made independently from the long-slit data analysis as with the integral-field data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The HyLight model for hydrogen emission lines in simulated nebulae</a><span class="id">[2509.20361]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hydrogen recombination lines are key diagnostics of ionized gas in the interstellar medium (ISM), particularly within photoionized nebulae. Hydrodynamical simulations, even those that include radiative transfer, do not usually determine the level population of hydrogen required to compute line intensities, but rather interpolate them from pre-computed tables. Here we present the HyLight atomic model, which captures the dominant processes governing the level populations, enabling the calculation of all dipole-allowed hydrogen transitions as well as two-photon transitions from the 2s to 1s state without the need to pre-computed tables. We compare HyLight predictions to those of other codes and published tables, finding differences between the various rates of up to factors of several per cent for common transitions, including those of the Balmer and Brackett series. However, we find sub-per cent agreement between HyLight and the Cloudy spectral synthesis code when enforcing photo-ionisation equilibrium in gas under typical nebular conditions of density and temperature. Importantly, HyLight can also predict emissivities if the gas is not in photo-ionisation equilibrium. As examples, we compute the ratios between the total photoionization rate and line intensities in a nebula, and post-process a snapshot from Sparcs, a hydrodynamical code that combines radiative transfer with non-equilibrium physics, and compute mock hydrogen emission line maps which can be compared directly to observations. Implemented in Python, HyLight is an accurate tool for determining the level population in neutral hydrogen, a crucial step in bridging the gap between simulations and observations in studies of photoionized regions in galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subhalos are Anisotropically Distributed and Aligned with the Smooth Matter Distribution of Their Host Halos</a><span class="id">[2406.10150]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the distributions of subhalos about their hosts in two suites of zoom-in N-body simulations of halo growth – one suite focused on Milky Way-Mass halos ($\sim 10^{12} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and another focused on cluster-mass halos ($\sim 10^{15} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) in the Symphony simulation suite. We find, in agreement with previous work on this subject, that subhalos are distributed anisotropically about their host halos. In particular, the positions of subhalos lie preferentially near the major axes of their host halos, possibly implying that satellite galaxies will exhibit a similar alignment. Furthermore, we show that in two-dimensional projection subhalos are more likely to be observed near the halo center (where the central galaxy presumably resides) when the host halo is projected nearly along its major axis. This projection effect is significant. Within projected radii of a few percent of the virial radius of the host halo, the fraction of mass in subhalos is $\sim 175\%$ larger for Milky Way mass halos and as much as $\sim 195\%$ larger for cluster halos when projected along the major axis as compared to the average from a random projection. This result has consequences for many applications including the interpretation of gravitational lenses. Finally, we find that the orbital angular momentum vector of subhalos is aligned with the angular momentum vector of their host halo, indicating that a significant component of a halo's angular momentum may be carried in its subhalos. This has consequences for galaxy formation models which use host halo angular momentum as a proxy for galaxy momentum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McFACTS II: Mass Ratio–Effective Spin Relationship of Black Hole Mergers in the AGN Channel</a><span class="id">[2411.10590]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the Monte Carlo For AGN (active galactic nucleus) Channel Testing and Simulation (McFACTS, this https URL ) code to study the effect of AGN disk and nuclear star cluster parameters on predicted mass distributions for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) compact binaries forming in AGN disks.

This approach eliminates the need for prior assumptions about dust attenuation curves, which are instead derived as outputs of the fitting process. By leveraging the invariance of EWs and employing the Discrete Penalised Least Squares (DPLS) method to extract EWs, we address the nonlinear aspects of the fitting process by linearising the matrix equations. This enables accurate recovery of key parameters, stellar age, metallicity and dust attenuation, even under systematic calibration biases and varying attenuation conditions. Rigorous testing with mock spectra across signal-to-noise ratios (S/N = 5-30) and calibration biases demonstrates the robustness of method. The derived attenuation curves align closely with input models, and stellar population parameters are recovered with minimal bias. To facilitate adoption, we implement this method as a Python extension package for \texttt{pPXF} (\texttt{pPXF-SEW}). Our work addresses critical degeneracies in traditional spectral fitting and enhances the reliability of extragalactic studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring photo-ionization rate and mean free path of HeII ionizing photons at $2.5 \leq z \leq 3.6$: Evidence for late and rapid HeII reionization Part-II</a><span class="id">[2503.04893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present measurements of the spatially averaged HeII photo-ionization rate ($\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$), mean free path of HeII ionizing photons ($\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$), and HeII fraction ($f_{\rm HeII}$) across seven redshift bins within the redshift range $2&lt;z&lt;4$. The measurements are obtained by comparing the observed effective optical depth distribution of HeII ($\tau_{\rm eff, HeII}$) with models generated by post-processing of the Sherwood simulation suite using our code EXCITE. With EXCITE, we efficiently explore a large parameter space ($\sim 15000$ models) by varying $\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$ and $\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$. We employ Anderson-Darling test for the cumulative distribution of $\tau_{\rm eff, HeII}$ to simultaneously measure $\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$ and $\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$. Our measurements account for possible observational and modeling uncertainties stemming mainly from the finite signal-to-noise ratio of the observed data and thermal parameter uncertainties. We find significant evolution, with the best-fit $\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$ and $\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$ decreasing by factors of $\sim 4.32$ and $ \sim 3.27$, respectively, from $z = 2.88$ to $z = 3.16$. Based on these measurements, we constrain the emissivity at the HeII ionization frequency ($\epsilon_{228}$) and HeII ionizing photon emission rate ($\dot{n}$), finding consistency with results from galaxy and QSO surveys. Comparison of our measured parameters with widely used uniform UVB models supports a scenario where HeII reionization is not completed before $z\sim2.74$. Our measured evolution is complementary and in good agreement with recent measurements of thermal parameters of the IGM, suggesting a coherent picture of rather late and rapid HeII reionization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07738" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Origin of Abundance Variations in the Milky Way's High-$α$ Plateau</a><span class="id">[2503.07738]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using multi-element abundances from the SDSS APOGEE survey, we investigate the origin of abundance variations in Milky Way (MW) disk stars on the &quot;high-$\alpha$ plateau,&quot; with $-0.5\leq\rm{[Mg/H]}\leq-0.1$ and $0.25\leq\rm{[Mg/Fe]}\leq0.35$. The elevated [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios of these stars imply low enrichment contributions from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), but it is unclear whether their abundance patterns reflect pure core-collapse supernova (CCSN) enrichment. We find that plateau stars with higher [Fe/Mg] ratios also have higher [X/Mg] ratios for other iron-peak elements, suggesting that the [Fe/Mg] variations in the plateau population do reflect variations in the SNIa/CCSN ratio. To quantify this finding, we fit the observed abundance patterns with a two-process model, calibrated on the full MW disk, which represents each star's abundances as the sum of a prompt CCSN process with amplitude $A_{\text{cc}}$ and a delayed SNIa process with amplitude $A_{\text{Ia}}$. This model is generally successful at explaining the observed trends of [X/Mg] with $A_{\text{Ia}}/A_{\text{cc}}$, which are steeper for elements with a large SNIa contribution (e.g., Cr, Ni, Mn) and flatter for elements with low SNIa contribution (e.g., O, Si, Ca). Our analysis does not determine the value of [Mg/Fe] corresponding to pure CCSN enrichment, but it should be at least as high as the upper edge of the plateau at $\rm{[Mg/Fe]}\approx0.35$, and could be significantly higher. Compared to the two-process predictions, the observed trends of [X/Mg] with $A_{\text{Ia}}/A_{\text{cc}}$ are steeper for (C+N) but shallower for Ce, providing intriguing but contradictory clues about AGB enrichment in the early disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identification of Anomalous E+A Galaxies in GAMA Using an Isolation Forest</a><span class="id">[2509.18264]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We implement an outlier detection model, an Isolation Foest (iForest), to uncover anomalous objects in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly Fourth Data Release (GAMA DR4).

We select two samples of galaxies to isolate, high signal-to-noise galaxies, to analyse the iForest's robustness, and E+A galaxies, to study the extremes of their population. This results in six-subsamples of spectroscopic, photometric and combined data isolations, finding 101 anomalous objects, half of which have not been identified as outliers in other works. We also find a number of fringing errors and false emission lines, displaying the iForest's potential in detecting these errors. Finding anomalous E+A galaxies, that although selected in a normal manner, using low [OII] and strong H{\delta} absorption, are still star-forming, with strong H{\alpha} emission. We propose two solutions to why these E+A galaxies are still star-forming but also question if these galaxies can be truly classified as E+A galaxies. We suggest that small-scale interactions on the galaxies causes small star bursts. The radiative pressure when forming high mass stars form expels the accreting material quicker than it can be accreted. We also suggest that the Jeans limit in our anomalous E+A galaxies is so low that it is simply not possible to form O and B class stars, but not low enough to fully prevent star-formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detectability of massive binary black holes with sub-mHz gravitational wave missions</a><span class="id">[2506.10768]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Beyond LISA, proposed space-based gravitational wave (GW) missions aim to explore the sub-millihertz to microhertz frequency band, with one key objective being the detection of massive binary black hole (MBBH) mergers across cosmic distances. In this work, we investigate the detection and localization capabilities of future sub-mHz GW observatories for MBBH coalescences. Including the full galactic foreground noise, we find that signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) can reach several thousand across a wide range of redshifts. We evaluate three representative orbital configurations–non-precessing and precessing with different inclination angles–and analyze their localization performance for various MBBH populations. In the non-precessing case, a two-hemisphere degeneracy arises when only the dominant (2,2) mode is considered, which is effectively resolved by including higher-order modes. These modes contribute to a more uniform performance across all configurations, thereby mitigating the prior advantage of precessing mission orbits. Sub-mHz missions operating in the [10 $\mu$Hz, 10 mHz] band partially overlap with LISA's range but provide enhanced sensitivity to lower-frequency GWs due to their longer interferometric baselines. This results in significantly improved localization of high-mass MBBHs, enhancing the prospects for multi-messenger astronomy and precision cosmology. Moreover, the high SNRs attainable with sub-mHz detectors could enable stringent tests of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity.</p></div></details></article>

Despite ongoing efforts to improve their resilience, they remain vulnerable to component damage and deorbiting under harsh space weather conditions. Prior work identified a modest but noticeable impact on LEO satellite network performance during solar storms, typically manifesting as an immediate rise in packet loss and a sustained increase in round-trip time (RTT). However, these studies offer only coarse-grained insights and do not capture the nuanced spatial and temporal patterns of disruption across the LEO network. In this paper, we conduct a deep dive into the impact of solar storms on LEO satellite communications. By localizing the impact of increased atmospheric drag at the level of individual satellites and orbits, we reveal significant heterogeneity in how different parts of the network are affected. We find that the degree of performance degradation varies significantly across geographic regions, depending on satellite positioning during the storm. Specifically, we find that (i) not all satellite orbits are equally vulnerable, (ii) within a given orbit, certain satellites experience disproportionate impact depending on their position relative to geomagnetic conditions, and (iii) autonomous maneuvering of satellites might be a cause of the sustained increase in RTT. Our findings uncover previously overlooked patterns of vulnerability in LEO satellite constellations and highlight the need for more adaptive, region-aware mitigation strategies to address space weather-induced network disruptions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Determining Ideal Fields for Epoch of Reionisation Science Using the 21 cm Line</a><span class="id">[2509.19751]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The upcoming Square Kilometre Array Low Frequency (SKA-Low) interferometer will have the required sensitivity to detect the 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR).

Gain uncertainties were calculated based on the positions of the calibrators within the beam. These uncertainties were then propagated into visibilities to produce cylindrical power spectra for various fields. Using these metrics in combination with the power spectra, we confirm that EoR0 ($\text{R.A.} = 0^\circ$, $\text{Dec} = -27.0^\circ$) is an ideal EoR field and discuss the interesting behaviour of other fields.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19758" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report on LEO satellite impacts on ground-based optical astronomy for the Rubin Observatory LSST</a><span class="id">[2509.19758]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In August 2025 a workshop was convened to bring together experts to better understand steps that can be taken to mitigate the impact of satellite constellations on astronomical observations. At the time, just over 12,000 operational satellites were in low-Earth orbit (LEO). Although reflected sunlight and emissions all across the electromagnetic spectrum from artificial satellites impact scientific observations and the sky, the workshop focused on reflected sunlight in the wavelength range 330 nm to 1100 nm. This aligns with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) planned imaging observations over the coming decade. Among other conclusions, we affirm previous recommendations that tracked satellite apparent magnitudes should be no brighter than 7th AB mag. The workshop participants discussed over 30 publications, reports, and presentations, and arrived at the Findings and Recommendations presented here. During the workshop, in addition to affirming many existing recommendations and best practices, the group discovered new issues and devised possible mitigations. These were nearly equally divided between advice to satellite builders and operators and to the observational astronomy community. While the workshop prioritized considerations for LSST, our hope is that many of the Findings and Recommendations will also apply to other observatories and constellations, and that all satellite companies will continue to engage in dialog with sky observers across the globe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Data of the 3000 km$^2$ Radio Detector at the Pierre Auger Observatory</a><span class="id">[2509.19984]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this contribution, we present the status and first data from the Radio Detector (RD) at the Pierre Auger Observatory, consisting of $1660$ radio antennas deployed across the $3000$ km$^2$ surface detector array. These antennas measure the radio emission from extensive air showers in the $30-80$ MHz band, enabling electromagnetic energy measurements for air showers with zenith angles above $65°$. Combined with the muonic measurements from the water-Cherenkov detectors (WCDs), this allows mass composition studies at the highest energies. The large-scale deployment of the RD began in November 2023 and was completed in November 2024. A full end-to-end calibration shows consistency between Galactic and in-lab calibration to better than $5$\% and includes continuous monitoring for hardware failures, ensuring, for example, antenna alignment within $5°$. We present the first data, demonstrating a strong correlation between the electromagnetic energy measured by the RD and the total shower energy measured by the WCD, confirming that the detector chain - including triggering, data readout, absolute calibration, and reconstruction is well understood. We highlight a particularly impressive $32$ EeV shower at a zenith angle of $85°$, producing a $50$ km-long radio footprint, showcasing the unique capabilities of this detector.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Educational Guide for 2D Stellar Structure Calculations of Rapidly Rotating Stars using the ESTER code</a><span class="id">[2509.20264]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Evolution STEllaire en Rotation (ESTER) code is the first 2D stellar structure code to be made open-source and freely available to the astronomy and astrophysics community. An important and novel advancement of this code is that it can reproduce the distorted shape and observable signatures (e.g., gravity darkening) of rapidly rotating stars. ESTER also calculates the steady-state large-scale flows within the star, namely their differential rotation and associated meridional circulation. In this report, we explore and document the physics implemented within version 1.1.0rc2 of the ESTER code, in a way that complements published descriptions. We illustrate this physics by plotting how stellar structure parameters vary through stellar interiors at a range of latitudes and at different angular velocities. We investigate how the thin convective envelopes of intermediate mass stars vary with latitude when rapidly rotating, becoming deeper and thicker near the equator. Simple comparisons of ESTER model predictions (e.g., central temperature and density, luminosity) with the output from the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code [Paxton et al., 2010] shows generally good agreement. Additional comparisons provide important benchmarking and verification for ESTER as a comparatively young code. Finally, we provide a guide for installing and running the code on our local university cluster, aimed at helping students to begin work.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20285" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GroundBIRD Telescope: Systematics Modelization of MKID Arrays Response</a><span class="id">[2509.20285]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Kinetic inductance detectors are widely used in millimeter- and submillimeter-wave astronomy, benefiting from their fast response and relative ease of fabrication. The GroundBIRD telescope employs microwave kinetic inductance detectors at 145 and 220 GHz to observe the cosmic microwave background.

This study models resonance frequency shifts induced by each source using calibrated on-site measurements of precipitable water vapor and temperature. Comparison with observational data confirms the validity of the models and identifies atmospheric loading as the dominant contributor to frequency variation under typical observation conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20310" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep learning for exoplanet detection and characterization by direct imaging at high contrast</a><span class="id">[2509.20310]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Exoplanet imaging is a major challenge in astrophysics due to the need for high angular resolution and high contrast.

Our goal is to reconstruct high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR) domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to generate reconstructions that are not only visually sharper but also physically consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical image enhancement.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Attention U-Net for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches</a><span class="id">[2509.19838]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detecting continuous gravitational waves is challenging due to the high computational cost of template-based searches across large parameter spaces, particularly for all-sky searches. Machine learning offers a promising solution to perform these searches with reasonable computational resources. In this study, we trained an attention U-Net, a convolutional neural network, on $\approx$ 10.67 days of simulated data with Gaussian noise for all-sky searches at different frequencies within the 20-1000 Hz band. Our model trained at 20 Hz achieves the best sensitivity, with a 90% detection efficiency sensitivity depth $D^{90\%} = 29.97 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ with a 1% false alarm rate per 50 mHz, while the model trained on the entire 20-1000 Hz band yields $D^{90\%} = 18.63 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. The sensitivities achieved are comparable to state-of-the-art results using deep learning approaches, with less than 50% of the training time and data. We find that sensitivity scales as $T^{0.28 \pm 0.01}$ with total observation time for the attention U-Net trained at 20 Hz, similar to semi-coherent search methods. The neural network demonstrates robustness on datasets with time gaps, with sensitivity dependence on duty factor analyzed. We also investigated the sensitivity dependence of the trained attention U-Net models on sky location. Our findings show that attention U-Net is a scalable and effective approach for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Chat&quot; between extreme mass ratio inspirals and Galactic binaries in LISA data</a><span class="id">[2509.20062]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The future space-based gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, is expected to observe between a few and a few thousand extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) per year.

In this work, we investigate the interaction between a gravitational signal from an EMRI and millions of signals from inspiralling Galactic white dwarf binaries. We demonstrate that bright Galactic binaries contaminate the detection and characterization of EMRIs. We perform Bayesian inference of EMRI parameters after removing resolvable Galactic binaries and confirm an accuracy comparable to that expected in Gaussian noise.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A meshfree approach for rapid reconstruction of compact binary sources detected in the network of international gravitational wave detectors</a><span class="id">[2509.20104]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This thesis explores parameter estimation methods for rapidly reconstructing compact binary sources generating gravitational waves.

The tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise in the inter-spacecraft interferometers, which originates from the angular jitters of the spacecrafts and the movable optical subassemblies, is predicted to be one of the main noise sources that might reduce Taiji's sensitivity to GWs. Since these angular jitters can be read out through the differential wavefront sensors, it is possible to suppress TTL noise during the data processing stage by fitting and subtracting it. This paper proposes an improved algorithm for TTL noise suppression, which addresses the issue of unknown noise floor required for optimal estimation in the practical detection scenario, and the design of this algorithm takes into account the presence of GW signals. The algorithm is validated via numerical simulation, which is built on a spacecraft dynamics simulation incorporating Taiji's drag-free and attitude control system. We also demonstrate the robustness of this algorithm by varying TTL coefficients at different levels, indicating that our algorithm is applicable to a range of payload statuses, and ultimately providing a critical advancement toward realizing Taiji's full sensitivity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">21st-Century Astrobiology Missions Should Seek These High-Confidence Biosignatures</a><span class="id">[2508.02746]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This white paper was submitted to NASA's Search For Life Science Analysis Group (SFL-SAG): To ensure that the first mission designed to seek signs of extant life since 1976 is able to produce an unambiguous biological interpretation, the SFL-SAG is tasked with identifying the most high-confidence, agnostic biosignatures which are targetable, detectable, and measurable in Martian subsurface mid-latitude ice.

To ascertain the conditions that determine whether (or how much) SO2, H2S, and other sulfur-bearing species are present in exoplanet atmospheres, we present a grid of planetary atmospheres covering metallicities from 0.3-1000x Solar and temperatures from 250-2050 K. These models map out the 'SO2 shoreline,' the region of metallicity and irradiation for which SO2 may be sufficiently abundant to be detectable. SO2 is a sensitive indicator of metallicity; expected SO2 abundances also depend strongly on overall temperature and C/O ratio; the SO2 abundance depends surprisingly weakly on XUV irradiation, also weakly on Kzz (for Teq &gt; 600 K), and is essentially independent of internal temperature. Despite its detection in a growing number of giant planets, SO2 is never the dominant sulfur-bearing molecule: depending on temperature and metallicity, H2S, S2, NS, SO, SH, and even S8 or atomic S are frequently as common (or more so) as SO2. Nonetheless SO2 remains the most easily detectable sulfur-bearing species, followed by H2S, though perhaps SO and SH could be detectable in some gas giants. Aside from a pressing need for additional observational constraints on sulfur, we also identify the need for future work to account for the effects of clouds and hazes, fully self-consistent atmospheric models, 2D and 3D models, a wider range of planetary masses and radii, and studies to measure and refine reaction rates and molecular opacities of sulfur-bearing species</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum Computing Tools for Fast Detection of Gravitational Waves in the Context of LISA Space Mission</a><span class="id">[2509.12929]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The field of gravitational wave (GW) detection is progressing rapidly, with several next-generation observatories on the horizon, including LISA. GW data is challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source properties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need for robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the development of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural networks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs simulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then extended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to distinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are evaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing it against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably distinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies above 98\%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind dataset. The remaining merger, characterized by the lowest amplitude, highlights an area for future improvement in model sensitivity. This can potentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, which we are preparing, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes.</p></div></details></article></body>
