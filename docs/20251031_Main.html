Tides also affect stellar and planetary rotation rates. We demonstrate that in addition to altering spin synchronization and pseudosynchronization, tidally driven inertial waves in the convective envelopes of low-mass stars and gas giant planets can enhance tidal eccentricity damping. Analytically, we find that eccentricity damping by inertial waves can be orders of magnitude faster than equilibrium tides, independent of any eddy viscosity prescription. We use simplified numerical experiments to demonstrate this enhancement, and to explore the effects of different mixing length treatments of convective turbulence, as well as a spin-down torque from magnetic braking. These calculations demonstrate that tidally driven inertial waves can produce an extended cool core of nearly circular binaries, helping to reconcile a longstanding discrepancy between observed and predicted main-sequence binary circularization. Our calculations additionally suggest that tidally driven inertial waves may leave identifiable signatures in the ratios of orbital to rotation periods for stellar binaries, including synchronous and sub-synchronous rotation periods reminiscent of populations identified in Kepler, TESS, and Gaia data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The kSZ optical depth degeneracy and future constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity</a><span class="id">[2510.25821]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent reconstructions of the large-scale cosmological velocity field with kinetic Sunyaev Zeldovich (kSZ) tomography have returned an amplitude that is low with respect to the halo model prediction, captured by the kSZ velocity reconstruction bias $b_v &lt;1$. This suggests that common choices for modeling the galaxy-electron cross correlation have systematically overestimated the true power, at least over scales and redshifts used in the velocity reconstruction measurements. In this paper, we study the implications of this overestimation for constraints on local-type primordial non-Gaussianity in current and near-future cosmological surveys. For concreteness, we focus on kSZ velocity reconstruction from a Vera Rubin Observatory-like survey in tandem with contemporary cosmic microwave background measurements. Assuming standard choices for the fiducial model of the small-scale galaxy-electron cross correlation, we find that upcoming kSZ tomography measurements can significantly improve constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity via measurement of scale-dependent galaxy bias, in broad concordance with previous studies of the application of kSZ tomography to primordial non-Gaussianity. However, when we instead modify the assumed galaxy-electron cross-spectrum to be consistent with recent measurements of the velocity reconstruction bias, this picture can change appreciably. Specifically, we find that if the inferred suppression of galaxy-electron power persists at higher redshifts $z\gtrsim 1$, kSZ-driven improvement in local primordial non-Gaussianity constraints may be less significant than previously estimated. We explore how these conclusions depend on various modeling and experimental assumptions and discuss implications for the emerging program of kSZ velocity reconstruction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Updated dark pixel fraction constraints on reionization's end from the Lyman-series forests of XQR-30</a><span class="id">[2510.25829]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fraction of &quot;dark pixels&quot; in the Ly$\alpha$ and other Lyman-series forests at $z\sim 5-6$ provides a powerful constraint on the end of the reionization process. Any spectral region showing transmission must be highly ionized, while dark regions could be ionized or neutral, thus the dark pixel fraction provides a (nearly) model independent upper limit to the volume-filling fraction of the neutral intergalactic medium, modulo choices in binning scale and dark pixel definition. Here we provide updated measurements of the 3.3 comoving Mpc dark pixel fraction at $z=4.85-6.25$ in the Ly$\alpha$, Ly$\beta$, and Ly$\gamma$ forests of 34 deep $5.8\lesssim z\lesssim 6.6$ quasar spectra from the (enlarged) XQR-30 sample. Using the negative pixel method to measure the dark pixel fraction, we derive fiducial $1\sigma$ upper limits on the volume-average neutral hydrogen fraction of $\langle x_{\rm{HI}}\rangle \leq \{0.030 + 0.048, 0.095 + 0.037, 0.191 + 0.056, 0.199 + 0.087\}$ at $\bar{z} = \{5.481, 5.654, 5.831, 6.043\}$ from the optimally sensitive combination of the Ly$\beta$ and Ly$\gamma$ forests. We further demonstrate an alternative method that treats the forest flux as a mixture of dark and transparent regions, where the latter are modeled using a physically-motivated parametric form for the intrinsic opacity distribution. The resulting model-dependent upper limits on $\langle x_{\rm{HI}}\rangle$ are similar to those derived from our fiducial model-independent analysis. We confirm that the bulk of reionization must be finished at $z&gt;6$, while leaving room for an extended &quot;soft landing&quot; to the reionization history down to $z\sim 5.4$ suggested by Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity fluctuations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demystifying flux eruptions: Magnetic flux transport in magnetically arrested disks</a><span class="id">[2510.25842]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetically arrested disks (MADs) are a compelling model for explaining variability in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), including horizon-scale outbursts like those observed in Sagittarius A*. MADs experience powerful flux eruptions-episodic ejections of magnetic flux from the black hole horizon-that may drive the observed luminosity variations. In this work, we develop and validate a new formalism describing large-scale magnetic field transport in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of MADs with geometrical thicknesses of $h/R=0.1$ and $h/R=0.3$. We introduce a net flux transport velocity, $v_\Phi$, which accounts for both advective and diffusive processes. We show that MADs maintain a statistical quasi-steady state where advection and diffusion nearly balance. Flux eruptions appear as small deviations from this equilibrium, with $v_\Phi/V_k\ll1$, where $V_k$ is the local Keplerian velocity. Using this framework, we analytically derive a recurrence timescale for flux eruptions, $t_{\rm rec}\sim1500\, r_g/c$. This timescale closely matches simulation results. The smallness of $v_\Phi$ explains the long recurrence times of flux eruptions compared to other system timescales. We also take a closer look at the diffusion of the magnetic field by performing the first measurement of turbulent resistivity in MADs. We then estimate the turbulent magnetic Prandtl number, defined as the ratio of turbulent viscosity to turbulent resistivity. We find $\mathcal{P}_m\sim3$, consistent with shearing-box simulations of magneto rotational instability-driven turbulence. While flux eruptions excite large-scale non-axisymmetric modes and locally enhance turbulent resistivity, magnetic field diffusion is dominated by smaller-scale turbulent motions. These results provide new insight into the nature of AGN variability and the fundamental physics of magnetic field transport.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25862" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WOCS XCIII: NGC 7789: the Evolution of Li, Stellar Rotation, and Extended Main Sequence Turnoffs</a><span class="id">[2510.25862]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Precision UBVRI photometry of NGC 7789 is combined with Gaia data to map reddening variations across the cluster face. HYDRA spectra, Gaia astrometry, and isochrone fitting constrain the absolute reddening, apparent modulus, and age to E(B-V) = 0.30 +/- 0.02, (m-M)=12.51 +/- 0.06, and 1.46 +/- 0.02 Gyr for [Fe/H] between -0.2 and solar; the spectroscopic [Fe/H] = -0.13 +/- 0.068 (MAD) from 156 single-star members. Corrections for variable reddening reduce the scatter in the unevolved main sequence below the turnoff. A(Li) is derived for only single star members from the G-dwarf Li-Plateau to the tip of the red giant branch. Giants separate into two distinct groups, probable first-ascent giants with detectable Li that declines with evolution toward the red giant tip and stars within the clump and the asymptotic giant branch which only exhibit upper limits. A(Li) structure from the turnoff to the unevolved main sequence, including the Li-Dip, and the presence of an extended color spread among the upper main sequence stars are attributed to the V_ROT distribution, indicating the wall of the Li-Dip as the true hot boundary of the Kraft break. Differences in the color-magnitude diagram topology of NGC 7789 and NGC 752 are explored and attributed to differences in the individual cluster V_ROT distributions. Prior indications that main sequence stars more massive than the Li-Dip evolve redward across the Li-Wall, undergoing rotational spindown and Li depletion like stars within the Li-Dip, are confirmed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Pipeline for Efficient Analysis of Large Spectroscopic Samples of OB Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.25871]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new spectroscopic pipeline designed to analyse large numbers of hot massive stars homogeneously.

With the highest angular resolution of any X-ray facility, its imaging and spectral capabilities in the 0.5-10 keV band have led to both unique and complementary breakthroughs in nearly all areas of the field. Now more than a quarter century into its mission, Chandra continues to provide unique information on the contributions of compact objects to the evolution of galaxies, the nature of supernova explosions, the impact of energetic jets from supermassive black holes on their host environments, and the fate of exoplanet atmospheres in systems rich with stellar flares. Here we provide a summary of Chandra results - one that is embarrassingly incomplete, but representative of both the exquisite past and promising future for Chandra's contributions to high energy astrophysics and all of mainstream astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitigating gain calibration errors from EoR observations with SKA1-Low AA*</a><span class="id">[2510.25886]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The observation of the redshifted 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen is a promising probe for understanding the phase transition of the early universe and its evolution during the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). One of the primary obstacles to the statistical detection of the target signal is the presence of residual foreground, which arises from gain calibration errors. Previous studies have shown that gain calibration errors as small as 0.01% can lead to a biased interpretation of the observed signal power spectrum estimation, by nearly an order of magnitude. A recent study further highlights that to retrieve astrophysical parameters accurately, the threshold gain calibration error should be lower than 0.01%. In this work, we develop a post-calibration mitigation strategy that combines foreground subtraction techniques with foreground avoidance to address residual contamination arising from gain calibration errors. We use an end-to-end pipeline 21cmE2E to simulate a realistic sky model and telescope configuration within the 138-146 MHz frequency range. To assess the impact of residual antenna-based gain calibration errors, we perform a detailed power spectrum analysis across several threshold levels. Our analysis shows that the extraction of the target signal over the wavenumber range $0.05 \leq k \leq 0.5$ Mpc$^{-1}$ is possible with a threshold gain calibration error of 1%, although with a significant SNR tradeoff on larger scales. Moreover, this work also offers a comparative assessment of foreground removal and avoidance techniques in the context of future SKA1-Low AA* observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atmospheric collapse and re-inflation through impacts for terrestrial planets around M dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2510.25896]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detection of an atmosphere around a terrestrial exoplanet will be a major milestone in the field, but our observational capacities are biased towards to tidally locked, close-in planets orbiting M-dwarf stars. The atmospheres of these planets are vulnerable to atmospheric erosion and collapse due to condensation of volatiles on the nightside. However, these collapsed volatiles accumulated as nightside ice constitute a stable reservoir that could be re-vaporised by meteorite impacts and re-establish the atmospheres. Through a simple energy balance model applied to atmospheric evolution simulations with stochastic impacts, we assess the viability and importance of this mechanism for CO$_2$ atmospheres. We find that moderate-sized impactors ($5-10 \rm{km}$ diameter) occurring at a frequency of $1-100 \rm{Gyr}^{-1}$ can regenerate observable transient atmospheres on previously airless planets. We focus on specific targets from the JWST DDT Rocky Worlds programme, and compute the fraction of their evolution spent with a transient CO$_2$ atmosphere generated through this mechanism. We find this fraction can reach $70\%$ for GJ 3929 b, $50\%$ for LTT 1445 Ac, $80\%$ for LTT 1445 Ab, at high impact rates and strong CO$_2$ outgassing over the planet's lifetime. We also show that atmospheric collapse can shield volatiles from escape, particularly in the early, high-XUV phase of M-dwarf evolution. Overall, our work suggests that terrestrial planet atmospheres may not evolve monotonically but instead may be shaped by episodic external forcings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEOForCE: Near-Earth Objects' Forecast of Collisional Events</a><span class="id">[2510.25923]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Robust impact monitoring of near-Earth objects is an essential task of planetary defense. Current systems such as NASA's Sentry-II, the University of Pisa's CLOMON2, and ESA's Aegis have been highly successful, but independent approaches are essential to ensure reliability and to cross-validate predictions of possible impacts. We present NEOForCE (Near-Earth Objects' Forecast of Collisional Events), a new independent monitoring system for asteroid impact prediction. By relying on orbital solutions from DynAstVO at Paris Observatory and using an original methodology for uncertainty propagation, NEOForCE provides an alternative line of verification for impact assessments and strengthens the overall robustness of planetary defense. As other monitoring systems, NEOForCE samples several thousand virtual asteroids from the uncertainty region and integrates their orbits up to 100 years into the future. Instead of searching for close approaches of the virtual asteroids with the Earth, our system looks for times when the Earth comes close to the realistic uncertainty regions around them, which are mostly stretched along their osculating orbits. We also estimate the maximal impact probability, and only if this value is large enough do we continue to the next step. In this second step, we compute how the original asteroid orbit should be modified so that the new trajectory leads to an Earth impact, which allows us to confirm the possible collision and estimate the impact probability. We tested NEOForCE against NASA's Sentry-II system on five representative asteroids: 2000 SG344, 2005 QK76, 2008 JL3, 2023 DO and 2025 JU. NEOForCE successfully recovered nearly all possible collisions reported by Sentry-II with impact probabilities above e-7, demonstrating the robustness of our approach. In addition, NEOForCE identified several potential impacts at the e-7 - e-6 level that Sentry-II did not report.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How does ice shell geometry shape ocean dynamics on icy moons?</a><span class="id">[2510.25988]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A poleward-thinning ice shell can drive circulation in the subsurface oceans of icy moons by imposing a meridional temperature gradient–colder at the equator than the pole–through the freezing point suppression due to pressure. This temperature gradient sets a buoyancy gradient, whose sign depends on the thermal expansion coefficient determined by ocean salinity. Together with vertical mixing, this buoyancy forcing shapes key oceanic features, including zonal currents in thermal wind balance, baroclinic instability of those currents, meridional heat transport by eddies, and vertical stratification. We use high-resolution numerical simulations to explore how variations in ice shell thickness affect these processes. Our simulations span a wide range of topographic slopes, pole-to-equator temperature differences, and vertical mixing strengths, for both fresh and salty oceans. We find that baroclinic eddies dominate large-scale circulation and meridional heat transport, consistent with studies assuming a flat ice-ocean interface. However, sloped topography introduces new effects: when lighter water overlies denser water along the slope, circulation weakens as a stratified layer thickens beneath the poles. Conversely, when denser water lies beneath the poles, circulation strengthens as topography increases the available potential energy. We develop a scaling framework that predicts heat transport and stratification across all simulations. Applying this framework to Enceladus, Europa, and Titan, we infer ocean heat fluxes, stratification, and tidal energy dissipation and showing large-scale circulation constrains tidal heating and links future observations of ice thickness and rotation to subsurface ocean dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational-Wave Constraints on Neutron-Star Pressure Anisotropy via Universal Relations</a><span class="id">[2510.26042]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutron stars may exhibit pressure anisotropy arising from various physical mechanisms, such as elasticity, magnetic fields, viscosity, and superfluidity. We compute the tidal deformability and the $f$-mode oscillation frequency of anisotropic neutron stars using a phenomenological quasi-local model characterized by a single dimensionless anisotropy parameter. We find that while the relation between the tidal deformability and the $f$-mode frequency depends on the degree of anisotropy, it remains largely insensitive to variations in the equation of state (the relation between radial pressure and energy density) for a fixed anisotropy parameter, similar to the isotropic case. Leveraging this anisotropy-dependent universal relation within a statistical framework, we place constraints on the anisotropy parameter using both the gravitational wave observation of GW170817 and simulated data for a GW170817-like event observed by a future network of detectors. We find that the anisotropy parameter can be constrained to order unity with current data, and the bounds remain comparable with future detector sensitivities. Importantly, these constraints are only weakly affected by uncertainties in the neutron-star equation of state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot Jupiter Origin and Tidal Evolution Constrained by a Broken Age-Frequency Relation</a><span class="id">[2510.26084]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of hot Jupiters has challenged the classical planet formation theory. Although various formation mechanisms have been proposed, the dominant channel and relative contributions remain unclear. Furthermore, hot Jupiters offer a unique opportunity to test tidal theory and measure the fundamental tidal quality factor, which is yet to be well-constrained. In this work, based on a hot Jupiter sample around single Sun-like stars with kinematic properties, {we find that the declining trend of their frequency is broken with a ridge at about 2 Gyr, providing direct evidence that hot Jupiters are formed with multiple origins of different timescales. By fitting with the theoretical expectations, we provide a constraint of tidal factor for Sun-like stars, which aligns well with the detected number of hot Jupiters with orbital decay. Moreover, we simultaneously constrain the relative importance of different channels: although the majority of hot Jupiters are formed early, within several tenths of Gyr via 'Early' models (e.g., in-situ formation, disk migration, planet-planet scattering and Kozai-Lidov interaction), a significant portion (about 40%) should be formed late on a relatively long timescale extending up to several Gyr mainly via the secular chaos mechanism, further supported by the obliquity distribution of 'late-arrived' hot Jupiters. Our findings provide a unified framework that reconciles hot Jupiter demographics and long-term evolution with multichannel formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence of cosmic-ray acceleration up to sub-PeV energies in the supernova remnant IC 443</a><span class="id">[2510.26112]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernova remnants (SNRs) have been considered as the primary contributors to cosmic rays (CRs) in our Galaxy. However, the maximum energy of particles that can be accelerated by shocks of SNRs is uncertain observationally and theoretically, and the role of contribution to CRs around PeV energies by SNRs is unclear. In this study, we present observations of high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from the SNR IC 443 using the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). The morphological analysis reveals a pointlike source whose location and spectrum are consistent with those of the Fermi-LAT-detected compact source with $\pi^0$-decay signature, and a more extended source which is consistent with a newly discovered source, previously unrecognized by Fermi-LAT. The spectrum of the point source can be described by a power-law function with an index of $\sim3.0$, extending beyond $\sim 30$ TeV without apparent cutoff. Assuming a hadronic origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission, the $95\%$ lower limit of accelerated protons reaches about 300 TeV. The extended source might be coincident with IC 443, SNR G189.6+3.3 or the putative pulsar wind nebula CXOU J061705.3+222127, and can be explained by either a hadronic or leptonic model. The LHAASO results provide compelling evidence that CR protons up to sub-PeV energies can be accelerated by the SNR.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direct Numerical Simulations of Oxygen-Flame-Driven Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition in Type Ia Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2510.26152]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present direct numerical simulations demonstrating deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) driven by oxygen flames in Type Ia supernova progenitors. Using the Castro hydrodynamics code coupled with the “aprox13” 13-isotope nuclear network, we simulate combustion in isolated fuel regions where oxygen flames trail carbon flames. In a fiducial one-dimensional run at $\rho_{0}=3.5\times10^{7}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$ we observe spontaneous DDT of the oxygen flame via the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism when the carbon-oxygen separation reaches $\sim 10\ \mathrm{km}$. The oxygen detonation then captures the carbon flame and triggers a stable carbon detonation. Systematic one-dimensional parameter scans show that successful carbon DDT requires upstream densities in the range $(3.1$–$3.6)\times10^{7}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$ and a minimum carbon-flame thickness of $\gtrsim 20\ \mathrm{m}$. Two-dimensional simulations confirm DDT and demonstrate that the multidimensional cellular structure of the oxygen detonation can promote carbon detonation at somewhat lower densities than in one dimension. These results provide direct numerical evidence that oxygen-flame-driven DDT is physically plausible in turbulent white-dwarf environments and underscore the importance of multidimensional effects for Type Ia supernova explosion modeling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-Faceted Emission Properties of PSR J2129+4119 Observed with FAST</a><span class="id">[2510.26209]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed single-pulse study of the long-period pulsar PSR J2129+4119 using high-sensitivity FAST observations. Despite locating well below the traditional death line, the pulsar exhibits sustained and multi-modal emission behavior, including nulls, weak pulses, regular emission, and occasional bright pulses. The nulling fraction is measured to be $8.13\% \pm 0.51\%$, with null durations typically under four pulse periods. Fluctuation spectral analysis reveals both phase-modulated subpulse drifting and intermittent beat-like modulation. At the same time, polarization profiles show high linear polarization and stable polarization position angle (PPA) swings consistent with a near-tangential sightline geometry. Quasi-periodic microstructures are detected in 11.54\% of regular pulses, with a mean periodicity and width of 4.57 ms and 4.30 ms, respectively. A well-defined scintillation arc in the secondary spectrum confirms the presence of a localized scattering screen. These results indicate that PSR J2129+4119 remains magnetospherically active and coherently emitting despite its low energy loss rate, offering key insights into pulsar emission physics near the death line.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new particle-based code for Lagrangian stochastic models applied to stellar turbulent convection</a><span class="id">[2510.26220]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The inclusion of convection in stellar evolution models lacks realism, especially near convective-radiative interfaces. Furthermore, the interaction of convection with oscillations prevent us from accurately predicting seismic frequencies, and therefore from fully exploiting the asteroseismic data of low-mass stars. We aim to develop a new formalism to model the one-point statistics of stellar convection, to implement it in a new numerical code, and to validate this implementation against benchmark cases. This new formalism is based on Lagrangian Probability Density Function (PDF) methods, where a Fokker-Planck equation for the PDF of particle-based turbulent properties is integrated in time. We then develop a Monte-Carlo implementation of this method, where the flow is represented by a large number of notional particles acting as realisations of the PDF. Notional particles interact with each other through the time- and space-dependent mean flow, which is estimated from the particle realisations through a scheme similar to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. We establish a model for the evolution of turbulent properties along Lagrangian trajectories applicable to stellar turbulent convection, with only a minimal number of physical assumptions necessary to close the system. In particular, no closure is needed for the non-linear advection terms, which are included exactly through the Lagrangian nature of formalism. The numerical implementation of this new formalism allows us to extract time-dependent maps of the statistical properties of turbulent convection in a way which is not possible in grid-based large-eddy simulations, in particular the turbulent pressure, Reynolds stress tensor, internal energy variance and convective flux.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Parameters and Evolutionary Pathways of the Subgiant system HIP 72217</a><span class="id">[2510.26224]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we applied Al-Wardat's method to analyze the subgiant system HIP72217 for which we obtained accurate parameters including stellar masses, effective temperatures ($T_{\text{eff}}$) and system this http URL the primary component we determined a stellar mass of $M_A = 1.14 \pm 0.15\,M_{\odot}$ and effective temperature $T_{\text{eff,A}} = 6125 \pm 50$ K while for the secondary component we obtained the values of $M_B = 1.12 \pm 0.14\,M_{\odot}$ and $T_{\text{eff,2}} = 5950 \pm 50$ K.

It is now possible using the apsidal motion rate in close eccentric binaries! The apsidal motion rate depends on the tidal interactions occurring between the stars and is proportional to k2, a measure of the star's inner density profile. Confronting standard stellar models with observations reveals the famous k2-discrepancy: models predict too high a k2 for the stars, that is to say, stars with too low a density contrast between their core and envelope. We built bespoke GENEC stellar evolution models including tidal mixing for the twin massive binary HD 152248. The models reveal the instabilities allowing to reproduce the stellar density profiles: advecto-diffusive models better reproduce k2 than magnetic models. A large overshooting is necessary to converge towards the observed k2, yet alone is not sufficient. While a change in metallicity or mass-loss rate has no significant impact on k2, a larger initial helium abundance allows us to better reproduce the k2. Yet, a super-solar helium abundance is not observationally supported. Our analyses highlight the need for a process in the stars that slows down the radial expansion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weak-Lensing Detection of Intercluster Filaments in Three Nearby Cluster Systems</a><span class="id">[2510.26318]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Direct detection of intercluster filaments is challenging due to their low surface density, resulting in a weak deflection field. We present weak-lensing detections of intercluster filaments using wide-field Dark Energy Camera (DECam) observations from the Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). A matched-filter method was applied to identify filamentary structures in three nearby ($z &lt; 0.1$) systems centered on Abell 401, Abell 2029, and Abell 3558. We discover two prominent filaments ($\geq 4\sigma$) in each system, with the strongest detections ($6.4\sigma - 7.3\sigma$) around Abell 401 and Abell 2029. In particular, we report the first robust weak-lensing detections $(&gt;5 \sigma)$ of the intercluster bridges connecting the cluster pairs Abell 401/399, Abell 2029/2033, Abell 2029/SIG, and Abell 3558/3556. Adopting a filament convergence model motivated by numerical simulations, we infer the maximum convergence ($\kappa_0$) and characteristic width ($h_{\mathrm{c}}$) for all six filaments, yielding $\kappa_0 \sim 0.015 - 0.053$ and $h_{\mathrm{c}} \sim 0.11 - 0.45 \ \mathrm{Mpc}$. The performance of the matched-filter technique is validated using mock shear catalogs and further tested on a null field around Abell 2351. We also explore the potential of using the B-mode lensing signal of filaments to suppress cluster-induced shear contamination. These results demonstrate the feasibility of directly mapping dark matter filaments with current and future wide-field weak-lensing datasets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26355" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Model-independent late-universe measurements of $H_0$ and $Ω_\mathrm{K}$ with the PAge-improved inverse distance ladder</a><span class="id">[2510.26355]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The standard $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model has encountered serious challenges and the $H_0$ tension has become more significant with increasingly precise cosmological observation. Meanwhile, inconsistencies in measurements of the curvature parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ between different datasets also have emerged. In this work, we employ two global and cosmic age-based parameterizations, PAge and MAPAge, to perform model-independent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ by utilizing the inverse distance ladder (IDL). To construct the PAge-improved IDL, we utilize the strong gravitational lensing (SGL), cosmic chronometers (CC), and gamma ray bursts (GRB) data to calibrate the latest DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation data and DESY5 type Ia supernova data. Our analysis indicate that DESI+DESY5+SGL+CC+GRB gives $H_0=71.59\pm 0.94\,{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ in the MAPAge model, reducing the $H_0$ tension to the $1.0\sigma$ level. Extending to MAPAge$+\Omega_{\rm K}$ model, we obtain $\Omega_\mathrm{K}=0.001\pm 0.038$, which suggests that current late-time data are consistent with a flat universe. Finally, the Bayesian analysis indicates that the present late-universe data provide weak to moderate evidence in favor of PAge and MAPAge relative to $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$Λ$vCF: Extending $Λ$CDM into a Unified Model with Particle Creation</a><span class="id">[2510.26366]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel extended version of the $\Lambda$CDM model that provides analytical solution for Hubble parameter uniting all epochs of cosmic evolution starting from inflation to late-acceleration, with intermediate radiation and matter-dominated epochs. This is achieved by relaxing the perfect fluid assumption in the standard model and considering a general viscous cosmic fluid (vCF) with non-zero particle creation rate and evolving adiabatic equation of state. Transition points of the Universe and the finite boundary connecting them is exactly determined. We then propose a novel method to determine the early-time viscous coefficient and inflation energy scale using the Cosmic Mode Index value postulated by Padmanabhan. Considering the data from the Planck 2018 analysis, this yields an inflationary Hubble parameter of $H_{I}\approx10^{13}$ GeV. An equivalent scalar-field description for the inflationary epoch is then constructed and inferences are made regarding the nature of inflation. Notably, we find that the model describes an ultra-slow-roll hilltop inflation scenario with a graceful exit to radiation-dominated epoch. Subsequently, we show that bulk viscosity in this model can be expressed as Israel-Stewart equation in relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics with an appropriate underlying viscous coefficient and relaxation time that satisfy the causality constraint in its extreme limit. Finally, by comparing the evolution of this causal relation and its Navier-Stokes counterpart, we infer that the evolution from inflation to radiation era signifies a fluid transitioning from viscoelastic to pseudoplastic behavior.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26385" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The light curve model fitting of LMC Cepheids: MESA-RSP versus Stellingwerf's code predictions</a><span class="id">[2510.26385]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A major challenge in modeling classical Cepheids is the treatment of convection, particularly its complex interplay with pulsation. This inherently three-dimensional process is typically approximated in one-dimensional hydrocodes using dimensionless turbulent convection (TC) free parameters. Calibrating these parameters is essential for reproducing key observational features such as light-curve amplitudes, secondary bumps, and the red edge of the instability strip. In this work, we calibrate TC parameters adopted in the publicly available MESA-RSP code through comparison with both observational data of classical Cepheids and stellar parameter constraints from the Stellingwerf code. We compute multi-band (V, I, and Ks) MESA-RSP light curves for 18 observed Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids, using stellar parameters determined from the Stellingwerf code. By fine-tuning the mixing-length and eddy viscosity parameters, we calibrate the TC treatment in MESA-RSP. We then compare the resulting period-luminosity (PL), period-radius (PR), and period-mass-radius (PMR) relations with predictions from the Stellingwerf models. We successfully reproduce multi-band light curves and obtain PL, PR, and PMR relations consistent with Ragosta et al. (2019). While in broad agreement with previous work, we explicitly identify distinct mass-luminosity (ML) relations for fundamental-mode and first-overtone Cepheids for the first time. This suggests that the macroscopic processes affecting the ML relation depend on stellar mass and/or effective temperature range. Although our study focuses on the calibration of TC parameters, we do not find a single set of parameter values that reproduces all light curves. No statistically significant correlation is found between stellar properties and convection parameters, although subtle trends with period and effective temperature may be present.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The dance of dust: Investigating young stellar object dipper variability</a><span class="id">[2510.26449]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dipper subclass of YSOs are characterised by frequent dips in their light curves. Irregular dippers do not show periodic signatures and have dips accounting for significant proportions of their photospheric flux. Given the short timescales on which these dips occur, their driving mechanisms are linked to the inner circumstellar disc dynamics. We present the first multi-epoch analysis of 16 irregular dippers observed with X-Shooter. Investigating the properties of their dips, and in particular the analysis of the dust characteristics, we aim to understand the root of their variability, and get a glimpse of the inner disc behaviour. We employed a novel approach to measure the properties of the dips, by combining class III templates with Gaia photometry to construct the intrinsic photospheres. We measured several dip properties including the depth of the dips, near-infrared (NIR) excesses, and their optical depths as a function of wavelength. We record 20 significant dips that range in their dip properties and show no relation to one another. In almost all cases, the low optical depths and small NIR excesses are observed. Comparison of their optical depths with grain opacity models show that the dips can be explained by the presence of dust substructures containing processed grains obscuring their photospheres and/or their discs. These grain distributions can have maximum sizes as large as 20$\mu m$ and in many cases have almost grey-like extinction, while some require a strong scattering component. The findings highlight the extent of the irregularity of dippers, but also link it to the dust dynamics in the inner regions of circumstellar discs. The dust substructures causing the variability require processed dust grains to be lifted above the disc into the line of sight. Possible lifting mechanisms including disc winds, unstable accretion columns, and disc warps are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In space there will be no need to scream - Limits to the presence of giant planets in the $ζ^2$ Ret system</a><span class="id">[2510.26483]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The search for life beyond our Solar system has been a long and difficult endeavour.

The latter includes a set of volatile species, gas flow through the porous interior, crystallization of amorphous ice, sublimation and refreezing of volatiles in the pores. We follow the evolution of three models, with radii of 2, 10 and 50 km for 4.6 Gyr, through different dynamical epochs, starting in the vicinity of Neptune, moving to the Oort Cloud and after a long sojourn there, back inward to the planetary region. The initial composition includes a mixture of CO, CO2 ices, amorphous water ice with trapped CO and CO2, and this http URL find that the CO ice is completely depleted in the small object, but preserved in the larger ones from a depth of 500 m to the center, while the CO2 and the amorphous ice are entirely preserved. Of crucial importance is the change in CO abundance profiles during the cooling phase, as the objects migrate to the OC. Upon return from the Oort Cloud, the activity is driven by CO sublimation at large heliocentric distances (up to 50 au), by CO2 inward of 13 au and by gas released from crystallizing amorphous ice at about 7 au. We test the effect of radioactive heating by long-lived isotopes and find that it is negligible. Considering sub-solar temperatures and limited active areas, we show that CO2 production rates can exceed the detection limit as far out as 25 au.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The $N_H$ Distribution of Hard X-ray Selected AGN in the NEP Field</a><span class="id">[2510.26554]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray surveys are one of the most unbiased methods for detecting Compton Thick (CT; $N_{\mathrm{H}} \geq 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) AGN, which are thought to comprise up to $60\%$ of AGN within $z \lesssim 1.0$. These CT AGN are often difficult to detect with current instruments, but the X-ray data within the JWST-North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time Domain Field (TDF) present a unique opportunity to study faint and obscured AGN. The NEP contains the deepest NuSTAR survey to date, and Zhao et al. (2024) detected 60 hard X-ray sources from the combined exposure of NuSTAR's Cycle 5 and 6 observations.

While several candidates have been suggested, definitive confirmation of these events remains elusive. We report the discovery of AT2023uqm, a nuclear transient that has exhibited at least five periodic optical flares, making it only the second confirmed case of periodicity after ASASSN-14ko. Uniquely, the flares from AT2023uqm show a nearly exponential increase in energy–a &quot;runaway&quot; phenomenon signaling the star's progressive destruction. This behavior is consistent with rpTDEs of low-mass, main-sequence stars or evolved giant stars. Multiwavelength observations and spectroscopic analysis of the two most recent flares reinforce its interpretation as an rpTDE. Intriguingly, each flare displays a similar double-peaked structure, potentially originating from a double-peaked mass fallback rate or two discrete collisions per orbit. The extreme ratio of peak separation to orbital period draws attention to the possibility of a giant star being disrupted, which could be distinguished from a low-mass main-sequence star by its future mass-loss evolution. Our analysis demonstrates the power of rpTDEs to probe the properties of disrupted stars and the physical processes of tidal disruption, though it is currently limited by our knowledge of these events.

The low-frequency data, particularly in band 3, is highly sensitive to propagation effects such as dispersion measure (DM) fluctuations, which can be imprints of some astrophysical phenomena (scientific outliers).

The measured &gt;100 MeV $\gamma$-ray emission persisted for over seven hours after the flare impulsive phase, and was characterized by photon energies exceeding 1 GeV and a remarkably-hard parent-proton spectrum. In contrast, the phenomena related to the coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock linked to this eruption were modest, suggesting an inefficient proton acceleration unlikely to achieve the energies well-above the 300 MeV pion-production threshold to account for the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. Specifically, the CME was relatively slow ( 600 km/s) and the accompanying interplanetary type-II/III radio bursts were faint and short-duration, unlike those typically detected during large events. In particular, the type-II emission did not extend to kHz frequencies and disappeared  5.5 hours prior to the LDGRF end time. Furthermore, the associated solar energetic particle (SEP) event was very weak, short-duration, and limited to a few tens of MeV, even at magnetically well-connected spacecraft. These findings demonstrate that a very-fast CME resulting in a high-energy SEP event is not a necessary condition for the occurrence of LDGRFs, challenging the idea that the high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission is produced by the back-precipitation of shock-accelerated ions into the solar surface. The alternative origin scenario based on local particle trapping and acceleration in large-scale coronal loops is instead favored by the observation of giant arch-like structures of hot plasma over the source region persisting for the entire duration of this LDGRF.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating episodic mass loss in evolved massive stars IV.

Initially, the spectral classification of their optical spectra was refined and compared to previous reported classifications, finding four sources that display spectral variability. We derived the physical properties of five of them using the \textsc{marcs} atmospheric models corrected for nonlocal thermal equilibrium effects to measure stellar properties from our new near-infrared spectra, such as the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and microturbulent velocity. Additional empirical and theoretical methods were employed to calculate effective temperatures, finding consistent results. We constructed optical and infrared light curves, discovering two targets in NGC 6822 with photometric variability between 1 and 2.5 mag in amplitude in r and   0.5 mag in the mid-infrared. Furthermore, we discovered a candidate-dimming event in one of these sources. Periods for three red supergiants were determined using epoch photometry, which were consistent with the empirical estimations from literature period-luminosity relations.

Among the gradient-based samplers routinely employed in field-level analyses, we further show that MicroCanonical Langevin Monte Carlo provides orders-of-magnitude improvements in sampling efficiency over currently employed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers, greatly reducing computational expense.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Weighing Halos Accurately, Locally, and Efficiently with Supernovae (WHALES) Survey Overview and Initial Data Release</a><span class="id">[2510.26731]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an overview of the Weighing Halos Accurately, Locally, and Efficiently with Supernovae (WHALES) survey, the first to discover and measure Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in and around galaxy superclusters. By building a sample of SNe Ia around these massive environments, we aim to provide new constraints on bulk-flow models while laying the groundwork for improved estimates of supercluster masses. Here, we present data from the first two seasons targeting the Shapley Supercluster (0.02&lt;z&lt;0.06), which is responsible for a large but unknown fraction of our local group's motion. Until now, no supernovae had been analyzed in the direction of Shapley. Through the WHALES survey, we have identified 12 likely SNe Ia in this region using SkyMapper, including 8 with spectroscopic confirmation. We present the first light curves of these SNe and combine our observations with data from ATLAS. We demonstrate that the low number of discovered SNe Ia per season is consistent with various rate calculations, highlighting the need for future surveys to monitor superclusters over a multi-year timespan. Finally, we present simulations of SN Ia observations in the environments of massive galaxy clusters, demonstrating how the inferred peculiar velocities can constrain cluster masses, and highlighting the added complexity within superclusters. We find that a sample of 100 SNe Ia would enable a 25% precision measurement of the total mass of the Shapley Supercluster.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unbiased Primordial Gravitational Wave Inference from the CMB with SMICA</a><span class="id">[2510.26767]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of primordial gravitational waves in Cosmic Microwave Background B-mode polarization observations requires accurate and robust subtraction of astrophysical contamination.

One standard mechanism for constraining decaying dark matter from 21-cm observations relies on heating of the intergalactic medium by the decay products, an effect whose observability is entangled with the uncertain Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes and X-ray heating from the first stars. In this Letter, we explore a novel mechanism, where the Lyman-$\alpha$ photons produced from dark matter decay initiate early Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the spin temperature to the gas temperature, thereby boosting the 21-cm signal. This mechanism provides constraints on dark matter that are less dependent on uncertainties associated with star formation than constraints on exotic heating. We study this effect for decaying dark matter with masses $m_{\chi}\sim20.4-27.2$ eV, where diphoton decay efficiently produces Lyman-series photons. We present forecasts for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array, showing their potential to probe an unconstrained parameter space for light decaying DM, including axion-like particles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond general relativity: gravitational waves in non-minimally coupled theories</a><span class="id">[2510.25895]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Non-minimal couplings between matter and curvature tensors arise in many different contexts. Such couplings modify solutions of general relativity (GR) and therefore can be probed in various astrophysical systems. A particularly interesting scenario arises if dark matter experiences non-minimal couplings, as dark matter densities are expected to spike in the vicinity of binary black hole mergers. This gives a novel setting for simultaneously studying dark matter and (beyond) GR physics via observations of gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we explore effects of various non-minimal couplings on GWs by working with a model-independent parameterization for left- and right-handed GW strains. We extend the parameterization proposed in \cite{Jenks:2023pmk,Daniel:2024lev} to include early-universe effects, and we write down the generic solution assuming slowly-varying matter fields.

Grounded in accreditation standards such as ABET and NCAAA, the model introduces mathematical tools that map exercises, assessment questions, teaching units (TUs), and student assessment components (SACs) to CLOs and PLOs. This dual-layer approach-combining micro-level analysis of assessment elements with macro-level curriculum evaluation-enables detailed tracking of learning outcomes and helps identify misalignments between instructional delivery, assessment strategies, and program objectives. The framework incorporates alignment matrices, weighted relationships, and practical indicators to quantify coherence and evaluate course or program performance. Application of this model reveals gaps in outcome coverage and underscores the importance of realignment, especially when specific PLOs are underrepresented or CLOs are not adequately supported by assessments. The proposed model is practical, adaptable, and scalable, making it suitable for academic programs. Its systematic structure supports institutions in implementing evidence-based curriculum improvements and provides a reliable mechanism for aligning teaching practices with desired learning outcomes. Ultimately, this framework offers a valuable tool for closing the feedback loop between instructional design, assessment execution, and learning outcomes, thus promoting greater transparency, accountability, and educational effectiveness. Institutions that adopt this model can expect to strengthen their quality assurance processes and help ensure that students graduate with the competencies required by academic standards and professional expectations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond GRMHD: A Robust Numerical Scheme for Extended, Non-Ideal General Relativistic Multifluid Simulations</a><span class="id">[2510.26019]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) have become the standard mathematical framework for modeling high-energy plasmas in curved spacetimes. However, the fragility of the primitive variable reconstruction operation in GRMHD, as well as the difficulties in maintaining strong hyperbolicity of the equations, sharply limit the applicability of the GRMHD model in scenarios involving large Lorentz factors and high magnetizations, such as around neutron stars. Non-ideal effects, such as electron inertia and Hall terms, are also neglected, and the absence of an explicitly evolved electric field precludes the self-consistent modeling of the strong poloidal fields found around spinning black holes, which are known to be crucial for jet formation. Here, we present a general relativistic multifluid model which strictly generalizes the GRMHD equations, consisting of an arbitrary number of relativistic fluid species interacting with a shared electromagnetic field via an explicit coupling of their source terms, thus allowing for the incorporation of non-ideal effects. We sketch how our model may be derived from general relativistic kinetics (via moments of the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation), as well as how GRMHD may be recovered in the single-fluid limit as the mobility of charge carriers goes to infinity. We present a numerical scheme for solving the general relativistic multifluid equations, and validate it against the analogous scheme for the GRMHD equations. Since the primitive variable reconstruction operation for our multifluid model is purely hydrodynamic, and therefore independent of the magnetic field, the resulting solver is highly robust, and able to simulate significantly larger Lorentz factors and higher magnetizations (across both black hole and neutron star spacetimes) than GRMHD without loss of either accuracy or stability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KM3-230213A and IceCube Neutrino Events from Metastable Dark Matter of Primordial Black Hole Origin</a><span class="id">[2510.26126]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a scenario in which the recently observed ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A, with a median energy of approximately 220 PeV, as well as the high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube Observatory, originate from the decay of superheavy dark matter (DM) particles produced through primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation. To establish this connection, we derive constraints on the PBH abundance parameter $\beta$ as a function of the initial PBH mass $M_{\mathrm{BH_0}}$ and DM mass $m_{\mathrm{DM}}$, by considering the bound from the observed relic DM abundance. Using these constraints, we compute the resulting neutrino flux and show that DM masses in the PeV-EeV range can yield neutrinos of comparable energies, capable of accounting for both the KM3-230213A and IceCube events while remaining consistent with the relic abundance constraint. Interestingly, the scenario remains viable over a broad region of parameter space while satisfying existing cosmological and astrophysical bounds. Overall, our results demonstrate that PBH evaporation followed by DM decay provides a consistent and natural explanation for the observed ultra-high-energy neutrino events in the absence of accompanying multimessenger signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the type-II seesaw mechanism with gravitational waves</a><span class="id">[2510.26235]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Traditional seesaw mechanisms provide an elegant theoretical framework for explaining the small yet non-zero masses of neutrinos.

Specifically, we compute the GW spectrum resulting from the decay of the Higgs triplet within the type-II seesaw model. Our results demonstrate that the resulting GW spectrum depends sensitively on the mass of the Higgs triplet and its couplings to the Standard Model Higgs doublet and the left-handed lepton doublet.

By applying the Gouy-Stodola theorem, we establish a consistent thermodynamic formulation for charged black holes, showing that the first law of thermodynamics remains valid in this context.

The first initial condition is an isocurvature mode between photons and neutrinos vorticities, and the second one is a non-trivial initial condition on the neutrino octupole. Both types of conditions sustain a constant vector mode on super Hubble scales at early times. We also consider a third scenario in which the adiabatic vector modes are rapidly sourced, at a given early but finite time, by an exotic component which develops an anisotropic stress. We find the best fitting parameters in these three cases to CMB and BAO data. We compare the resulting $B$-mode spectra of the CMB to data from BICEP/Keck and SPTpol. We find that none of the proposed initial conditions can produce large enough PMFs to seed every type of magnetic fields observed.

Although the interactions with companion stars play important roles on the spin-up process, the global properties of pulsars determined by the equation of state (EoS), such as mass, radius and the moment of inertia, should also play a role. We investigate the spin-up of MSPs in neutron star (NS) and strangeon star (SS) models, both of which have passed the tests by the existence of high-mass pulsars and the tidal deformability of GW 170817. Combining the spin-up condition and the transferred angular momentum, and taking into account the evolution of magnetic field strength during accretion, we can constrain the spin-period and mass of an MSP. Our results show that the impeding effect of magnetic field on the spin-up of MSPs would be more significant for NSs than for SSs, especially for the ones with low masses. In the low-mass ($M$ below or around about $1.2 M_\odot$) case, an SS can spin faster than an NS of the same mass by accreting the same amount of mass. Finding more low-mass and fully recycled MSPs, with accurate mass-measurement and better constraints on the amount of accreted mass, could help to put more strict constraints on the EoS of pulsars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic strings with next-generation detector networks: Component separation based on a multi-source astrophysical foreground noise model</a><span class="id">[2502.12828]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from cosmic strings is crucial for unveiling the evolutionary laws of the early universe and validating non-standard cosmological models.

By constructing a hybrid signal model incorporating multi-source astrophysical foreground noise, including compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and compact binary hyperbolic encounters (CBHEs), we propose an innovative parameter estimation methodology based on multi-component signal separation. Numerical simulations using one-year observational data reveal three key findings: (1) The CE4020ET network, comprising the Einstein Telescope (ET-10 km) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE-40 km and CE-20 km), achieves nearly one order of magnitude improvement in constraining the cosmic string tension $G\mu$ compared to individual detectors, reaching a relative uncertainty $\Delta G\mu / G\mu &lt; 0.5$ for $G\mu &gt; 3.5 \times 10^{-15}$ under standard cosmological framework; (2) The network demonstrates enhanced parameter resolution in non-standard cosmological scenarios, providing a novel approach to probe pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis cosmic evolution; (3) Enhanced detector sensitivity amplifies CBHE foreground interference in parameter estimation, while precise modeling of such signals could further refine $G\mu$ constraints by $1-2$ orders of magnitude. This research not only quantifies the detection potential of third-generation detector networks for cosmic string models but also elucidates the intrinsic connection between foreground modeling precision and cosmological parameter estimation accuracy, offering theoretical foundations for optimizing scientific objectives of next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the cosmic baryon distribution and the impact of AGN feedback with FRBs in CROCODILE simulation</a><span class="id">[2503.12741]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the Missing Baryon problem using Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to trace cosmic baryons.

We find that the coronal brightness is primarily determined by the total energy input from photospheric magnetic activities, such as the small-scale dynamo, rather than differences in dissipative processes within the corona. Using synthesized EUV intensity maps, we show that brightness thresholds commonly used to identify coronal holes may overlook open-field regions, especially at lower spatial resolutions. Observational analysis utilizing SDO/HMI and AIA synoptic maps supports our simulation results, demonstrating that magnetic field extrapolation techniques, such as the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model, are sensitive to the chosen parameters, including the source surface height. We suggest that discrepancies in estimates of open magnetic flux (the “open flux problem”) arise both from the modeling assumptions in coronal magnetic field extrapolation and systematic biases in solar surface magnetic field observations.

Recently, the newly-discovered nuclear transient, quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) show intriguing evidence of a stellar-mass companion captured by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme/intermediate mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI), which is the most promising sources of the space-based GW detectors, such as LISA. Here, we study the secular orbital evolution of QPE systems under different theoretical frameworks based on timing observation,including the stripping scenario and the orbiter-disk scenario, and assess their GW detectability by LISA. Here, we model the secular orbital evolution of known QPE systems using two frameworks: a stripping scenario in which periodic mass transfer at periapsis drives the evolution; and an orbiter-disk collision scenario in which the companion interacts with a misaligned accretion disk, modulated by coupled orbiter-disk precession. For each framework, we assess detectability by LISA, together with the resulting constraints on $H_0$. Our principal findings are: (i) in the stripping scenario, no currently known QPE reaches detectability within a four-year LISA mission. (ii) in the orbiter-disk scenario, two sources-eRO-QPE2 and eRO-QPE4-are detectable with signal-to-noise ratios $\simeq 8.5-28.8$ and constrain $H_0$ with frictional uncertainty of 6.7-14.9\%.

It is thus essential to comprehend the various mechanisms that can excite planetary obliquities, particularly at the primordial stage. Here, we explore planetary obliquity excitation induced by the early evolution of the host star. A young, distended star spins rapidly, resulting in a large gravitational quadrupole moment that induces nodal recession of the planet's orbit. As the star contracts and spins down, the nodal recession frequency decreases and can cross the planet's spin axis precession frequency. An adiabatic encounter results in the planet's capture into a secular spin-orbit resonance and excites the obliquity to large values. We find planets within $a \lesssim 1 \ \mathrm{AU}$ are most affected, but adiabatic capture depends on the initial stellar radius and spin rate. The overall picture is complicated by other sources of perturbation, including the disk, multiple planets, and tidal dissipation. Tides make it such that stellar oblateness-induced obliquity excitation is transient since tidal perturbations cause the resonance to break once high obliquities are reached. However, this early transient excitation is important because it can prime planets for long-term capture in a secular spin-orbit resonance induced by planet-planet interactions. Thus, although stellar oblateness-induced resonances are short-lived, they facilitate the prevalence of long-lived non-zero obliquities in exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Late-time Radio Survey of Type Ia-CSM Supernovae with the Very Large Array</a><span class="id">[2506.19071]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type Ia-CSM supernovae (SNe) are a rare and peculiar subclass of thermonuclear SNe characterized by emission lines of hydrogen or helium, indicative of a high-density circumstellar medium (CSM).

In this paper, we present an independent study of CSM densities around a sample of 29 archival Ia-CSM SNe using radio observations with the Very Large Array at 6 GHz. Motivated by the late ($\sim$2 yr) radio detection of the Ia-CSM SN 2020eyj, we observed old ($&gt;$1 yr) SNe where we are more likely to see the emergent synchrotron emission that may have been suppressed earlier by free-free absorption by the CSM. We do not detect radio emission down to 3$\sigma$ limits of $\sim$35 $\mu$Jy in our sample. The only radio-detected candidate in our sample, SN 2022esa, was likely mis-classified as a Ia-CSM with early spectra, and appears more consistent with a peculiar Ic based on later-epochs. Assuming a wind-like CSM with temperatures between $2 \times 10^4$ K and $10^5$ K, and magnetic field-to-shock energy fraction ($\epsilon_B$) = $0.01-0.1$, the radio upper limits rule out mass-loss rates between $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (100 km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$.

To address this limitation, we employ two distinct interpretable machine learning frameworks-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)-to derive physically insightful models from a FFC simulation dataset. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between predictive accuracy and model simplicity. The KANs demonstrates high fidelity in reconstructing post-conversion neutrino energy spectra, achieving accuracies of up to $90\%$. In contrast, SINDy uncovers a remarkably concise, low-rank set of governing equations, offering maximum interpretability but with lower predictive accuracy. Critically, by analyzing the interpretable model, we identify the number density of heavy-lepton neutrinos as the most dominant factor in the system's evolution. Ultimately, this work provides a methodological framework for interpretable machine learning that supports genuine data-driven physical discovery in astronomy and astrophysics, going beyond prediction alone.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12928" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond monoculture: Polydisperse moment methods for sub-stellar atmosphere cloud microphysics II. A three-moment gamma distribution formulation for GCM applications</a><span class="id">[2507.12928]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Understanding how the shape of cloud particle size distributions affects the atmospheric properties of sub-stellar atmospheres is a key area to explore, particularly in the JWST era of broad wavelength coverage, where observations are sensitive to particle size distributions. It is therefore important to elucidate how underlying cloud microphysical processes influence the size distribution, in order to better understand how clouds affect observed atmospheric properties. Aims. In this follow-up paper, we aim to extend our sub-stellar atmosphere microphysical cloud formation framework from Paper I to include effects of assuming a polydisperse gamma particle size distribution, requiring a three-moment solution set of equations. Methods. We develop a three-moment framework for sub-stellar mineral cloud particle microphysical nucleation, condensation, evaporation and collisional growth assuming a gamma distribution. As in the previous paper, we demonstrate the effects of polydispersity using a simple one-dimensional Y-dwarf KCl cloud formation scenario, and compare the results with the monodisperse case. Results. Our three-moment scheme provides a generalised framework applicable to any size distribution with a defined moment generation expression. In our test case, we show that the gamma distribution evolves with altitude, initially broad at the cloud base and narrowing at lower pressures. We find that differences between the gamma and monodisperse cloud structures can be significant, depending on the surface gravity of the atmosphere. Conclusions. We present a self-consistent framework for including the effects of polydispersity for sub-stellar microphysical cloud studies using the moment method.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Preference for a Positive Neutrino Mass at 2.7$σ$: A Joint Analysis of DESI DR2, DESY5, and DESY1 Data</a><span class="id">[2507.16589]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. {In this work, we obtain a high-confidence measurement of the neutrino mass within a dynamical DE framework. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a measurement for a non-zero, positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This high-confidence measurement is driven mainly by these factors: (i) the DESI's preference for a dynamical DE with its equation of state evolving from $w&lt; -1$ at early times to $w&gt; -1$ at late times, thus leading to a larger neutrino mass; (ii) treating $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as a free parameter together with the inclusion of weak lensing data, which likewise allows for an increased neutrino mass.} In future, even higher-confidence measurements of neutrino mass are expected with stronger preferences for dynamical DE in light of more complete DESI data releases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01428" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2024gy: Multi-epoch Spectroscopic Features Suggestive of Delayed Detonation in a Type Ia Supernova</a><span class="id">[2508.01428]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024gy, a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) exhibiting high-velocity features (HVFs) in its early-time spectra. This SN reaches a peak $B$-band magnitude of $-19.25 \pm 0.29$ mag and subsequently declines by $\Delta m_{15}(B) \approx 1.12$ mag, consistent with the luminosity-width relation characteristic of normal SNe Ia. Based on the peak thermal luminosity of $(1.2 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, we estimate that $0.57 \pm 0.14~\rm M_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized during the explosion. Our dense early spectral monitoring revealed significant velocity disparities within the ejecta. Notably, absorption features from the Ca II near-infrared triplet were observed at velocities exceeding 25,000 km s$^{-1}$, while the Si II $\lambda$6355 line velocity at the same epoch was significantly lower at $\sim$ 16,000 km s$^{-1}$. This velocity disparity likely reflects distinct ionization states of intermediate-mass elements in the outermost layers. The prominent Ca II HVFs may originate from ionization suppression within the highest-velocity ejecta, potentially indicative of minimal hydrogen mixing in a delayed-detonation explosion scenario. Additionally, the Ni/Fe ratio derived from the nebular spectrum of SN 2024gy provides further support for this model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In-Situ Formation of the Cold Classical Kuiper Belt</a><span class="id">[2508.04776]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cold Classical Kuiper belt objects (CCKBOs) are considered first-generation planetesimals that formed 42-47 au from the Sun and remained untouched since. Formation is thought to proceed by clumping of dust particles in protoplanetary disk gas by the streaming instability, followed by gravitational collapse. Previous calculations along these lines are inconsistent with the CCKB's supposedly pristine nature, because they assume orders of magnitude more solid mass than is actually present in the CCKB (a few thousandths of an Earth mass) and do not explain how to expel the &gt;99% extra mass. Here we show from 3D numerical simulations of dust and gas that the total mass in CCKBOs, their characteristic sizes of  100 km, and the relative proportion of prograde to retrograde binaries can all be reproduced at the tail end of the solar nebula's life, when it contained just 2-5% of its original (minimum-mass) gas. As a solar metallicity's worth of mm-sized solids drains out from 42-47 au from nebular headwinds, about 1% of the dust collapses into planetesimals that remain behind in the CCKB region. Binarity is guaranteed from a simple analytic estimate, confirmed numerically, of the spin angular momentum in clumps seeded by the streaming instability. We show that other formation scenarios, including trapping of dust within a gas pressure bump, fail to reproduce the low-mass CCKB. Outstanding problems are identified.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08061" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acceleration of Heavy Ions at Non-Relativistic Collisionless Shocks</a><span class="id">[2509.08061]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the process of Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) of particles with mass number to charge number ratios $A/Q &gt; 1$, e.g., partially-ionized heavy ions. To this end, we introduce helium- and carbon-like ions at solar abundances into two-dimensional hybrid (kinetic ions–fluid electrons) simulations of non-relativistic collisionless shocks. This study yields three main results: 1) Heavy ions are preferentially accelerated compared to hydrogen. For typical solar abundances, the energy transferred to accelerated helium ions is comparable to, or even exceeds, that of hydrogen, thereby enhancing the overall shock acceleration efficiency. 2) Accelerated helium ions contribute to magnetic field amplification, which increases the maximum attainable particle energy and steepen the spectra of accelerated particles. 3) The efficient acceleration of helium significantly enhances the production of hadronic gamma rays and neutrinos, likely dominating the one due to hydrogen. These effects should be taken into account, especially when modeling strong space and astrophysical shocks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding the Origins of Super-Puff Planets: A New Mass-Loss Regime Coupled to Planetary Evolution</a><span class="id">[2510.02201]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Super-puffs are a class of low-mass, large-radius planets that have challenged planet formation and evolution models. Their high inferred H/He mass fractions, required to explain their physical sizes, would lead to rapid atmospheric escape, raising questions about their long-term retention. Recent modeling work indicates that low-mass planets typically require 50\% less H/He mass to match their observed radius, due to significant roles of the radiative atmosphere and interior heating from the rock/iron core. Here, through a new quantitative analysis of XUV-driven escape in sub-Neptunes, we find that previous studies overestimated mass loss, as scaling laws in low-gravity regimes deviate greatly from the widely used energy-limited regime. We define a new regime, thermal-energy-mediated photoevaporation (TEMP), in which thermal energy conversion critically sets the mass-loss rate. These effects make super-puffs more resilient to mass loss than previously thought. We develop a coupled evolution model integrating this updated thermal evolution framework with a 1D hydrodynamic photoevaporation model. Applying this novel, joint model to observed super-puffs and young low-density planets, we find that their masses, radii and transit pressures align with predictions assuming either a clear or hazy atmosphere. This indicates that super-puffs have undergone a combination of boil-off and photoevaporative mass loss, with boil-off dominating the process. Our results indicate that low-density planets typically possess both a thick convective envelope and substantial radiative atmosphere, which contribute to their large radii. For this to occur, these planets must have intermediate masses of 5-10$M_\oplus$ and receive stellar insolation $\lesssim 30F_\oplus$, favoring FG-type stars over M-dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPYGLASS. VII-A. The Demographics and Ages of Small Nearby Young Associations</a><span class="id">[2510.21936]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent Gaia-based young stellar association surveys have revealed dozens of low-mass populations that have, until recently, been too small or sparse to detect. These populations represent a largely unstudied demographic with unknown origins, and their relative isolation may minimize gravitational disruptions that impact traceback, making them compelling targets for dynamical studies. In this paper, we survey 15 of these isolated young associations for the first time: Andromeda South (SCYA-97), Aquila East, Aries South (SCYA-104), Cassiopeia East (SCYA-43), Canis Major North, Leo Central (SCYA-2), Leo East (SCYA-3), Theia 72, Ophiuchus Southeast, Scutum North (SCYA-70), Taurus-Orion 1 (TOR1), Theia 78, Vulpecula East (UPK 88), SCYA-54, and SCYA-79. By combining Gaia astrometry and photometry with new ground-based spectroscopic measurements, we assess the membership of each population, search for substructure, analyze their demographics, and compute ages. We find that the smallest populations in our sample contain $&lt;20$ $M_{\odot}$ of stellar mass, making them the smallest associations ever detected. Four host substantial substructure, including TOR1, where we discover TOR1B, a new 9 $M_{\odot}$ association with radial velocities inconsistent with an origin in the parent complex. Using PARSEC isochrones, we produce self-consistent ages for all populations supported by dynamical and lithium depletion ages, which range from 6.9 $\pm$ 0.5 Myr in TOR1 to 42.8 $\pm$ 2.4 in AndS. Our results provide the first detailed overview of the properties of these populations, characterizing a largely unknown category of young associations that may have an important role in tracing the processes that guide local star formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Physical and Chemical Characteristics of an Extremely Early Class 0 Protostar in G204.4-11.3A2-NE</a><span class="id">[2510.25230]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have observed the low-mass molecular cloud core G204.4-11.3A2-NE (G204NE) in the direction of Orion B giant molecular cloud with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Band 6. The $\rm 1.3\ mm$ continuum images and visibilities unveil a compact central structure with a radius of $\sim$12 au, while showing no signature of binarity down to 18 au. The bolometric temperature and luminosity of this source are derived to be ${\sim}$33 K and $\sim$1.15 $~L_{\odot}$, respectively. Chemical stratification is observed in dense gas tracers, with C$^{18}$O emission peaking at the continuum position surrounded by the spatially extended emission of N$_2$D$^+$ and DCO$^+$. This implies that the core is in a very early evolutionary stage in which $\rm CO$ depletion occurs in most regions except for a small area heated by the central source. The envelope kinematics indicates a rotating and infalling structure with a central protostar mass of 0.08-0.1 $M_{\odot}$. The protostar drives a collimated outflow traced by CO, SiO, SO, and H$_2$CO, with misaligned blueshifted and redshifted lobes exhibiting a pair of bow-like patterns. High-velocity jets, extending up to 720 au, are detected in CO, SiO, and SO lines. The jet launching region is likely within twice of the dust sublimation zone. The absence of a binary signature suggests the outflows and jets are driven by a single protostar, although a close binary cannot be ruled out. The observed deflection of the outflows and jet is likely due to turbulent accretion in a moderately magnetized core.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of accretion disc-corona in the TDE Candidate AT 2019avd</a><span class="id">[2510.25247]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT 2019avd show drastic variabilities in flux and spectral shape over hundreds of days, providing clues on the accretion disc-corona evolution. We utilize a disc-corona model, in which a fraction of the gravitational energy released in the disc is transported into the hot corona above/below. Some soft photons emitted from the disc are upscattered to X-ray photons by the hot electrons in the optically thin corona. By fitting the NICER observations of AT 2019avd during epochs when the spectra exhibit significant hardening, we derive the evolution of the mass accretion rate, $\dot{m}$, and the coronal energy fraction, $f$. Our results show that $f$ decreases with increasing $\dot{m}$, which is qualitatively consistent with that observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), while the slope of this source, $f\propto \dot{m}^{-0.30}$, is much shallower than that of AGNs. We also find that the non-thermal X-ray spectrum in this source is significantly softer than those typically seen in AGNs and black-hole X-ray binaries. We argue that these quantitative differences can be a powerful diagnostic of the underlying magnetic turbulence, which may imply a stronger magnetic field within the TDE accretion disc than that in typical AGNs. It is also found that the evolution of the fitted neutral hydrogen column density follows a similar pattern to that of the accretion rate evolution, which may reflect the accumulation of absorbing material originating from the inflowing streams of stellar debris and/or other related sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25579" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Population of Binary Black Holes Inferred from One Hundred and Fifty Gravitational Wave Signals</a><span class="id">[2510.25579]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations have reported gravitational wave signals from more than 150 binary black holes in the fourth catalog (GWTC-4). Here, we investigate the population properties of these binary black holes using the mixture-model framework Vamana. We present one-dimensional distributions of masses and spins, explore their correlations, and examine their evolution with redshift. These features may reflect astrophysical processes associated with binary black hole formation channels, although most remain poorly constrained. A notable feature is a peak near $10M_\odot$ in the primary mass and $8M_\odot$ in the chirp mass. Additionally, the primary and secondary masses correlate uniquely, producing pronounced peaks in the chirp mass around $14M_\odot$ and $27M_\odot$. The three peaks are roughly separated by a factor of two. A simple explanation for such well-placed peaks is a hierarchical merger scenario, in which the first peak arises from mergers of black holes of stellar origin, and higher-mass peaks arise from repeated mergers of black holes from lower-mass peaks. Although most binaries do not exhibit the high spins and characteristic mass ratios expected from hierarchical mergers, those that do are associated with the peaks observed in the chirp mass distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints to Lorentz violation and ultrahigh-energy electrons in D-foamy space-times</a><span class="id">[2505.06121]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We entertain the constraints that the absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation of ultrahigh-energy electrons inferred from LHAASO observations of the Crab Nebula can impose on generic models in which Lorentz symmetry of the particle vacuum is violated, as established by some recent studies in \href{ this https URL }{\emph{Phys.

Albeit such results are likely effective then, they do not apply in the same form among scenarios. Specifically, we show that these Cherenkov constraints are naturally evaded in models of space-time foam inspired from (supercritical) string theory, involving D-branes as space-time defects in a brane-world scenario, in which subluminous energy-dependent refractive indices of light have been suggested.

While these corrections are negligible for the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newtons law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa type deviations and inverse square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and forthcoming experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. For truly massless hidden states, present data still permit multiplicities as large as 1e61, with modest spin dependence; for finite masses the constraints reduce to the familiar short range Yukawa parameterization. Our results provide a model independent framework for confronting dark sector scenarios with precision gravity data and clarify how non minimal scalar couplings, potential higher derivative poles at large species number, and Kaluza Klein towers fit within this picture. The approach is complementary to cosmological probes: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background constrain relic abundances under specified production histories, whereas laboratory tests constrain the spectrum of light states irrespective of their cosmological population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observable spins in gravitational waves from compact binary mergers</a><span class="id">[2510.17449]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the measurability of effective inspiral spin in the detectable compact binary mergers using gravitational-wave observations.
