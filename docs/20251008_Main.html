Our estimator supports arbitrary binning in redshift and multipoles $\ell$ and includes cross-correlations of redshift bins. It implements a fully optimal analysis with a pixel-wise covariance model. We implement a number of optimizations which make the estimator and associated covariance matrix computationally tractable for a low-$\ell$ analysis, suitable for example for kSZ velocity reconstruction or primordial non-Gaussianity from scale-dependent bias analyses. We validate our estimator extensively on simulations and compare its features and precision with the common pseudo-$C_\ell$ method, showing significant gains at large scales. We make our code publicly available. In a companion paper, we apply the estimator to kSZ velocity reconstruction using data from ACT and DESI Legacy Survey and construct full set of QML estimators on 40 correlated fields up to $N_{\text{side}}= 32$ in timescale of an hour on a single 24-core CPU requiring $&lt;256\ \mathrm{Gb}$ RAM, demonstrating the performance of the code.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital decay candidates reconsidered: WASP-4 b is not decaying and Kepler-1658 b is not a planet</a><span class="id">[2510.05229]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fate of hot Jupiters is thought to be engulfment by their host stars, the outcome of tidal orbital decay. Transit timing has revealed a few systems with apparently shrinking orbital periods, but such signals can be mimicked by light travel-time effects (LTTE) of a distant companion. Combining transit timings with precise radial-velocity data, including new data, we reassessed three reported cases of orbital decay: WASP-4, WASP-12, and Kepler-1658. For WASP-4, the period change is best explained by LTTE due to a 10-Jupiter-mass companion at 4 AU, with no need to invoke orbital decay. For WASP-12, in contrast, the data firmly exclude LTTE and confirm genuine orbital decay. For Kepler-1658, spectroscopic and photometric anomalies reveal the &quot;planet&quot; to be an eclipsing K/M binary bound to the F-type primary, with LTTE explaining the observed period change. Thus, among the known hot Jupiters, only WASP-12 b currently shows compelling evidence for orbital decay.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From X-rays to High-Energy Gamma-rays: A Comprehensive Multi-Wavelength Study of Early Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows</a><span class="id">[2510.05239]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) generate powerful relativistic jets that inject a large amount of energy into their surrounding environment, producing blast waves that accelerate particles to high energies. The GRB afterglow radiation provides a powerful means to investigate the microphysics of relativistic shocks and to probe the medium surrounding the progenitor of the burst. In this study, we present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of 31 GRBs observed between 2008 and 2024 from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (X-ray Telescope and Burst Alert Telescope) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering photon energies from 0.3 keV to 300 GeV. Our goal is to characterize the broadband spectral properties of GRB afterglows in soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and high-energy gamma rays. We investigate correlations between spectral shape and energy output across different parts of the spectrum. The observed emission is modeled using a forward shock scenario that includes both synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation losses. The results favor an SSC-dominated radiation model in a wind-like medium, consistent with expectations for long-duration GRBs. Crucially, this work provides new benchmarks for the microphysical parameters governing the emission, particularly indicating a notably low magnetic energy fraction, which refines previous estimates. By modeling broadband data, this study offers one of the most detailed SSC analyses in a wind-like environment to date. Notably, our results naturally account for the comparable energy output observed in both the soft X-ray and TeV bands, consistent with the previously detected TeV-GRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The First Dedicated Survey of Atmospheric Escape from Planets Orbiting F Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.05240]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hydrodynamic escape can strip the envelopes of close-in exoplanets, but most observations of atmospheric mass loss to date have been confined to planets orbiting K and M dwarfs. A growing body of detections of atmospheric escape from planets orbiting early-type stars indicates that they may have significantly stronger and more extended outflows than planets orbiting cooler stars. However, it is unclear whether this limited sample of planets is representative of all gas giants orbiting early-type stars. Motivated by this question, we initiated the first dedicated survey of atmospheric escape from gas giants orbiting F stars in order to understand how their distinct radiation environments shape planetary outflows. We observed ten transits of six planets in an ultra-narrowband filter centered on the metastable helium line using Palomar/WIRC. We report strong ($&gt;3\sigma$) detections of atmospheric escape for WASP-12 b and WASP-180 A b, tentative ($&gt;2\sigma$) detections for WASP-93 b and HAT-P-8 b, and non-detections for WASP-103 b and KELT-7 b. We fit these measurements with a 1D Parker wind model to derive corresponding mass-loss rates, and combine our results with literature measurements to obtain an updated picture of mass loss from planets orbiting early-type stars. Our results indicate that the observed variation in mass-loss rates can be explained by a combination of Roche filling factor and XUV luminosity, and disfavors NUV-driven escape models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Water solubility in silicate melts: The effects of melt composition under reducing conditions and implications for nebular ingassing on rocky planets</a><span class="id">[2510.05281]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rocky planet atmospheres form and evolve through interactions between the planet's surface and interior. If a growing rocky planet acquires enough mass prior to the dissipation of the nebular gas disk, it can gravitationally capture a `primary' atmosphere dominated by H2. At the same time, these young, rocky bodies are likely to have partial or global magma oceans as a result of the heat from accretion, core formation and radioactive decay of short-lived major element isotopes. During this magma ocean stage, the dissolution of volatile, life-essential elements, such as hydrogen in the form of water or H2, into the magma is critical in determining the extent to which a rocky planet can maintain these elements over time. However, our ability to quantify the amount of hydrogen dissolved in the magma oceans of rocky planets is limited by the lack of experimental constraints on H-bearing species' solubilities at relevant pressure and temperature conditions, including those expected for the early Earth. Here we experimentally determine the solubility of water in silicate melts of various compositions in the Ca-Mg-Al-Si-Fe-O system at a total pressure of 1 bar and temperatures from 1673-1823 K, synthesized in a H2-CO2 gas-mixing furnace. We use Bayesian parameter estimation to derive a robust water solubility law that includes the effects of melt composition and temperature. Using this solubility law, we estimate that  100 ppm of hydrogen can dissolve into a 1 MEarth planet with a surface pressure of  300 bars set by accretion of solar-like nebular gas. For rocky planets in general, ingassing of a primary atmosphere may be an important source and initial storage mechanism for hydrogen-bearing species in a planet's interior, provided it grew to a sufficient mass within the lifetime of the solar nebula.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First X-ray and radio polarimetry of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 17+2</a><span class="id">[2510.05284]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the first polarimetric results of the neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) Z-source GX 17+2 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and the Very Large Array (VLA). We find that the X-ray source was polarized at PD = 1.9 +/- 0.3 % (1-sigma errors) with a polarization angle of PA = 11 +/- 4 degree (1-sigma errors). Simultaneous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations show that the source was in the normal branch (NB) during our IXPE observations. The X-ray spectro-polarimetry results suggest a source geometry comprising an accretion disk component, a Comptonization component, and a reflection component. The VLA radio polarization study shows a PD = 2.2 +/- 0.2 % with a Faraday-corrected intrinsic polarization angle of 1 +/- 5 degree, which is an indication of the jet axis. Thus, we find the estimated X-ray PA from the source is consistent with the radio PA. We discuss the accretion geometry of the Z-source in light of our X-ray spectro-polarimetry and radio findings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05297" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamma-ray Bursts</a><span class="id">[2510.05297]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts are flashes of high-energy radiation lasting from a fraction of a second to several hours. Military satellites made the first detections of GRBs in the late 1960s. The $\gamma$-ray emission forms from shocks in a relativistic jet launched from a compact central engine. In addition to the emission of $\gamma$-rays, the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium yields afterglow emission that can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum. Redshift measurements from these afterglows place GRBs from the local to the distant Universe. The central engines of GRBs are thought to be either a hyperaccreting black hole or a highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar). There is now strong observational evidence that this central engine is created either in the core collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star or via the merger of two compact objects (neutron stars or a neutron star with a black hole). The combination of stellar scale events with extreme energies and luminosities makes GRBs powerful probes of the extreme physics involved in their production and of other areas of astrophysics and cosmology. These include as the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources, the production and acceleration of relativistic jets, the synthesis of heavy elements, the study of the interstellar and intergalactic medium, and the identification of the collapse of early generations of stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05302" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scalarized Hot Neutron Stars Containing Hyperons and $Δ$-Resonances in Different Evolution Regimes</a><span class="id">[2510.05302]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scalar-tensor gravity models are among the prime candidates to explain cosmic acceleration, and compact stars provide unique laboratories for testing such theories. Predictions of scalar-tensor gravity in compact stars can be examined during the evolution of neutron stars. Spontaneous scalarization in relativistic stars is influenced by different properties of stellar matter in various evolution regimes. In the present study, we investigate the scalarization of neutron stars in different stages of the evolvement. For this aim, we apply the isentropic equations of state for the neutron star matter including nucleons, hyperons, and $\Delta$- resonances in neutrino-trapped, neutrino diffusion, and neutrino-transparent stages as well as cold-catalyzed neutron star. Our equations of state are based on the relativistic model within the mean-field approximation. To emphasize the role of scalar-tensor theories in exploring the properties and structure of compact stars, we calculate the structure of neutron stars with hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances in different snapshots of the neutron star evolution in the scalar-tensor gravity. Our calculations confirm that the neutron star scalarization is affected by the hyperons as well as the $\Delta$-resonances. Moreover, the properties of scalarized neutron stars depend on the stage of the star evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the statistical characterization of the synchrotron multi-zone polarization of blazars</a><span class="id">[2510.05324]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Multiwavelength polarimetric observations of blazars reveal complex, energy-dependent polarization behavior, including a decrease in polarization fraction from X-rays to millimeter bands and significant variability in the electric vector position angle (EVPA). These trends challenge simple single-zone synchrotron models and suggest a more intricate, turbulent jet structure with multiple emission zones. We develop a statistical framework to model the observed energy-dependent polarization patterns in blazars, focusing on the behavior captured by IXPE in the X-ray band and RoboPol in the optical. The goal is to statistically characterize multi-zone models in terms of the distributions of cell size and the physical parameters of the electron energy distribution (EED). A Monte Carlo approach, implemented with the JetSeT code, is used to generate synthetic multi-zone synchrotron emission from a spherical region filled with turbulent cells with randomly distributed physical properties. Simulations explore scenarios ranging from identical cells to power-law distributions of cell sizes and EED parameters with variable cutoff and low-energy slopes. The results show that a purely turbulent, multi-zone model can reproduce the observed energy-dependent polarization without requiring correlations between cell size and EED parameters. The polarization degree is primarily determined by the effective, flux-weighted, number of emitting cells, modulated by the dispersion in cell properties, particularly the EED cutoff energy at high frequencies and the low-energy spectral index at low frequencies. With a fractional dispersion in cutoff energy of about 90% and a low-energy spectral index dispersion of  0.5-1.5, the model reproduces the chromatic mm-to-X-ray polarization trends seen by IXPE and the optical polarization limiting envelope observed in the RoboPol dataset.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05334" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observation and modeling of a geo-effective event observed on 2011 May 28 from the solar surface to 1au</a><span class="id">[2510.05334]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we present a comprehensive observational and modeling study of a geo-effective event with D_ST index of -80 nT observed on 2011 May 28 when a coronal hole was bordering an active region. We analyze HMI and EUV images and found that this event involved two filament eruptions  8 hours apart from two different active region closed to each other. We produce 3D magnetic field configurations for the active regions that are consistent with the observations and employ numerical models to track the CME/ICME propagation up to 1 au. From our, magnetic models we found that the nearby coronal hole reduced the stability threshold of the flux ropes, with axial flux values approximately three times lower than in comparable cases without coronal holes. A derivative analysis applied to STEREO coronagraph and OMNI database in situ data revealed no evidence of CME-CME interaction during the early stages of their evolution and identified distinct signatures of two CMEs, along with the interacting flow associated with the nearby coronal hole at 1 au. Moreover, we used hydrodynamic simulations constrained by remote sensing and in situ data to track the different structures in the solar wind. We found a good agreement between data and the models. Additionally, we found that the presence of the coronal hole may have suppressed interactions between CMEs, with the transients subsequently propagating along the solar wind streams emerging from the coronal hole.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05340" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large-scale peculiar velocities in the universe</a><span class="id">[2510.05340]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations have repeatedly confirmed the presence of large-scale peculiar motions in the universe, commonly referred to as “bulk flows”. These are vast regions of the observable universe, typically spanning scales of several hundred Mpc, that move coherently with speeds of the order of several hundred km/sec. While there is a general consensus on the direction of these motions, discrepancies persist in their reported sizes and velocities, with some of them exceeding the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The observed large-scale peculiar-velocity fields are believed to have originated as weak peculiar-velocity perturbations soon after equipartition, which have subsequently grown by structure formation and by the increasing inhomogeneity of the post-recombination universe. However, the evolution and the implications of these bulk velocity fields remain poorly understood and they are still a matter of debate. For instance, it remains a challenge for the theoreticians to explain the high velocities measured by several bulk-flow surveys, like those recently reported using the CosmicFlows-4 data. Such extensive and fast velocity fields could have played a non-negligible role during structure formation and they might have also “contaminated” our observations. After all, in the history of astronomy, there are examples where relative-motion effects have led us to a serious misinterpretation of reality (shortened abstract due to length limits).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2021tsz: A luminous, short photospheric phase Type II supernova in a low-metallicity host</a><span class="id">[2510.05426]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the analysis of the luminous Type II Supernova (SN) 2021tsz, which exploded in a low-luminosity galaxy. It reached a peak magnitude of -18.88 $\pm$ 0.13 mag in the $r$ band and exhibited an initial rapid decline of 4.05 $\pm$ 0.14 mag (100 d)$^{-1}$ from peak luminosity till $\sim$30 d. The photospheric phase is short, with the SN displaying bluer colours and a weak H$\alpha$ absorption component–features consistent with other luminous, short-photospheric phase Type II SNe. A distinct transition from the photospheric to the radioactive tail phase in the $V$ band–as is common in hydrogen-rich Type II SNe–is not visible in SN 2021tsz, although a modest $\sim$1 mag drop is apparent in the redder filters. Hydrodynamic modelling suggests the luminosity is powered by ejecta-circumstellar material (CSM) interaction during the early phases (&lt;30 days). Interaction with 0.6 M$_\odot$ of dense CSM extending to 3100 R$_\odot$ reproduces the observed luminosity, with an explosion energy of 1.3$\times$10$^{51}$ erg. The modelling indicates a pre-SN mass of 9 M$_\odot$, which includes a hydrogen envelope of 4 M$_\odot$, and a radius of $\sim$1000 R$_\odot$. Spectral energy distribution analysis and strong-line diagnostics reveal that the host galaxy of SN 2021tsz is a low-metallicity, dwarf galaxy. The low-metallicity environment and the derived high mass loss from the hydrodynamical modelling strongly support a binary progenitor system for SN 2021tsz.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buildup, Explosion, and Untwisting of a Solar Active Region Jet Observed with Solar Orbiter, IRIS, and SDO</a><span class="id">[2510.05439]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present detailed analysis of an active region coronal jet accompanying a minifilament eruption that is fully captured and well-resolved in high spatial resolution 174A coronal images from Solar Orbiters Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). The active region jet is simultaneously observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). An erupting minifilament is rooted at the edge of an active region where mixed-polarity magnetic flux is present. Minority-polarity positive flux merges and cancels with the active regions dominant negative flux at an average rate of 1019 Mx/hr, building a minifilament-holding flux rope and triggering its eruption. The eruption shows a slow rise followed by a fast rise, akin to large-scale filament eruptions. EUI images and Mg II k spectra, displaying simultaneously blueshifts and redshifts at the opposite edges of the spire, indicate counterclockwise untwisting of the jet spire. This jet is the clearest, most comprehensively observed active-region jet with this instrument set, displaying striking similarities with quiet Sun and coronal hole jets. Its magnetic, thermal, and kinetic energies suggest a significant contribution to local coronal heating. We conclude that magnetic flux cancelation builds a minifilament-carrying twisted flux rope and also eventually triggers the flux ropes eruption that makes the coronal jet, in line with our recent results on the buildup and explosion of solar coronal jets in quiet Sun and coronal holes. That is, this active region jet clearly works the same way as the vast majority of quiet Sun and coronal hole jets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Everyone wants something better than $Λ$CDM</a><span class="id">[2510.05483]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The current cosmological paradigm, $\Lambda$CDM, is characterized its expansive description of the history of the Universe, its deep connections to particle physics and the large amounts of data that support it.

The only free parameter in the PFSS method is the source-surface height ($R_{\rm SS}$), beyond which all field lines are open. Although $R_{\rm SS}$ is known to vary with solar activity, there is no consensus on how to determine it for a given surface magnetic field distribution. In this study, we investigate the nature of $R_{\rm SS}$ using a long-period (2006-2023) data, covering two solar minima and one maximum. We adopt ADAPT-GONG magnetograms and determine $R_{\rm SS}$ by matching the open flux estimated from observations at 1 au with that calculated using the PFSS method. Our analysis reveals that $R_{\rm SS}$ increases slightly after the solar minima and around the solar maximum, and that it can be characterized by both the mean unsigned photospheric magnetic field strength and the dipolarity parameter $f_{\rm dip}$, defined as $f_{\rm dip} = B_{\rm dip}^2/(B_{\rm dip}^2 + B_{\rm quad}^2 + B_{\rm oct}^2)$, with $B_{\rm dip}$, $B_{\rm quad}$, and $B_{\rm oct}$ denoting the magnitudes of dipolar, quadrupolar, and octupolar components of photospheric radial magnetic field, respectively. Our results suggest that $R_{\rm SS}$ does not exhibit a simple monotonic dependence on the solar activity and must be determined by properly considering both surface magnetic field strength and global field structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Gamma-ray Luminosity Function of Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars</a><span class="id">[2510.05515]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have utilized the largest sample of $\gamma$-ray selected Fermi flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) ever used (519 sources) to construct the luminosity function and its evolution through the cosmic history. In addition to spanning large redshift ($0&lt;z\lesssim 4$) and luminosity ranges ($2.9\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ - $7.3\times10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$), this sample also has a robust calculation of the detection efficiency associated with its observation, making its selection effects and biases well understood. We confirm that the local luminosity function is best explained by a double power law. The evolution of the luminosity function of FSRQs follows a luminosity-dependent density evolution. FSRQs experience positive evolution with their space density growing with increasing redshift up to a maximum redshift, after which the numbers decrease. This peak in redshift occurs at larger redshifts for higher luminosity sources and at lower redshifts for lower luminosity sources. We find an unexpected similarity between the luminosity function of FSRQs and that of BL Lacertae objects at intermediate luminosity. This could be a sign of a strong genetic link between the two blazar sub-classes or that BL Lac samples are contaminated by large amounts of FSRQs with their jets nearly perfectly aligned with our line of sight.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05539" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Validation of the DESI-DR1 3x2-pt analysis: scale cut and shear ratio tests</a><span class="id">[2510.05539]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Combined survey analyses of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing (3x2-pt studies) will allow new and accurate tests of the standard cosmological model. However, careful validation is necessary to ensure that these cosmological constraints are not biased by uncertainties associated with the modelling of astrophysical or systematic effects. In this study we validate the combined 3x2-pt analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1) spectroscopic galaxy clustering and overlapping weak lensing datasets from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC). By propagating the modelling uncertainties associated with the non-linear matter power spectrum, non-linear galaxy bias and baryon feedback, we design scale cuts to ensure that measurements of the matter density and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum are biased by less than 30% of the statistical error. We also test the internal consistency of the data and weak lensing systematics by performing new measurements of the lensing shear ratio. We demonstrate that the DESI-DR1 shear ratios can be successfully fit by the same model used to describe cosmic shear correlations, and analyse the additional information that can be extracted about the source redshift distributions and intrinsic alignment parameters.

SNe Ia analyses typically fit to the functional form $D_{\rm L}(z)$ derived theoretically from the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Yet, the metric in the epoch relevant to SNe Ia measurements deviates slightly from FLRW due to gravitational clumping of mass into large-scale structures like filaments and voids, whose sizes span many orders of magnitude. The small deviation is modeled typically by scalar perturbations to the FLRW metric. Each line of sight to a SNe Ia passes through a random sequence of structures, so $D_{\rm L}$ differs stochastically from one line of sight to the next. Here, we calculate the $D_{\rm L}$ dispersion in an exact Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Swiss-cheese universe with a power-law hole size distribution, as a function of the lower cut-off $R_{\rm min}$ and logarithmic slope $\gamma$. We find that the standard deviation of $D_{\rm L}$ scales as $\sigma_{D_{\rm L}} \propto z^{2.25\pm0.01} (R_{\rm min}/24\pm1\,{\rm Mpc})^{(0.157\pm0.003)\left[\gamma - (1.16\pm0.02)\right]}$ for redshifts in the range $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.1$. The scaling shows that the $D_{\rm L}$ dispersion is dominated by a few large voids rather than the many small voids.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaussian process analysis of type-B quasiperiodic oscillations in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630</a><span class="id">[2510.05587]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyzed Insight-HXMT data of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630 during the type-B QPO phase of its 2019 outburst. Using the Gaussian process method, we applied an additive composite kernel model consisting of an SHO, a DRW, and an additional white noise (AWN) to data from three energy bands: LE (1-10 keV), ME (10-30 keV), and HE (30-150 keV). We find that for the DRW component, correlations on the timescale of $\tau_{\rm DRW}\sim10$ s are absent in the LE band, while they persist in the ME and HE bands over the full duration of the light curves. This energy-dependent behavior may reflect thermal instabilities, with the shorter correlation timescale in the disk compared to the corona. Alternatively, it may reflect variable Comptonizations of seed photons from different disk regions. Inner-disk photons are scattered by a small inner corona, producing soft X-rays. Outer-disk photons interact with an extended, jet-like corona, resulting in harder emission. The QPO is captured by an SHO component with a stable period of $\sim 0.2$ s and a high quality factor of $\sim 10$. The absence of significant evolution with energy or time of the SHO component suggests a connection between the accretion disk and the corona, which may be built by coherent oscillations of disk-corona driven by magnetorotational instability. The AWN components are present in all the three-band data and dominate over the DRW and SHO components. We interpret the AWN as another fast DRW with its $\tau_{\rm DRW} &lt; 0.01$ s. It may trace high-frequency fluctuations that occur in both the inner region of the accretion disk and the corona. Overall, our work reveals a timescale hierarchy in the coupled disk-corona scenario: fast DRW &lt; SHO &lt; disk DRW &lt; corona DRW.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05599" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of Changing-Look behavior in AGN NGC 3822: A long-term multiwavelength study</a><span class="id">[2510.05599]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive long-term multi-wavelength study of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 3822, based on 17 years (2008 to 2025) of X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), and optical this http URL dataset includes observations from Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, the Very Large Telescope, and the Himalayan Chandra Telescope. Our multiwavelength light curve analysis reveals flux variations across X-ray to optical/UV bands, with an increased variability amplitude at shorter wavelengths. X-ray spectral analysis indicates the presence of intrinsic absorption during the 2016 and 2022 observations; however, this absorption disappeared before and after these epochs. The presence and absence of the absorber are attributed to clouds moving in and out of the line of sight. During the long-term monitoring period, the bolometric luminosity of the source varies between ($1.32-17)\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Optical spectroscopic monitoring reveals changing-look (CL) behaviour in NGC 3822, characterized by the appearance and disappearance of broad emission lines (BELs). These CL transitions are associated with changes in the Eddington ratio rather than changes in the obscuration. The BELs appear only when the Eddington ratio is relatively high ($\sim 3.8\times10^{-3}$) and disappear when it drops to a lower value ($\sim 0.9\times10^{-3}$).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infall Explains the Disk Kinematics of AB Aur Without Gravitational Instability</a><span class="id">[2510.05601]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Late-stage infall onto protoplanetary disks can produce large scale spiral arms. In this paper we used 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations to study the kinematic perturbations induced in disks by infalling material. We found that deviations from Keplerian rotation are predominantly in the radial and vertical velocity components, spatially correlated with spiral arms in the gas surface density. The infall produces observable wiggles in the channel maps, analogous to those produce by the gravitational instability (GI), along with large-scale arcs and filaments. GI induced spiral arms produce radial velocity perturbations that point towards the center of the spiral arm owing to their higher self-gravity. We found a similar signature from infall-induced spiral arms, despite not including self-gravity in our simulation. Our study suggests that recent evidence of GI in the kinematics of the disk around AB Aur may instead be due to the observed infall, without the need for invoking GI.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estimation of intrinsic fast radio burst width and scattering distributions from CRAFT data</a><span class="id">[2510.05654]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The intrinsic width and scattering distributions of fast radio bursts (FRBs) inform on their emission mechanism and local environment, and act as a source of detection bias and, hence, an obfuscating factor when performing FRB population and cosmological studies. Here, we utilise a sample of 29 FRBs with measured high-time-resolution properties and known redshift, which were detected using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients Survey (CRAFT), to model these distributions. Using this sample, we estimate the completeness bias of intrinsic width and scattering measurements, and fit the underlying, de-biased distributions in the host rest-frame. We find no evidence for a down-turn towards high values of the intrinsic distributions of either parameter in the 0.01-40 ms range probed by the data. Rather, the intrinsic scattering distribution at 1 GHz is consistent with a log-uniform distribution above 0.04 ms, while the intrinsic width distribution rises as a Gaussian in log-space in the 0.03-0.3 ms range, and is then log-uniform above that. This is inconsistent with previous works, which assumed that these parameters have lognormal distributions. This confirms that FRB observations are currently strongly width- and scattering-limited, and we encourage FRB searches to be extended to higher values of time-width. It also implies a bias in FRB host galaxy studies, although the form of that bias is uncertain. Finally, we find that our updated width and scattering model - when implemented in the zDM code - produces 10% more FRBs at redshift $z=1$ than at $z=0$ when compared to alternative width/scattering models, highlighting that these factors are important to understand when performing FRB population modelling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the Most Extreme Blazars: New Insights from MAGIC</a><span class="id">[2510.05727]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extremely high-peaked BL Lac objects (or extreme blazars) are unique extragalactic laboratories where particle acceleration processes are pushed at their physical limits. In these blazars, synchrotron emission peaking above keV energies is reprocessed to very-high-energy (VHE, energies &gt; 100 GeV) gamma rays, often resulting in very hard TeV spectra. Over the past two decades, they have attracted a growing interest from the scientific community, both experimentally and theoretically, as crucial targets for understanding the diversity within the blazar class. On the experimental side, new sources have been detected and characterized, populating the extreme blazars class. Notably, VHE campaigns have revealed evidence of emerging spectral differences in this energy band, suggesting inhomogeneity within this class of sources. Recent studies have also unveiled intriguing differences in the temporal evolution of their spectral emission. On the theoretical side, these spectral differences are challenging the current standard emission and acceleration models for blazars, suggesting the need for more complex theoretical frameworks. In this contribution, we present the latest results from recent MAGIC Collaboration observing campaigns aimed to enlarge the extreme blazars population at VHE and understand the origin of their extreme properties. Furthermore, we will present the results of the most recent observations, discussing analogies and differences with well-known sources such as the archetypal 1ES 0229+200, as well as interpretations of their non-conventional spectral emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05736" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Convolution and Graph-based Deep Learning Approaches for Gamma/Hadron Separation in Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes</a><span class="id">[2510.05736]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The identification of $\gamma$-rays from the predominant hadronic-background is a key aspect in their ground-based detection using Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs).

However, several challenges involving the robustness and applicability of such models remain. Designing model architectures with inductive biases relevant for the task can help mitigate the problem. Three such deep learning-based models are proposed, trained, and evaluated on simulated data: (1) a hybrid convolutional and graph neural network model (CNN-GNN) using both image and graph data; (2) an enhanced CNN-GNN variant that incorporates additional reconstructed information within the graph construction; and (3) a graph neural network (GNN) model using image moments serving as a baseline.

In this work, we revisit the quantum-corrected Higgs inflation scenario within the framework of a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory. Starting from the one-loop effective action, we incorporate radiative corrections through the anomalous scaling parameter ${\bf A_I}$ and derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$ in the Einstein frame. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum corrections naturally shift $n_s$ toward higher values while keeping the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ suppressed. For ${\cal N} = 60$, the model predicts $n_s \simeq 0.9743$ and $r \simeq 5.4\times10^{-3}$, in excellent agreement with the latest ACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) data and fully consistent with the \textit{Planck} 2018 limit $r &lt; 0.036$. The derived constraint $4.36\times10^{-10} &lt; \lambda/\xi^{2} &lt; 10.77\times10^{-10}$ confirms the robustness of the quantum-corrected Higgs framework and indicates that near-future CMB polarization experiments such as CORE, AliCPT, LiteBIRD, and CMB-S4 will be able to probe the predicted parameter space with high precision.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio emission from beyond the light cylinder in millisecond pulsars</a><span class="id">[2510.05778]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A striking aspect of the radio profiles of many millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is that they consist of components separated from each other by regions lacking in emission. We devise a technique for determining &quot;disjoint&quot; from &quot;contiguous&quot; components and show that 35% of MSPs have disjoint components as opposed to only 3% of the slow pulsar population. We surmise that the pulsars with these disjoint components show evidence for both emission above the polar cap and from the current sheet beyond the light cylinder, co-located with gamma-ray emission. For a sub-class of radio MSPs only the light cylinder emission is being observed. It is our contention that almost all of the current population of gamma-ray MSPs show evidence for co-located radio emission. A simple geometric explanation allows the presence (or not) of light cylinder emission and the relationship (or not) between the gamma-ray and radio profiles to be determined. The light-cylinder components have frequently very high polarization and typically flat position-angle traverses thus helping to explain the difficulties in determining the geometry of MSPs. In cases where the geometry can be determined the values broadly align with expectations. If our picture is correct, the beaming fraction of radio MSPs is higher than previously thought and a mechanism is required to produce coherent radio emission far from the stellar surface. This has implications for our understanding of the populations of radio-loud and radio-quiet rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, and could relate to the timing stability of some of these sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accessing the fine temporal scale of EUV brightenings and their quasi-periodic pulsations: 1 second cadence observations by Solar Orbiter/EUI</a><span class="id">[2510.05810]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Small scale extreme ultraviolet (EUV) transient brightenings are observationally abundant and critically important to investigate. Determining whether they share the same physical mechanisms as larger scale flares would have significant implications for the coronal heating problem. A recent study has revealed that quasi periodic pulsations (QPPs), a common feature in both solar and stellar flares, may also be present in EUV brightenings in the quiet Sun (QS). We aim to characterise the properties of EUV brightenings and their associated QPPs in both QS and active regions (ARs) using unprecedented 1 s cadence observations from Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). We applied an automated detection algorithm to analyse statistical properties of EUV brightenings. QPPs were identified using complementary techniques optimised for both stationary and non stationary signals, including a Fourier based method, ensemble empirical mode decomposition, and wavelet analysis. Over 500000 and 300000 brightenings were detected in ARs and QS regions, respectively. Brightenings with lifetimes shorter than 3 s were detected, demonstrating the importance of high temporal resolution. QPP periods span from 5 to over 500 s and show similar distributions between AR and QS. We found a consistent power law scaling, with a weak correlation and a large spread, between QPP period and lifetime in EUV brightenings, solar, and stellar flares. The results support the interpretation that EUV brightenings may represent a small scale manifestation of the same physical mechanisms driving larger solar and stellar flares. Furthermore, the similarity in the statistical properties of EUV brightenings and their associated QPPs between AR and QS regions suggests that the underlying generation mechanisms may not strongly depend on the large scale magnetic environment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An interferometric mid-infrared study of the eruptive star binary Z CMa with MATISSE/VLTI.

The observations were obtained during a serendipitous large outburst of the HBe star that lasted more than 100 days, while the FUor companion is presumed to be in quiescence. The size of the MIR-emitting disk region of the more massive HBe star increases toward longer wavelengths from $&lt;14$ mas at 3.5$\mu m$ to $\ll 50$ mas at 11.5$\mu m$ . The lack of substructures in the HBe disk might suggest that it is a continuous disk; however, this could be due to observational constraints. We also note a radial variation of the silicate absorption feature over the disk, where the optical depth increases inwards of $&lt;$40 au radii. This contradicts the scenario of a carved, dusty cocoon surrounding the HBe star. In the case of the less massive FUor companion, the MIR-emitting region is much smaller with an angular size $\leq$15 mas (or else a physical radius $&lt;9$ au) in all bands, suggesting a compact disk. Both disks are aligned within uncertainties, and their orientation agrees with that of the known jets. Furthermore, MATISSE data place the binary's separation at $117.88 \pm 0.73$ mas and a position angle of $139.16^o\,\pm\,0.29^o$ east of north. Our estimates for the orbital elements gave an eccentric orbit ($e\sim0.17$) with a moderate inclination ($i\sim 66$\degr). The derived total mass is $M_{\rm total} = 16.4^{+2.1}_{-2.3}$ M$_\odot$, while the period is approximately 950 years. Our MATISSE imaging of the Herbig disk during outburst indicates a temperature gradient for the disk, while imaging of the FUor companion's disk corroborates previous studies showing that FUor disks are rather compact in the MIR. We cannot infer any misalignment between the MATISSE results and earlier ALMA/JVLA data, nor can we infer any influence from the alleged flyby event.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physical Characterization of Asteroid (16583) Oersted Combining Stellar Occultation and Photometric Data</a><span class="id">[2510.05843]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report a successful observation of a stellar occultation by asteroid (16583) Oersted, enabling a detailed physical characterization of its shape, spin state, and surface properties. Our goal is to determine the physical parameters of Oersted by combining multi-chord occultation timing, sparse optical photometry, and thermal infrared observations. Such asteroids (size$\sim$20 km) are rarely modeled in this detail due to observational limitations, making Oersted a valuable case study. We applied convex lightcurve inversion to sparse photometric data to derive an initial shape and spin state. This model was then refined and scaled using non-convex shape modeling with the ADAM algorithm, incorporating constraints from the occultation chord profile. Thermophysical modeling based on WISE thermal infrared fluxes was used to determine the asteroid's effective diameter, geometric albedo, and thermal inertia. The non-convex shape model reveals localized surface concavities and provides a size estimate consistent with radiometric measurements. The derived thermal inertia is typical for asteroids of comparable size. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining stellar occultations, photometry, and thermal infrared data for asteroid modeling and highlights the valuable contributions of citizen scientists, who played a key role in capturing the occultation and constraining the asteroid's profile.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An in-depth study of brown dwarfs with TESS</a><span class="id">[2510.05852]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The existence of a deficit of brown dwarfs (BDs) in close orbit around main-sequence stars is one of the most intriguing questions in stellar physics.

We explore this using entropy-complexity and information planes, where the measure for entropy is formed using either permutation entropy or the degree distribution of a horizontal visibility graph (HVG). The entropy is then compared to the Jensen complexity (Jensen-Shannon complexity plane) and Fisher information measure (Fisher-Shannon information plane), formed both from permutations and the HVG approach. Additionally we characterise the solar wind time series by studying the properties of the HVG degree distribution. Four types of solar wind intervals have been analysed, namely fast streams, slow streams, magnetic clouds and sheath regions, all of which have distinct origins and interplanetary characteristics. Our results show that, overall, different metrics give similar results but Fisher-Shannon, which gives a more local measure of complexity, leads to a larger spread of values in the entropy-complexity plane. Magnetic cloud intervals stood out in all approaches, in particular when analysing the magnetic field magnitude. Differences between solar wind types (except for magnetic clouds) were typically more distinct for larger time lags, suggesting universality in fluctuations for small scales. The fluctuations within the solar wind time series were generally found to be stochastic, in agreement with previous studies. The use of information theory tools in the analysis of solar wind time series can help to identify structures and provide insight into their origin and formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three-dimensional Reconstruction and Propagation of an Asymmetric Flux-rope Coronal Mass Ejection</a><span class="id">[2510.05916]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on the characterization of a coronal mass ejection (CME) observed on 22 October 2003 by the LASCO-C2 and C3 coronagraphs over a time interval of 6 hours. This CME clearly appears as an asymmetric flux-rope in self-similar expansion and in spite of having a single vantage point, this relatively simple morphology and the geometry of the observations allow us to reconstruct its shape and its trajectory. The images are first processed in order to remove most of the background or foreground coronal structures (essentially streamers) which are superimposed on the CME. The analysis is based on forward modeling of an asymmetric structure where the plasma is homogeneously distributed in a thin shell and synthetic images are calculated from Thomson scattering by the electrons. They are best fitted to the images to determine the exact shape of the flux rope, and to track its evolution characterized by a radial propagation in self-similar expansion. The analysis supports the forward propagation (over the backward one) characterized by constant accelerations of 76 and 46 m/sec^2 for the front and rear parts of the CME, respectively. The respective velocities at 20 Rsun reach 2000 and 1100 km/s, and its mass unbiased by projection effects is estimated at 1.7x10^16 g. Altogether, these are quite exceptionally large values among CMEs and imply a very energetic event. No erupting event could be identified at or near the calculated initial location of the CME. It lies 25° west of the active region NOAA 10484, the site of contemporary, violent, and recurrent solar eruptions (the “Halloween event”) and a putative connection would require a strong deflection over a very short path. Therefore, the origin of this CME remains unclear.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinetic collisionless model of the solar transition region and corona with spatially intermittent heating</a><span class="id">[2510.05954]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a three-dimensional kinetic model of the solar transition region and corona in which the plasma above the chromosphere is collisionless and embedded in a uniform magnetic field.

These planets offer unique observational opportunities through transit photometry, transmission spectroscopy, and infrared (IR) phase curve analysis, which reveal information about heat redistribution and atmospheric dynamics. Complementary to common generalized circulation models (GCMs), we introduce a more comprehensive approach using the anelastic fluid equations that fully capture the three-dimensional nature of the emerging non-linear flows. We identify various non-linear flow regimes and analyze the heat distribution when irradiation and thermal advection reach equilibrium. Eastward zonal winds can reach velocities comparable to the planetary rotation (up to several kilometers per second), while slower radial flows, though less prominent, contribute significantly to heat advection and can cause both eastward and westward hotspot shifts. The efficiency of day-to-night heat redistribution and the positioning of brightness maxima are shown to depend strongly on pressure and the interplay of advective and radiative processes. These findings improve our understanding of the diversity observed in the IR phase curves and suggest a non-magnetic mechanism for retrograde hotspot shifts. By extending the scope of traditional GCM models, our work demonstrates the usefulness of anelastic models in capturing the complex, multidimensional dynamics of irradiated exoplanetary atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stochastic Gravitational Waves from Modulated Reheating</a><span class="id">[2510.05967]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate scalar-induced stochastic gravitational waves from adiabatic curvature perturbations sourced by a spectator field via the modulated reheating mechanism.

We used photospheric magnetograms and EUV filtergrams from the Solar Orbiter and the Solar Dynamics Observatory along with flare detections from the GOES and the STIX instrument on board the Solar Orbiter. All images were deprojected into a common coordinate system and merged into a unified dataset. We tracked the evolution of magnetic flux and EUV emission and computed magnetic field parameters from the line-of-sight magnetograms to quantify the region's non-potentiality. We identified the region's initial emergence and followed its evolution through to its decay. The region developed through successive flux emergence episodes over a period of 20 days, reached its peak complexity one month after the first emergence, and gradually decayed over the subsequent two months. Unlike many complex regions, it consistently maintained high levels of non-potentiality for most of its lifetime, sustaining equally strong flaring activity. The derived time series of non-potentiality parameters, the first of their kind, far exceeded the typical 14-day window imposed by solar rotation and were remarkably consistent, exhibiting strong correlation with the flaring activity of the region.

Although Gaia astrometric orbits have already revealed a small sample of compact object binaries, many systems remain undetected due to stringent quality cuts imposed on the published orbits. Using a forward-modelling framework that simulates Gaia observables, in particular the renormalised unit weight error (ruwe) and radial velocity (RV) scatter, we infer posterior distributions for companion mass and orbital period via MCMC sampling, marginalising over nuisance orbital parameters. We validate our approach by comparing the predicted masses and periods against full orbit solutions from DR3, and by successfully recovering known compact object binaries as promising candidates. The method is best suited for systems with red giant primaries, which have more reliable Gaia RV scatter and a light centroid more likely dominated by one component, compared to main-sequence stars. And they are less likely to be triples with short-period inner binaries, which produce confounding signatures. We apply the method to three million giants and identify 556 systems with best-fit companion masses $\gtrsim 3\,M_\odot$. Recovery simulations suggest our selection method is substantially more sensitive than the DR3 non-single-star catalogue, particularly for binaries with periods below 1 year and above $\sim 6$ years. These candidates represent promising targets for spectroscopic follow-up and Gaia DR4 analysis to confirm the presence of compact objects. Candidate main-sequence stars with massive companions face a larger set of confounding effects. Therefore, we present an analogous catalogue of 279 additional `main sequence' candidates only as an appendix.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The inertial dip as a window on the convective core dynamics</a><span class="id">[2510.05983]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma Dor stars are ideal targets for studies of the innermost dynamical properties of stars, due to their rich frequency spectrum of gravito-inertial modes propagating in the radiative envelope. Recent studies found that these modes could couple at the core-to-envelope interface with pure inertial modes in their sub-inertial regime, forming the so-called inertial dip in the period-spacing pattern of these stars. The inertial dip, as formed by core modes, stands out as a unique probe of core properties. We aim in this work to explore the effect of core magnetism on its structure, property of key relevance in modern stellar physics. We describe the outlines of our model and the geometry of the considered field. We give the coupling equation and the variation of the dip shape and location with increasing magnetic contrast between the core and the envelope. We compare our findings to the ones obtained in a hydrodynamical, differentially-rotating case. We show hints at potentially lifting the degeneracy between the signatures of core-to-envelope differential rotation and core magnetic fields. Together, these two cases can be considered as an exploration of different magnetic regimes potentially reached in the core of gamma Dor stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hunting Very High-Energy ($&gt;$100 GeV) Emitting High-Synchrotron Peaked Blazars</a><span class="id">[2510.06017]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Very-high energy (VHE; $&gt;$100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission originates via some of the most extreme particle acceleration processes in the universe. Considering beamed active galactic nuclei, i.e., blazars, only a small fraction, mainly high synchrotron peak BL Lacs, have been detected in the VHE band with the ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. We utilized $\sim$16 years of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations in the 0.1$-$2 TeV energy range to systematically search for potential VHE emitters in a sample of high synchrotron peaked ($\nu^{\rm peak}_{\rm syn}&gt;10^{15}$ Hz) BL Lac sources. We identified, for the first time, 92 VHE emitting blazars at $\geq 5\sigma$ confidence level. A significant VHE emission was also detected from 52 objects, which have been previously reported to be a VHE blazar. Comparing with the general blazar population, these VHE emitting blazars are found to be located at low redshifts (mean $z=0.2 \pm 0.1$) and exhibit bright synchrotron emission ($\log F^{\rm peak}_{\rm syn}=-11.2 \pm 0.4$, in erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). We also investigated the coincidence of VHE photon arrivals with the source activity states and found that Fermi-LAT has detected VHE photons during both quiescent and elevated activity epochs. These VHE emitting blazars represent promising targets for current and next-generation ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, and provide valuable laboratories for probing particle acceleration in relativistic jets, testing multi-messenger connections, and constraining extragalactic background light models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The influence of rotation and metallicity on the explodability of massive stars</a><span class="id">[2510.06043]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During the late stages of massive stellar evolution, failed supernovae (FSN) may form through core-collapse processes. The traditional evaluation criterion $\xi_{2.5}$ $=$ 0.45, primarily established using non-rotating progenitor models, suffers from significant inaccuracies when applied to rotating pre-supernova systems. The effects of metallicity and rotation on the explodability landscapes of massive stars lack robust quantification. We aim to investigate how rotation and metallicity influence the explodability of massive stars. We investigate how rotation and metallicity affect stellar explodability using MESA simulations with initial rotational velocities of $0$, $300$, and $600~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at three metallicities ($Z_{\odot}$, $1/10,Z_{\odot}$, $1/50,Z_{\odot}$). Core-collapse phases are simulated with GR1D to determine critical heating efficiencies. Our results yield revised $\xi_{2.5}$ criteria: 0.45 for non-rotating models; 0.48 for $300~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$; 0.47 for $600~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at solar metallicity; and 0.59 for low-metallicity models. Chemically homogeneous evolution in rapidly rotating low-metallicity stars significantly raises the compactness limit for successful explosions and narrows the zero-age main sequence mass range for failed supernovae. Rotation substantially affects the explodability of low-metallicity massive stars, underscoring the importance of incorporating rotational effects in models of core-collapse supernova progenitors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Influence of Central Body Tides on Catastrophic Disruptions of Close-in Planetary Satellites</a><span class="id">[2510.06044]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We model the outcomes of catastrophic disruptions on small, gravity-dominated natural satellites, accounting for the tidal potential of the central body, which is neglected in classical disruption scaling laws. We introduce the concept of $Q^\star_\text{TD}$, the specific energy required to disperse half of the total mass involved in a collision, accounting for the tidal potential of a central body. We derive a simple scaling relation for $Q^\star_\text{TD}$ and demonstrate that for close-in planetary or asteroidal satellites, the tides from the central body can significantly reduce their catastrophic disruption threshold. We show that many satellites in the Solar System are in such a regime, where their disruption threshold should be much lower than that predicted by classical scaling laws which neglect tidal effects. Some notable examples include Mars' Phobos, Jupiter's Metis and Adrastea, Saturn's ring moons, Uranus' Ophelia, and Neptune's Naiad and Thalassa, among others. We argue that traditional impact scaling laws should be modified to account for tides when modeling the formation and evolution of these close-in satellites.

Since only a small number of RGs are detected in gamma rays compared to the largest known radio population, the correlation between radio and gamma-ray emission serves as a crucial tool to characterize the gamma-ray properties of these sources. We analyse the population of RGs using two samples. The first sample contains 26 sources individually detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at gamma rays. The second sample contains 210 RGs for which the gamma-ray emission is not significantly detected by the LAT. We use a stacking analysis to characterize the average properties of the gamma-ray emission of the two samples, separately at first and then combined. We then evaluate the correlation between their gamma-ray emission and the emission from their radio core at 5 GHz, and we use it to determine their contribution to the IGRB. Due to the limited number of RGs detected at the gamma-rays, information on the gamma-ray luminosity function is limited. The correlation between the gamma-ray emission and the emission of the radio core allows us to characterize it starting from the luminosity function of the radio cores, which is modeled with greater accuracy due to the larger number of sources detected at these frequencies. We find that the diffuse emission as extrapolated from the properties of the subthreshold RGs is lower than the one inferred from detected RGs, showing that the contribution of the population of RGs to the IGRB is lower than the previous estimates and it is around the 30% level of the IGRB intensity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06154" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Possibility of Melting Water Ice during the Recent Past of Mars.

However, melting-based hypotheses generally overlook key processes: (1) sublimation cooling by latent heat absorption, (2) the non-stability of ice where melting conditions can be reached, and (3) the particular microclimates of gullied slopes. Using state-of-the-art climate simulations, we reassess ice melting scenarios over the past four million years (obliquity $\le$35\textdegree)), beyond the estimated period of gully formation. We find that surface melting is impossible anywhere due to sublimation cooling, while (quasi-) stable subsurface ice is typically too deep to reach melting temperatures. We propose an alternative mechanism in which seasonal CO$_2$ frost sublimation destabilizes the regolith and brings the underlying water ice close to the surface, allowing rapid heating. Even under these optimal conditions, melting requires unrealistic assumptions. The only remaining possibility is solar absorption in dusty ice, though its occurrence remains uncertain.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06164" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonlinear Evolution of the Matter Trispectrum with Primordial Parity Violation</a><span class="id">[2510.06164]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Parity-odd four-point correlation functions, or trispectra, of cosmic matter density fields provide a unique probe of fundamental symmetries in cosmology.

In this paper, we compute the nonlinear evolution of the parity-odd matter trispectrum to one-loop order, i.e., to third order in density fluctuations, within the framework of effective field theory of the large-scale structure of the universe. By analyzing the different terms in the perturbation series, we demonstrate the structure of infrared divergence cancellations, as required by the equivalence principle. We also derive the forms of the counterterms required to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences. Adopting a specific model for a primordial parity-odd trispectrum, we numerically compute the leading-order effects of nonlinear gravitational evolution and study its impact on baryonic acoustic oscillations within the signal. These calculations are essential for comparing the observed trispectra of nonlinear cosmic density fields with theoretical expectations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST-TST DREAMS: The Nightside Emission and Chemistry of WASP-17b</a><span class="id">[2510.06169]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Theoretical studies have suggested using planetary infrared excess (PIE) to detect and characterize the thermal emission of transiting and non-transiting exoplanets, however the PIE technique requires empirical validation. Here we apply the PIE technique to a combination of JWST NIRSpec G395H transit and eclipse measurements of WASP-17b, a hot Jupiter orbiting an F-type star, obtained consecutively (0.5 phase or 1.8 days apart) as part of the JWST-TST program to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS). Using the in-eclipse measured stellar spectrum to circumvent the need for ultra-precise stellar models, we extract the first JWST nightside emission spectrum of WASP-17b using only transit and eclipse data thereby performing a controlled test of the PIE technique. From the WASP-17b nightside spectrum, we measure a nightside equilibrium temperature of $1005 \pm 256$ K and find tentative evidence for nightside SO2 absorption ($\ln B = 1.45$, $2.3\sigma$). In context with the dayside, the temperature of the nightside is consistent with (1) previous eclipse mapping findings that suggest relatively inefficient day-night heat transport, and (2) a non-zero bond albedo of $0.42^{+0.06}_{-0.10}$. SO2 on the nightside, if confirmed, would represent the first direct evidence for transport-induced chemistry, matching previous model predictions, and opening a new door into the 3D nature of giant exoplanets. Our results suggest that PIE is feasible with JWST/NIRSpec for two epochs separated in time by significantly less than the rotation period of the host star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rare Transients in Nearby Galaxies Explain Ultra-high-energy Cosmic Rays</a><span class="id">[2510.06193]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays remains one of the central open questions in astroparticle physics.

In our fiducial neutron-star merger model, the cosmic ray flux above $25$ EeV is dominated by ten nearby galaxies within $8\,$Mpc. This accounts for the observed hotspots: seven of the ten brightest galaxies coincide with reported excess regions, a chance probability of $p\simeq0.003$. Nearby transients also explain the spectral excess of TA over Auger; link their angular sizes to extragalactic magnetic fields at $\sim$1 nG; explain the dominance of individual species over narrow energy ranges; and the rigidity-aligned succession of isotopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intrinsically Quantum Effects of Axion Dark Matter are Undetectable</a><span class="id">[2510.05198]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Is the usual treatment of axion dark matter as a classical field reliable?

We show that intrinsically quantum effects are washed out by mode averaging or small amounts of noise, and significantly suppressed by the weakness of the axion coupling.

Examples of this source separation task include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source. Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution. The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors, evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as real-world galaxy observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comparing LSTM-Based Sequence-to-Sequence Forecasting Strategies for 24-Hour Solar Proton Flux Profiles Using GOES Data</a><span class="id">[2510.05399]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites, astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by NOAA GOES, each associated with a &gt;=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs. combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data, and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data preprocessing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Binary Neutron Stars from the Moon: Early Warnings and Precision Science for the Artemis Era</a><span class="id">[2510.05400]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binary neutron star mergers are unique probes of matter at extreme density and standard candles of cosmic expansion. The only such event observed in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation, GW170817, revealed the origin of heavy elements, constrained the neutron star equation of state, and provided an independent measurement of the Hubble constant. Current detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA capture only the final minutes of inspiral, offering limited advance warning and coarse sky localization. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of binary neutron star signals for lunar-based gravitational-wave observatories (LILA, LGWA, GLOC) envisioned within NASA's Artemis and Commercial Lunar Payload Services programs, and compare their performance with current and next-generation Earth-based facilities. For GW170817-like sources, we find that lunar detectors can forecast mergers weeks to months in advance and localize them to areas as small as 0.01 deg$^{2}$, far beyond the reach of terrestrial detectors. We further show that lunar observatories would detect on the order of 100 well-localized mergers annually, enabling coordinated multi-messenger follow-up. When combined in a multi-band LIGO+Moon network, sky-localization areas shrink to just a few arcsec$^{2}$, comparable to the field of view of the James Webb Space Telescope at high zoom. Multi-band parameter estimation also delivers dramatic gains: neutron star mass-ratio uncertainties can be measured with $\sim0.1\%$ precision, spin constraints to 0.001$\%$ with luminosity distance errors to 1$\%$ level, enabling precision measurements of the equation of state and the cosmic expansion rate.

It affects significantly the radii, tidal deformations, cooling rates and frequencies of various oscillation modes of isolated neutron stars as well as the strain amplitude and frequencies of gravitational waves from their mergers, besides its many effects on structures of nuclei as well as the dynamics and observables of their collisions. Siemens (1970s) observed that $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ scales as $(\rho/\rho_0)^{2/3}$ near the saturation density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter, since both the kinetic part and the potential contribution (quadratic in momentum) exhibit this dependence. The scaling holds if: (1) the nucleon isoscalar potential is quadratic in momentum, and (2) the isovector interaction is weakly density dependent. After examining many empirical evidences and understanding theoretical findings in the literature we conclude that: (1) Siemens' $\rho^{2/3}$ scaling is robust and serves as a valuable benchmark for both nuclear theories and experiments up to $2\rho_0$ but breaks down at higher densities, (2) Experimental and theoretical findings about $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ up to $2\rho_0$ are broadly consistent, but uncertainties remain large for its curvature $K_{\mathrm{sym}}$ and higher-order parameters, (3) Above $2\rho_0$, uncertainties grow due to poorly constrained spin-isospin dependent tensor and three-body forces as well as the resulting nucleon short-range correlations. Looking forward, combining multimessengers from both observations of neutron stars and terrestrial heavy-ion reaction experiments is the most promising path to finally constraining precisely the high-density $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ and the EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demagnifying gravitational lenses as probes of dark matter structures and nonminimal couplings to gravity</a><span class="id">[2510.05575]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnification of total image fluxes is typically considered a defining feature of gravitational microlensing.

Given the data volume and the impact of the findings, the potential for confirmation bias poses a significant challenge. To address this, we implement and validate a comprehensive blind analysis strategy for DESI Data Release 1 (DR1), tailored to the specific observables DESI is most sensitive to: Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Redshift-Space Distortion (RSD) and primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG). We carry out the blinding at the catalog level, implementing shifts in the redshifts of the observed galaxies to blind for BAO and RSD signals and weights to blind for PNG through a scale-dependent bias. We validate the blinding technique on mocks, as well as on data by applying a second blinding layer to perform a battery of sanity checks. We find that the blinding strategy alters the data vector in a controlled way such that the BAO and RSD analysis choices do not need any modification before and after unblinding.

Here, we present improvements in the efficiency and accuracy of the RSD modeling in the perturbative LEFTfield forward model. We perform a detailed quantification of the perturbative and numerical error for the prediction of momentum, velocity and the redshift-space matter density. Further, we test the recovery of cosmological parameters at the field level, namely the growth rate $f$, from simulated halos in redshift space. For a rigorous test and to scan through a wide range of analysis choices, we fix the linear (initial) density field to the known ground truth but marginalize over all unknown bias coefficients and noise amplitudes. With a third-order model for gravity and bias, our results yield $&lt;1\,\%$ statistical and $&lt;1.5\,\%$ systematic error. The computational cost of the redshift-space forward model is only $\sim 1.5$ times of the rest frame equivalent, enabling future field-level inference that simultaneously targets cosmological parameters and the initial matter distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Gigaparsec-Scale Hydrodynamic Volume Reconstructed with Deep Learning</a><span class="id">[2411.16920]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The next generation of cosmological spectroscopic sky surveys will probe the distribution of matter across several Gigaparsecs (Gpc) or many billion light-years. In order to leverage the rich data in these new maps to gain a better understanding of the physics that shapes the large-scale structure of the cosmos, observed matter distributions must be compared to simulated mock skies. Small mock skies can be produced using precise, physics-driven hydrodynamical simulations. However, the need to capture small, kpc-scale density fluctuations in the intergalactic medium (IGM) places tight restrictions on the necessary minimum resolution of these simulations. Even on the most powerful supercomputers, it is impossible to run simulations of such high resolution in volumes comparable to what will be probed by future surveys, due to the vast quantity of data needed to store such a simulation in computer memory. However, it is possible to represent the essential features of these high-resolution simulations using orders of magnitude less memory. We present a hybrid approach that employs a physics-driven hydrodynamical simulation at a much lower-than-necessary resolution, followed by a data-driven, deep-learning Enhancement. This hybrid approach allows us to produce hydrodynamic mock skies that accurately capture small, kpc-scale features in the IGM but which span hundreds of Megaparsecs. We have produced such a volume which is roughly one Gigaparsec in diameter and examine its relevant large-scale statistical features, emphasizing certain properties that could not be captured by previous smaller simulations. We present this hydrodynamic volume as well as a companion n-body dark matter simulation and halo catalog which we are making publically available to the community for use in calibrating data pipelines for upcoming survey analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on Neutrino Physics from DESI DR2 BAO and DR1 Full Shape</a><span class="id">[2503.14744]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration has obtained robust measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the redshift range, $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 4.2$, based on the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and galaxies from Data Release 2 (DR2). We combine these measurements with external cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT to place our tightest constraints yet on the sum of neutrino masses. Assuming the cosmological $\Lambda$CDM model and three degenerate neutrino states, we find $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.0642$ eV (95%) with a marginalized error of $\sigma(\sum m_\nu)=0.020$ eV. We also constrain the effective number of neutrino species, finding $N_\rm{eff} = 3.23^{+0.35}_{-0.34}$ (95%), in line with the Standard Model prediction. When accounting for neutrino oscillation constraints, we find a preference for the normal mass ordering and an upper limit on the lightest neutrino mass of $m_l &lt; 0.023$ eV (95%). However, we determine using frequentist and Bayesian methods that our constraints are in tension with the lower limits derived from neutrino oscillations. Correcting for the physical boundary at zero mass, we report a 95% Feldman-Cousins upper limit of $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.053$ eV, breaching the lower limit from neutrino oscillations. Considering a more general Bayesian analysis with an effective cosmological neutrino mass parameter, $\sum m_{\nu,\rm{eff}}$, that allows for negative energy densities and removes unsatisfactory prior weight effects, we derive constraints that are in $3\sigma$ tension with the same oscillation limit. In the absence of unknown systematics, this finding could be interpreted as a hint of new physics not necessarily related to neutrinos. The preference of DESI and CMB data for an evolving dark energy model offers one possible solution. In the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we find $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.163$ eV (95%), relaxing the neutrino tension.

The latter is unfortunately never strictly the case. A key question for field-level inference approaches then is where the cosmological information is coming from, and how to ensure that it is robust. In the context of perturbative approaches such as effective field theory, some progress on this question can be made analytically. We derive the parameter posterior given the data for the field-level likelihood given in the effective field theory, marginalized over initial conditions in the zero-noise limit. Particular attention is paid to cutoffs in the theory, the generalization to higher orders, and the error made by an incomplete forward model at a given order. The main finding is that, broadly speaking, an $m$-th order forward model captures the information in $n$-point correlation functions with $n \leqslant m+1$. Thus, by adding more terms to the forward model, field-level inference is made to automatically incorporate higher-order $n$-point functions. Also shown is how the effect of an incomplete forward model (at a given order) on the parameter inference can be estimated.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing Quintessence Axion Dark Energy with Recent Cosmological Results</a><span class="id">[2504.17638]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a quintessence axion model for dynamical dark energy, motivated in part by recent results from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) combined with the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and the latest Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data. By carefully treating the initial conditions and parameter sampling, we identify a preferred parameter space featuring a sub-Planckian axion decay constant and a relatively large axion mass, which naturally avoids the quality problem and remains consistent with the perturbative string conjecture. Our parameter scan also uncovers a trans-Planckian regime of theoretical interest, which is only mildly disfavored even by the strongest constraint. Finally, we discuss the possible connection between this model and the recently reported non-zero rotation of the CMB linear polarization angle, emphasizing the broader cosmological implications and the promising prospects for testing this scenario.

In this note, we update our analysis using the Dark Energy Survey 5 year supernova data set (DES-SN5YR) and the baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Approximating the scalar potential via a first order Taylor series $V \approx V_0 + V_1 \phi$ about the present value, and making use of only recent-time data from DES-SN5YR and DESI DR2, we find that the slope parameter is constrained as $V_1 = 1.49 \pm 0.25$ in a standard likelihood analysis. This is naively a $&gt;5 \sigma$ discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM (which has $V_1 =0$), though a more detailed analysis not assuming a Gaussian likelihood distribution suggests $4 \sigma$ significance. Based only on the $\Delta \chi^2 = -13.7$ improvement of fit while ignoring parameter space volumes disfavours $\Lambda$CDM at a $3 \sigma$ significance level. These significance measures are substantially improved from our previous analysis using older data sets. We also reproduce the DESI DR2 parameter constraints based on the same combination of data and find that the $\Lambda$CDM is more strongly disfavoured in the context of the linear potential extension (dubbed $V_0V_1$) as compared with the $w_0 w_a$ extension of $\Lambda$CDM. A caveat is that for both $w_0 w_a$ and $V_0 V_1$, much of the significance relies on the historical $z &lt; 0.1$ supernova samples included in the DES-SN5YR data set.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13623" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Reheating Phase via Non-Helical Magnetogenesis and Secondary Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2505.13623]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the past two decades, significant advancements have been made in observational techniques to enhance our understanding of the universe and its evolutionary processes. However, our knowledge of the post-inflation reheating phase remains limited due to its small-scale dynamics. Traditional observations, such as those of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), primarily provide insights into large-scale dynamics, making it challenging to glean information about the reheating era. In this paper, our primary aim is to explore how the generation of Gravitational Waves (GWs) spectra, resulting from electromagnetic fields in the early universe, can offer valuable insights into the Reheating dynamics. We investigate how the spectral shape of GWs varies across different frequency ranges, depending on the initial magnetic profile and reheating dynamics. For this, we consider a well-known non-helical magnetogenesis model, where the usual electromagnetic kinetic term is coupled with a background scalar. Notably, for such a scenario, we observe distinct spectral shapes with sufficiently high amplitudes for different reheating histories with the equation of state parametrized by ($w_{\rm re}$). We identify spectral breaks in the GW spectra for both $w_{\rm re}&lt;1/3$ and $w_{\rm re}&gt;1/3$ scenarios. We find that future GW experiments such as BBO, LISA, SKA, and DECIGO are well within the reach of observing those distinct spectral shapes and can potentially shed light on the underlying mechanism of the reheating phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100,000 Crab giant pulses at 215 MHz detected with an SKA-Low prototype station</a><span class="id">[2506.07422]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report detection and analysis of the largest low-frequency (200 - 231.25 MHz) sample of Crab giant pulses (GPs) reported in the literature. In total about 95000 GPs were detected. The observations were performed in 2024/2025 with the EDA2, a prototype station of the SKA-Low telescope. The fluence distribution of GPs in the entire sample is very well characterised with a single power law (no flattening at higher fluences) N(F) $\propto$ F$^\alpha$, where $\alpha = -3.17\pm0.02$ for all GPs, and $\alpha_{MP} = -3.13\pm0.02$ and $\alpha_{IP} = -3.59\pm0.06$ for GPs at the phases of the main pulse and interpulse respectively. The index of the power law fluence distribution remained approximately constant over the observing period, but the normalisation of the distribution was strongly correlated with the scatter broadening time ($\tau$). As a result, the measured fluence distribution increased for lower ($\tau \approx$ 2 ms) and decreased for higher ($\tau \approx$ 5 ms) scatter broadening time $\tau$ causing the GP rate to vary between 3000 and 100 per hour respectively. The timescale of variations (weeks) indicates refractive scintillation as the root cause. We also observe a strong positive correlation between the scatter broadening time and dispersion measure. Our modelling favours the screen of the size $\sim10^{-5}$ pc and mean electron density $\sim 400$e$^{-}$cm$^{-3}$ located within 100 pc from the pulsar. The frequency scaling of the scattering broadening time ($\tau \propto \nu^{\beta}$) with $\beta \approx -3.6\pm0.1$ is in agreement with earlier measurements. Our results agree with the current views that GPs from extra-galactic Crab-like pulsars can be responsible for very weak repeating FRBs, but cannot explain the entire FRB population. Finally, these results demonstrate an enormous scientific potential of individual SKA-Low stations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice II: Nonperturbative Curvature Perturbation</a><span class="id">[2506.11795]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Building on the recent lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics presented in arXiv:2410.23942 , we investigate the role of the nonlinear relation between the inflaton field configuration and the curvature perturbation $\zeta$, the key observable after inflation. Using a nonperturbative $\delta N$ approach applied to the lattice output, we generate fully nonlinear three-dimensional maps of $\zeta$. This calculation captures both the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear mapping between $\phi$ and $\zeta$, and the intrinsic non-Gaussianity generated around Hubble crossing by the nonlinear field dynamics, which is neglected in stochastic approaches. We find that the nonlinear mapping has a profound impact on the statistics, significantly enhancing the positive tail of the $\zeta$ probability distribution, with important implications for observable quantities. A central part of this work is the comparison with the standard perturbative treatment based on a gauge transformation, which allows us to quantify when and how the perturbative picture breaks down as fluctuations grow large. Together with arXiv:2410.23942 , this work sets the basis for robust, nonperturbative predictions of primordial black hole production and scalar-induced gravitational wave emission from inflation using lattice simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17565" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transient star B/R ratio and star formation in $z\gtrsim 1$ lensed galaxies</a><span class="id">[2506.17565]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The extreme magnification from galaxy clusters and microlenses therein allows the detection of individual, luminous stars in lensed galaxies as transient events, and hence provides a valuable window into the high mass stellar population in $z&gt;1$ galaxies. As these bright stars can only be formed at specific ages, the relative abundance of transient events at blue (B) and red (R) optical wavelengths ($B/R$ ratio) can provide insights into the recent star formation history of galaxies that are not well constrained by their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Here, we forward model the transient detection rates in an idealized mock scenario to find that the $B/R$ ratio of strongly lensed $z&gt;1$ galaxies decreases quickly with increasing age. This ratio has moderate sensitivity to metallicity and comparatively low sensitivity to dust attenuation, with no significant dependency on the stellar initial mass function. Fitting model stellar populations to either the SED or $B/R$ ratio alone of “Warhol” arc ($z = 0.94$), we find that neither a simple single starburst nor a more complex star formation can simultaneously reproduce both constraints. We then demonstrate that a best-fit model constrained by both the B/R ratio and SED requires a star-formation rate that has varied quite dramatically over the past $\sim$50 Myr, for which the total stellar mass formed over this time is a factor of 10 (with $2-3\sigma$ significance) different from the best-fit models to the SED alone. Our work shows that the transient $B/R$ ratio can be used as an additional powerful constraint on the recent star formation history of higher-redshift galaxies in future works that are strongly lensed by galaxy clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{\tt RapidGBM}: An Efficient Tool for Fermi-GBM Visibility Checking and Data Analysis with a Case Study of EP240617a</a><span class="id">[2506.20532]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have developed a lightweight tool, {\tt RapidGBM}, featuring a web-based interface and capabilities of rapid calculation of Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) visibilities and performance of basic data analysis.

The visibility check and the response matrix generation required for spectral analysis can be achieved through the historical pointing file after the orbit calculation, even when the real-time pointing file is not yet available. As a case study, we apply the tool to EP240617a, an X-ray transient triggered by Einstein Probe (EP). We demonstrate the workflow of visibility checking, data processing, and spectral analysis for this event. The results suggest that EP240617a can be classified as an X-ray-rich gamma-ray burst (XRR) and confirm the feasibility of using historical pointing files for rapid analysis. Further, we discuss possible physical interpretations of such events, including implications for jet launching and progenitor scenarios.

The expanded envelope engulfs the neutron star, causing strong mass accretion at super-Eddington rates. Feedback from the accretion powers the supernova light curve with periodic undulations. Our simulations capture key features of SN2022jli, both the overall decline and the superimposed undulations of the light curve. Based on our parameter study, we find that (i) the accretion feedback should be sufficiently geometrically confined and (ii) the eccentricity of the post-supernova binary orbit should be $0.8\lesssim e\lesssim0.9$ to sustain a high accretion rate and match the low undulation amplitude ($\Delta L/L\sim0.1$) of SN2022jli. Different combinations of parameters could account for other supernovae like SN2022mop, SN2009ip and SN2015ap, which have varying undulation periods and amplitudes.

We find a Bayes factor of $B\approx2.3$ when comparing models with and without an explicit phase transition, marginally favoring its presence. At $68\%$ credibility, the transition onset density $n_{\rm PT}$ is either below $2\,n_s$ (corresponding to masses $\lesssim1\,M_\odot$, with density jump $\Delta n\sim0.5\,n_s$) or, more prominently, above $4\,n_s$ (near the central density of the heaviest NS, with $\Delta n\sim3\,n_s$), where $n_s$ represents the nuclear saturation density.

We experiment with post-formation pollution by planetesimal accretion, pebble accretion, and disk-induced migration and find that an observable signature of post-formation pollution is only possible under pebble accretion in metal-heavy disks.

The brightness ($\Delta m_g = -6.12$) of this flare, combined with the high air mass ($1.45 \lesssim X \lesssim 1.75$) and blue filter (DES $g$, 398-548 nm) in which it was observed, provided ideal conditions to measure the zenith-ward apparent motion of the source due to differential chromatic refraction (DCR) and, from that, infer the effective temperature of the event. We model the flare's spectral energy distribution as a blackbody to produce the constraints on flare temperature and geometric properties derived from single-band photometry. We additionally demonstrate how simplistic assumptions on the flaring spectrum, as well as on the evolution of flare geometry, can result in solutions that overestimate effective temperature. Exploiting DCR enables studying chromatic phenomena with ground-based astrophysical surveys and stellar flares on M-dwarfs are a particularly enticing target for such studies due to their ubiquity across the sky, and the heightened color contrast between their red quiescent photospheres and the blue flare emission.

In corresponding models with pre-recombination EDE, resolving the Hubble tension (i.e., achieving $H_0\sim 73$km/s/Mpc) must be accompanied by a shift of $n_s$ towards unity to maintain consistency with the cosmological data, which thus implies a scale invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum with $n_s=1$ $(|n_s-1|\simeq {\cal O}(0.001))$.

Our work again highlights the importance of re-examining our understanding on the very early Universe within the broader context of cosmological tensions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Dimensional Bayesian Model Comparison in Cosmology with GPU-accelerated Nested Sampling and Neural Emulators</a><span class="id">[2509.13307]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We demonstrate a GPU-accelerated nested sampling framework for efficient high-dimensional Bayesian inference in cosmology. Using JAX-based neural emulators and likelihoods for cosmic microwave background and cosmic shear analyses, our approach provides parameter constraints and direct calculation of Bayesian evidence. In the 39-dimensional $\Lambda$CDM vs $w_0w_a$ shear analysis, we produce Bayes factors and a robust error bar in just 2 days on a single A100 GPU, without loss of accuracy. Where CPU-based nested sampling can now be outpaced by methods relying on MCMC sampling and decoupled evidence estimation, we demonstrate that with GPU acceleration nested sampling offers the necessary speed-up to put it on equal computational footing with these methods, especially where reliable model comparison is paramount. We also explore interpolation in the matter power spectrum for cosmic shear analysis, finding a further factor of 4 speed-up with consistent posterior contours and Bayes factor. We put forward both nested and gradient-based sampling as useful tools for the modern cosmologist, where cutting-edge inference pipelines can yield orders of magnitude improvements in computation time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26418" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical equilibria of fast neutrino flavor conversion</a><span class="id">[2509.26418]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dense neutrino systems, which display collectivity mediated by the weak interaction, have deep parallels with mean-field kinetic systems governed by other fundamental forces.

We find accurate analytic approximations for the blow-up time that we validate against numerical simulations, and explore the properties of the equation in the vicinity of equilibrium between innovation and extinction.

This situation motivates the study of how the probability density function (PDF) of a light spectator field $\varphi$ in a pure de Sitter space-time, becomes non-Gaussian under the influence of a scalar potential ${\mathcal V(\varphi)}$. One approach to this problem is offered by the stochastic formalism introduced by Starobinsky and Yokoyama. It results in a Fokker-Planck equation for the time-dependent PDF $\rho (\varphi , t)$ describing the statistics of $\varphi$ which, in the limit of equilibrium gives one back the solution $\rho (\varphi) \propto \exp \big[ - \frac{8 \pi^2}{3 H^4} {\mathcal V(\varphi)} \big]$. We study the derivation of $\rho (\varphi , t)$ using quantum field theory tools. Our approach yields an almost Gaussian distribution function, distorted by minor corrections comprised of terms proportional to powers of $\mathcal O_\varphi {\mathcal V(\varphi)}$, where $\mathcal O_\varphi$ stands for a derivative operator acting on ${\mathcal V(\varphi)}$ proportional to $\Delta N$, the number of $e$-folds succeeding the Hubble-horizon crossing of $\varphi$'s wavelengths. This general form is obtained perturbatively and remains valid even with loop corrections. Our solution satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation that receives corrections with respect to the one found within the stochastic approach, allowing us to comment on the validity of the standard equilibrium solution for generic potentials. We posit that higher order corrections to the Fokker-Planck equation may become important towards the equilibrium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10755" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Could We Observe an Exploding Black Hole in the Near Future?</a><span class="id">[2503.10755]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observation of an exploding black hole would provide the first direct evidence of primordial black holes, the first direct evidence of Hawking radiation, and definitive information on the particles present in nature. However, indirect constraints suggest that direct observation of an exploding Schwarzschild black hole is implausible. We introduce a dark-QED toy model consisting of a dark photon and a heavy dark electron. In this scenario a population of light primordial black holes charged under the dark $u(1)$ symmetry can become quasi-extremal, so they survive much longer than if they were uncharged, before discharging and exhibiting a Schwarzschild-like final explosion. We show that the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, in this scenario the probability of observing an exploding black hole over the next $10$ years could potentially be over $90\%$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACT inflation and its influence on reheating era in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</a><span class="id">[2508.11377]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the observational viability of non-minimally coupled scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity, during inflation and post-inflationary reheating dynamics, from the perspective of the latest ACT-DR6 combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO data. It turns out that the ACT result considerably affects the inflationary e-fold number compared to the case where only Planck 2018 data is taken into account. The viable parameter spaces corresponding to the inflationary ACT-DR6+Planck18+BAO substantially influence the reheating phenomenology via the reheating equation of state ($w_\mathrm{eff}$) and the reheating temperature. In particular, the ACT-DR6+Planck18+BAO data seems to disfavor $w_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 1/3$ during the reheating stage, which is unlike to that of only Planck 2018 case. These reveal how the ACT-DR6 data hits the early universe phenomenology from inflation to reheating in the context of higher curvature like scalar-Einstein-GB theory of gravity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02539" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extending the Dynamical Systems Toolkit: Coupled Fields in Multiscalar Dark Energy</a><span class="id">[2509.02539]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the dynamics of a two-field scalar model consisting of an axion-saxion pair with both kinetic and potential couplings, as motivated by string theory compactifications. We extend the dynamical systems (DS) toolkit by introducing a new set of variables that not only close the system and enable a systematic stability analysis, but also disentangle the role of the kinetic coupling. Within this framework we derive a compact, general expression for the non-geodesicity (turning-rate) parameter evaluated at fixed points, valid for arbitrary couplings. This provides a transparent way of diagnosing non-geodesic dynamics, with direct applications to both dark energy and multifield inflation. We first consider exponential coupling functions to establish analytic control and facilitate comparison with previous literature. In this case, we uncover a pair of genuinely non-geodesic fixed points, which act as attractors within a submanifold of the full system. In contrast, when the axion shift symmetry remains unbroken, our analysis shows that the apparent non-geodesic fixed point reported previously does not persist once the full dynamics are taken into account. Finally, we illustrate how our approach naturally extends to more realistic string-inspired models, such as power-law axion potentials combined with exponential saxion couplings, and present an explicit supergravity realisation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the (Im)possibility of Electrically Charged Planck Relics</a><span class="id">[2509.12520]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I revisit whether black-hole remnants, from sub-Planckian compact objects to Planck relics and up to (super)massive black holes, can preserve Standard-Model (SM) electric charge. Two exterior-field mechanisms – Coulomb-focused capture from ambient media and QED Schwinger pair production – robustly neutralize such objects across cosmic history. I first derive the general capture rate including both Coulomb and gravitational focusing, and sum the stepwise discharge time in closed form via the trigamma function, exhibiting transparent Coulomb- and gravity-dominated limits. I then integrate the Schwinger rate over the near-horizon region to obtain an explicit $\dot Q(Q)$ law: discharge proceeds until the horizon field falls below $E_{\rm crit}$, leaving a residual charge $Q_{\rm stop}^{(e)}\!\propto\! r_h^2$ that is $\ll e$ for Planck radii. Mapping the mass dependence from sub-Planckian to astrophysical scales, I also analyze dark-sector charges with heavy carriers (including kinetic mixing and massive mediators). In a conservative “no-Schwinger” limit where vacuum pair creation is absent, cumulative ambient exposures alone force discharge of any integer SM charge. Three possible loopholes remain. (i) A fine-tuned SM corner in which the relic sits arbitrarily close to Reissner-Nordström extremality so greybody factors suppress charged absorption, while Schwinger pair creation is absent due to Planck-scale physics. (ii) Charge relocated to a hidden $U(1)_D$ with no light opposite carriers, e.g. if the lightest state is very heavy and/or kinetic mixing with $U(1)_{\rm EM}$ is vanishingly small. (iii) Discrete or topological charges rather than ordinary SM electric charge. Outside these cases, the conclusion is robust: within SM electromagnetism, charged black-hole relics neutralize efficiently and cannot retain charge over cosmological times.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vector dark matter production during inflation in the gradient-expansion formalism</a><span class="id">[2509.24963]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A massive vector field is a highly promising candidate for dark matter in the universe. A salient property of dark matter is its negligible or null coupling to ordinary matter, with the exception of gravitational interaction. This poses a significant challenge in producing the requisite amount of dark particles through processes within the Standard Model. In this study, we examine the production of a vector field during inflation due to its direct interaction with the inflaton field through kinetic and axion-like couplings as well as the field-dependent mass. The gradient-expansion formalism, previously proposed for massless Abelian gauge fields, is extended to include the longitudinal polarization of a massive vector field. We derive a coupled system of equations of motion for a set of bilinear functions of the vector field. This enables us to address the nonlinear dynamics of inflationary vector field production, including backreaction on background evolution. To illustrate this point, we apply our general formalism to a low-mass vector field whose kinetic and mass terms are coupled to the inflaton via the Ratra-type exponential function. The present study investigates the production of its transverse and longitudinal polarization components in a benchmark inflationary model with a quadratic inflaton potential. It has been demonstrated that pure mass coupling is able to enhance only the longitudinal components. By turning on also the kinetic coupling, one can get different scenarios. As the coupling function decreases, the primary contribution to the energy density is derived from the transverse polarizations of the vector field. Conversely, for an increasing coupling function, the longitudinal component becomes increasingly significant and rapidly propels the system into the strong backreaction regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01907" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter with a refined numerical scheme</a><span class="id">[2510.01907]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The existence of a large primordial neutrino asymmetry is an intriguing possibility, both observationally and theoretically. Such an asymmetry can lead to the resonant production of $\mathrm{keV}$-scale sterile neutrinos, which are a fascinating candidate for dark matter. In this paper, we comprehensively revisit the resonant production processes with a refined numerical analysis, adopting a dynamical discretization of momentum modes to take care of the sharpness of the resonance. We find parameter regions consistent with X-ray and Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints for lepton-to-entropy ratio $\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ and $m_{\nu_s}\gtrsim 20\,$keV. We also explore the Affleck-Dine mechanism as a possible origin for such asymmetries. While previous studies considered resonant production after lepton number generation, we numerically investigate cases where a fraction of sterile neutrinos is produced during lepton number injection. In this regime, some parameter sets can shorten the free-streaming length and reduce the required mixing angle to match the observed dark matter abundance, thereby mitigating the observational constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitomagnetic-Hydrodynamics and Turbulence in Early Universe</a><span class="id">[2510.03711]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work tries to establish the theoretical framework for gravitomagnetic-hydrodynamics (GMHD), revealing a fundamental correspondence between geometrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in general relativity. By introducing the gravitoelectromagnetic formalism to relativistic fluids, a set of leading-order GMHD equations is derived that govern the co-evolution of spacetime geometry and matter dynamics in the early Universe. This analysis reveals that, under high-temperature and high-density conditions such as those during the electroweak phase transition, the gravitomagnetic Reynolds number becomes large, leading to a strongly coupled fluid-spacetime system. This coupling supports the emergence of gravitational Alfven waves and a turbulent energy cascade. Our findings suggest that GMHD turbulence may leave imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background, offering a new window into the nonlinear dynamics of the primordial Universe.</p></div></details></article></body>
