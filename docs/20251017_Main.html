Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional MHD–CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion–convection equations to trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\!\lesssim\!10^{-4}\,\mathrm{G}$), NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a self-regulated state where $E_{\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields ($B_{0}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-3}\,\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for PeV–EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13949" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Explicit M1 Radiation-hydrodynamics Scheme for Three-dimensional Protostellar Evolution</a><span class="id">[2510.13949]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) scheme that enables three-dimensional simulations resolving both protostellar interiors and their surrounding accretion flows within a single framework, to clarify how a protostar evolves while interacting with the accretion flow. The method builds on an explicit M1 closure scheme with a reduced speed of light approximation (RSLA) for massively parallel computation. Our scheme introduces a complementary non-RSLA radiation component that dominates in optically thick regions. This hybrid treatment restores physical energy conservation inside protostars, which would otherwise be violated under the RSLA, while retaining the advantage of large time steps. To overcome the limitation of the conventional M1 closure in solving radiative transfer in extremely optically thick regions inside protostars and across steep optical-depth gradients near their surfaces, we incorporate the optical-depth information of neighboring cells into the radiative transfer calculation. We further evolve photon number densities in addition to radiation energy densities to reconstruct an effective local spectrum on the fly without resorting to costly multi-frequency transport. We implement this scheme in the adaptive mesh refinement code SFUMATO and verify its validity through a series of test calculations. As an application, we follow the early evolution of a massive protostar formed at high redshift, within a full cosmological context. The results reveal a continuous structure connecting the swollen protostar and its surrounding disk, which cannot be captured in conventional one-dimensional models. This explicit RHD scheme opens a path to studies of protostellar evolution and its interaction with the accretion flow in realistic three-dimensional environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of sub-Eddington Circumbinary Disk in a 10:1 Massive Black Hole Binary</a><span class="id">[2510.13955]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a global three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation of a circumbinary disk (CBD) around a massive black hole binary (MBHB) with a total mass $2 \times 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ and mass ratio $0.1$, separated by $100\, GM_{\rm tot}/c^2$. The inclusion of radiation makes the disk thinner, denser, less eccentric at the inner edge, and more filamentary when compared to an otherwise identical locally isothermal MHD disk. The RMHD disk has accretion rate $\sim 0.23\,\dot{M}_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ and produces thermal emission peaking in the near-UV/optical with a luminosity of $\sim 1\, \% L_{\rm {Edd }}$. Compared with an equal-mass binary with the same total mass, the thermal emission of the CBD around the unequal-mass binary is several orders of magnitude brighter and much more variable at far-UV/soft X-rays frequencies. Similarly, we find that the light curve associated with the $0.1$ mass ratio binary exhibits dominant periodicity corresponding to 2 binary orbits, compared to the equal-mass binary that shows periodicity at 2.5-5 binary orbits. Our results highlight the importance of radiation for the structure and observational properties of MBHB circumbinary disks and have implications for detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LISA gravitational wave precursors and for the heavier binaries targeted by the Pulsar Timing Arrays.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13962" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulation budgeting for hybrid effective field theories</a><span class="id">[2510.13962]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we forecast the number of, and requirements on, N-body simulations needed to train hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) emulators for a range of use cases, using a hybrid of HMcode and perturbation theory as a surrogate model. Our accuracy goals, determined with careful consideration of statistical and systematic uncertainties, are $1\%$ accurate in the high-likelihood range of cosmological parameters, and $2\%$ accurate over a broader parameter space volume for $k&lt;1 h Mpc^{-1}$ and $z&lt;3$. Focusing in part on the 8-parameter $w_0w_a$CDM+$m_\nu$ cosmological model, we find that $&lt;225$ simulations are required to meet our error goals over our wide parameter space, including models with rapidly evolving dark energy, given our simulation and emulator recommendations. For a more restricted parameter space volume, as few as 80 simulations are sufficient. We additionally present simulation forecasts for example use cases, and make the code used in our analyses publicly available. These results offer practical guidance for efficient emulator design and simulation budgeting in future cosmological analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anatomy of the Class I protostar L1489 IRS with NOEMA - II. A disk replenished by a massive streamer</a><span class="id">[2510.14022]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>(abridged) Streamers are newly identified channels that transport mass from large, molecular-cloud scales down to small, protoplanetary-disk scales. To better understand their impact on planet formation, it is essential to study their physical and chemical properties. In this framework, we aim to characterize the longest streamer identified in carbon chain emission within the Class I system L1489 IRS, connecting the nearby prestellar core L1489 to the young stellar object (YSO). We observed multiple transitions of C$_2$H, ortho-c-C$_3$H$_2$, and HC$_3$N in L1489 IRS with NOEMA and IRAM-30m at 3mm and 2mm. Using a variety of radiative transfer methods, including a hyperfine structure (HFS) fitting, rotational diagrams, and proposing a new self-consistent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach combined with the non-LTE RADEX code, we derived the column densities and abundances of those molecules, as well as the H$_2$ number density along the streamer. This enabled us to estimate its mass, infall rate, and its impact on the {star+disk} system's mass. We found lower limits on the streamer mass of $\geq(4.67-18.3)\times10^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ (i.e., $\geq0.65-2.57$ times the current disk mass) and an infall rate of $\geq(1.94-7.57)\times10^{-7}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, where the ranges correspond to the different molecular tracers. These values are consistent with those derived in similar Class I objects. This suggests that the disk could be fully replenished by streamer material. Given its mass, the streamer is likely at the origin of the external warped disk seen in this system, as predicted by numerical simulations. Moreover, the first investigations based on the C$_2$H/c-C$_3$H$_2$ and HC$_3$N/c-C$_3$H$_2$ abundance ratios suggest that the streamer chemistry may be inherited from the core. These results suggest, for the first time, that the chemical composition of a Class I object is [...]</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conversion and Damping of Non-axisymmetric Internal Gravity Waves in Magnetized Stellar Cores</a><span class="id">[2510.14026]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetism is thought to play an important role in the evolution and dynamics of stars, though little is known about magnetic fields deep within stellar interiors. A promising avenue for probing these fields uses asteroseismic observations of global oscillations that result from the coupling of acoustic waves in the convective zone to internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the radiative interior. Recent modeling efforts implicate deep magnetic fields in the suppression of dipole mixed modes observed in 20% of red giants and a number of high-mass main sequence stars. Previous numerical and theoretical work shows that core magnetic fields could suppress axisymmetric global modes by refracting down-going IGWs into slow-magnetosonic (SM) waves that damp at magnetic cutoff heights. Here, we extend these results to the non-axisymmetric case, for which the IGWs and SM waves are coupled to a continuous spectrum of Alfven waves (AWs). We consider a Cartesian model of the radiative interior with uniform stratification and a spatially-varying, current-free magnetic field. Using a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation to solve for the vertical mode structure, corroborated with numerical simulations, we show that IGWs convert to up-going SM waves, which resonate with the Alfven spectrum and produce mixed SM-AW modes. We find cutoff heights (as in the axisymmetric case), above which the SM/SM-AWs convert to AWs. Latitudinal variations of the background magnetic field lead to phase mixing of the AWs, resulting in rapid damping. Our results suggest that energy in both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric IGWs is lost via interactions with a strong magnetic field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating Nonlinear Landau Damping in Hybrid Simulations</a><span class="id">[2510.14031]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Phenomenological studies of cosmic-ray self-confinement often hinge on the linear theory for the growth rate of the streaming instability and for the damping rate of the generated magnetic modes. Largely different expressions exist, especially for the rate of nonlinear Landau damping, which is often assumed to be the most important damping mechanism in warm ionized plasmas. Using hybrid-PIC simulations in the resonant streaming instability regime, we present a comprehensive assessment of nonlinear Landau damping and show that the damping rate at a given scale depends on the power in magnetic fields on larger scales. Furthermore, we find that an inverse cascade develops, which produces magnetic fields on scales larger than the resonant ones. Here we extend previous results obtained for a mono-energetic distribution of non-thermal particles to the case of broader CR distributions, as a first step towards developing phenomenological models. Pre-existing turbulence of Alfvénic nature at large scales severely affects the damping of waves produced by low-energy CRs; depending on its amplitude, such a turbulence may inhibit the growth of streaming instability so that CRs are either self-confined at all energies or not at all.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14037" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the impact of electromagnetic dissipation on ultra-relativistic plasma outflows</a><span class="id">[2510.14037]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-relativistic plasma outflows are intrinsically connected with gamma-ray bursts. Over the years, a large number of analytical and numerical works has been devoted to understanding the intricacies of their complex dynamics, with most of these past studies performed in the ideal MHD regime. We propose a self-similar formalism, based on the expansion of the equations of resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for the description of these outflows in the vicinity of their symmetry axis and present semi-analytical solutions describing strongly relativistic jets in both the ideal and resistive MHD regimes. Our solutions provide a clear picture of the impact of electromagnetic dissipation on the acceleration and collimation mechanisms which determine the kinetic and morphological characteristics of these relativistic outflows. The resistive MHD solutions are compared to their ideal MHD counterparts, revealing the key differences between the two regimes. Our comparative analysis sheds light on the possible role of electromagnetic dissipation in shaping the dynamics of the ultra-relativistic outflows associated with gamma-ray bursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14083" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NGTS-11 c: a transiting Neptune-mass planet interior to the warm Saturn NGTS-11 b</a><span class="id">[2510.14083]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of NGTS-11 c, a transiting warm Neptune ($P \approx 12.8$ d; $M_{p} = 1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2} M_{\mathrm{Nep}}$; $R_{p} = 1.24 \pm 0.03 R_{\mathrm{Nep}}$), in an orbit interior to the previously reported transiting warm Saturn NGTS-11 b ($P \approx 35.5$ d). We also find evidence of a third outer companion orbiting the K-dwarf NGTS-11. We first detected transits of NGTS-11 c in TESS light curves and confirmed them with follow-up transits from NGTS and many other ground-based facilities. Radial-velocity monitoring with the HARPS and FEROS spectrographs revealed the mass of NGTS-11 c and provides evidence for a long-period companion ($P &gt; 2300$ d; $M_{p} \sin i &gt; 3.6 M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$). Taking into account the two additional bodies in our expanded datasets, we find that the mass of NGTS-11 b ($M_{p} = 0.63 \pm 0.09 M_{\mathrm{Sat}}$; $R_{p} = 0.97 \pm 0.02 R_{\mathrm{Sat}}$) is lower than previously reported ($M_{p} = 1.2 \pm 0.3 M_{\mathrm{Sat}}$). Given their near-circular and compact orbits, NGTS-11 c and b are unlikely to have reached their present locations via high-eccentricity migration. Instead, they probably either formed in situ or formed farther out and then underwent disk migration. A comparison of NGTS-11 with the eight other known systems hosting multiple well-characterized warm giants shows that it is most similar to Kepler-56. Finally, we find that the commonly used 10-day boundary between hot and warm Jupiters is empirically well supported.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14089" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards field-level likelihood for projected fields: Evolved projected fields from initial projected fields</a><span class="id">[2510.14089]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The evolved cosmological matter density field is fully determined by the initial matter density field at fixed cosmological parameters. However, the two-dimensional cosmological projected matter density field, relevant for weak-lensing and photometric galaxy studies, is fully determined by the initial projected matter density field only at the linear order. At non-linear order, the entire volume of initial matter contributes. We study a model for the evolved projected density field that is deterministic in the initial projected density fields and probabilistic in the effects of the remaining modes in the initial conditions. We write down predictions for the mean evolved projected field model using Lagrangian perturbation theory. We run a suite of small N-body simulations with fixed projected initial conditions and measure the statistical properties of the ensemble of evolved projected fields. Measurements and theory are in good agreement and show that the information on the initial projected fields is exponentially suppresses on non-linear scales. Our model offers a potential approach to a field-level likelihood of projected fields.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axisymmetric hydrodynamics in numerical relativity: treating coordinate singularity, artificial heating and modeling MHD instabilities</a><span class="id">[2510.14127]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnant are a cheap alternative to 3D simulations. To maintain realism for secular timescales, simulations must avoid accumulated errors from drifts in conserved quantities and artificial heating, and they must model turbulent transport in a way that remains plausible throughout the evolution. It is also crucial to avoid numerical artifacts due to the polar coordinate axis singularity. Methods that behave well near the axis often break flux-conservative form of the hydrodynamic equations, resulting in significant drifts in conserved quantities. We present a flux-conservative scheme that maintains smoothness near the axis without sacrificing conservative formulation of the equations or incurring drifts in conserved global quantities. We compare the numerical performance of different treatments of the hydrodynamic equations when evolving a hypermassive neutron star resembling the remnant of a BNS merger. These simulations demonstrate that the new scheme combines the axis smoothness of non-conservative methods with the mass and angular momentum conservation of other conservative methods on $\sim$ $10^2$ ms timescales of viscous and neutrino-driven evolution. Because fluid profiles remain smooth in the remnant interior, it is possible to remove artificial heating by evolving the entropy density. We show how physical heating and cooling terms can be easily calculated from source terms of the conservative evolution variables and demonstrate our implementation. Finally, we discuss and implement improvements to the effective viscosity scheme to better model the effect of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities as the remnant evolves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A formation mechanism for narrow rings around minor bodies</a><span class="id">[2510.14130]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recent discovery of narrow rings around minor bodies has raised many questions regarding their origin and current dynamics. Sharp ring boundaries seem indicative of shepherding moonlets, but none have been found. All rings lie close to spin-orbit resonances (SORs) with the central body, particularly the 1/3, even though it is not clear how these may be related. Furthermore, in at least one case the location of the ring is exterior to the Roche radius, adding to the striking differences with respect to giant planets. We study the dynamical evolution of a particle disk around a minor body, perturbed by the non-spherical component of the gravity field, particle collisions, and spin changes of the central mass linked to angular momentum conservation. By varying key parameters, we search for cases where the combined effects may lead to resonance capture and orbital configurations similar to those that have been observed. We performed N-body simulations of massless particles orbiting a central spherical body with a co-rotating mass anomaly. Collisions were modeled by adopting a simple radial damping force. Angular momentum conservation links the body spin to the disk orbital evolution. Since the gravitational effect of the test particles is neglected, this back-reaction is introduced externally assuming ad hoc spin-down rates and disk mass. Interaction between non-sphericity and collisions leads to the formation of a narrow ring that slowly recedes from the central mass. Spin-down of the minor planet shifts the SORs outward, enabling resonant capture. For suitable parameters, a portion -or all- of the initial disk can become trapped in the 1/3 SOR with the mass anomaly, in dynamically stable low-eccentricity orbits. Although the required disk mass is high ($\ge 1\%$ of the central body), long-term collisional erosion could reduce it to values that are consistent with observed ringlets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 2025 Failed Outburst of IGR J17091-3624: Spectral Evolution and the Role of Ionized Absorbers</a><span class="id">[2510.14134]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>IGR J17091-3624 is the only black hole X-ray binary candidate, aside from the well-studied black hole system GRS 1915+105, observed to exhibit a wide range of structured variability patterns in its light curves. In 2025, the source underwent a “failed” outburst: it brightened in the hard state but did not transition to the soft state before returning to quiescence within a few weeks. During this period, IGR J17091-3624 was observed by multiple ground- and space-based facilities. Here, we present results from six pointed NuSTAR observations obtained during the outburst. None of the NuSTAR light curves showed the exotic variability classes typical of the soft state in this source; however, we detected, for the first time, strong dips in the count rate during one epoch, with a total duration of $\sim4\,\mathrm{ks}$ as seen by NuSTAR. Through spectral and timing analysis of all six epochs, we investigate the hard-state spectral evolution and the nature of the dips. A clear evolution of the coronal properties with luminosity is observed over all six epochs, with clear signatures of relativistic disk reflection which remain largely unchanged across the first five epochs. The first five epochs also show a strong and stable quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature in the power spectra. The dips observed in Epoch 5 are consistent with partial obscuration by ionized material with a column density $N_{\mathrm{H}} \approx 2.0 \times 10^{23}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. We discuss possible origins for this material and place constraints on the orbital parameters and distance of the system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing cosmic velocities with the pairwise kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal in DESI Bright Galaxy Sample DR1 and ACT DR6</a><span class="id">[2510.14135]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a measurement of the pairwise kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) signal using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS) Data Release 1 (DR1) galaxy sample overlapping with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) CMB temperature map. Our analysis makes use of $1.6$ million galaxies with stellar masses $\log M_\star/M_\odot &gt; 10$, and we explore measurements across a range of aperture sizes ($2.1' &lt; \theta_{\rm ap} &lt; 3.5'$) and stellar mass selections. This statistic directly probes the velocity field of the large-scale structure, a unique observable of cosmic dynamics and modified gravity. In particular, at low redshifts, this quantity is especially interesting, as deviations from General Relativity are expected to be largest. Notably, our result represents the highest-significance low-redshift ($z \sim 0.3$) detection of the kSZ pairwise effect yet. In our most optimal configuration ($\theta_{\rm ap} = 3.3'$, $\log M_\star &gt; 11$), we achieve a $5\sigma$ detection. Assuming that an estimate of the optical depth and galaxy bias of the sample exists via e.g., external observables, this measurement constrains the fundamental cosmological combination $H_0 f \sigma_8^2$. A key challenge is the degeneracy with the galaxy optical depth. We address this by combining CMB lensing, which allows us to infer the halo mass and galaxy population properties, with hydrodynamical simulation estimates of the mean optical depth, $\bar \tau$. We stress that this is a proof-of-concept analysis; with BGS DR2 data we expect to improve the statistical precision by roughly a factor of two, paving the way toward robust tests of modified gravity with kSZ-informed velocity-field measurements at low redshift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14164" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breaking gyrochronology through the collapse of coronal winds</a><span class="id">[2510.14164]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gyrochronology, a method for dating aged field stars ($\gtrsim$ a few Gyr) based on their rotation rate, has recently been shown to fail for many stars older than the sun. The explanation most often put forth is that a shutdown or mode change in the stellar dynamo leads to a sharp decrease in angular momentum loss in magnetized coronal winds. In this paper, we explore an alternate possibility, namely a collapse of the wind itself through a reduction of coronal heating. We show that in the low coronal temperature ($T_0$) limit, even at solar-like low rotation rates ($\Omega$) and coronal magnetic field strength ($B_{r0}$), magnetocentrifugal effects are important and preclude expression of the mass and angular momentum loss rates as power-laws of $T_0$ or $\Omega$ when $T_0$ drops below $\simeq 1.5\,$MK. Mass loss is found to scale linearly with power input into the wind at all coronal temperatures. Introducing an ad hoc power law relationship $T_0\propto B_{r0}^\sigma$ while retaining the “standard” dynamo relationship $B_{r0}\propto\Omega$, we show that reproducing the observed break in gyrochronology requires an exponent $\sigma\gtrsim 1.5$, with which is associated a drop by over 3 orders of magnitude in power input into the quiet corona. This appears physically unrealistic, given current observations of chromospheric and coronal non-thermal emission in aged solar-type stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation pressure and equation of state are important in the envelope unbinding process in common envelope evolution</a><span class="id">[2510.14173]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In common envelope evolution, the ultimate unbinding of the envelope during the plunge-in phase involves complex and poorly understood physical processes that may give rise to luminous red novae. In this work, we investigate the roles of radiation and gas pressures in envelope unbinding. We perform a parameter space survey using a self-consistent one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic model that is solved by {\tt Guangqi} to study the impact of key parameters on the mass unbound fraction and resulting light curves. The parameters include the radiation to gas energy ratio $\E/\eg\in[0.2,3.2]$, speed of the ejecta, ranging from 70\% to 85\% of the escape velocity, and EoS. For comparison, we also perform simulations with pure hydrodynamic or no radiation pressure conditions. Our simulations demonstrate that the radiation pressure is crucial for the envelope unbinding. Specifically, the radiation pressure may dominate in a high opacity and high luminosity layer just below the recombination front, where it can accelerate the sub-escape material to escape velocities. A realistic EoS further enhances the pressure gradient, especially during the early phase of ejection at small radii, promoting additional envelope ejection. Both $\E/\eg$ and EoS significantly alter light curve shapes, provide observable diagnostics for these processes. We show that the relative energy error of all the simulations is no more than 1.4\%, and all the simulations are close to convergence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estimation of gravitational wave from solar emerging magnetic flux tube</a><span class="id">[2510.14239]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study investigates the gravitational waves (GWs) generated by the emergence of magnetic flux tubes in the solar convection zone. We focus on the upward buoyancy of magnetic flux tubes, which leads to significant magnetic activity and the formation of active region sunspots. This study adopts parameters representative of a moderate-sized solar active region to estimate the GWs generated by the emergence of magnetic flux tubes. Our results indicate that the GW strain amplitude, achievable through signal superposition and detection at close proximity (e.g., approximately one solar radius from the solar surface), may reach $\sim$10$^{-29}$. The characteristic GW frequency is estimated at $\sim$10$^{-5}$ Hz, placing it at the high-frequency end of the sensitivity band of Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) methods. However, the estimated strain amplitudes remain orders of magnitude below the sensitivity thresholds of current and foreseeable gravitational wave detectors. Notably, reducing the cadence $\Delta t$ of Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations to approximately 2 hours ($\Delta t = 2\text{hours}$) would raise the maximum detectable frequency to about $5.8 \times 10^{-5} \text{Hz}$, thereby encompassing the dominant spectral component of solar activity-related GWs predicted in this study, offering a potential pathway for future detection. Successful detection in the future may help to predict the super solar active region emergence in space weather forecasting.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14294" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Water Snowline in Young Stellar Objects with Various Density Structures Using Radiative Transfer Models</a><span class="id">[2510.14294]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tracing the water snowline in low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) is important because dust grain growth is promoted and the chemical composition varies at the water snowline, which influences planet formation and its properties. In protostellar envelopes, the water snowline can be estimated as a function of luminosity using a relation derived from radiative transfer models, and these predictions are consistent with observations. However, accurately estimating the water snowline in protoplanetary disks requires new relations that account for the disk structure. We present the relations between luminosity and water snowline using the dust continuum radiative transfer models with various density structures. We adopt two-dimensional density structures for an envelope-only model (Model E), an envelope+disk+cavity model (Model E+D), and a protoplanetary disk model (Model PPD). The relations between the water snowline, where T_dust = 100 K, and the total luminosity, ranging 0.1-1,000 solar luminosity, are well fitted by a power-law relation, R_snow=a * (L/L_solar)^p au. The factor a decreases with increasing disk density, while the power index p has values around 0.5 in all models. As the disk becomes denser, the water snowline forms at smaller radii even at the same luminosity, since dense dust hinders photon propagation. We also explore the effect of viscous heating on the water snowline. In Model PPD with viscous heating, the water snowline shifts outward by a few au up to 15 au, increasing the factor a and decreasing the power index p. In Model E+D with lower disk mass, the effect of viscous heating is negligible, indicating that the disk mass controls the effect. The discrepancy between our models and direct observations provides insights into the recent outburst event and the presence of a disk structure in low-mass YSOs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14355" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combining spectral analysis and narrow band pass filtering to predict solar cycle parameters in the next solar grand minimum</a><span class="id">[2510.14355]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a new method for predicting sunspot number (SSN) that, based on successful back projections, can predict features of the SSN several solar cycles in advance. The method applies Fourier analysis to the annual SILSO SSN record, from 1700.5 to 2023.5, to identify in the spectrum, four strong components in the decadal, 10 to 11 year period, range and four weaker components in the octal, 8 to 9 year period, range. The time variation of each component is isolated by a new method of narrow band pass filtering. The components are fitted with sinusoids at the beginning/end of the SSN record for back/forward projection. Back projection successfully replicated the long term features of the Maunder Minimum. Forward projection predicts a Maunder-like grand minimum from 2030 to 2110, encompassing solar cycles 26 to 35. Details of short term features of SSN within the grand minimum are less certain. The octal contribution to SSN is shown to occasionally exceed the decadal contribution both in the projection and also within the observational record. Predicted SSN amplitudes for cycles 26 and 28 are about 50, about half the amplitude of cycles 24 and 25. The amplitude of cycle 27 is difficult to forecast as it may emerge as a double peak of cycle 26 rather than as two separate cycles 26 and 27. Amplitudes forecast for cycles 29 to 33 are, on average, about half the amplitude of cycles 26 and 27 with the lowest cycle of the grand minimum, cycle 30, occurring around 2070. Macro changes in SSN such as the occurrence of grand solar minima and maxima and micro changes such as the Waldmeier Effect are explained in terms of interference between the octal and decadal components evident in the SSN spectrum. The explanation differs from current theories that suggest SSN variability is due to stochastic forcing of a single solar dynamo process.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14363" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is GW231123 a hierarchical merger?</a><span class="id">[2510.14363]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The binary black hole merger GW231123 is both the most massive gravitational-wave event observed and has the highest component spins measured to date.

Its large mass and extremal spins are challenging to explain through standard binary stellar physics, though a flurry of hypothetical scenarios have been proposed. Hierarchical assembly – i.e., mergers of black holes that are themselves formed from previous generations of mergers – is generally a promising way to explain massive and rapidly spinning black holes. Here, we investigate the possibility that both GW231123 was assembled hierarchically in a dense star cluster as the merger of two second-generation black holes. Taking the inferred spin values at face value, we find that it is possible, though unlikely ($p\lesssim 1\%$), that a compact binary with both component spins like GW231123 could form in a cluster from hierarchical assembly.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for the dynamical dark energy with evolving Hubble constant</a><span class="id">[2510.14390]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hubble constant tension, together with the recent indications of dynamical dark energy proposed from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, poses significant challenges to the standard cosmological model. In this work, we perform a model-independent reconstruction of the dark-energy equation of state $w(z)$, jointly with an evolving Hubble constant $H_0(z)$. Using the DESI DR2 data combined with multiple type Ia supernova samples, we find that $w(z)$ varies with redshift and exhibits two potential phantom crossings at $z\sim0.5$ and $z\sim1.5$. Meanwhile, $H_0$ decreases continually from local to high redshift, alleviating the Hubble constant tension effectively. The joint $w(z)$-$H_0(z)$ model is strongly favored over the $w$CDM ($\Lambda$CDM) framework, with a logarithmic Bayes factor $\ln \boldsymbol{\mathcal B}= 5.04~(8.53)$. Across various prior assumptions and dataset combinations, we obtain consistent, data-driven reconstructions of both $w(z)$ and $H_0(z)$. Future BAO measurements from Euclid and next-generation CMB experiments will provide critical tests of these results and bring deeper insights into the nature of dark energy and the evolution of cosmic expansion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14464" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Built-in precision: Improving cluster cosmology through the self-calibration of a galaxy cluster sample</a><span class="id">[2510.14464]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine the potential improvements in constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ and matter density $\Omega_M$ from using clustering information along with number counts for future samples of thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich selected galaxy clusters. We quantify the relative improvement from including the clustering power spectrum information for three cluster sample sizes from 33,000 to 140,000 clusters and for three assumed priors on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable relation. As expected, clustering information has the largest impact when (i) there are more clusters and (ii) the mass-observable priors are weaker. For current knowledge of the cluster mass-observable relationship, we find the addition of clustering information reduces the uncertainty on the dark energy equation of state, $\sigma(w)$, by factors of $1.023\pm 0.007$ to $1.0790\pm 0.011$, with larger improvements observed with more clusters. Clustering information is more important for the matter density, with $\sigma(\Omega_M)$ reduced by factors of $1.068 \pm 007$ to $1.145 \pm 0.012$. The improvement in $w$ constraints from adding clustering information largely vanishes after tightening priors on the mass-observable relationship by a factor of two. For weaker priors, we find clustering information improves the determination of the cluster mass slope and redshift evolution by factors of $1.389 \pm 0.041$ and $1.340 \pm 0.039$ respectively. These findings highlight that, with the anticipated surge in cluster detections from next generation surveys, self-calibration through clustering information will provide an independent cross-check on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable relationship as well as enhancing the precision achievable from cluster cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Level Resolved Ground and Excited State Pb III, IV, V &amp; VI Photoionization Cross Sections for Heavy Metal Subdwarf Modeling</a><span class="id">[2510.14519]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High abundances of various lead (Pb) species have been identified in the spectra of many Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and O- and B-type subdwarfs (sdO/B). Additional atomic data relating to Pb, and in particular photoionization cross sections, are needed to allow a greater understanding of the origin of these observed Pb abundances, and hence discern the evolutionary pathway of these stars. We have calculated level-resolved photoionization cross sections for Pb III, IV, V and VI. Four new target structures have been developed with the General Relativistic Atomic Structure Package (GRASP0), whose corresponding energy levels, Einstein A-coefficients and oscillator strengths have been found to be in good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical sources. The photoionization cross sections calculated using the Dirac Atomic R-matrix Codes (DARC) are available in TOPBASE format, and follow the trends expected for an isonuclear series. These new Pb data sets will now allow for the modelling of Pb abundances and line opacities under Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (non-LTE) conditions. Using the helium-rich hot subdwarf EC 22536-5304 as a test case, we show that there are noticeable differences in the Pb line profiles across the ultraviolet and optical wavelength regions under LTE and non-LTE conditions. There is both depletion and enrichment of individual Pb species. This highlights the importance of applying non-LTE conditions when modelling EC 22536-5304, as well as other O/B-type stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Influence of kinetic effects in large-scale magnetic reconnection with multi-hierarchy simulation code KAMMUY</a><span class="id">[2510.14521]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic reconnection is a multiscale phenomenon where fluid- and particle-scale processes interact. The particle-in-cell (PIC) method, capable of resolving kinetic (particle-scale) physics, is extensively used to study the kinetic effects in magnetic reconnection. Meanwhile, because of the high computational cost, PIC simulations cannot capture the interaction between kinetic and fluid dynamics, which poses a major obstacle to understanding magnetic reconnection in large-scale phenomena such as solar flares. A multi-hierarchy simulation that combines Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and PIC provides a promising means to overcome these spatial and temporal scale gaps. We developed a multi-hierarchy simulation code KAMMUY (Kinetic And Magnetohydrodynamic MUlti-hierarchY simulation code), in which an ideal MHD simulation for a large domain and a PIC simulation for a smaller domain are solved in parallel with mutual information exchange. To validate the code, we conducted test simulations of MHD wave propagation and the shock tube problem. The results demonstrate that short-wavelength, high-frequency waves generated in the PIC region do not propagate into the MHD region, whereas MHD-scale structures propagate smoothly into the PIC region, highlighting the capability of our code for numerical studies of magnetic reconnection. By applying the KAMMUY code to magnetic reconnection while varying the PIC domain size, we find that the reconnection rate remains unchanged, regardless of the extent of the PIC region where the Hall magnetic field is present. It suggests that the spatial extension of the Hall magnetic field on the scale of $10 \sim 100 \lambda_i$ does not influence the reconnection rate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14524" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The bimodal distribution of donor stars in X-ray binaries</a><span class="id">[2510.14524]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The classification of X-ray binaries into high- and low-mass types has historically lacked a unified, data-driven quantitative criterion, and large-scale statistical studies of the donor star population have been limited.

We find a statistically bimodal distribution in the donor star parameters, which is characterized by a valley at approximately 3 $M_{\odot}$ or 11,000 K. We uncover the physical mechanism behind this bimodality: a previously unreported “parallel tracks” phenomenon observed in the relationship between the donor's evolutionary stage and its fundamental parameters, such as luminosity and radius. These two tracks represent distinct main-sequence populations, and the valley between them corresponds to the sparsely populated pre- and post-main-sequence evolutionary phases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting electron-capture decay for Galactic cosmic-ray data</a><span class="id">[2510.14544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Electron-capture (EC) unstable species in Galactic cosmic rays constrain the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and acceleration. They have also been advocated as tracers of reacceleration or gas inhomogeneities during their transport. The number of EC-unstable species grows with mass, with an expected EC-decay impact more important for larger atomic number and lower energy. We revisit the modelling of EC decay and its detectability in the context of recent unmodulated low-energy (Voyager) and high-precision data for heavy (AMS-02) and very-heavy nuclei (ACE-CRIS, CALET and Super-TIGER). We solve the transport equation for a multi-level configuration (up to any number of electrons attached) in the diffusion and leaky-box models. Their decayed fractions are found to be qualitatively similar but with very different absolute fluxes. We check that the standard two-level approximation, wherein the cosmic-ray nucleus is fully ionised or with one electron attached, is sufficient for most situations. We find that the impact of EC-decay is negligible in current data, except possibly for fluxes or ratios involving $^{51}$Cr, $^{55}$Fe, and Co. These conclusions are robust against significant uncertainties in the attachment and stripping cross-sections. This first analysis calls for further investigation, as several forthcoming projects (e.g., TIGERISS) are targeting $Z&gt;30$ cosmic rays.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eclipsing Stellar Flare on the Demon Star Algol Binary System Observed during the MAXI-NICER Follow-up Campaign in 2018</a><span class="id">[2510.14587]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Algol is a well-known eclipsing binary hosting an active and variable star that exhibits frequent stellar flares. Here, we report our pre-planned and coordinated rapid X-ray follow-up observations of an eclipsing flare on Algol. The Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) detected a flare on Algol at 05:52 UT on 2018 July 4. Subsequently, we carried out a prompt X-ray monitoring with the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) starting at 19:45 UT on the same day, and the observation ended at 06:02 UT on 2018 July 6. During the decaying phase of the flare, we successfully detected a 5.8-hour-long eclipse, corresponding to the secondary eclipse in which Algol A blocks the line of sight to Algol B. During the eclipse, the 2–10 keV X-ray flux is decreased to 20\% level from $1.9\times10^{-10}~ \mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1} }$ to $4.5\times10^{-11}~ \mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1} }$. We found a configuration of the flare size and location to explain the X-ray observations; e.g., the flare occurred at the latitude 45°S of the Algol B surface with a flare height of $1.9\times10^{11}~\mathrm{cm}$, corresponding to 0.8 times the stellar radius of Algol B, giving 80% obscuration of the flare loop by Algol A. The apparent absorption increase before the eclipse might originate from coronal mass ejection (CME) in the line of sight ejected during the flare.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14636" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Performance of the Prototype Station of the IceCube Surface Array Enhancement</a><span class="id">[2510.14636]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The prototype station of the Surface Array Enhancement at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has been taking data in its final design since 2023.

On March 23, 2024, the successive eruption of two magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) from the solar active region 3614 produced twin CMEs, as identified in coronagraph images. By analyzing in-situ data from Solar Orbiter and Wind, it is found that the primary ICME-driven shock overtook the preceding ICME, trapping it in the sheath between the shock and the primary ICME, forming the ICME-in-sheath (IIS) structure. Using Solar Orbiter observations, we show that both electrons and ions are accelerated within the IIS. A clear enhancement of suprathermal electrons was observed at the IIS boundary, where strong flow shear and large magnetic field variation suggest possible local electron acceleration. Electrons (&gt;38 keV) exhibit a long-lasting enhancement in the IIS with a spectral index of  2.2, similar to that in the shock sheath and the primary ICME, indicating a similar solar origin. Inside both the sheath and IIS, spectra of proton and 4He are generally consistent with the prediction of the diffusive shock acceleration, whereas Fe and O present a double power-law shape. Additionally, the Fe/O ratio in the IIS is higher than that in the sheath, and more close to the abundance of the flare-related particles, suggesting the remnant particles of flare confined in the IIS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14671" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diffusion-Free Dynamics in Rotating Spherical Shell Convection Driven By Internal Heating and Cooling</a><span class="id">[2510.14671]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The bulk properties of convection in stellar and giant planet interiors are often assumed to be independent of the molecular diffusivities, which are very small. By contrast, simulations of this process in rotating, spherical shells, which are typically driven by conductive boundary heat fluxes, generally yield results that depend on the diffusivity. This makes it challenging to extrapolate these simulation results to real objects. However, laboratory models and Cartesian-box simulations suggest diffusion-free dynamics can be obtained if convection is driven using prescribed internal heating and cooling instead of boundary fluxes. Here, we apply this methodology to simulations of Boussinesq, hydrodynamic rotating spherical shell convection. We find that this set-up unambiguously yields diffusion-free behaviour for bulk 'thermal' properties of the convection, such as the radial temperature contrast and the convective heat transport. Moreover, the transition from prograde to retrograde equatorial zonal flow is diffusion-free and only depends on the convective Rossby number. The diffusivity dependence of other bulk 'kinematic' properties is regime-dependent. In simulations that are rotationally constrained, the convective velocities, and the strength and structure of the zonal flow, are diffusion-dependent, although the zonal flow appears to approach a diffusion-free state for sufficiently high supercriticality. In simulations that are uninfluenced by rotation, or are only influenced by rotation at large scales, diffusion-free convective velocities and zonal flow amplitudes are obtained. The result that many aspects of our idealised simulations are diffusion-free has promising implications for the development of realistic stellar and giant planet convection models that can access diffusion-free regimes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for exocomets transits in Kepler light curves: Ten new transits identified</a><span class="id">[2510.14687]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Kepler mission, despite its conclusion over a decade ago, continues to offer a rich dataset for uncovering new astrophysical objects and phenomena. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive search for exocometary transit signatures within the Kepler light curves, using a machine learning approach based on a neural network trained on a library of theoretical exocomet transit light curves. By analyzing the light curves of 201,820 stars, we identified candidate events through the neural network and subjected the output to filtering and visual inspection to mitigate false positives. Our results are presented into three catalogs of increasing ambiguity. The first-tier catalog includes 17 high-confidence exocometary transit events, comprising 7 previously reported events and 10 newly identified ones, each associated with a different host star. The second-tier catalog lists 30 lower-confidence events that remain consistent with possible exocometary transits. The third-tier catalog consists of 49 more symmetric photometric events that could be either exocometary transits, exoplanet mono-transits, or false positives due to eclipsing binaries mimicking transits. Contrary to previous studies, which suggested that the cometary activity was favored by stellar youth, we find a broad age distribution among candidate host stars, including several red giants. This challenges the general idea of a decline in cometary activity with stellar age and underlines the need for further investigation into the temporal evolution of exocometary activity in planetary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expansion kinematics of young clusters.

Methods: We took spectra of &gt;600 candidate pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in several nearby young clusters (NGC 2264 N &amp; S, Collinder 95, and Collinder 359) using MMT/Hectospec. These spectra were analyzed for H{\alpha} emission and lithium absorption, features indicative of low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) still in their PMS evolution. We complemented these samples with YSOs identified via Gaia DR3 variability. In conjunction with Gaia astrometry, these data enable an analysis of cluster structure, kinematics and ages. In particular, we searched for halos of YSOs around our targets to test models of young cluster dynamical evolution. Results: For the NGC 2264 N &amp; S cluster pair we identified 354 YSOs, while for Collinder 95 and 359 we identified 130 and 7 YSOs, respectively. We calculate kinematic &quot;traceback ages&quot; for YSOs in these clusters, which we compare to isochronal ages estimated using several sets of stellar evolution models. We find for NGC 2264 N &amp; S that kinematic ages are generally smaller than their isochronal ages, which may indicate these systems remained bound for a few Myr before their current state of expansion. On the other hand, kinematic ages for Collinder 95 are often significantly larger than isochronal ages, which implies many of these YSOs did not originate from a central, dense region, leading to overestimated kinematic ages. Conclusions: We conclude that NGC 2264 N &amp; S clusters likely formed as initially bound and compact systems, but have been gradually evaporating as cluster members become unbound, forming halos of unbound YSOs surrounding the cluster cores. We conclude that Collinder 95 likely formed initially sparse and substructured and has been dispersing since gas expulsion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14748" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QFP Waves Driven by the Tuning-Fork Effect during Magnetic Reconnecion</a><span class="id">[2510.14748]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Through three-dimensional MHD simulations, we have uncovered a kind of fast coronal wave originating from both ends of a current sheet (CS) during a solar eruption. These waves are observed to appear near the top and bottom ends of the reconnection-related CS. The simulations demonstrate the presence of termination shock regions above the two ends of the CS. As the reconnection outflows escape from the vertical CS and encounter these termination shocks, they undergo partial reflection, redirecting towards the CS terminal fork walls. The identified waves propagate rapidly at a speed of approximately 1400 km/s with a period of just 2 s. Concurrently, the time-evolution of intensity within a small region of the CS terminal fork structures, exhibits a similar oscillation period of 2 s. All these evidence supports the notion that these QFP (Quasi-periodic Fast-Propagating) waves were excited by tuning fork effects within the CS system. Essentially, the rapid reconnection outflows are reflected by the terminal shocks, striking the fork walls at the CS ends. Moreover, parts of the oscillations along the tuning fork handle are transformed into thermal energy, accumulating in the CS center and elevating the temperature. This is the first time to report such QFP waves resulting from tuning fork effects within the CS during a solar eruption. These waves are anticipated to manifest closely following the propagation of CMEs and adjacent to the related post-flare loops in observations, with partial confirmation in current observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evaluating Habitability and Biosignature Detection on TOI-700 d: The Role of UV Environment and Atmospheric Pressure</a><span class="id">[2510.14776]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>M dwarfs have long been prime targets in the search for habitable exoplanets, owing to their abundance in the galaxy and the relative ease of detecting Earth-sized worlds within their narrower habitable zones. Yet, these low-mass stars can emit high-energy radiation that may gradually erode planetary atmospheres, raising concerns about long-term habitability. TOI-700, a relatively quiescent M dwarf that hosts four known planets, stands out due to its Earth-sized TOI-700 d in the star's habitable zone. Here, we assess whether a habitable environment can be sustained on TOI-700 d by analyzing different UV flux levels and atmospheric pressures. We focus on two atmospheric scenarios - one analogous to the Archean Earth and another representing a modern Earth-like environment - using a 1D photochemistry-climate model. Our results indicate that all simulated cases can maintain temperatures compatible with liquid water on the surface. However, the dominant photochemical pathways differ substantially with UV levels: under low-UV conditions, haze formation in the Archean-like atmosphere provides the main UV shielding, whereas under intensified UV, ozone production in the modern-like atmospheres can protect the surface from harmful doses. Interestingly, although haze can impede the detection of certain biosignatures, such as CH4, CO2 and O2, it also enhances the overall atmospheric signal by increasing scattering and transit depth, potentially aiding in revealing the presence of an atmosphere. These findings underscore the dual role of hazes as both a challenge for biosignature detection and a potential protection of surface habitability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar population astrophysics (SPA) with the TNG.

Evolution of phosphorus abundance, despite its astrophysical and biological significance, remains poorly understood due to a scarcity of observational data. By combining precise stellar parameters from the optical, a robust line selection and measurement method, we measure phosphorus abundances using available P I lines. Our analysis confirms a declining trend in [P/Fe] with increasing [Fe/H] around solar metallicity for clusters and Cepheids, consistent with previous studies. We also report a [P/Fe]-age relation among open clusters older than 1 Gyr, indicating a time-dependent enrichment pattern. Such pattern can be explained by the different stellar formation history of their parental gas, with more efficient stellar formation in the gas of older clusters (thus with higher phosphorus abundances). [P/Fe] shows a flat trend among cepheids and clusters younger than 1 Gyr (along with three Cepheids inside open clusters), possibly hinting at the phosphorus contribution from the previous-generation low-mass stars. Such trend suggests that the young clusters share a nearly common chemical history, with a mild increase in phosphorus production by low-mass stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new photometric ephemeris for the 2M1510 AB double brown dwarf eclipsing binary system</a><span class="id">[2510.14801]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Eclipsing brown dwarfs are important calibrators of sub-stellar evolution models used to infer the characteristics of directly imaged brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. Only two double brown dwarf eclipsing binary systems are known, among them 2MASS J15104786-2818174 (2M1510 AB), published in 2020 with a poorly constrained orbital period. Here we analyse TESS full-frame image (FFI) photometry of this faint ($T=15.9$) binary and detect a significant (${&gt;}10\sigma$) periodic signal spanning TESS Cycles 1-7, consistent with previous data. We refine the orbital period to $20.897782 \pm 0.000036$ d, reducing its present-day uncertainty from 18 h to 8 min. Our work is crucial for scheduling follow-up observations of this system for detailed study with other photometric facilities. We also find that a recent orbital solution from Doppler data is inconsistent with existing photometry. A timing offset in the Doppler data may have produced a spurious signal mimicking retrograde apsidal precession, from which the claimed circumbinary planet 2M1510 ABb was inferred. From our best attempt at correcting the data we were unable to reconcile the radial velocity data with the photometry, suggesting that the radial velocity uncertainties are underestimated, and that the circumbinary planet 2M1510 ABb may be a false positive.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14820" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring a cosmic ray inverse-Compton origin to the SZ-to-X-ray pressure deficit in the cool core cluster ZwCl 3146</a><span class="id">[2510.14820]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the possibility that inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by $\sim$GeV cosmic rays (CRs) injected by the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) in cool core (CC) clusters produces a non-negligible continuum-like X-ray signal that is easily misinterpreted as intracluster medium (ICM) thermal bremsstrahlung continuum. This is particularly relevant to the cooling flow problem–the lack of star formation relative to X-ray-inferred ICM cooling rates. Using ZwCl 3146, a relaxed CC system at $z = 0.291$, we compare pressure profiles derived via X-rays and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. While SZ measurements probe only thermal ICM electrons, additional CR-IC emission would appear to boost the X-ray-inferred pressure. Relative to unity, we measure a $\simeq30\%$ decrement in $P_{SZ}/P_X$ within 100 kpc of the ZwCl 3146 center at a statistical significance of $\simeq 3.3\sigma$, consistent with predicted deficits from CR-IC contamination in reasonable models of central AGN-driven CR injection. X-ray spectral fits of a two-component model with thermal ICM and CR-IC emission are consistent with CR-IC as the cause of this deficit. We test alternative explanations and systematics that could drive such a decrement, with the leading order systematics associated with halo triaxiality. Collectively, these systematics are unlikely to produce a $P_{SZ}/P_X$ decrement $\gtrsim10\%$. While our results establish that non-negligible CR-IC emission is plausible in ZwCl 3146, we stress that more detailed studies of larger cluster samples are required to robustly assess whether CR-IC is relevant to the cooling flow problem.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers: The influence of spin on the multi-messenger picture</a><span class="id">[2510.14850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rich phenomenology of binary neutron star mergers offers a unique opportunity to test general relativity, investigate matter at supranuclear densities, and learn more about the origin of heavy elements. As multi-messenger sources, they emit both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation across several frequency bands. The interpretation of these signals relies heavily on accurate numerical-relativity simulations that incorporate the relevant microphysical processes. Using the latest updates of the BAM code, we perform general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers with two different spin configurations. We adopt a state-of-the-art equation of state based on relativistic mean-field theory developed for dense matter in neutron star mergers. To capture both dynamical ejecta and secular outflows from magnetic and neutrino-driven winds, we evolve the systems up to $\sim 100\ \rm ms$ after the merger at considerably high resolution with a grid spacing of $\Delta x \approx 93\ \rm m$ across the neutron stars. Our results show that the non-spinning configuration undergoes a more violent merger, producing more ejecta with lower electron fraction and higher velocities, while the spinning configuration forms a larger disk due to its higher angular momentum. Although the initial magnetic field amplification within $\lesssim 10\ \rm ms$ after merger is similar in both systems, the non-spinning system reaches stronger magnetic fields and higher energies at later times. For a detailed view of the multi-messenger observables, we extract the gravitational-wave signal and compute nucleosynthesis yields, the expected kilonova and afterglow light curves from our ejecta profiles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deuterated water ice on the satellites of Saturn</a><span class="id">[2510.14859]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The deuterium to hydrogen ratio in water ice in a planetary body carries important information on the history of water processing and delivery in the protostellar nebula. For a giant planet satellite, the D/H ratio is also affected by the processes and temperatures of the circumplanetary or circumstellar environment in which the satellites formed. Here we present robust JWST spectroscopic detections of the 4.14 $\mu$m O-D stretch absorption line (analogous to the 3 $\mu$m water O-H stretch) on the mid-sized Saturnian satellites and use these detections to infer a D/H ratio on each satellite. Within the limitations of the technique, we find that all of the satellites are consistent with having a D/H ratio of about $1.5 \times$ Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW), which is about an order of magnitude higher than the value of the atmosphere of Saturn. A much higher previously reported D/H ratio for Phoebe is ruled out at the 10$\sigma$ level, and a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 2.3 $\times$ VSMOW is obtained. The elevated D/H ratios demonstrate that the solid planetesimals and pebbles that built the satellites never sublimed and re-equilibrated with the gaseous circumplanetary disk. The similarity of the D/H measurements across all satellites suggest that the D/H ratio of water ice in the vicinity of Saturn at the time of satellite formation was also approximately 1.5 $\times$ VSMOW.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astrophysical uncertainties challenge 21-cm forecasts: A primordial black hole case study</a><span class="id">[2510.14877]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 21-cm signal is a powerful probe of the early Universe's thermal history and could provide a unique avenue for constraining exotic physics. Previous studies have forecasted stringent constraints on energy injections from exotic sources that heat, excite, and ionize the background gas and thereby modify the 21-cm signal. In this work, we quantify the substantial impact that astrophysical uncertainties have on the projected sensitivity to exotic energy injection. In particular, there are significant uncertainties in the minimum star-forming dark matter halo mass, the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, whose values characterize the fiducial astrophysical model when projecting bounds. As a case study, we investigate the energy injection of accreting primordial black holes of mass $\sim 1~M_\odot-10^3~M_\odot$, also taking into account uncertainties in the accretion model. We show that, depending on the chosen fiducial model and accretion uncertainties, the sensitivity of future 21-cm data could constrain the abundance of primordial black holes to be either slightly stronger, or significantly weaker, than current limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14888" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling nonlinear scales for dynamical dark energy cosmologies with COLA</a><span class="id">[2510.14888]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Upcoming galaxy surveys will bring a wealth of information about the clustering of matter, but modeling small-scale structure beyond $\Lambda$CDM remains computationally challenging. While accurate $N$-body emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum for $\Lambda$CDM and some limited extensions, it's unfeasible to generate $N$-body simulation suites for all candidate models. Motivated by recent hints of an evolving dark energy equation of state, we assess the viability of employing the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method to generate simulation suites for the $w_0w_a$ dark energy model. We combine COLA simulations with an existing high-precision $\Lambda$CDM emulator to extend its predictions into new regions of parameter space. We assess the precision of our emulator at the level of the matter power spectrum, finding that our emulator can reproduce the nonlinear boosts from EuclidEmulator2 at less than $2\%$ error. Moreover, we perform an analysis of a simulated cosmic shear survey akin to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) first year of observations, assessing the differences in parameter constraints between our COLA-based emulator and the benchmark emulator. We find our emulator to be in excellent agreement with the benchmark, achieving less than $0.3\sigma$ shifts in cosmological parameters. We compare our emulator's performance to a commonly used approach: assuming the $\Lambda$CDM boost can be employed for extended parameter spaces without modification. We find that our emulator yields a significantly smaller $\Delta\chi^2$ distribution, parameter constraint biases, and a more accurate figure of merit compared to this second approach. Our results demonstrate that COLA emulators provide a computationally efficient path forward for modeling nonlinear structure in extended cosmologies, offering a practical alternative to full $N$-body suites.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14927" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIRPS and TESS reveal a peculiar system around the M dwarf TOI-756: A transiting sub-Neptune and a cold eccentric giant</a><span class="id">[2510.14927]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Near InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS) joined HARPS on the 3.6-m ESO telescope at La Silla Observatory in April 2023, dedicating part of its Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program to the radial velocity follow-up of TESS planet candidates to confirm and characterize transiting planets around M dwarfs. We report the first results of this program with the characterization of the TOI-756 system, which consists of TOI-756 b, a transiting sub-Neptune candidate detected by TESS, as well as TOI-756 c, an additional non-transiting planet discovered by NIRPS and HARPS. TOI-756 b is a 1.24-day period sub-Neptune with a radius of 2.81 $\pm$ 0.10 $R_\oplus$ and a mass of 9.8$^{+1.8}_{-1.6}$ $M_\oplus$. TOI-756 c is a cold eccentric (e$_c$ = 0.45 $\pm$ 0.01) giant planet orbiting with a period of 149.6 days around its star with a minimum mass of 4.05 $\pm$ 0.11 $M_\mathrm{jup}$. Additionally, a linear trend of 146$~\mathrm{m\,s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ is visible in the radial velocities, hinting at a third component, possibly in the planetary or brown dwarf regime. This system is unique in the exoplanet landscape, standing as the first confirmed example of such a planetary architecture around an M dwarf. With a density of 2.42 $\pm$ 0.49 g cm$^{-3}$, the inner planet, TOI-756 b, is a volatile-rich sub-Neptune. Assuming a pure H/He envelope, we inferred an atmospheric mass fraction of 0.023 and a core mass fraction of 0.27, which is well constrained by stellar refractory abundances derived from NIRPS spectra. It falls within the still poorly explored radius cliff and at the lower boundary of the Neptune desert, making it a prime target for a future atmospheric characterization with JWST to improve our understanding of this population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14941" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-Minimally Coupled Quintessence in Light of DESI</a><span class="id">[2510.14941]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze a model of quintessence governed by an exponential potential and non-minimally coupled to gravity, in light of recent datasets, including cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and supernovae distance moduli observations.

These constraints rely on the resonant transfer of a substantial portion of the dark photon energy density into the SM plasma, heating the plasma in the process. We demonstrate that this resonant transfer saturates because of plasma nonlinearities. Dark photon dark matter resonantly converts into $k \simeq 0$ Langmuir waves in the early universe electron-ion plasma. Once the Langmuir-wave energy approaches the thermal energy of the plasma, nonlinear effects driven by the ponderomotive force become significant. In particular, we show using dedicated Particle-in-Cell simulations that large-amplitude $k = 0$ Langmuir waves excite higher-k Langmuir and ion acoustic waves, producing strong spatial variations in density and plasma frequency. These inhomogeneities suppress further resonant conversion, limiting the deposited energy to about the thermal energy of the electrons at the time of conversion, orders of magnitude below observable cosmological thresholds. Consequently, the dark photon dark matter constraints are weaker by factors of $3000$ to $10^7$ across ten orders of magnitude in dark photon mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum Damping of Cosmological Shear: A New Prediction from Loop Quantum Cosmologies</a><span class="id">[2510.14021]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the dynamics of the Bianchi I universe in modified loop quantum cosmology (Model I, or mLQC-I), uncovering a robust mechanism for isotropization.

In particular, during the preliminary design phase of space missions, the combinatorial complexity of MGA sequencing is very large, and current optimization approaches require extensive experience and can take many days to simulate. Therefore, a novel optimization approach is developed here – called the Recursive Target Body Approach (RTBA) – that uses the hodographic-shaping low-thrust trajectory representation together with a unique combination of tree-search methods to automate the optimization of MGA sequences. The approach gradually constructs the optimal MGA sequence by recursively evaluating the optimality of subsequent gravity-assist targets. Another significant contribution to the novelty of this work is the use of parallelization in an original way involving the Generalized Island Model (GIM) that enables the use of new figures of merit to further increase the robustness and accelerate the convergence. An Earth-Jupiter transfer with a maximum of three gravity assists is considered as a reference problem. The RTBA takes 21.5 hours to find an EMJ transfer with 15.4 km/s $\Delta V$ to be the optimum. Extensive tuning improved the quality of the MGA trajectories substantially, and as a result a robust low-thrust trajectory optimization could be ensured. A distinct group of highly fit MGA sequences is consistently found that can be passed on to a higher-fidelity method. In conclusion, the RTBA can automatically and reliably be used for the preliminary optimization of low-thrust MGA trajectories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A unified model of dark energy and inflation from the Markov-Mukhanov action</a><span class="id">[2510.14416]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a unified model of dark energy and inflation through the Markov-Mukhanov modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action, where the matter sector is coupled to gravity via a scalar coupling function depending only on the energy density of the matter content.

We establish the usefulness of variances in ${\rm DM}$ using toy models of reionization and later verify it with the realistic reionization simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02847" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exomoons of Circumbinary Planets</a><span class="id">[2412.02847]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Confirmation of the first exomoon remains elusive. Although several exomoon candidates exist around single stars, there are currently no candidates around circumbinary planets (CBPs). Most circumbinary planets are thought to form far from the host binary and migrate through the protoplanetary disc. Therefore, an exomoon of a CBP represents a fascinating yet complex and evolving four-body system. Their existence (or absence) would shed light on the robustness of moon formation and evolution in dynamically active planetary systems. In this work, we simulate the orbital evolutions of exomoons around migrating CBPs. We show that for fully migrated CBPs, a moon is capable of surviving the migration if it is formed within $\sim5-10\%$ of the planet's Hill Radius, well within the currently proposed range at which moons are thought to settle in the planetary disc for giant planets. Even though all known CBPs are gas giants, 18\% of the surviving moons in our sample are within the habitable zone, giving credence to circumbinary habitability, albeit hosted by moons rather than planets. $38\%$ of moons escape their host planet early in the migration and become long-period CBPs (i.e a multi-planet circumbinary system). Nearly one-third of exomoons collide with their host planet, and $1\%$ are ejected from the system entirely. This last class presents another pathway for producing free-floating planetary mass objects, like those discovered recently and expected from the Roman microlensing survey.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02096" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effects of Galaxy Cluster Structure on Lensed Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2501.02096]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strong gravitational lenses come in many forms, but are typically divided into two populations: galaxies, and groups and clusters of galaxies. The largest objects in the Universe (i.e. galaxy clusters) are highly irregular and composed of many components due to a history of (or active) hierarchical mergers. In this work, we analyze the discrepancies in the observables of strongly lensed gravitational wave transients in both scenarios, namely relative magnifications, time delays, and image multiplicities. We compare the detection rates between the single spherical dark matter halo models found in the literature, and publicly available state-of-the-art cluster lens models. We find there to be approximately an order of magnitude fewer detection of strongly lensed transients in the realistic model case, likely caused by their loss of overall strong lensing optical depth. We also report detection rates in the weak lensing or single-image regime. Additionally, we find a systemic shift towards lower time delays between the brightest image pairs in the cases of the realistic models, as well as higher fractions of positive versus negative parity images, which was previously reported in the literature. This deviation in the joint relative magnification factor-time delay distribution will hinder the feasibility of the reconstruction of cluster-scale lenses through gravitational wave transients alone, but can still provide a lower limit on the lens mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interpreting the HI 21-cm cosmology maps through Largest Cluster Statistics.

The LCS can, in principle, constrain the reionization model and history by quantifying the morphology of neutral hydrogen (\HI) distribution during the different stages of the EoR. Specifically, the percolation transition of ionized regions, quantified and constrained via LCS, provides a crucial insight about the underlying reionization model. The previous LCS analysis of EoR 21 cm maps demonstrates that the convolution of the synthesized beam of the radio interferometric arrays, e.g. SKA1-Low with the target signal, shifts the apparent percolation transition of ionized regions towards the lower redshifts. In this study, we present an optimal thresholding strategy to reduce this bias in the recovered percolation transition. We assess the robustness of LCS analysis of the 21 cm maps, considering the effects of antenna-based gain calibration errors and instrumental noise for SKA1-Low. This analysis is performed using synthetic observations simulated by the \textsc{21cmE2E} pipeline, considering SKA1-Low AA4 configuration within a radius of 2 km from the array centre. Our findings suggest that a minimum of $2000$ hours of observation (SNR $\gtrapprox 3$) are required for the LCS analysis to credibly suppress the confusion introduced by thermal noise. Further, we also demonstrate that for a maximum antenna-based calibration error tolerance of $\sim 0.02\%$ (post calibration), the reionization history can be recovered in a robust and relatively unbiased manner using the LCS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-copy Axion Transfer Function and Observational Implications of Effective de Broglie Scales</a><span class="id">[2503.12019]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-light axions are well-motivated dark matter candidates predicted by the String Axiverse, offering potential solutions to the small-scale challenges faced by conventional heavy particle CDM. In this work, we explore the generic multi-axion scenario motivated in the String Axiverse context and investigate its astronomical implications in both the linear and nonlinear regimes. In the linear regime, we provide a simplified prescription for multi-copy axion transfer functions, and introduce the notion of effective mass ($m_{eff}^{-2}=\sum_i w_i m_i^{-2}$ with $\{ w_i\}$ being fractional contributions of different copies to cosmic matter density) that governs the suppression to Large Scale Structure (LSS), including the turnover scale of the galaxy luminosity function (LF). On galactic scales, individual copies decouple from the collective behavior seen for LSS, leading to different galaxy groups each dominated by different copies (Pozo et al. 2025). This explains the preference for $\sim 10^{-22}$eV axions from local, galactic scale observation despite stringent mass constraints set by existing UV LF turnover searches. In the non-linear regime within galaxy halos, we show that similar notion of effective masses or de Broglie scales govern the collective wave interference, influencing the net stellar heating rates and the substructure-induced spread of JWST transients near critical curves. Distinctive to the multi-copy scenario, the effective mass within galaxy halos is generically anticipated to be radially decreasing following the stronger concentration of heavier copies to the galactic center. Such a spatial variation leads to radially increasing spreading scales for micro-lensed transients at different radial positions, a signature that may be tested with future JWST lensing observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray Polarimetry in the Low Statistics Regime using the Bayesian Approach Reveals Polarization Angle Variations</a><span class="id">[2504.04775]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray polarimetry of accreting compact objects has revealed fast time variations in the polarization angle (PA), suggesting that the geometry and/or optical depth of the Comptonization region is changing rapidly. This prompts investigations into how fast such variability can be. Conventionally, the data are often binned to examine the time variability such that the measurement in each bin is above the minimum detectable polarization (MDP). Here we demonstrate that this is unnecessary, and even below the MDP, one can infer the posterior distribution of PA reliably using the Bayesian approach and still be able to place useful constraints on the physics in many cases, due to small relative uncertainties on PA (e.g., $\Delta$PA $\approx$ 10–30$^\circ$ compared with a dynamical range of 180$^\circ$). With this approach, we discovered that the PA variation in one of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of GX 13+1 is not following a linear rotation mode as suggested previously. Instead, the PA swings between two discrete angles, suggesting that there are two emitting components, e.g., the boundary layer and the spreading layer, competing with each other. In XTE J1701-462, we confirmed previous results for a variable PA in the normal branch, and furthermore, revealed that the variation timescale could be as short as 1.5 hours. During the IXPE observation of Sco X-1, a hint is found for the PA in the highest flux level to be different from the average but consistent with previous measurement results with PolarLight and OSO-8.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmology Constraints from Type Ia Supernova Simulations of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Strategy Recommended by the High Latitude Time Domain Survey Definition Committee</a><span class="id">[2506.04402]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Within the next few years, the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will be gathering data for the High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS) that will be used to significantly improve the Type Ia supernova measurement of the dark energy equation of state parameters w0 and wa.

We demonstrate for the first time that the inhomogeneous fast flavor instability is disrupted by many-body correlations using a novel tensor network framework that allows a continuous transition between mean-field and many-body results by tuning the singular value decomposition cutoff value. Generalizing the forward-scattering Hamiltonian to spatially varying conditions, we demonstrate that the timescale of flavor transformation scales logarithmically with system size, suggesting that many-body effects could occur before mean-field instabilities are able to saturate.

High synchrotron-peaked blazars (HSPs) and extreme high synchrotron-peaked blazars (EHSPs), with synchrotron peaks exceeding $10^{15}$ Hz and $10^{17}$ Hz, respectively, are crucial for understanding the full range of blazar phenomena and testing models of jet physics. Yet, their understanding remains challenging. This work aims to systematically identify and characterize the most extreme $\gamma$-ray blazars using data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The focus is on spectral hardening, where the $\gamma$-ray spectrum becomes harder at higher energies, particularly during flaring episodes. This represents the first dedicated analysis of spectral hardening across a population of EHSPs, as previous studies explored it only in individual sources. We analyze 138 blazars selected from the 4FGL-DR2 catalog with high synchrotron peak frequencies and well-sampled light curves. Flaring periods are automatically identified, and each flare is analyzed, with the significance of spectral hardening assessed through a test statistic based on the likelihood ratio of two spectral models. We identify two flaring episodes with indications of spectral hardening, in 4FGL J0238.4$-$3116 and PKS 2155$-$304, the latter detected independently by both methods but referring to the same period. These events are consistent with expectations from statistical fluctuations, suggesting that spectral hardening is a rare occurrence (&lt; 0.1 %). These results constrain its frequency and support a smoothly varying power-law blazar emission model, motivating future multi-wavelength studies to clarify whether these rare flares reflect distinct physical processes within blazar jets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Does DESI DR2 challenge $Λ$CDM paradigm ?</a><span class="id">[2507.21607]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although debate on DESI DR1 systematics remains, DESI DR2 is consistent with DR1 and strengthens its trends. In our analysis, the LRG1 point at $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.510$ and the LRG3+ELG1 point at $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.934$ are in tension with the $\Lambda$CDM-anchored $\Omega_m$ inferred from Planck and SNe Ia (Pantheon$^{+}$, Union3, DES-SN5YR): for LRG1 the tensions are $2.42\sigma$, $1.91\sigma$, $2.19\sigma$, and $2.99\sigma$; for LRG3+ELG1 they are $2.60\sigma$, $2.24\sigma$, $2.51\sigma$, and $2.96\sigma$. Across redshift bins DR2 shows improved agreement relative to DR1, with the $\Omega_m$ tension dropping from $2.20\sigma$ to $1.84\sigma$. Nevertheless, DR2 alone is not decisive against $\Lambda$CDM, and the apparent deviation is driven mainly by LRG1 and LRG2. In a $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM fit using all tracers we find a posterior mean with $w_0&gt;-1$, consistent with dynamical dark energy and nominally challenging $\Lambda$CDM. Removing LRG1 and/or LRG2 restores $\Lambda$CDM concordance ($\omega_0\to-1$); moreover, $\omega_0^{\mathrm{(LRG2)}}&gt;w_0^{\mathrm{(LRG1)}}$, indicating that LRG2 drives the trend more strongly. Model selection via the natural-log Bayes factor $\ln\mathrm{BF}\equiv\ln(Z_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}/Z_{\omega_0\omega_a\mathrm{CDM}})$ yields weak evidence for $\Lambda$CDM when LRG1, LRG2, or both are removed, and is inconclusive for the full sample. Hence the data do not require the extra $\omega_a$ freedom, and the apparent $\omega_0&gt;-1$ preference should be interpreted cautiously as a reflection of the $\omega_0$$\omega_a$ degeneracy with limited per-tracer information.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Panchromatic View of Late-time Shock Power in the Type II Supernova 2023ixf</a><span class="id">[2508.11747]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present multi-wavelength observations of the type II supernova (SN II) 2023ixf during its first two years of evolution. We combine ground-based optical/NIR spectroscopy with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) far- and near-ultraviolet spectroscopy and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy to create spectral energy distributions of SN 2023ixf at +374 and +620 days post-explosion, covering a wavelength range of  0.1-30 $\mu$m. The multi-band light curve of SN 2023ixf follows a standard radioactive decay decline rate after the plateau until  500 days, at which point shock powered emission from ongoing interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) begins to dominate. This evolution is temporally consistent with 0.3-10 keV X-ray detections of SN 2023ixf and broad ”boxy” spectral line emission from reprocessing of shock luminosity in a cold dense shell located between forward and reverse shocks. Using the expected absorbed radioactive decay power and the detected X-ray luminosity, we quantify the total shock powered emission at the +374 and +620 day epochs and find that it can be explained by nearly complete thermalization of the reverse shock luminosity as SN 2023ixf interacts with a continuous, ”wind-like” CSM with a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot M \approx 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w = 20 \pm 5$ km/s). Additionally, we construct multi-epoch spectral models from the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN, which contain radioactive decay and shock powers, as well as dust absorption, scattering, and emission. We find that models with shock powers of $L_{sh} = (0.5-1) \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $(0.5 - 1) \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ of silicate dust in the cold dense shell and/or inner SN ejecta can effectively reproduce the global properties of the late-time (&gt;300 days) UV-to-IR spectra of SN 2023ixf.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Role of symmetry energy at subnuclear densities in protoneutron star crusts</a><span class="id">[2508.16120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The impact of matter properties at subnuclear densities on the evolution of protoneutron stars is investigated. Several models of nuclear equation of state (EOS) are constructed with varying saturation parameters, particularly the symmetry energy $S_0$ and its density slope $L$. Using the Thomas–Fermi approximation, the mass and proton numbers of heavy nuclei at subnuclear densities are systematically evaluated, along with their dependence on the EOS. Cooling simulations of protoneutron stars reveal that EOSs with smaller $L$ values lead to a longer cooling timescale and higher average neutrino energies. This behavior is attributed to the enhanced neutrino scattering caused by larger mass numbers, which increases the thermal insulation. Furthermore, the crystallization temperature, marking the onset of crust formation, is found to be higher for EOSs with smaller values of $L$. This is due to the enhanced Coulomb energy associated with larger proton numbers. As a result, despite slower cooling, crust formation occurs earlier for smaller-$L$ EOSs. These findings indicate that the timing of crust formation is sensitive to the EOS and highlight the importance of late-time neutrino observations as probes of the matter properties at subnuclear densities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Attributing the supernova remnant RCW 89 to the jittering jets explosion mechanism</a><span class="id">[2509.04723]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I examine recent radio observations of the supernova remnant (SNR) RCW 89 and identify a point-symmetric morphology composed of two main symmetry axes. I attribute this morphology to a jet-driven explosion in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). To reach this conclusion, I argue that the MSH 15-52 nebula associated with the pulsar PSR B1509-58, the X-ray hand-like-shaped nebula, and RCW 89 are two separate core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants that interact with each other. Namely, the nebula SNR G320.4-1.2 contains two CCSN remnants. In essence, I utilize the recent successes of the JJEM to account for the morphologies of point-symmetric CCSN remnants, thereby explaining the morphology of RCW 89 and identifying it as a separate CCSN remnant. I suggest a process by which somewhat more energetic pairs of jets in the JJEM have a positive feedback on the accreted gas onto the newly born neutron star, thereby prolonging the life of the jets and explaining the occurrence of two or three energetic pairs of jets in some CCSNe. This study adds RCW 89 to the growing list of point-symmetric CCSN remnants. The JJEM naturally explains these morphologies as shaped by misaligned pairs of jets that exploded these CCSNe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantifying the Effects of Parameters in Widespread SEP Events with EPREM</a><span class="id">[2509.16401]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Model (EPREM) solves the focused transport equation (FTE) on a Lagrangian grid in a frame co-moving with the solar wind plasma and simulates the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the heliosphere. When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located $\geq 90^\circ$ from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Excursion Set Approach to Primordial Black Holes: Cloud-in-Cloud and Mass Function Revisited</a><span class="id">[2509.25871]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The abundance and mass function of primordial black holes (PBHs) are often estimated using the Press-Schechter (PS) formalism. In the case of halo formation, the PS formalism suffers from the miscounting of regions collapsing into halos, known as the cloud-in-cloud problem, which is usually corrected by introducing a multiplicative `fudge factor 2'. By analogy, this factor has sometimes been applied to PBH calculations, although its validity has remained unsettled. We reformulate the PS approach for PBHs (forming during radiation-dominated epoch) within the excursion-set framework, where the smoothed density contrast undergoes a stochastic random walk as the smoothing scale varies and collapse is identified with the first threshold crossing. While the halo case is described by a Markovian process, we show that the PBH case is non-Markovian, even when the sharp-k filter Window function is adopted. Decomposing the total collapse probability into two distinct components of the stochastic motion, we numerically confirm that their contributions are exactly equal in the case of halo formation, justifying the fudge factor. For PBHs, however, we demonstrate that this equality no longer holds, and consistent inclusion of both contributions is essential to ensure a positive-definite mass function. Our results clarify the origin of the ambiguity surrounding the fudge factor and establish a robust theoretical foundation for PBH abundance calculations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A revision of the lifetime of submoons: tidal dynamics with the Euler-Lagrange equation</a><span class="id">[2510.10344]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Submoons, moons orbiting other moons, may be exotic environments capable of hosting extraterrestrial life. We extend previous studies to revise the maximum lifetime of these objects due to planetary, lunar and sublunar tidal migration. Using the Euler-Lagrange equation with a tidal dissipation process as specified by the Constant Geometric Lag model, we derive and solve the governing equations numerically to map the semi-major axis parameter space for star-planet-moon-submoon systems in which the submoon could be massive enough to host life. We find that Earth could have hosted asteroid-sized submoons ($\sim10^{15}\mathrm{kg}$), whereas a submoon near the previously proposed upper limit ($\sim4.6\cdot10^{17}\mathrm{kg}$) would have driven the Moon $\sim30\%$ farther from Earth than its current orbit. A Warm Jupiter system like Kepler1625 has greater potential of hosting a massive submoon. We found that a submoon of around $10\%M_{\text{Luna}}$ could survive if Kepler1625b's hypothesized moon were $68\%$ farther away then what the best-fit model suggests ($67R_{\mathrm{p}}$ instead of $40R_{\mathrm{p}}$). Giant submoons of mass $1.8M_{\oplus}$ are stable in a Kepler1625-like system. In these cases, the moon orbit is wide ($&gt; 100R_{\mathrm{p}}$). Decreasing the submoon mass to a habitability prerequisite of $0.5M_{\oplus}$, likely needed for a stable atmosphere and plate tectonics, leads to a smaller total number of stable iterations relative to the $m_{sm}=1.8M_{\oplus}$ case. In fact, we identified a minimum number of stable iterations on intermediate submoon mass-scales of around $0.1M_{\oplus}$. This is likely due to an interplay between small tidal forces at small submoon masses and small Roche-Limits at very high submoon masses. If submoon formation pathways in Warm Jupiter systems prefer such intermediate mass-scales, habitable submoons could be a rare phenomenon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On The Orbital Evolution of Multiple Wide Super-Jupiters: How Disk Migration and Dispersal Shape the Stability of The PDS 70 System</a><span class="id">[2510.11021]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Direct imaging has revealed exoplanet systems hosting multiple wide-orbit Super-Jupiters, where planet-planet interactions can shape their long-term dynamical evolution. These strong perturbations may lead to orbital instability, raising questions about the long-term survival of such systems. Shortly after formation, planet-disk interactions can shepherd planets into mean-motion resonances, which may promote long-term stability as seen in HR 8799. However, early-stage processes such as disk photoevaporation and viscosity can influence these outcomes. The $\sim$5 Myr-old PDS 70 system offers a unique laboratory to investigate these processes: its two massive ($&gt;$4 $M_{Jup}$), wide-orbit ($&gt;$20 AU) giants are still embedded in their natal disk. We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations of the system, allowing the disk to disperse via photoevaporation. Once the disk dissipates, we continue to track the planets' orbital evolution over Gyr timescales using N-body simulations. We find that the system is likely to remain stable for $&gt;$ 1 Gyr. To assess the importance of disk-driven evolution, we compare these results with disk-free N-body simulations using orbital parameters constrained by orbit fits that include recent relative astrometry and radial velocities from the literature. In this case, we find that only $\lesssim 4\%$ of posterior is stable for 100 Myr, highlighting the importance of considering disk-driven evolution for long-term dynamics stability of exoplanetary systems. We also simulate two three-planet configurations including the proposed inner candidate &quot;PDS 70 d&quot;, finding that a higher photoevaporation leads the system to become unstable in $&lt;$ 10 Myr.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tycho supernova exploded inside a planetary nebula (SNIP)</a><span class="id">[2510.12674]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I examine recent observations of the type Ia supernova remnant (SNR Ia) Tycho and conclude that Tycho is an SN Ia inside a planetary nebula (SNIP), strengthening such a previous suggestion from 1985. The observations reveal two opposite protrusions, termed ears, projected on the main shell of Tycho. The pair of ear structures resembles that of the SNRs Ia Kepler, SNR G299-2.9, and SNR G1.9+0.3, which earlier studies considered as SNIPs. The requirement that the explosion occurs within hundreds of thousands of years after the formation of the planetary nebula (by the second star to evolve) makes the core-degenerate scenario the most likely for Tycho. Several other possible scenarios lead to an SNIP, but they are unlikely for Tycho. The identification of Tycho as an SNIP leads to two general conclusions. (1) The fraction of SNIPs among normal SNe Ia is very large,  70-90%. Namely, the vast majority of normal SNe Ia are SNIPs. (2) To accommodate the large fraction of SNIPs, the delay time distribution of normal SNe Ia includes not only the stellar evolution timescale (as usually assumed), but also includes pockets of younger stellar populations in galaxies without ongoing star formation; the SNIPs come from the younger stellar populations in galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the connection between compact object mergers and fast X-ray transients: The cases of LXT 240402A &amp; EP250207b</a><span class="id">[2510.13015]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The connection between compact object mergers and some extragalactic fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) has long been hypothesized, but never ultimately established.

We find that both FXRTs remain compatible with a compact binary merger progenitor, which produced low-mass ejecta and kilonova emission subdominant to the afterglow. However, alternative explanations such as a distant ($z\!\gtrsim\!1$) core-collapse supernova cannot be conclusively ruled out.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamics and Observational Signatures of Core-Collapse Supernovae with Central Engines: Hydrodynamics Simulations with Monte Carlo Post-Processing</a><span class="id">[2510.13741]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A long-lived central engine embedded in expanding supernova ejecta can alter the dynamics and observational signatures of the event, producing an unusually luminous, energetic, and/or rapidly-evolving transient. We use two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations to study the effect of a central energy source, varying the amount, rate, and isotropy of the energy deposition. We post-process the results with a time-dependent Monte Carlo radiation transport code to extract observational signatures. The engine excavates a bubble at the centre of the ejecta, which becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. Sufficiently powerful engines are able to break through the edge of the bubble and accelerate, shred, and compositionally mix the entire ejecta. The breakout of the engine-driven wind occurs at distinct rupture points, and the outflowing high-velocity gas may eventually give rise to radio emission. The dynamical impact of the engine leads to faster rising optical light curves, with photon escape facilitated by the faster expansion of the ejecta and the opening of low-density channels. For models with strong engines, the spectra are initially hot and featureless, but later evolve to resemble those of broad-line Ic supernovae. Under certain conditions, line emission from ionized, low-velocity material near the centre of the ejecta may be able to escape and produce narrow emission similar to that seen in interacting supernovae. We discuss how variability in the engine energy reservoir and injection rate could give rise to a heterogeneous set of events spanning multiple observational classes, including the fast blue optical transients, broad-line Ic supernovae, and superluminous supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flavor solitons in dense neutrino gases</a><span class="id">[2303.12143]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider a dense neutrino gas in the &quot;fast-flavor limit&quot; (vanishing neutrino masses). For the first time, we identify exact solutions of the nonlinear wave equation in the form of solitons. They can propagate with both sub- or superluminal speed, the latter not violating causality. The soliton with infinite speed is a homogeneous solution and coincides with the usual fast-flavor pendulum except that it swings only once instead of being periodic. The subluminal soliton in the static limit corresponds to a one-swing &quot;spatial pendulum&quot;. A necessary condition for such solutions to exist is a “crossed” neutrino angle distribution. Based on the Nyquist criterion, we derive a new sufficient condition without solving the dispersion relation. The solitons are very fragile: they are as unstable as the homogeneous neutrino gas alone. Moreover, in the presence of matter, only the solution survives that is homogeneous in a frame comoving with the matter current. Generally, the matter effect cannot be eliminated by transformations in flavor space, but instead has a real physical impact.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From kinetic gases to an exponentially expanding universe - The Finsler-Friedmann equation</a><span class="id">[2504.08062]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the gravitational field of a kinetic gas beyond its usual derivation from the second moment of the one-particle distribution function (1PDF), that serves as energy-momentum tensor in the Einstein equations. This standard procedure raises the question why the other moments of the 1PDF (which are needed to fully characterize the kinematical properties of the gas) do not contribute to the gravitational field and what could be their relevance in addressing the dark energy problem? Using the canonical coupling of the entire 1PDF to Finsler spacetime geometry via the Finsler gravity equation, we show that these higher moments contribute non-trivially. A Finslerian geometric description of our universe allows us to determine not only the scale factor but also of the causal structure dynamically. We find that already a Finslerian vacuum solution naturally permits an exponential expanding universe, without the need for a cosmological constant or any additional quantities. This solution possesses a causal structure which is a mild deformation of the causal structure of Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry; close to the rest frame defined by cosmological time (i.e., for slowly moving objects), the causal structures of the two geometries are nearly indistinguishable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospects of detecting cosmic ray up-scattered dark matter with DUNE</a><span class="id">[2504.16996]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detection of sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles in direct detection experiments is inherently difficult, as their low kinetic energies in the galactic halo are insufficient to produce observable recoils of the heavy nuclei in the detectors. On the other hand, whenever DM particles interact with nucleons, they can be accelerated by scattering with galactic cosmic rays. These cosmic-ray-boosted DM particles can then interact not only through coherent elastic scattering with nuclei, but also through scattering with individual nucleons in the detectors and produce outgoing particles at MeV to GeV kinetic energies. The resulting signal spectrum overlaps with the detection capabilities of modern neutrino experiments. One future experiment is the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Sanford Underground Research Facility. Our study shows that DUNE has a unique ability to search for cosmic-ray boosted DM with sensitivity comparable to dedicated direct detection experiments in the case of spin-independent interactions. Importantly, DUNE's sensitivity reaches similar values of DM-nucleon cross sections also in the case of spin-dependent interactions, offering a key advantage over traditional direct detection experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07951" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological scalar perturbations for a metric reconstructed from group field theory</a><span class="id">[2505.07951]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While homogeneous cosmologies have long been studied in the group field theory (GFT) approach to quantum gravity, including a quantum description of cosmological perturbations is highly non-trivial. Here we apply a recent proposal for reconstructing an effective spacetime metric in GFT to the case of a metric with small inhomogeneities over a homogeneous background. We detail the procedure and give general expressions for cosmological scalar perturbations defined in terms of the GFT energy-momentum tensor. These include all the scalar components of standard perturbation theory and hence can be used to define gauge-invariant quantities. This is a major advantage of the effective metric approach compared to previous GFT studies limited to volume perturbations. We compute these perturbations explicitly for a particular Fock coherent state. While it was previously shown that such a state can be interpreted as an approximately flat homogeneous cosmology at late times, here we find that, in a very simple example, inhomogeneities do not follow the dynamics of general relativity in the semiclassical regime. More specifically, restricting ourselves to a specific coherent state in a simple (free) GFT, we study two types of perturbative GFT modes, squeezed and oscillating modes. For squeezed modes we find perturbation equations with Euclidean signature and a late-time limit that differs from general relativistic perturbation equations. Oscillating modes satisfy different dynamical equations that also differ from those of general relativity, but show a Lorentzian signature. Considering that our results were obtained within a number of simplifying assumptions [...], we discuss how going beyond these assumptions could lead to a more desirable phenomenology. Overall, our analysis should be understood as a first step in understanding cosmological perturbations within the effective GFT metric.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of $Ξ$-Hypernuclear Constraints on Relativistic Equation of State and Properties of Hyperon Stars</a><span class="id">[2506.16871]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Significant uncertainties persist in describing the equation of state and internal structure of hyperon stars due to the limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying hyperon interactions. Constraining the interaction parameter space through a combination of the latest astronomical observations and hypernuclear physics experiments is therefore essential. In this study, we incorporate experimental constraints from $\Xi$ hypernuclear physics on top of $\Lambda$ hyperons considered in \citet{Sun2023APJ942.55}. Specifically, based on updated measurements of hyperon separation energies from $\Xi$ hypernuclear experiments, sets of $\Xi N$ effective interactions are constructed and a linear correlation between their scalar ($\sigma$) and vector ($\omega$) coupling strength ratios is proposed as a constraint derived from $\Xi$ hypernuclear physics. Together with experimental correlations and astronomical observational data, four types of analyses are performed to constrain hyperon-nucleon interactions and the properties of hyperon stars. Compared to the vector $\omega$ meson-hyperon coupling, the introduction of linear correlations in hypernuclear physics imposes a more substantial constraint on the scalar $\sigma$ meson-hyperon coupling, significantly enhancing its coupling strength and thereby ensuring the stiffness of the equation of state, highlighting the crucial role of hypernuclear studies in solving the hyperon puzzle problem. Consequently, a maximum mass of around $2M_{\odot}$ can be achieved with all five interactions considered in this study under the combined constraints from astronomical observations and nuclear physics. With more reliably estimated hyperon-nucleon contributions, the uncertainties in both the fractions and the threshold densities at which hyperons appear inside neutron stars are notably reduced, along with those in the mass-radius predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Running scalar spectral index in warm natural inflation</a><span class="id">[2506.23448]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The validity of inflation models is mainly evaluated according to the consistency of the predicted scalar spectral index $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, the tensor scalar ratio $r$, and the running scalar spectral index $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ with cosmic microwave background observations. In warm inflation (WI) scenarios, one can find exact analytical solutions for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ in principle, but long expressions may be obtained. Previous studies for WI scenarios have only shown approximate analytical solutions or numerical results for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$. In this study, we present a general analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ without approximation in WI. By providing an analytical expression, even if it is mathematically redundant, we believe that $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ will be studied across a broader range of WI models in the future. The obtained analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is used in the study of warm natural inflation (WNI). Although $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $r$ have been previously investigated, $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is omitted in previous studies on WNI. Our study of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ completes previous phenomenological studies on WNI. In particular, the lower limit of the symmetry-breaking scale in WNI becomes more concrete in this study.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Higher-order gravity models: corrections up to cubic curvature invariants and inflation</a><span class="id">[2509.09167]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We construct a higher-order gravity model including all corrections up to mass dimension six. Starting from the Jordan frame, we derive the field equations and specialize to the FLRW background, where the dynamics take the form of a four-dimensional autonomous system. Focusing on the $R+R^{2}+RR_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ case, we obtain linearized equations in the parameter $\gamma_{0}$ and analyze the resulting phase space. The model exhibits the main desirable features of an inflationary regime, with a slow-roll attractor and a stable critical point corresponding to the end of inflation. Analytical expressions for the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ show that the model is consistent with Planck, BICEP/Keck, and BAO data if $|\gamma_{0}|\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Moreover, negative values of $\gamma_{0}$ restore compatibility with recent ACT, Planck, and DESI results, suggesting that higher-order corrections may be relevant in refining inflationary cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00702" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asymptotic Schwarzschild solutions in $f(R)$ gravity and their observable effects on the photon sphere of black holes</a><span class="id">[2510.00702]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate asymptotic Schwarzschild exterior solutions in the context of modified gravity theories, specifically within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, where the asymptotic behavior recovers the standard Schwarzschild solution of General Relativity. Unlike previous studies that rely mainly on analytical approximations, our approach combines asymptotic analysis with numerical integration of the underlying differential equations. Using these solutions, we analyze strong lensing effects to obtain the photon sphere radius and the corresponding capture parameter. Considering rings produced by total reflection, we define the photon sphere width as the difference between the first total reflection and the capture parameter; and study how it is modified in the $f(R)$ scenario. Our results show that the photon sphere width increases in the presence of $f(R)$-type modifications, indicating deviations from GR that could be observable in the strong-field regime.</p></div></details></article></body>
