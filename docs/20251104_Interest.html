<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Newtonian limit of orthonormal frames in metric theories of gravity</a><span class="id">[2410.01800]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extend well-known results on the Newtonian limit of Lorentzian metrics to orthonormal frames. Concretely, we prove that, given a one-parameter family of Lorentzian metrics that in the Newtonian limit converges to a Galilei structure, any family of orthonormal frames for these metrics converges pointwise to a Galilei frame, assuming that the two obvious necessary conditions are satisfied: the spatial frame must not rotate indefinitely as the limit is approached, and the frame's boost velocity with respect to some fixed reference observer needs to converge.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Where Photons Have Been: Nowhere Without All Components of Their Wavefunctions</a><span class="id">[2507.06362]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A nested interferometer experiment by Danan et al (2013) is discussed and some claims evaluated concerning the whereabouts of the photon, primarily in the context of time-symmetric interpretations of quantum theory including the Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF) and the Transactional Interpretation (TI). It is pointed out that the TSVF account fails to predict the observed data based only on the first-order wavefunction component. It is shown that the Transactional Interpretation readily accounts for all the observed phenomena.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An intuitive model for illustrating the classical Doppler effect equation</a><span class="id">[2504.18159]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Doppler effect has many applications in science and engineering fields. Although the format of the classical Doppler effect equation is simple, the derivation for the equation in physics textbooks is not intuitive to many students. This article provides a simple but effective model to illustrate the derivation for the classical Doppler effect equation. This model visualizes frequency, wavelength, and wave speed, which helps students to establish an intuitive and clear understanding of mechanical waves. This model also provides a clear visualization that the wave speed is unchanging in an underlying medium, which is a key point in understanding the classical Doppler effect.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Water Management Considerations for a Self-Sustaining Moonbase</a><span class="id">[2405.14100]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The most pragmatic first step in the all-but-inevitable 3rd-millennium Völkerwanderung of humanity throughout the Solar System is the establishment of a permanent human presence on the Moon. This research examines: 1. the human, agricultural, and technical water needs of a 100-person, 500 m x 100 m x 6 m self-sustaining lunar colony; 2. choosing a strategic location for the moonbase; 3. a heat drill model by which the needed lunar water ice could be sublimated; and 4. the robust water treatment and recovery infrastructure and water management personnel that would be needed for a self-sustaining moonbase.</p></div></details></article></body>
