We show that minimal models of scalar-mediated forces between dark matter particles do not enhance the growth of unbiased tracers of structure: weak lensing observables depend on the total density perturbation, for which the enhanced growth of the density contrast in the matter era is cancelled by the more rapid dilution of the background dark matter density. Moreover, the same background-level effects imply that scenarios compatible with CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies in fact suppress structure growth, as fixing the distance to last scattering requires a substantially increased density of dark energy. Though massive mediators undo these effects upon oscillating, they suppress structure even further because their gravitational impact as nonclustering subcomponents of matter outweighs the enhanced clustering strength of dark matter. We support these findings with analytic insight that clarifies the physical impact of dark forces and explains how primary CMB measurements calibrate the model's predictions for low-redshift observables. We discuss implications for neutrino mass limits and other cosmological anomalies, and we also consider how nonminimal extensions of the model might be engineered to enhance structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00102" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Cold and Super-Puffy Planet on a Polar Orbit</a><span class="id">[2510.00102]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of TOI-4507 b, a transiting sub-Saturn with a density $&lt;0.3$ g/cm$^3$ on a 105-day polar orbit around a $700$ Myr old F star. The transits were detected using data from TESS as well as the Antarctic telescope ASTEP. A joint analysis of the light curves and radial velocities from HARPS, FEROS, and CORALIE confirmed the planetary nature of the signal by limiting the mass to be below $30\,M_\oplus$ at $95\%$ confidence. The radial velocities also exhibit the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and imply that the star's equatorial plane is tilted by $82.0_{-2.4}^{+2.6}$ deg with respect to the planet's orbital plane. With these characteristics, TOI-4507 b is one of longest-period planets for which the stellar obliquity has been measured, and is among the longest-period and youngest ”super-puff” planets yet discovered.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The OATMEAL Survey. III. An Aligned Transiting Warm Brown Dwarf and Evidence for Quiescent Brown Dwarf Migration</a><span class="id">[2510.00105]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first measurement of the sky-projected orbital obliquity of a benchmark transiting brown dwarf host, HIP 33609, as a part of the Orbital Architectures of Transiting Massive Exoplanets And Low-mass stars (OATMEAL) survey. HIP 33609 b is a highly eccentric, 68 $M_{\rm J}$ brown dwarf orbiting a 10,300 K, A-type star with an orbital period of 39 days. Its host star is a known member of the 150 Myr old MELANGE-6 moving group, making it an excellent laboratory for testing sub-stellar evolutionary models. Using in-transit spectra collected by the Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) on the Magellan II Clay 6.5 m telescope, we measured a sky-projected orbital obliquity of $|\lambda|= 12.7 \pm 1.3$°. The mass of the brown dwarf is most consistent with a stellar-like fragmentation formation history followed by a period of migration. Given the high eccentricity ($e=0.557$) but low orbital obliquity of the brown dwarf, we claim that coplanar high eccentricity tidal migration seems to be the most plausible pathway, however, it remains difficult to conclusively rule out other migration mechanisms. The low orbital obliquity for HIP 33609 is consistent with previous measurements of high mass-ratio companions, and bears a striking resemblance to the obliquity distribution of transiting warm Jupiters. We suggest brown dwarfs may follow a dynamically quiescent migration pathway, consistent with them forming in isolated conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on the Thompson optical depth to the CMB from the Lyman-$α$ forest</a><span class="id">[2510.00107]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first constraints on the electron optical depth to reionization, $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$, from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest alone for physically motivated reionization models that match the reionization's end-point, $z_{\rm{end}}$, required by the same astrophysical probe, and for symmetric reionization models with fixed duration, $\Delta z$, commonly adopted in CMB reionization analyses. Compared to traditional estimates from the latter, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest traces the ionization state of the IGM through its coupling with the thermal state. We find an explicit mapping between the two solving the chemistry and temperature evolution equations for hydrogen and helium. Our results yield $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=$0.042^{+0.047}_{-0.02}$ (95% C.L) and $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=$0.042^{+0.024}_{-0.015}$ for reionization models with $z_{\rm{end}}$ and $\Delta z$-fixed, respectively, disfavoring a high $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=0.09 by 2.57$\sigma$ and 4.31$\sigma$. With mock Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data that mimics the precision of future larger quasar sample datasets, we would potentially obtain tighter $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$ constraints and exclude such a high $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$ with a higher significance, paving the way for novel constraints on the epoch of reionization from a large-scale structure probe independent of the CMB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semianalytical Accretion-Tracer Emission: Forming Planets Are Intrinsically Faint</a><span class="id">[2510.00138]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Direct-imaging surveys have looked for accreting planets through their accretion tracers such as H alpha but have been less fruitful than expected. However, up to now, hydrogen-line emission at accreting planets has been estimated primarily with extrapolations of stellar-scaling relationships or with theoretical spherically-symmetric computations. To predict the line emission intensity during the formation phase, we wish to follow the consequences of angular momentum conservation of the material accreting onto a gas giant in a protoplanetary disc. We focus on the limiting case that magnetospheric accretion does not occur, which yields a conservative estimate of the line emission and might correspond to certain epochs during formation. We extend but simplify an existing analytical description of the multidimensional gas flow onto an accreting gas giant, the ballistic infall model, and combine this with detailed shock emission models. Applying this to data from a global planet formation model, we confirm that the line-emitting accretion rate is a minuscule fraction of the gas inflow into the Hill sphere. Also, forming planets are mostly fainter than PDS 70 b and c or WISPIT 2 b, with a maximum H alpha line luminosity Lline near 1e-7 Lsol, roughly independent of planet mass. Most surveys have not been sensitive to such faint planets. Other hydrogen lines in the NIR are fainter by 1–2 dex. This implies that accreting planets are fainter than from past estimates, such that the non-detections are not as constraining as thought. Accreting super-Jupiters may well be present, and a deeper look and closer in to the host stars could well reveal many forming planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Icy or Rocky? Convective or Stable? New interior models of Uranus and Neptune</a><span class="id">[2510.00175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new framework for constructing agnostic and yet physical models for planetary interiors and apply it to Uranus and Neptune. Unlike previous research that either impose rigid assumptions or rely on simplified empirical profiles, our approach bridges both paradigms. Starting from randomly generated density profiles, we apply an iterative algorithm that converges toward models that simultaneously satisfy hydrostatic equilibrium, match the observed gravitational moments, and remain thermodynamically and compositionally consistent. The inferred interior models for Uranus and Neptune span a wide range of possible interior structures, in particular encompassing both water-dominated and rock-dominated configurations (rock-to-water mass ratios between 0.04-3.92 for Uranus and 0.20-1.78 for Neptune). All models contain convective regions with ionic water and have temperature-pressure profiles that remain above the demixing curves for hydrogen-helium-water mixtures. This offers both a plausible explanation for the observed non-dipolar magnetic fields and indicates that no hydrogen-helium-water demixing occurs. We find a higher H-He mass fraction in the outermost convection zones for Uranus (0.62-0.73) compared to Neptune (0.25-0.49) and that Uranus' magnetic field is likely generated deeper in the interior compared to Neptune. We infer upper limits of 0.69-0.74 (Uranus) vs. 0.78-0.92 (Neptune) for the outer edges of the dynamo regions in units of normalised radii. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional classification of Uranus and Neptune as &quot;ice giants&quot; and underscore the need for improved observational data or formation constraints to break compositional degeneracy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inconsistencies of Tsallis Cosmology within Horizon Thermodynamics and Holographic Scenarios</a><span class="id">[2510.00234]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the cosmological implications of Tsallis entropy in two widely discussed settings: the Cai–Kim thermodynamic derivation of the Friedmann equations and the holographic dark energy (HDE) scenario with the Hubble scale as infrared cutoff. In both cases, the dynamics introduce a nonextensivity parameter $\delta$, with standard $\Lambda$CDM recovered for $\delta=1$. Previous studies have argued that only small deviations from extensivity are observationally allowed, typically constraining $|1 - \delta| \lesssim 10^{-3}$. In this work we go further and present, for the first time, a systematic consistency analysis across the entire expansion history. We show that even mild departures from $\delta=1$ lead to pathological behavior in the effective dark energy sector: its density becomes negative or complex, its equation of state diverges, or alternatively it contributes an unacceptably large early–time fraction that spoils radiation domination and violates BBN and CMB bounds. Our results sharpen and unify earlier hints of tension, providing a clear physical explanation in terms of corrections that grow uncontrollably with expansion rate toward the past. We conclude that, within both the Cai–Kim and HDE frameworks, viable cosmology is realized only in the extensive limit, effectively collapsing the models back to $\Lambda$CDM. More broadly, our findings call attention to the importance of dynamical consistency and cosmological viability tests when assessing nonextensive entropies as possible explanations of the Universe's dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effects of Primordial Black Holes on IGM History</a><span class="id">[2510.00246]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Currently the asteroid mass window (mass $\sim 10^{17}- 10^{21}$ grams) remains unconstrained for Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) to make up all of the dark matter content of the universe. Given these PBHs have very small masses, their Hawking temperature can be up to hundreds of keV. This study investigates the potential impacts of PBH Hawking radiation on the intergalactic medium from $z\sim 800-25$, namely studying the ionization history, kinetic gas temperature, and ultimately the 21 cm signature. We find that for masses on the low edge of the asteroid mass window, there are up two orders of magnitude increases in the ionization fraction and kinetic gas temperature by redshift 25, and the 21 cm spin temperature can differ from non-PBH cosmology by factors of a few. This analysis results in maximum differential brightness temperatures of +17 mK for our lightest PBH masses of $2.12\times 10^{16}$g. We also show maximal $53$ mK discrepancies in differential brightness temperatures between our PBH and non-PBH cosmologies for our lightest PBH mass, while our heaviest PBH mass of $1.65 \times 10^{17}$g shows only $0.5$ mK variations. We find the Hawking-radiated electrons and positrons are instrumental in driving these IGM modifications. This study shows the necessity for a rigorous treatment of Hawking radiation in PBH cosmological observables from the dark ages through cosmic dawn.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00248" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Late-afterglow Emission from a Quasi-spherical Outflow in a stratified environment</a><span class="id">[2510.00248]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are cosmic events occurring at large distances beyond our galaxy. They provide a unique opportunity to study electromagnetic patterns not seen elsewhere. When the collimated GRB outflow interacts with the outer layers of a star or the wind generated by a binary neutron star merger, it releases energy, forming a quasi-spherical outflow around it. This broad outflow begins to radiate once it has transferred enough energy to the surrounding medium. We have developed a new analytical model that describes the synchrotron afterglow scenario of the quasi-spherical outflow, including factors such as stratified density, self-absorption regime, and the fraction of electrons accelerated by the shock front. We also successfully describe the multiwavelength observations of a sample of llGRB afterglows (GRB 980425, 031203, 060218, 100316D, 130603B, 150101B and 171205A) that exhibited a late component, analyzed in both stellar wind and constant-density environments. Our analysis shows that a constant-density environment is favored. Additionally, we consider the multiwavelength upper limits of the short bursts reported in the Swift-BAT database.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exotic PeVatrons as sources of ultra-high-energy gamma rays</a><span class="id">[2510.00254]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore novel classes of exotic astrophysical sources capable of producing ultra-high-energy gamma rays extending beyond the PeV scale, motivated by quantum gravity scenarios and dark matter phenomenology. These sources include: ultra-spinning black hole vortex-string systems; exotic compact objects such as boson star, axion star and Q-ball. Such Exotica generate powerful magnetic fields through interactions with millicharged dark matter, enabling particle acceleration mechanisms that surpass the energy limits of conventional astrophysical sources like pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants. We demonstrate that such exotic PeVatrons could be distributed throughout our Galaxy and may be detectable by current (LHAASO, HAWC) and next-generation (CTA) gamma-ray observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for Ultra-light Dark Matter in Spatial Correlations of White Dwarf Structure</a><span class="id">[2510.00271]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>If dark matter is ultra-light and has certain Standard Model interactions, it can change the mass-radius relation of white dwarf stars. The coherence length of ultra-light dark matter imparts spatial correlations in deviations from the canonical mass-radius relation, and thus white dwarfs can be used to reconstruct the coherence length, or equivalently the particle mass, of the dark matter field. We simulate the observability of such spatial correlations accounting for realistic complications like variable hydrogen envelope thickness, dust, binaries, measurement noise, and distance uncertainties in DA white dwarfs. Using a machine learning approach on simulated data, we measure the dark matter field coherence length and find that large deviations from the mass-radius relation ($\sim10\%$ change in radius) are needed to produce an observable signal given realistic noise sources. We apply our spatial correlation measurement routine to the SDSS catalog of 10,207 DA white dwarfs. We detect a positive spatial correlation among white dwarfs at separations corresponding to a coherence length of $300\pm50$ pc, with an average Z-score of 85 for white dwarfs separated by less than this coherence length. We conclude that this signal is due to observational bias. The signal can be explained by an offset between measurements and theory for nearby cool white dwarfs, and the presence of few, low-temperature white dwarfs with noisy measurements at further distances. With future improvements in white dwarf models and measurement techniques, particularly for cool white dwarfs, this method can provide interesting constraints on ultra-light dark matter models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A planetary system with a sub-Neptune planet in the habitable zone of TOI-2093</a><span class="id">[2510.00299]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aims. We aim to confirm and measure the mass of the transiting planet candidate around the K5V star TOI-2093, previously announced by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) project. Methods. We combined photometric data from 32 sectors between 2019 and 2024 with 86 radial velocity measurements obtained with the CARMENES spectrograph over a period of 2.4 years, along with a series of ground-based, broadband photometric monitoring campaigns to characterize the host star and the transiting planet candidate, as well as to search for additional planets in the system. Our data indicate that TOI-2093 is a main-sequence star located at a distance of 83 pc, with solar metallicity, and a rotation period of 43.8 +- 1.8 d. Results. We have confirmed the planetary nature of the TESS transiting planet candidate, named TOI-2093 c, through the detection of its Keplerian signal in the spectroscopic data. We measured a planetary radius of 2.30 +- 0.12 Rearth, a Neptune-like mass of 15.8 +- 3.7 Mearth, and an orbital period of 53.81149 +- 0.00017 d. This makes TOI-2093 c the smallest exoplanet known in the habitable zone of a main-sequence FGK star. Given its size and relatively high density, TOI-2093 c belongs to a class of planets with no analog in the Solar System. In addition, the CARMENES data revealed the presence of a second planet candidate with a minimum mass of 10.6 +- 2.5 Mearth and an orbital period of 12.836 +- 0.021 d. This inner planet, which we designated TOI-2093 b, shows no detectable photometric transit in the TESS light curves. The orbital planes of the two planets are misaligned by more than 1.6 deg despite the near 4:1 mean-motion resonance of their orbital periods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar limb faculae: intensity contrast from two vantage points</a><span class="id">[2510.00320]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Small-scale magnetic flux concentrations contribute significantly to the brightness variations of the Sun, yet observing them - particularly their magnetic field - near the solar limb remains challenging. Solar Orbiter offers an unprecedented second vantage point for observing the Sun. When combined with observations from the perspective of Earth, this enables simultaneous dual-viewpoint measurements of these magnetic structures, thereby helping to mitigate observational limitations. Using such a dual-viewpoint geometry, we characterise the brightness contrast of faculae near the limb as a function of both their associated magnetic field strength and the observation angle. We analyse data from Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on board Solar Orbiter (SO/PHI), obtained during an observation program conducted in near-quadrature configuration with Earth, in combination with data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI). The High Resolution Telescope of SO/PHI observed a facular region located near disc centre as seen from its vantage point, while the same region was simultaneously observed near the solar limb by SDO/HMI. We identify faculae and determine their magnetic field strength from the disc-centre observations, and combine these with continuum intensity measurements at the limb to derive dual-viewpoint contrast curves. We then compare these with contrast curves derived from SDO/HMI alone. Using two viewpoints, we consistently find higher facular contrast near the limb than from a single-viewpoint.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Eclipsing $γ$ Doradus Star V421 Pegasi</a><span class="id">[2510.00337]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-precision TESS photometry of V421 Peg (TIC 301747091), an early F-type eclipsing binary containing a candidate $\gamma$ Dor component. The observed short-cadence data allow the detection of pulsation signals, along with revision of the fundamental properties of the component stars. Detailed binary modeling indicated that the program target is a partially-eclipsing detached system in a circular orbit and that both components are currently in super-synchronous states. The radii of each star were measured with an accuracy of about 1 \%. By periodogram analysis of the outside-eclipse residual lights obtained from the binary star model, we extracted nine significant signals, five of which are likely aliasing frequencies due to sampling artifacts and uncorrected trends in the data used. The other signals of $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_3$, and $f_6$ are considered to be independent pulsations with frequencies ranging from 0.73 day$^{-1}$ to 1.02 day$^{-1}$, corresponding to pulsation constants of 0.63$-$0.88 days. These frequencies, pulsation constants, and position on the H-R diagram reveal that the pulsating signals are $\gamma$ Dor variables arising from the V421 Peg primary component.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00403" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinetic Simulations of Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Perpendicular Electron-positron Shocks with Proton Admixture</a><span class="id">[2510.00403]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Particle acceleration in relativistic shocks of electron-positron plasmas with proton admixture is investigated through two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The upstream plasma, with a bulk Lorentz factor of $10$ and a magnetization parameter of 0.02, includes a small fraction of protons ($\sim 5\%$ by number). A relativistic perpendicular shock is formed by reflecting the flow off a conducting wall. The shock structure, electromagnetic fields, and particle energy spectra are analyzed. The particle density and the magnetic field have fluctuations. In the far-downstream region of the shock, positrons are accelerated to energies comparable to protons and develop a hard nonthermal component with a spectral index of $\sim 2$ in their energy spectrum, while electrons remain confined to lower energies. This asymmetry is attributed to the polarization properties of proton-driven electromagnetic waves, which favor positron acceleration. The results highlight the importance of plasma composition in shaping particle acceleration and nonthermal emission in relativistic shocks. These findings provide new insights into the microphysics of particle acceleration in astrophysical sources containing relativistic shocks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00440" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faraday Depolarization Study of a Radio Galaxy Using LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey: Data Release 2</a><span class="id">[2510.00440]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed depolarization analysis of a radio galaxy ILTJ012215.21+254334.8, utilizing polarimetric data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release 2 (DR2) catalogue. The selected source exhibits a rotation measure (RM) of   - 47 rad/m^2 and a projected linear size of 335 kpc at a redshift z   0.05. Depolarization model fitting was performed on LOFAR High Band Antenna data (120 - 168 MHz), with fractional polarization detected at 3.0%. Five depolarization models were tested, and Bayesian qu-fitting revealed that the three-component model (1T+2ED) best describes the data, with a reduced chi-squared value of 2.12 and a logarithmic Bayesian evidence of 1384.82. This model includes a Faraday-thin component at RM   - 0.3 rad/m^2 (instrumental leakage) and two external Faraday dispersion astrophysical emission at RM   - 47 rad/m^2. The results demonstrate that depolarization in low-frequency radio galaxies requires multi-component modelling and is driven by turbulence and inhomogeneity in the magneto-ionic medium. Our findings highlight the potential of LOFAR polarization studies for probing galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields with high precision.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscillations of the solar photospheric magnetic field caused by the m = 1 high-latitude inertial mode</a><span class="id">[2510.00596]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Periodic oscillations at 338 nHz in the Earth frame are observed at high latitudes in direct Doppler velocity measurements.

Through direct observations and spectral analysis, we detect periodic magnetic field oscillations at high latitudes ($65^\circ$–$70^\circ$) with a frequency of 338 nHz in the Earth frame, matching the known frequency of the $m = 1$ high-latitude inertial mode. The observed line-of-sight magnetic field oscillations are predominantly symmetric across the equator.

However, our understanding of the photospheric magnetic field topology is inherently constrained by the limitation of systematically observing the Sun from only one vantage point, Earth. To address this challenge, we introduce global magnetic field maps that assimilate far-side active regions derived from helioseismology into solar wind modeling. Through a comparative analysis between the combined surface flux transport and helioseismic Far-side Active Region Model (FARM) magnetic maps and the base surface flux transport model without far-side active regions (SFTM), we assess the feasibility and efficacy of incorporating helio- seismic far-side information in space weather forecasting. We are employing the Wang-Sheeley-Arge Solar Wind (WSA) model for statistical evaluation and leveraging the three-dimensional heliospheric MHD model, EUHFORIA, to analyze a case study. Using the WSA model, we show that including far-side magnetic data improves solar wind forecasts for 2013-2014 by up to 50% in correlation and 3% in Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error, especially near Earth and STEREO-A. Additionally, our 3D modeling shows significant localized differences in heliospheric structure that can be attributed to the presence or absence of active regions in the magnetic maps used as input boundaries. This highlights the importance of including far-side information to more accurately model and predict space weather effects caused by solar wind, solar transients, and geomagnetic disturbances.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiband Optical Photometric and Spectroscopic Monitoring of the 2024 Flare Event in Transition Blazar OP313</a><span class="id">[2510.00631]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Blazars are active galactic nuclei known for their extreme variability, offering unique opportunities to study jet physics and high-energy emission mechanisms. In 2024, the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) OP313 underwent a remarkable flare event, during which the gamma-ray flux observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi/LAT) increased by a factor of 60 over its average value. The flare peak lasted less than two days. Using optical telescopes, we conducted 100-day time-scale observations. Multi-wavelength data revealed that OP313 entered an active state 50 days prior to the flare and remained active for at least 50 days afterward. We propose that this prolonged activity results from variations in electron density within the shock front due to changes in the accretion rate. Concurrently, OP313's spectrum transitioned from an FSRQ-like state to a BL Lac-like state, characterized by a significant increase in the synchrotron peak frequency and the disappearance of broad-line region emission lines. In the post-flare phase, we observed a decoupling between synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering, along with a possible decrease in the magnetic field strength within the shock front.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00648" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diffuse neutrino flux from coronal magnetospheric current sheets of accreting black holes</a><span class="id">[2510.00648]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Non-jetted AGN exhibit hard X-ray emission with a power law spectrum above $\sim$2 keV, which is thought to be produced through Comptonization of soft photons by electrons and positrons (pairs) in the vicinity of the black hole. The origin and composition of this plasma source, known as the corona, is a matter open for debate. Our study focuses on the role of relativistic protons accelerated in black-hole magnetospheric current sheets in the neutrino production of AGN coronae. We present a model that has two free parameters, namely the proton plasma magnetization $\sigma_{\rm p}$, which controls the peak energy of the neutrino spectrum, and the Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ (defined as the ratio between X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and Eddington luminosity $L_{\rm Edd}$), which controls the amount of energy transferred to secondary particles. Furthermore, we combine our coronal model with an AGN population in order to provide a prediction for the diffuse neutrino flux measured on Earth. We compare our results with the observational data by IceCube and we find a satisfactory agreement on both the flux value and the slope of the neutrino distribution when we assume a $\sigma_{\rm p}$ value of $10^5$ for all the sources in our sample.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00724" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Propagation and Energy Dissipation of Shock Waves in the Solar Chromosphere</a><span class="id">[2510.00724]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The solar atmosphere is permeated by various types of waves that originate from subsurface convection. As these waves propagate upward, they encounter they encounter a steep decrease in the density of the medium, leading to their steepening into shock waves. These shock waves typically exhibit a characteristic sawtooth pattern in wavelength-time ($\lambda$-t) plots of various chromospheric spectral lines, viz., H$\alpha$, Ca II 8542 Å to name a few. In this study, we investigate the propagation of shock waves in the lower solar atmosphere using coordinated observations from the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope (SST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our analysis reveals that after forming in the chromosphere, these shock waves travel upward through the solar atmosphere, with their signatures detectable not only in the transition region but also in low coronal passbands. These shock waves dissipate their energy into the chromosphere as they propagate. In certain cases, the energy deposited by these waves is comparable to the radiative losses of the chromosphere, highlighting their potential role in chromospheric heating. Our findings reported here provide crucial insights into wave dynamics in the lower solar atmosphere and their contribution to the energy transport process in the chromosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00736" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exoplanets beyond the Conservative Habitable Zone: I.

In the Solar System, the HZ for a conservative climate model extends approximately between the orbits of Earth and Mars. We elaborate on earlier HZ models and apply an analytical climate model of the temperature distribution on tidally-locked planets to extend the HZ. We show that planets orbiting M- and K-dwarf stars may maintain liquid water on their night side, significantly closer to their host star than the inner border of the conservative HZ. We calculate the extended borders of the HZ in the flux-effective temperature diagram. This extension may explain the presence of water vapor and other volatile gases in the transmission spectra of warm Super-Earth-sized exoplanets closely orbiting M dwarfs, recently detected by JWST.

As a result, a cluster sample selected by richness has a mean lensing signal higher than expected from its mean mass, and the inferred mass will be biased high. This selection bias is currently limiting the accuracy of cosmological parameters derived from optical clusters. In this paper, we quantify the bias in mass calibration due to this selection bias. Using two simulations, MiniUchuu and Cardinal, with different galaxy models and cluster finders, we find that the selection bias leads to an overestimation of lensing mass at a 20-50% level, with a larger bias 20-80% for large-scale lensing (&gt;3 Mpc). Even with a conservative projection model, the impact of selection bias significantly outweighs the impact of other currently known cluster lensing systematics. We urge the cluster community to account for this bias in all future optical cluster cosmology analyses, and we discuss strategies for mitigating this bias.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dissecting the radiation mechanism of short GRB 160821B through multi-wavelength modelling</a><span class="id">[2510.00780]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRB 160821B is the only short GRB detected to date at very high energy (VHE, $\gtrsim 100$ GeV). At a redshift $z=0.161$, it was detected by MAGIC telescopes approximately four hours since the trigger. VHE dataset was complied with the datasets of other wavelengths in between the timescale of 1.7 to 4 hours to construct the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). In previous studies of GRB 160821B, synchrotron and external Compton (EC) model could explain the VHE emission better than the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. Although, these fits were mostly eyeballing data without any optimisation. Our model includes the combination of synchrotron, SSC, and EC models with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Our analysis reveals that the EC contribution is negligible in comparison with the SSC and our model explains the VHE data well for the wind medium. We found that GRB 160821B is the least energetic VHE GRB and it occurred in high density wind medium which is quiet unusual for a short GRB. But like other long-duration VHE GRBs, GRB 160821B occurred in a poorly magnetised medium. As there is no statistical study on afterglow modelling of short GRB sample, we compare the inferred properties of GRB 160821B with other VHE GRBs. It stands out distinctively in the $E_{k, \rm iso}$ - $\epsilon_B$ parameter space and lies outside the 3-$\sigma$ region of the correlation. In future, more VHE detections of short GRBs, in the CTA era, will provide crucial insights into the emission sites, radiation mechanisms, and particle acceleration, as well as their connection to long GRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exoplanets beyond the Conservative Habitable Zone: II.

Integrating over the phase space in the HZ diagram and normalizing our calculation to relatively recent analyses of the Kepler data, we show that potentially habitable planets may be as much as 50 times more abundant than in the lower estimate, limited to the conservative HZ of G-type stars only.

While probing the HI gas over cosmic time has improved our understanding, direct HI detection is essentially limited to $z \lesssim 0.42$ due to the faintness of the 21cm line. Detections beyond this redshift have made use of the stacking technique to obtain average quantities of galaxy populations. Gravitational lensing by the cluster lenses enhances the HI signal and can extend the redshift limit further. In this work, we describe simulations of HI lensing in cluster lenses. We explore the feasibility of detecting strongly lensed HI emission from background galaxies using known 50 cluster lenses within the uGMRT sky coverage. We demonstrate that certain clusters offer a strong likelihood of HI detection. We also investigate how strong lensing distorts the HI spectral line profile. The shape of the HI signal in these lensing models provides useful information and can be used in optimising signal extraction in blind and targeted HI surveys. We find that blind detection of HI signal from galaxies in the redshift range up to 1.58 requires more than a few hundred hours of observations of individual clusters with the uGMRT. Detection of HI emission in galaxies where strong lensing has been observed in the optical appears to be more promising with potential for a $5\sigma$ detection in $&lt;50$ hours of on-source observations for Abell 370 and in $&lt;75$ hours for Abell 1703 with the uGMRT.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alleviating Cosmological Tensions with the Hadrosymmetric Twin Higgs</a><span class="id">[2510.00852]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Hadrosymmetric Twin Higgs (HTH) model provides a natural solution to the little hierarchy problem by incorporating all three generations of quarks in a twin sector. Unlike other Twin Higgs scenarios, such as the Mirror Twin Higgs (MTH), the HTH framework avoids introducing additional light states or radiation and thus remains consistent with stringent bounds on the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Its particle content and interactions also make it difficult to probe at colliders, highlighting the importance of cosmological tests. In this work, we study the cosmological implications of the HTH model, focusing on the persistent tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($\sigma_8$). Implementing the HTH sector in a Boltzmann code and confronting it with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and local $H_0$ measurements, we find that the scenario reduces the Hubble tension from more than $4\sigma$ to about $2.5\sigma$, while also alleviating the $\sigma_8$ discrepancy. These results demonstrate that the HTH framework not only addresses naturalness in particle physics but also offers a viable route to mitigating current cosmological tensions, thereby strengthening the link between fundamental theory and precision cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding the evolution of black hole spin in X-ray binary systems: Case study of XTE J1550-564</a><span class="id">[2510.00860]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive study of the X-ray binary system XTE J1550-564, with the primary objective of analyzing the evolution of the black hole's spin parameter.

Using a set of models covering various parameter combinations, we were able to replicate the system's observed characteristics within acceptable error margins, including fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital period, donor luminosity, and effective temperature. The model results indicate the possibility of diverse evolutionary pathways for the system, highlighting the significant role played by the initial mass of the donor star and the efficiency of mass transfer episodes. While some models are well-aligned with estimates of the mass transfer rate, they all fall short of explaining the black hole's observed moderate spin ($a^* = 0.49$). We also explored alternative magnetic braking prescriptions, finding that only an extreme and fully conservative scenario, based on the convection and rotation boosted prescription, can reproduce the observed spin and only in a marginal way. Our study attempts to shed light on the complex dynamics of black hole X-ray binaries and the challenges of explaining their observed properties with theoretical models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Waves sourced by Gauge Fields during Inflation</a><span class="id">[2510.00869]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the inflationary gravitational wave background induced by Abelian gauge fields generated by non-minimal kinetic and axial couplings to the inflaton.

We use three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to model the prototype gamma Cas system assuming a white dwarf companion and investigate the accretion of the circumstellar material by the secondary star. We contrast these results to a model for 59 Cyg, a non-gamma Cas Be star system with a stripped companion. We find that the secondary stars in both systems form disk-like accretion structures with Keplerian characteristics, similar to those seen in the Be decretion disks. We also find that white dwarf accretion can produce X-ray fluxes that are consistent with the observed values for gamma Cas, while the predicted X-ray luminosities are significantly lower for the non-degenerate companion in 59 Cyg. In addition, using the three-dimensional radiative transfer code, HDUST, we find that these models produce H-alpha emission consistent with the observations for both gamma Cas and 59 Cyg, and that the predicted polarization degrees across optical and UV wavelengths are at detectable levels.

These efforts have yielded conflicting findings regarding the presence or absence of lightning in Venus's atmosphere. In this study we adopt an indirect approach to constrain the prevalence of lightning on Venus, using the chemical by-products it produces in Venus's atmosphere. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key tracer species of lightning, being exclusively generated by lightning in Venus's lower atmosphere. By calculating the present rate of atmospheric destruction of NO in Venus's atmosphere through photochemical-kinetic modelling, we constrain the lightning power required to sustain the estimated NO abundances on modern Venus. The reported NO constraints require lightning to generate at-least three times the power released on Earth; consistent with either a higher rate of strikes, or greater energy per strike, or a combination of both. Limited detections of optical flashes within the clouds could point to lightning striking deeper in the atmosphere and nearer the surface – with the result that its optical flashes are obscured by the clouds – driven by triboelectric charging during volcanic eruptions or wind interactions with surface sediments. Our findings underscore the importance for future missions of confirming lightning on Venus, either by verifying the below-cloud NO abundance, or by detecting another unambiguous lightning signature, to provide the first definitive evidence of lightning on a rocky planet other than Earth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Molecular Mobility of Extraterrestrial Ices: Surface Diffusion in Astrochemistry and Planetary Science</a><span class="id">[2510.01018]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Molecules are ubiquitous in space. They are necessary component in the creation of habitable planetary systems and can provide the basic building blocks of life. Solid-state processes are pivotal in the formation of molecules in space and surface diffusion in particular is a key driver of chemistry in extraterrestrial environments, such as the massive clouds in which stars and planets are formed and the icy objects within our Solar System. However, for many atoms and molecules quantitative theoretical and experimental information on diffusion, such as activation barriers, are lacking. This hinders us in unraveling chemical processes in space and determining how the chemical ingredients of planets and life are formed. In this article, an astrochemical perspective on diffusion is provided. Described are the relevant adsorbate-surface systems, the methods to model their chemical processes, and the computational and laboratory techniques to determine diffusion parameters, including the latest developments in the field. While much progress has been made, many astrochemically relevant systems remain unexplored. The complexity of ice surfaces, their temperature-dependent restructuring, and effects at low temperatures create unique challenges that demand innovative experimental approaches and theoretical frameworks. This intersection of astrochemistry and surface science offers fertile ground for physical chemists to apply their expertise. We invite the physical chemistry community to explore these systems, where precise diffusion parameters would dramatically advance our understanding of molecular evolution in space - from interstellar clouds to planetary surfaces - with implications on our understanding on the origins of life and planetary habitability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carbon and nitrogen as indicators of stellar evolution and age.

Low- and intermediate-mass giants undergo a complex chemical evolution that has yet to be observationally probed. The influence of core helium flash on the chemical composition of stellar atmospheres has been an open question since its theoretical prediction 60 years ago. Aims. Based on high-resolution spectral observations of 44 open star clusters in the Gaia-ESO survey, our aim is to perform the first large-scale homogeneous investigation into the carbon and nitrogen photospheric content of low- and intermediate-mass giant stars in different phases of evolution. Methods. We determined carbon and nitrogen abundances using spectral synthesis of the C2 Swan (1,0) band head at 5135 Å and C2 Swan (0,1) band head at 5635.5 Å, 12C14N bands in the interval 6470 - 6490 Å, and the forbidden [O i] line at 6300.31 Å. Results. We revealed differences in C/N abundance ratios between pre- and post-core-He-flash stars. The lower C/N ratios in core He-burning red clump stars are mainly due to the enhancement of nitrogen abundances. We presented calibrations of the relationship between [C/N] and stellar age for solar metallicity low- and intermediate-mass giants taking into account different evolutionary stages. Conclusions. The C/N abundance ratios in the investigated first-ascent giant stars are slightly less affected by the first dredge-up than predicted by the theoretical models. The rotation-induced extra mixing is not as efficient as theoretically predicted. The core helium flash may trigger additional alterations in carbon and nitrogen abundances that are not yet theoretically modelled. We found that the evolutionary stage of stars must be taken into account when using [C/N] as an age indicator.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing Gravitation from Light-second to Cosmological Scales with Radio Pulsars</a><span class="id">[2510.01062]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsars are spinning neutron stars typically observed as pulses emitted at radio wavelengths.

Various simulations are being developed and used to predict and understand the nature and morphology of this signal. However, these simulations are computationally very expensive and time-consuming to produce in large numbers. To overcome this problem, an efficient field-level emulator of this signal is required. However, the EoR 21-cm signal is highly non-Gaussian; therefore, capturing the correlations between different scales of this signal, which is directly related to the evolution of the reionization, with the neural network is quite difficult. Here, we introduce CosmoUiT, a UNet integrated vision transformer-based architecture, to overcome these difficulties. CosmoUiT emulates the 3D cubes of 21-cm signal from the EoR, for a given input dark matter density field, halo density field, and reionization parameters. CosmoUiT uses the multi-head self-attention mechanism of the transformer to capture the long-range dependencies and convolutional layers in the UNet to capture the small-scale variations in the target 21-cm field. Furthermore, the training of the emulator is conditioned on the input reionization parameters such that it gives a fast and accurate prediction of the 21-cm field for different sets of input reionization parameters. We evaluate the predictions of our emulator by comparing various statistics (e.g., bubble size distribution, power spectrum) and morphological features of the emulated and simulated maps. We further demonstrate that this vision transformer-based architecture can emulate the entire 3D 21-cm signal cube with high accuracy at both large and small scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KiDS-1000 cosmic shear reanalysis using MetaCalibration</a><span class="id">[2510.01122]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A number of cosmic shear studies have reported results that are in mild tension with the Planck cosmic microwave measurement. To explore if this can be caused by biases in the shear estimation, we revisit the analysis of data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) using an alternative shape measurement pipeline that is more robust to uncertainties in the calibration. To this end, we present an implementation of MetaCalibration, and compare its performance to that of lensfit, which has been used in previous analyses of these data. We find that the multiplicative bias is reduced, especially for the most distant redshifts, as derived from multi-band image simulations designed to match the KiDS data (SURFS-based KiDS-Legacy-Like Simulations: SKiLLS). For all tomographic bins we obtain a multiplicative bias $|m|&lt;0.017$, with negligible additive bias. Importantly, the calibration has a negligible sensitivity to key galaxy properties. The resulting robust shear estimates were used to obtain cosmological parameter constraints. We find that the parameter $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3} =0.789_{-0.024}^{+0.020}$ is consistent with the previous KiDS-1000 lensfit constraint of $S_8=0.776^{+0.029 +0.002}_{-0.027-0.003}$ (statistical + systematic errors). Thanks to the higher effective source density, the constraining power is improved by about 28%. The difference in $S_8$ with the Planck value remains at a similar level, 1.8$\sigma$, implying that it is not caused by the shear measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pan-STARRS follow-up of the gravitational-wave event S250818k and the lightcurve of SN 2025ulz</a><span class="id">[2510.01142]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Kilonovae are the scientifically rich, but observationally elusive, optical transient phenomena associated with compact binary mergers.

To this end, we present our follow-up observations of the gravitational-wave signal, S250818k, a plausible binary neutron star merger at a distance of $237 \pm 62$ Mpc. Pan-STARRS tiled 286 and 318 square degrees (32% and 34% of the 90% sky localisation region) within 3 and 7 days of the GW signal, respectively. ATLAS covered 70% of the skymap within 3 days, but with lower sensitivity. These observations uncovered 47 new transients; however, none were deemed to be linked to S250818k. We undertook an expansive follow-up campaign of AT 2025ulz, the purported counterpart to S250818k. The griz-band lightcurve, combined with our redshift measurement ($z = 0.0849 \pm 0.0003$) all indicate that SN 2025ulz is a SN IIb, and thus not the counterpart to S250818k.

We find some evidence in favour of a UV flux excess that may be intrinsic to iPTF16geu or due to external factors such as host galaxy subtraction and uncertainties in the reddening law. Upcoming surveys will significantly increase the samples of SNe discovered at high redshifts due to strong gravitational lensing. These glSNe will enable tighter constraints on the explosion physics of type Ia supernovae and how this has evolved throughout the Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanishing Acts: Quantifying Black Hole Formation with the DSNB Signal</a><span class="id">[2510.01177]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) created by stellar core-collapses throughout cosmic history is on the verge of discovery, with SK-Gd showing early deviations from the background expectation and JUNO starting to take data. However, the interpretation of early DSNB data will face significant challenges due to degeneracies between astrophysical parameters and uncertainties in supernova neutrino modeling. We explore how complementary astronomical observations can break these degeneracies and, in this context, we investigate whether early DSNB observations can constrain invisible supernovae, which have no optical emission but are powerful neutrino sources before being swallowed by a forming black hole. Leveraging the differences in the spectra between invisible and visible supernovae, we estimate the sensitivity of 1) detecting the existence of invisible supernovae, and 2) determining the fraction of invisible supernovae. Finally, we discuss how these conclusions depend on the spectral parameters of the black hole-forming component.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00114" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chiral effects and Joule heating in hot and dense matter</a><span class="id">[2510.00114]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Initial states of dense matter with nonzero electron chiral imbalance could potentially give rise to strong magnetic fields through chiral plasma instability. Previous work indicated that unless chiral chemical potential is as large as the electron vector chemical potential, the growth of magnetic fields due to the instability is washed out by chirality flipping rate enabled by electron mass. We re-examine this claim in a broader range of parameters and find that at higher temperatures the hierarchy is reversed supporting a growing magnetic field for an initial electron chiral chemical potential much smaller than the electron vector chemical potential. Further, we identify a qualitatively new effect relevant for magnetized hot and dense medium where chiral magnetic effect (CME) sourced by density fluctuation acts as a powerful source of Joule heating. Remarkably, even modest chiral chemical potentials (keV) in such environment can deposit energy densities set by the QCD scale in a relatively short time of the order of a few milliseconds or seconds. We speculate how this mechanism makes CME-driven Joule heating a potentially critical ingredient in the dynamics of turbulent density fluctuation of supernovae and neutron star mergers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chase Orbits, not Time: A Scalable Paradigm for Long-Duration Eccentric Gravitational-Wave Surrogates</a><span class="id">[2510.00116]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Surrogate modeling of eccentric binary black hole waveforms has remained challenging. The complicated morphology of these waveforms due to the eccentric orbital timescale variations makes it difficult to construct accurate and efficient surrogate models, especially for waveforms long enough to cover the sensitivity band of the current ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We present a novel and scalable surrogate building technique which makes surrogate modeling of long-duration eccentric binary black hole waveforms both feasible and highly efficient. The technique aims to simplify the harmonic content of the intermediate eccentric surrogate data pieces by modeling them in terms of an angular orbital element called the mean anomaly, instead of time. We show that this novel parameterization yields an order of magnitude fewer surrogate basis functions than using the contemporary parameterization in terms of time. We show that variations in surrogate data-pieces across parameter space become much more regular when expressed in terms of the instantaneous waveform eccentricity and mean anomaly, greatly easing their parameter-space fitting. The methods presented in this work make it feasible to build long-duration eccentric surrogates for the current as well as future third-generation gravitational wave detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lectures on Open Effective Field Theories</a><span class="id">[2510.00140]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Effective field theories offer a powerful method to unify diverse models under a small set of control parameters, allowing systematic expansions around well-established theories.

The recognition of the limitations of traditional EFT techniques has, over the past decade, sparked intense progress at the interface of high-energy physics and condensed matter. These considerations motivate a new approach to gravitation and cosmology, one that models the gravitational sector as evolving in the presence of an unobservable medium.

However, recent studies have shown that, under the Clausius relation and assuming a linear mass-to-horizon (MHR) relation, all entropic force models reduce to the original Bekenstein-Hawking formulation, regardless of the specific form of the horizon entropy. As a result, they inherit the same observational limitations in accounting for cosmic dynamics. To address this issue, a generalized MHR has been introduced, providing the foundation for a modified cosmological scenario rooted in the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture. In this work, we explore the implications of this generalized framework for early-Universe dynamics. Specifically, we analyze the growth of matter perturbations within the spherical Top-Hat formalism in the linear regime, showing that the density contrast profile is significantly influenced by the modified background dynamics predicted by the model. Moreover, considering the sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors in the sub-$10^3\,\mathrm{Hz}$ range, we examine the impact on the relic abundance of Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs), identifying parameter regions where deviations from standard cosmology may arise through an enhanced PGW spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00702" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asymptotic Schwarzschild solutions in $f(R)$ gravity and their observable effects on the photon sphere of black holes</a><span class="id">[2510.00702]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate asymptotic Schwarzschild exterior solutions in the context of modified gravity theories, specifically within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, where the asymptotic behavior recovers the standard Schwarzschild solution of General Relativity.

Using these solutions, we analyze strong lensing effects to obtain the photon sphere radius and the corresponding capture parameter. Considering rings produced by total reflection, we define the photon sphere width as the difference between the first total reflection and the capture parameter; and study how it is modified in the $f(R)$ scenario.

In this work, we consider such a class of Newton couplings and look for the possible observational implications on the highly lensed images of the black holes. In addition to placing constraints on the parameter space of the model through the latest Sgr A* images, we find that the variations in the shape of shadows in a large portion of the parameter space can be qualitatively captured by a quantity solely defined by the event horizon. Most importantly, the consistency of thermodynamics suggests a lower bound on the shadow size, beyond which either horizon disappears, or the shadow cannot keep the standard D-shaped structure. The possibility that the black holes in this model could spin faster than the Kerr bound, and the physical implications of the resulting cuspy shadows, are also discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00847" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gluon Condensation as a Unifying Mechanism for Special Spectra of Cosmic Gamma Rays and Low-Momentum Pion Enhancement at the Large Hadron Collider</a><span class="id">[2510.00847]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Decoding the internal structure of the proton is a fundamental challenge in physics. Historically, any new discovery about the proton has fuelled advances in several scientific fields. We have reported that gluons inside the proton accumulate near the critical momentum due to chaotic phenomena, forming gluon condensation. Surprisingly, the pion distribution predicted by this gluon distribution for the production of high-energy proton collisions could answer two puzzles in astronomy and high-energy physics. We find that during ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray collisions, gluon condensation may abruptly produce a large number of low-momentum pions, whose electromagnetic decays have the typical breakout properties appearing in various cosmic gamma-ray spectra. On the other hand, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is well below the cosmic ray energy scale, also shows weak but recognisable signs of gluon condensation, which had been mistaken for BEC pions. The connection between these two phenomena, which occur at different scales in the Universe, supports the existence of a new structure within the proton-gluon condensation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00986" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Novel very-high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations of compact, non-singular objects</a><span class="id">[2510.00986]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on a novel set of very-high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (VHFQPO's) in the context of compact, non-singular horizonless objects.

The choice $L \gtrsim GM$ generically removes the horizon from these metrics leading to compact, horizonless but non-singular objects. This generically guarantees the existence of a stable orbit at small radii $r \ll r_\text{ISCO}$, independent of the angular momentum of the massive particle. Crucially, the absence of a horizon allows the resulting VHFQPO's to escape to infinity, spanning the range from 1kHz ($M = 10M_\odot$) to 25 kHz ($M = 2M_\odot$). Within the paradigm of non-singular spacetime geometries, the absence of such VHFQPO's from X-ray binary spectra implies the presence of a horizon around the central, compact object.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Properties of Neutron Stars with Hyperons within a Relativistic Metamodel</a><span class="id">[2510.00997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we study the effects of $\Lambda$-hyperons on neutron star properties employing a metamodel framework for the equation of state (EoS).

In the case of relating hyperonic couplings via $SU(6)$-symmetry arguments to the nucleonic ones, we find that NS radii for intermediate mass stars are shifted to higher values compared with purely nucleonic stars, in agreement with the existing literature.

A striking signature is that any infalling object appears to orbit at $\Omega_H$ due to frame dragging, while its emitted signals decay exponentially at a rate set by $\kappa$ as a consequence of gravitational redshift. Recent theoretical work predicts that the merger phase of gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescences carries direct imprints of the remnant horizon's properties, via a &quot;direct wave&quot; component that (i) oscillates near $2\Omega_H$, reflecting the horizon's frame dragging and the quadrupole nature of the gravitational radiation, and (ii) decays at an increasing rate characterized by $\kappa$, with additional screening from the black hole's potential barrier. In this paper, we report observational evidence for the direct wave in GW250114 with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of $14.0^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ ($13.5^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$) in the LIGO Hanford (Livingston) detector. The measured properties are in full agreement with theoretical predictions.

Although the tearing-mode instability is commonly thought to trigger a plasmoid cascade that enables fast reconnection - i.e., independent of $S$ - our results, in broad agreement with the recent findings of Morillo &amp; Alexakis (2025), challenge this belief. We demonstrate a Sweet-Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \sim 10^4$. For larger values, plasmoid formation sets in leading to a slight enhancement of the reconnection rate, $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/3}$, consistent with the prediction from linear tearing mode induced reconnection, indicating that reconnection remains resistivity dependent, and therefore slow. In our simulations, the plasmoids do not form a cascade of mergers, as they are rapidly advected out of the reconnection layer. Our findings call for the revision of the role of plasmoid formation in 2D high Lundquist number magnetic reconnection. Even if future studies demonstrate that 2D plasmoid-reconnection becomes resistivity-independent at sufficiently large $S$, directly extending those results to 3D astrophysical environments is not justified, as in realistic circumstances, the increase of $S$ also raises the Reynolds number of the outflows, making it essential to account for the dominant role of turbulence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imaging Venus' surface at night in the near-IR from above its clouds: New analytical models for the effective spatial resolution, illustrated with new Parker Solar Probe data</a><span class="id">[2211.07848]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There are a handful of spectral windows in the near-IR through which we can see down to Venus' surface on the night side of the planet. The surface of our sister planet has thus been imaged by sensors on Venus-orbiting platforms (Venus Express, Akatsuki) and during fly-by with missions to other planets (Galileo, Cassini). The most tantalizing finding, so far, is the hint of possible active volcanism. However, the thermal radiation emitted by Venus' searing surface (c. 475 degrees C) has to get through the opaque clouds between 50 and 70 km altitude, as well as the sub-cloud atmosphere. In the clouds, the light is not absorbed but scattered, indeed, many times. This results in blurring the surface imagery to the point where the smallest discernible feature is roughly 100 km in size, full-width half-max (FWHM), and this has been reproduced using numerical models. We propose a new analytical modeling framework for predicting the width of the atmospheric point-spread function (APSF) that determines the effective resolution of surface imaging from space. Our best estimates of the APSF width for the 1-to-1.2 micron spectral range are clustered around 130 km FWHM. Interestingly, this is somewhat larger than the accepted value of 100 km based on both visual image inspection and detailed numerical simulations. Lastly, we apply the new modeling framework to the fly-by imaging by the Parker Solar Probe in a somewhat shorter wavelength band.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09411" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slaying Axion-Like Particles via Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes from Supercooled Phase Transition</a><span class="id">[2401.09411]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from density fluctuations due to supercooled phase transitions (PTs) triggered in an axion-like particle (ALP) model. We find that the mass of the PBHs is inversely correlated with the ALP decay constant $f_a$. For instance, for $f_a$ varying from ${\cal O}$(100 MeV) to ${\cal O}$($10^{12}$ GeV), the PBH mass varies between $(10^{3} - 10^{-24}) M_{\odot}$. We then identify the ALP parameter space where the PBH can account for the entire (or partial) dark matter fraction of the Universe, in a single (multi-component) dark matter scenario, with the ALP being the other dark matter candidate. The PBH parameter space ruled out by current cosmological and microlensing observations can thus be directly mapped onto the ALP parameter space, thus providing new bounds on ALPs, complementary to the laboratory and astrophysical ALP constraints. Similarly, depending on the ALP couplings to other Standard Model particles, the ALP constraints on $f_a$ can be translated into a lower bound on the PBH mass scale. Moreover, the supercooled PT leads to a potentially observable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signal at future GW observatories, such as aLIGO, LISA and ET, that acts as another complementary probe of the ALPs, as well as of the PBH dark matter. Finally, we show that the recent NANOGrav signal of stochastic GW in the nHz frequency range can be explained in our model with $f_a\simeq (10~{\rm GeV}-1~{\rm TeV})$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13993" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundamental modes of rotating neutron stars with various degrees of differential rotation in dynamical spacetimes</a><span class="id">[2401.13993]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Violent astrophysical events, including core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, can result in rotating neutron stars with diverse degrees of differential rotation. Oscillation modes of these neutron stars could be excited and emit strong gravitational waves. Detecting these modes may provide information about neutron stars, including their structures and dynamics. Hence, dynamical simulations were employed to construct relations for quantifying the oscillation mode frequency in previous studies. Specifically, linear relations for the frequencies of fundamental $l=0$ quasi-radial mode $f_{F}$ and fundamental $l=2$ quadrupolar mode $f_{^2f}$ were constructed by simulations with the Cowling approximation. Nevertheless, these relations can overestimate $f_{F}$ and underestimate $f_{^2f}$ up to $\sim 30\%$. Furthermore, it has yet to be fully studied how the degree of differential rotation affects $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$. Here, for the first time, we consider both various degrees of differential rotation $\Tilde{A}$ and dynamical spacetime to construct linear relations for quantifying $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$. Through 2D axisymmetric simulations, we first show that both $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$ scale almost linearly with the stellar compactness $M/R$ for different values of $\Tilde{A}$. We also observe the quasi-linear relations for both $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$ with the kinetic-to-binding energy ratio $T/|W|$ for different $\Tilde{A}$ values. Finally, we constructed linear fits that can quantify $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$ by $T/|W|$. Consequently, this work updated the relations for the fundamental modes of rotating neutron stars with differential rotations in dynamical spacetime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Badminton Birdie-Like Aerodynamic Alignment of Drifting Dust Grains by Subsonic Gaseous Flows in Protoplanetary Disks</a><span class="id">[2407.10025]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent (sub)millimeter polarization observations of protoplanetary disks reveal toroidally aligned, effectively prolate dust grains large enough (at least  100 $\mu$m) to efficiently scatter millimeter light. The alignment mechanism for these grains remains unclear. We explore the possibility that gas drag aligns grains through gas-dust relative motion when the grain's center of mass is offset from its geometric center, analogous to a badminton birdie's alignment in flight. A simple grain model of two non-identical spheres illustrates how a grain undergoes damped oscillations from flow-induced restoring torques which align its geometric center in the flow direction relative to its center of mass. Assuming specular reflection and subsonic flow, we derive an analytical equation of motion for spheroids where the center of mass can be shifted away from the spheroid's geometric center. We show that a prolate or an oblate grain can be aligned with the long axis parallel to the gas flow when the center of mass is shifted along that axis. Both scenarios can explain the required effectively prolate grains inferred from observations. Application to a simple disk model shows that the alignment timescales are shorter than or comparable to the orbital time. The grain alignment direction in a disk depends on the disk (sub-)structure and grain Stokes number (St) with azimuthal alignment for large St grains in sub-Keplerian smooth gas disks and for small St grains near the gas pressure extrema, such as rings and gaps.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fermion-Boson Stars as Attractors in Fuzzy Dark Matter and Ideal Gas Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2412.13382]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the context of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) we study the core formation in the presence of an Ideal Gas (IG).

Recent ACT observation suggests that the constraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ at CMB scale may be shifted to a larger value than the predictions in the Starobinsky model, the Higgs inflation, and the $\alpha$-attractor model, which motivates us to consider the modification of the pole inflation. We find that if we regularize the second order pole in the kinetic term such that the kinetic term becomes regular for all field range, we can generally increase $n_s$ because the potential in the large field regime will be lifted. We have explicitly demonstrated that this type of regularized pole inflation can naturally arise from the Einstein-Cartan formalism, and the inflationary predictions are consistent with the latest ACT data without spoiling the success of the $\alpha$-attractor models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Multispacecraft Analysis and Modeling of Type III Radio Burst Exciter Deceleration in Inhomogeneous Heliospheric Plasma</a><span class="id">[2504.18312]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Electron beams accelerated in solar flares and escaping from the Sun along open magnetic field lines can trigger intense radio emissions known as type III solar radio bursts.

The model predicts that the beam velocity decreases as $u(f)\propto f^{1/4}(r)$, so the acceleration changes $\propto r^{-1.58}$ (and speed as $\propto r^{-0.29}$) for the plasma density profile $n(r)\propto r^{-2.3}$. The deceleration is consistent with the average observation values corrected for the type III source locations. Intriguingly, the observations also show differences in velocity and acceleration of the same type III observed by different spacecrafts. We suggest the difference could be related to the additional time delay caused by radio-wave scattering between the spacecraft and the source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal effects on primordial black hole capture in neutron stars</a><span class="id">[2505.04709]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit the problem of the capture of a primordial black hole (PBH) by a neutron star, accounting for the tidal perturbation from a nearby star or planet.

We show how this effect depends on environmental parameters and can weaken the proposed constraints based on observations of old neutron stars in high-density dark matter environments for PBH masses $\lesssim 10^{22}\,$g.

Using NewAthena/X-IFU and simulation based inference to constrain turbulence</a><span class="id">[2505.14378]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. The NewAthena mission planned for launch in the late 2030s will carry X-IFU, an integral field unit spectrometer that will obtain unique insight into the X-ray hot universe through its combination of spectral and spatial capabilities. Its high spectral resolution will allow a mapping of turbulent velocities of the hot gas in galaxy clusters, providing an unrivaled way to study the complex dynamics within galaxy clusters. Aims. This is the fourth in a series of papers aimed at forecasting the ability to investigate turbulence in the intracluster medium through the observation of the centroid shift caused by turbulent motions of the gas. In this paper we improve on previous methods by investigating the ability of simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the underlying nature of velocity fluctuations through the use of standard observational diagnostics, such as the structure function. Methods. We rely on a complex architecture of neural networks in order to model the likelihood and posterior distributions relevant to our case. We investigate its capability to retrieve the turbulence parameters on mock observations, and explore its capability to use alternative summary statistics. Results. Our trained models are able to infer the parameters of the intracluster gas velocity power-spectrum in independently simulated X-IFU observations of a galaxy cluster. We evaluated the precision of the recovery for different models. We show the necessity to use methods such as SBI to avoid an under-estimation of the sources of variance by comparing the results to our previous paper. We confirm that sample variance severely impacts the precision of recovered turbulent features. Our results demonstrate the need for advanced modeling methods to tackle the complexity of the physical information nested within future observations expected from X-IFU/NewAthena.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modelling multiwavelength afterglows of the VHE-GRB population</a><span class="id">[2505.18041]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recent detection of very high energy (VHE, $\gtrsim$ 100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has provided new insights into afterglow physics. Understanding the temporal and spectral evolution of VHE GRBs requires detailed modelling of multiwavelength observations spanning radio to VHE $\gamma$ rays. Previous studies interpreted afterglow of VHE GRBs using a range of frameworks, including single- and multi-zone jet configurations, synchrotron radiation from forward and reverse shocks, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) processes, as well as hadronic emission processes. We have modeled five long-duration VHE GRBs - GRB 180720B, GRB 190114C, GRB 190829A, GRB 201216C and GRB 221009A; using the NAIMA code and modifications to it. The results from our analysis indicate that SSC is the dominant VHE emission mechanism, with negligible contribution from external Compton. Most VHE GRBs are well described by the forward shock model in a spherical jet configuration, where constant density interstellar medium is preferred over wind medium. Additionally, we find that VHE GRBs tend to occur in environments with lower magnetic fields and higher ambient medium densities. Interestingly, VHE GRBs lie at the edge of the $3\sigma$ region of the $E_{\rm k,iso}$ - $\epsilon_B$ correlation observed in other energetic GRBs. Our model slightly over predicts the radio fluxes, indicating that a more complicated modelling might be required in some cases. These findings provide crucial constraints on VHE GRB emission sites and mechanisms and serve as a benchmark for future observations and theoretical studies in the era of CTA and next-generation $\gamma$-ray observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22516" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Updated predictions for gravitational wave emission from TDEs for next generation observatories</a><span class="id">[2505.22516]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we investigate the gravitational wave (GW) emission from stars tidally disrupted by black holes (TDEs), using a semi-analytical approach.

On top of this, we also extend the analysis to a population of repeated-partial TDEs, where the star undergoes multiple passages around the black hole before complete disruption. For both populations, we estimate the rate of individual GW-detections considering future observatories like LISA and a potential deci-Hertz (dHz) mission, and derive the GW background from these sources. Our conclusions, even if more conservative, are consistent with previous results presented in literature. In fact, full disruptions of stars will not be seen by LISA but will be important targets for dHz observatories. In contrast, GWs from repeated disruptions will not be detectable in the near future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22373" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmography with DESI DR2 and SN data</a><span class="id">[2506.22373]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we present a kinematic analysis of the Universe's expansion history using cosmography, with a particular emphasis on the jerk parameter $j_0$, which is equal to one in the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario.

We confirm that all of these are consistent with persistent drift direction changes. These 'bi-drifting' pulsars present a challenge to the classical carousel model for sub-pulse drifting. In general, bi-drifting in this expanded sample is less clear than some of the previously published cases, which we attribute to narrower profile widths ($&lt;20$ degrees) or smaller $P_3$ values (close to 2$P$). However, given the broad variety of pulse shapes and drift behaviours across the pulsar population, it is unsurprising that the phenomenon is not limited to only those where it can most easily be detected. Four of our samples show at least two emission modes with different profile shapes and drift properties, which seems to be a relatively common feature of bi-drifting pulsars. We also find jumps in sub-pulse phase between adjacent components in two pulsars. In addition to our MeerKAT L-band data, we used GMRT observations for four, and MeerKAT UHF observations for two of these pulsars to investigate the frequency dependence of sub-pulse drift. We find subtle changes in the drift as a function of frequency, but no clear overall pattern. Looking at the distribution of bi-drifting pulsars over $P$, $\dot{P}$ and $P_3$ suggests they are consistent with the underlying population of all drifting pulsars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20428" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revising the Giant Planet Mass-Metallicity Relation: Deciphering the Formation Sequence of Giant Planets</a><span class="id">[2509.20428]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rate at which giant planets accumulate solids and gas is a critical component of planet formation models, yet it is extremely challenging to predict from first principles. Characterizing the heavy element (everything other than hydrogen and helium) content of giant planets provides important clues about their provenance. Using thermal evolution models with updated H-He EOS and atmospheric boundary condition that varies with envelope metallicity, we quantify the bulk heavy element content of 147 warm ($&lt; 1000$ K) giant planets with well-measured masses and radii, more than tripling the sample size studied in Thorngren et al. 2016. These measurements reveal that the population's heavy element mass follows the relation $M_{\rm Z} = M_{\rm core} + f_Z (M_{\rm p} - M_{\rm core})$, with $M_{\rm core} = 14.7^{+1.8}_{-1.6}$ Earth masses (M$_\oplus$), $f_Z = 0.09 \pm 0.01$, and an astrophysical scatter of $0.66 \pm 0.08 \times M_Z$. The classical core-accretion scenario ($Z_{\rm p} = 1$ at 10 M$_\oplus$ and $Z_{\rm p} = 0.5$ at 20 M$_\oplus$) is inconsistent with the population. At low planet masses ($&lt;&lt; 150$ M$_\oplus$), $M_{\rm Z} \sim M_{\rm core}$ and as a result, $Z_{\rm p} = M_{\rm Z} / M_{\rm p}$ declines linearly with $M_{\rm p}$. However, bulk metallicity does not continue to decline with planet mass and instead flattens out at $f_Z \sim 0.09$ ($\sim 7 \times$ solar metallicity). When normalized by stellar metallicity, $Z_{\rm p} / Z_\star$ flattens out at $3.3 \pm 0.5$ at high planet masses. This explicitly shows that giant planets continue to accrete material enriched in heavy elements during the gas accretion phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-long Gamma-ray Bursts from Micro-Tidal Disruption Events: The Case of GRB 250702B</a><span class="id">[2509.22779]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs), a rare class of high-energy transients with durations $&gt;10^3$s, remain poorly understood. GRB 250702B is notable for its multi-hour prompt emission, an X-ray precursor $\sim$1 day earlier, off-nuclear host position, and hard, rapidly variable gamma-rays. This combination is difficult to explain with standard ULGRB progenitors such as blue-supergiant collapsars, magnetar engines, or white-dwarf tidal disruptions by intermediate-mass black holes. We interpret the event as a micro-tidal disruption event ($\mu$TDE), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star partially or fully disrupts a main-sequence star. Three $\mu$TDE pathways can reproduce the observed precursor-main flare delay: (i) a dynamical (partial/repeating) disruption, in which a grazing passage yields a faint precursor and the core returns after $\sim$day for a deeper encounter; (ii) a natal-kick disruption, where the delay reflects the ballistic motion of a newborn compact object relative to its companion, leading to full disruption; and (iii) a hybrid natal-kick + partial case, in which the kick seeds the close encounter but the first passage is only partial, with the core returning on the day-scale period. Cross-section scalings imply comparable rates for partial and full outcomes in both dynamical and natal-kick scenarios. The highly variable, hard $\gamma$-ray emission supports association with a stellar-mass compact object. Fallback and viscous accretion naturally explain the ultra-long duration, energetics, and ks-scale X-ray variability. We outline observational discriminants between the three channels and argue that $\mu$TDEs offer a compelling framework for ULGRBs such as GRB 250702B.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comprehensive X-ray Observations of the Exceptional Ultra-long X-ray and Gamma-ray Transient GRB 250702B with Swift, NuSTAR, and Chandra: Insights from the X-ray Afterglow Properties</a><span class="id">[2509.22787]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRB 250702B is an exceptional transient that produced multiple episodes of luminous gamma-ray radiation lasting for $&gt;25$ ks, placing it among the class of ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, unlike any known GRB, the \textit{Einstein Probe} detected soft X-ray emission up to 24 hours before the gamma-ray triggers. We present comprehensive X-ray observations of the transient's afterglow obtained with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory between 0.5 to 65 days (observer frame) after the initial high-energy trigger. The X-ray emission decays steeply as $\sim t^{-1.9}$, and shows short timescale X-ray variability ($\Delta T/T &lt; 0.03$) in both Swift and NuSTAR, consistent with flares superposed on an external shock continuum. Serendipitous detections by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) out to $\sim$0.3 days and continued NuSTAR variability to $\sim$2 days imply sustained central engine activity; including the precursor, the required engine duration is $\gtrsim 3$ days. Afterglow modeling favors the combination of forward and reverse shock emission in a wind-like ($k \approx 2$) environment. These properties, especially the long-lived engine and early soft X-ray emission, are difficult to reconcile with a collapsar origin, and GRB 250702B does not fit neatly with canonical ultra-long GRBs or relativistic tidal disruption events (TDEs). A hybrid scenario in which a star is disrupted by a stellar-mass black hole (a micro-TDE) provides a plausible explanation, although a relativistic TDE from an intermediate-mass black hole remains viable. Decisive discrimination between progenitors will require sensitive late-time X-ray observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the nature of GW200105 by probing the frequency evolution of eccentricity</a><span class="id">[2509.26152]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GW200105 is a compact binary coalescence (CBC) event, consisting of a neutron star and a black hole, observed in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's (LVK's) third observing run (O3). Recent reanalyses of the event using state-of-the-art waveform models have claimed observation of signatures of an eccentric orbit. It has nevertheless been pointed out in the literature that certain physical or modified gravity effects could mimic eccentricity by producing a spurious non-zero eccentricity value, at a given reference frequency, when recovered with an eccentric waveform model. We recently developed a model-independent Eccentricity Evolution Consistency Test (EECT, S. A. Bhat et al. 2025) to identify such mimickers, by comparing the measured frequency $\textit{evolution}$ of eccentricity, $e(f)$, with that expected from General Relativity (GR). In this $\textit{Letter}$, we apply EECT to GW200105 and find that it satisfies EECT within 68% confidence. Our analysis therefore lends complementary support in favour of the eccentricity hypothesis, while also providing a novel test of the consistency of $e(f)$ with GR.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tests of Evolving Dark Energy with Geometric Probes of the Late-Time Universe</a><span class="id">[2509.26480]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have shown a strong statistical preference for a time-evolving dark energy model over $\Lambda$CDM when combining BAO, CMB, and supernova (SN) data. We investigate the robustness of this conclusion by isolating geometric information in weak lensing measurements from the DES Year 3 survey and combining it with different datasets. We introduce a hyperparameter, $\Omega_{\rm m}^{\rm growth}$, to decouple the growth contribution from the lensing 2-point correlation and thus bypass the possible effect of the $\sigma_8$ tension in our analysis. We then combine with the late-time geometric probes provided by BAO and SN, along with CMB primary data. The preference for evolving dark energy is consistent with the DESI-DR2 findings: when combining BAO, primary CMB, and weak lensing data, the $w_0w_a$CDM is preferred at about the $3\sigma$ significance. However, when we add SN, the result is sensitive to the choice of data: if we leave out $z&lt;0.1$ SN data in the analysis, as a test of the effect of inhomogeneous calibration, we obtain a statistical significance below $2\sigma$ for time evolving dark energy. Indeed, the high-z only SN data \textbf{lowers} the evidence for evolving dark energy in all the data combinations we have examined. This underscores the importance of improved SN samples at low redshift and of alternative data combinations. We show that cosmic shear measurements with LSST Year 1 data will provide comparable power to current SN data. We discuss other low-redshift probes provided by lensing and galaxy clustering to test for evolving dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01876" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A nonperturbative test of nucleation calculations for strong phase transitions</a><span class="id">[2404.01876]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nucleation rate computations are of broad importance in particle physics and cosmology.

The computational mesh is divided into smaller elements that touch but do not overlap. Like a pure DG method, our new hybrid scheme requires information exchange only at the surface of neighboring elements. This avoids the need for ghost zones that are usually many points deep in traditional FV implementations. Furthermore, unlike traditional FV implementations, that need information exchange between each element and its 26 surrounding neighbors on noncuboid meshes, our new hybrid method exchanges information only between each element and its six nearest neighbors. With this reduced communication, we aim to retain the high scalability of DG when using large supercomputers. In addition, the information exchange between adjacent elements is much simpler than in a traditional FV implementation, because we always have grid points at the interface, so that only surface interpolation is required. As a result it is much easier to implement adaptive mesh refinement. The goal is to use DG in elements with smooth matter fields and to fall back onto the more robust FV/FD method in elements that contain nonsmooth shocks or star surfaces. For this we devise trouble criteria to decide whether an element should be evolved with DG or FV/FD. We use the Nmesh program to implement and test the new scheme. We successfully evolve various single neutron star cases. These include the challenging cases of a neutron star initially in an unstable equilibrium migrating to a stable configuration and a boosted neutron star. These cases are simulated for the first time here in full 3D with general relativistic hydrodynamics using DG methods. We also describe additional numerical methods, such as the limiters and the atmosphere treatment we need for our simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A quantitative analysis of Galilei's observations of Jupiter satellites from the Sidereus Nuncius</a><span class="id">[2503.12543]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new careful and comprehensive analysis the observations of the satellites of Jupiter from the Sidereus Nuncius that extends and complements previous similar studies.

The work considers both the information that can be extracted from the sketches and the angular measurements reported by Galilei. Angular measurements allow assessing the absolute accuracy in relation to modern ephemerides. We evaluate the performances of the telescope in terms of separation power of close-by satellites and the inefficiency in the detection connected to the proximity to the disk. A sinusoidal fit of the data, allows measuring the relative major semi-axes of the satellites' orbits and their periods with a statistical precision of 2-4\% and 0.1-0.3\% respectively. The posterior fit error is used to estimate the measurements precision. We show that with this data one can infer in a convincing way the third law of Kepler for the Jupiter system. The 1:2:4 orbital resonance between the periods of Io and Europa/Ganymede can be determined with \% precision. In order to obtain these results it is important to separate the four datasets. This operation was an extremely difficult task for Galilei. Nevertheless we show how some indication on the periods emerge from the using the modern Lomb-Scargle technique on the full data-set.
