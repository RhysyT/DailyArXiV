Successful and choked jets, as well as the accretion disk, corona, wind, and outflow regions in a TDE have been examined and shown to produce TeV - PeV neutrinos. In this work, we use the IceCube 12.5 year high energy starting events (HESE) dataset and perform a maximum likelihood analysis to investigate the spatial and temporal correlations between HESE dataset and a selected sample of 89 TDEs. Our results indicate that the currently observed data do not show any significant correlation and hence is consistent with the background only hypothesis. Using this result, we place constraints on the fraction of TDEs harboring intrinsic jets ($f_{\rm jet}$) and the corresponding isotropic-equivalent cosmic ray (CR) energy ($\mathcal{E}_{\rm CR}$). We note that even with limited statistics, we can constrain the parameter space as $\mathcal{E}_{\rm CR} \lesssim 3 \times 10^{53}$ erg for $f_{\rm jet} \gtrsim 0.6$ at more than 90% C.L. Finally, we discuss the theoretical implications of our results and the limits on the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux from TDEs. With more observational data in the electromagnetic band for TDEs and neutrino observations from IceCube and KM3NeT, our analysis can be used to place stringent constraints on physical parameters associated with TDEs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20953" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbulent Dynamo Action in Binary Neutron Star Mergers</a><span class="id">[2601.20953]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binary neutron star mergers are expected to generate intense magnetic fields that power relativistic and non-relativistic outflows and shape their multimessenger signatures. These fields likely arise from the turbulent amplification of initially weak magnetic fields during the merger, particularly via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the collisional interface between the stars. While previous studies have shown efficient amplification to magnetar-level strengths, the degree of large-scale coherence of the resulting field remains uncertain. We present general-relativistic, dynamical spacetime, magnetohydrodynamic simulations following the evolution of initially weak, pulsar-like magnetic fields in a binary neutron star merger. We find rapid magnetic field growth at small scales with clear signatures of small-scale turbulent dynamo action. At the highest resolutions, we additionally observe the emergence of coherent magnetic structures on larger scales. Our results imply that strong, ordered magnetic fields may be present immediately after merger, with important implications for the subsequent evolution of the remnant and its observable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First constraints on causal sources of primordial gravitational waves from BICEP/Keck, SPTpol, SPT-3G, Planck and WMAP $B$-mode data</a><span class="id">[2601.20958]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Non-inflationary sources of gravitational waves in the early Universe generically predict causality-limited tensor power spectra at low frequencies. We report the first-ever constraints on such sources based on cosmic microwave background (CMB) $B$-mode polarization measurements. Using data from BICEP/Keck, SPTpol, SPT-3G, Planck, and WMAP, we constrain the amplitude of an early causal tensor (ECT) power spectrum parameterized by $r_{ect}$, the ratio of causal tensor power to total scalar power at $k~=~0.01$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and obtain a 95% CL upper limit of $r_{ect}&lt;$ 0.0077. Since $r_{ect}$ can easily be related to the parameters of a given theory, our bound robustly constrains a broad class of well-motivated gravitational wave sources in the early universe, including first-order cosmological phase transitions, enhanced small-scale density perturbations, and various topological defects. Finally, we translate our limit into a bound on the present-day energy density in gravitational waves at ultra-low frequencies otherwise inaccessible to traditional gravitational wave detection strategies, including pulsar timing arrays, interferometers, and resonant cavities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early results in the search for extreme coronal line emitters with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</a><span class="id">[2601.20964]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Here we present the results of our search through the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) - a rare classification of galaxies displaying strong, high-ionization iron coronal emission lines within their spectra. With the requirement of a strong X-ray continuum to generate the coronal emission, ECLEs have been linked to both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). We focus our search on identifying TDE-linked ECLEs. We identify three such objects within the EDR sample, highlighting DESI's effectiveness for discovering new nuclear transients, and determine a galaxy-normalized TDE-linked ECLE rate of $R_\mathrm{G}=5~^{+5}_{-3}\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{galaxy}^{-1}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at a median redshift of z = 0.2 - broadly consistent with previous works. Additionally, we also identify more than 200 AGNs displaying coronal emission lines, which serve as the primary astrophysical contaminants in searches for TDE-related events. We also include an outline of the custom python code developed for this search.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposal to Search for the CP Violating Electromagnetic Vacuum Angle at the Event Horizon Telescope</a><span class="id">[2601.20965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine the possibility that evidence for a non-zero value of the CP violating $ \frac{e^2 }{32\pi^2}\theta_{EM} \int d^4 x {\vec E}\cdot {\vec B}$ coupling might be extracted from Event Horizon Telescope observations of the black holes SgA* and M87*. The Fischler-Kundu\cite{FK} effect predicts a universal Hall current in the relaxation of charge falling onto the black hole horizon. We argue that this leads to a non-zero value of a certain CP-violating observable ${\cal C}$, defined below. The effect can be masked by parity violating plasma currents. In particular, evidence for polarization flips \cite{flip} in the signals from M87* indicate strong plasma effects in the data. We suggest that time averaging the data over periods including the flip might leave over a residual that would be an indicator of the FK signal. In addition, similarities in the polarization patterns between the two very different black holes, and a part of the signal that is uniform in frequency, might enable us to distinguish the universal topological signal from source and frequency dependent plasma effects. Current data does not appear to be sufficient to perform such a test.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Third Option: Color Phase Curves to Characterize the Atmospheres of Temperate Rocky Exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2601.20966]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detecting and characterizing the atmospheres of rocky exoplanets has proven to be challenging for JWST. Transit spectroscopy of the TRAPPIST-1 planets has been impacted by the effects of spots and faculae on the host star. Secondary eclipses have detected hot rocks, but evidence for atmospheres has been difficult to obtain. However, there is a third option that we call color phase curves. This method will apply to synchronously rotating non-transiting planets as well as transiting planets. A color phase curve uses photometry at a long-IR wavelength near the peak of the planetary thermal emission (e.g., 21 microns) divided by photometry at a shorter wavelength where the star dominates more strongly (e.g., 12 microns). We avoid wavelengths having potentially strong molecular absorption (e.g., 15 microns) to minimize degeneracies in the color phase curve, and we aim to detect and characterize the planetary atmosphere via its longitudinal heat transfer. The ratio of two wavelengths observed nearly simultaneously is designed to isolate thermal emission from the planet, discriminate against the star, and largely cancel instrumental systematic effects. Moreover, we show that invoking mass-radius relations, and using self-consistent physical models, will permit the longitudinal heat transfer to be measured independent of the orbital inclination. Radial velocity surveys are detecting many new exoplanets, including temperate rocky worlds with Earth-like masses. Most of those planets will not transit, but color phase curves have the potential to detect and characterize their atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Universal CMB $B$-Mode Spectrum from Early Causal Tensor Sources</a><span class="id">[2601.20967]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many early universe scenarios predict post-inflationary tensor perturbations from causality-limited, sub-horizon sources. While the microphysical details may differ, as long as these sources are bounded in duration and correlation length, their tensor power spectra exhibit a universal scaling behavior at small wavenumber: $P_h(k) \propto k^3$, corresponding to white noise on super-horizon scales at the time of production. If these early causal tensor sources (ECTs) exclusively produce gravitational waves before redshift $z \sim 10^5$, this scaling is realized on all of the scales observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and thus yields a universal multipole distribution for the $B$-mode angular power spectrum. Unlike the scale-invariant distributions of inflationary $B$ modes, ECTs generically predict enhanced power on small scales and suppressed power on large scales, which allows these source classes to be distinguished given measurements over a sufficient range of angular scales. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for characterizing ECTs and demonstrate how their universal infrared scaling manifests in low-frequency observables, including CMB $B$ modes and stochastic gravitational wave spectral densities. We illustrate this mapping with representative case studies of this universality class involving first-order phase transitions, topological defects, and enhanced scalar perturbations, which source tensor modes at second order in perturbation theory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Lambert $W$ equation of state in light of DESI BAO</a><span class="id">[2601.20972]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the hypothesis that the evolution of the Universe can be described by a single dark fluid whose effective equation of state (EoS), $\omega_{\rm{eff}}$, is a linear combination of a logarithmic term and a power law term, both involving the Lambert $W$ function. This particular form of EoS was first proposed by S. Saha and K. Bamba in 2019 and has two parameters, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, which must be determined from observations. To this end, we place limits on these parameters by combining recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data – including measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) – with Type Ia supernova observations from the Pantheon+ compilation, along with direct determinations of the Hubble parameter. From this combined analysis, we obtain a best-fit value for the Hubble parameter, $H_0 = 67.4 \pm 1.2~\text{km\,s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, while current measurements of the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch yield $r_d = 146\pm 2.5$ Mpc. Furthermore, we study the evolution of the deceleration parameter, the effective EoS, and the jerk parameter, and support our findings using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. The model exhibits noticeable deviations from the predictions of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. Despite these differences, our results indicate that the model provides a coherent description of late-time cosmic evolution and the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe. Finally, we assess the observational viability of the model using information criteria, particularly the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and compare these results with those obtained for the $\Lambda$CDM model, which serves as our reference.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">27 years of Spaceborne IR Astronomy: An ISO, Spitzer, WISE and NEOWISE Survey for Large-Amplitude Variability in Young Stellar Objects</a><span class="id">[2601.21013]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Infrared observations can probe photometric variability across the full evolutionary range of young stellar objects (YSOs), from deeply embedded protostars to pre-main-sequence stars with dusty disks. We present 3-8 micron light curves extending 27 years from 1997 to 2024 obtained with three space-based IR telescopes: ISO, Spitzer and WISE. Although unevenly sampled with large gaps in coverage, these light curves show variability on time scales ranging from days to decades. We focus on the Spitzer-identified YSOs with disks and envelopes that exhibit variations of a factor of two or more in this wavelength range. We identified seven YSOs where the light curves are dominated by bursts of sustained (&gt; 5 yr) high flux, including four that show a steep decay ending the burst and three that are ongoing as of the final observation. We find six YSOs that are undergoing declines, which may be the end of bursts that began before 1997. The most common form of variability, exhibited by 26 YSOs in our sample, show variations over time intervals of years to months but do not exhibit sustained bursts or fades. The Spitzer [3.6]-[4.5] and WISE [3.5]-[4.6] colors either increase or remain constant with increasing brightness, inconsistent with dust extinction as being the primary source of the large-amplitude variability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards precision astrometry of scattered images of compact radio sources: scintillometry theory and prospects</a><span class="id">[2601.21041]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Compact radio sources such as pulsars and FRBs undergo scintillation in the interstellar medium (ISM) when scattered images interfere at the observer. “Scintillometry” refers to the range of techniques to extract astrometric information – such as the angular positions of the images and distances to the scattering screen and source – from scintillation observations. Pulsar scintillometry has proven to be a powerful technique, revealing rich and unexpected scattering phenomenology in the ISM and also shedding light on the emission physics of pulsars. FRB scintillometry stands to be a similarly powerful probe of FRB emission, as well as structure on tiny scales in ionized media beyond our galaxy, such as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). However, nascent FRB scintillation studies are far from the sophisticated lensing geometry reconstructions that have been performed for scintillating pulsars. In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for scintillometry, demonstrating that the full astrometric content of scintillation observations is contained within a single underlying observable: the instantaneous spatial wavefield. We relate the instantaneous spatial wavefield to more familiar concepts from the pulsar scintillometry literature, such as the dynamic spectrum. Using this framework, we discuss prospects and limitations for FRB scintillometry, towards the goal of full astrometric reconstructions of FRB lensing geometries. We show how key degeneracies in two-screen scattering measurements can be ameliorated. In addition, we discuss the possibility of inferring dispersion measure gradients across scintillation screens, which may shed light on the highly unconstrained physics of the cool CGM phase on tiny ($\sim 100\,{\rm au}$) scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21072" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermal emission spectra of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-33 b</a><span class="id">[2601.21072]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of exoplanetary atmospheres provide critical insights into their chemical composition, formation and evolution history. Ultra-hot Jupiters serve as excellent targets for atmospheric characterization; studies of these planets may yield key understanding of gas giant's formation and evolution history. We present a thermal emission study of WASP-33 b's dayside atmosphere, based on two secondary eclipse observations with CFHT/WIRCam in two specific narrow band filters, namely the CO and CH4$_{\rm on}$ filters, and archival data with HST/WFC3 and Spitzer. Stellar pulsations of the host star induce some quasi-periodic photometric variations, particularly in the CH4$_{\rm on}$ band, which are modelled and corrected in the high-precision differential light curves. An eclipse depth of $1565.2^{+228.6}_{-237.5}$ ppm and $914.3^{+56.1}_{-57.0}$ ppm is determined for the CO and CH4$_{\rm on}$ bands, respectively. Combined with HST/WFC3 and Spitzer data, our joint retrieval of WASP-33 b's dayside atmosphere reveals a high metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 1.52^{+0.35}_{-0.52}$), high C/O ratio (C/O $= 0.78^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$), and a thermal inversion layer, suggesting a formation history involving metal-rich gas accretion. We confirm the presence of the molecules H$_{2}$O, H$^{-}$ and CO, and report a tentative detection of TiO in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-33 b. Future higher precision observations with JWST may provide better understand constraints on the chemical abundances of oxygen and refractory element abundances to better WASP-33 b's formation and evolutionary pathway.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The First Quantitative Study of Tail Regrowth of CME-Driven Disconnection in Comet C/2023 P1 Nishimura</a><span class="id">[2601.21101]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Comet C/2023 P1 (Nishimura) was observed by the Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI), onboard the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, from 2023 September 1 to 14. During this period, the ion tail of the comet exhibited continual fluctuations and four tail disconnection events (TDEs), each coinciding with the passage of a coronal mass ejection (CME). In this work, we report on the ion tail dynamics of the best observed TDE, which occurred on September 11. The SoloHI white-light images reveal an abrupt bending, subsequent kinks, and severing of a downstream portion of the pre-existing ion tail. The onset of disconnection occurred $\sim$6.5 hours after the projected passage of the CME leading edge in the images, consistent with a CME flank encounter. After the disconnection, the ion tail reformed within $\sim$24 hours, with a regrowth rate of $\sim$86$\pm7~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, indicating the rate at which newly ionized material forms along the magnetic field draped around the comet's coma. After the TDE, the detached tail drifted anti-sunward at an estimated speed of $\sim$295$\pm20~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, comparable to the local CME flank's speed, suggesting that the severed plasma was most likely carried away from the comet by the CME. This study provides the first direct, quantitative characterization of comet-CME interactions and the subsequent regrowth phase of a cometary TDE. These measurements were achievable by SoloHI's unique inner-heliospheric coverage, thanks to a combination of high photometric sensitivity, short exposure times, and a wide field of view that preserves the fine-scale tail dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation. Decomposing components of the extragalactic background light using multi-band intensity mapping cross-correlations</a><span class="id">[2601.21111]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The extragalactic background light (EBL) fluctuations in the optical/near-IR encode the cumulative integrated galaxy light (IGL), diffuse intra-halo light (IHL), and high-$z$ sources from the epoch of reionisation (EoR), but they are difficult to disentangle with auto-spectra alone. We aim to decompose the EBL into its principal constituents using multi-band intensity mapping combined with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering. We develop a joint halo-model framework in which IHL follows a mass- and redshift-dependent luminosity scaling, IGL is set by an evolving Schechter luminosity function, and EoR emission is modelled with Pop II/III stellar emissivities and a binned star-formation efficiency. Using mock surveys in a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with ten spectral bands spanning 0.75-5.0$\rm \mu m$ in the NEP deep fields over about 100$°^2$ with source detections down to AB=20.5 for masking, and six redshift bins to $z=2.5$, we fit auto- and cross-power spectra using a MCMC method. The combined SPHEREx$\times$Euclid analysis recovers all fiducial parameters within 1$\sigma$ and reduces 1$\sigma$ uncertainties on IHL parameters by 10-35% relative to SPHEREx EBL-only, while EoR star-formation efficiency parameters improve by 20-35%. Cross-correlations reveal a stronger coupling of IHL than IGL to the shear field, enhancing component separation; conversely, the EoR contribution shows negligible correlation with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering, aiding its isolation in the EBL. Relative to the SPHEREx EBL-only case, the inferred IHL fraction as a function of halo mass is significantly tightened over $10^{11}-10^{14} M_{\odot}$, with uncertainties reduced by 5-30%, and the resulting star-formation rate density constraints extend to $z\sim 11$, with uncertainty reductions of 22-31%.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of a compact hierarchical triple main-sequence star system while searching for binary stars with compact objects</a><span class="id">[2601.21125]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have discovered a compact hierarchical triple main-sequence star system, which is cataloged as Gaia DR3 1010268155897156864 or TIC 21502513. Hereafter, we call it “G1010”. G1010 consists of a primary (the most massive) star and inner binary that orbit each other. The primary star is a $0.85_{-0.03}^{+0.03}\;{\rm M}_\odot$ main-sequence (MS) star, and the inner binary components are $0.63_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ and $0.61_{-0.02}^{+0.02}\;{\rm M}_\odot$ MS stars. The outer and inner orbital periods are $277.2_{-1.3}^{+1.6}$ and $\sim 18.26$ days, respectively. G1010 is categorized as a single-lined spectroscopic binary, and its orbital solution indicates that G1010 possibly accompanies a massive compact object, such as a neutron star or massive white dwarf. In order to confirm the presence of a massive compact object, we have performed several-times low signal-to-ratio (SNR) and one-time high SNR spectroscopic observations, and determined the outer orbital parameters. Moreover, we have deeply analyzed the high SNR spectroscopic data, and found that G1010 accompanies not a massive compact object, but an inner binary. We have investigated G1010's light curve in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and concluded that the inner binary is actually an eclipsing binary, not included in TESS Eclipsing Binary Stars. We have obtained the inner orbital parameters from the TESS light curve. G1010 is similar to compact hierarchical triple star systems previously discovered by eclipse timing variation analysis. Our discovery has shown that such triple star systems can be discovered by combination of low- and high-SNR spectroscopic observations with the help of Gaia DR3 and the upcoming Gaia DR4/DR5.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pre-He White Dwarfs in Eclipsing Binaries.

The time-series spectra yielded the radial velocities (RVs) of the primary component and its atmospheric parameters, $T_{\rm eff,A}=7194\pm70$ K and $v_{\rm A}\sin i=68\pm9$ km s$^{-1}$. Joint modeling of our RVs and the archival TESS data provided component masses of $M_{\rm A}=1.930\pm0.054$ $M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm B}=0.211\pm0.005$ $M_\odot$, radii of $R_{\rm A}=1.922\pm0.020$ $R_\odot$ and $R_{\rm B}=0.207\pm0.005$ $R_\odot$, and luminosities of $L_{\rm A}=8.87\pm0.39$ $L_\odot$ and $L_{\rm B}=0.546\pm0.034$ $L_\odot$. The surface gravity and distance derived from this modeling are consistent with the model-independent $\log g_{\rm B}$ obtained from the direct observables and with the Gaia distance. The third light of $l_3=0.136\pm0.003$ comes mainly from two neighboring stars, TIC 399725539 and TIC 399725544. Comparison with stellar models indicates that TIC 399725538 A lies within the instability region of $\delta$ Sct$-$$\gamma$ Dor hybrids, whereas its extremely low-mass companion is markedly underluminous compared to theoretical white dwarf (WD) counterparts. Multifrequency analysis of the binary-subtracted residual lights revealed three significant signals, two of which correspond to aliases at two and four times the dominant frequency $f_1=0.0848$ day$^{-1}$. The $f_1$ frequency is likely a $\gamma$ Dor-type pulsation arising from the brighter A component, though further confirmation is required. Our results demonstrate that TIC 399725538 is a short-period EL CVn system belonging to the thick-disk population, consisting of a main-sequence $\gamma$ Dor pulsator and a helium-core WD precursor formed through stable mass transfer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strontium-84 Enrichments in Presolar Grains Provide First Evidence of p-process Nucleosynthesis in Core-collapse Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2601.21168]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study reports detection of rare p-process isotopes within presolar grains. Presolar grains are relic dust grains from dying stars. These microscopic dust particles are found in primitive solar system materials. Their distinct isotopic compositions record the nucleosynthetic processes in their parent stars and the Galactic chemical environment in which these stars formed. We studied presolar graphite grains of high-density type from the Murchison meteorite and found five grains with subgrains that show enrichments in 84Sr compared to the solar abundance.84Sr is the neutron-deficient isotope of strontium that can be produced in the deep oxygen-rich interior of high-mass stars that end their lives as core-collapse supernovae. The observed 84Sr excesses cannot be produced in low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, the source of most high-density presolar graphites found in meteorites. High-density graphites with embedded 84Sr excesses are, instead, compatible with a core-collapse supernovae origin. The graphite subgrains condensed from carbon-rich materials in the outer layers of core-collapse supernovae, where 84Sr was destroyed by neutron captures during hydrostatic evolution of the stars and their final explosion. Based on current theoretical stellar models, a few percent of contribution from the inner regions of core-collapse supernovae, which are enriched in p-process nuclides, to the outer carbon-rich regions is the most likely explanation for the observed enrichment of 84Sr in the subgrains of the high-density graphites. In this study, we present the first observational evidence that core-collapse supernovae produce and eject isotopes made by the p-process.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proposal of a Novel Physical Parameter Characterizing Solar Wind Speed in a Wave-Driven Model</a><span class="id">[2601.21229]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Empirical solar wind speed models play an important role in enabling space weather forecasting with low computational cost. Among these, one model called WS model is based on the asymptotic expansion factor. However, it is known that it fails in the case of pseudostreamers. In this study, as a first step toward constructing a solar wind speed empirical model based on physical parameters, we investigated the effect of the radial profile of flux-tube shape on the solar wind speed using one-dimensional numerical simulations. In the simulations, ad hoc Alfvén waves are injected from the photosphere at $r=R_\odot$ as the energy source, and the MHD equations are solved out to the interplanetary space at $r=70R_\odot$ to reproduce solar wind acceleration. As a result, even when the coronal base magnetic field and the asymptotic expansion factor are fixed, the final solar wind speed varies by approximately 300 km s$^{-1}$ depending on changes in the expansion height or non-monotonic expansion. Additionally, across all simulations performed, a better correlation is found with the quantities that reflect the information about the radial profile of flux-tube shape than the asymptotic expansion factor. Our results suggest that, as a physical characteristic parameter of the solar wind speed, an operation that can account for the expansion factor throughout the corona is necessary.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Realizing the phantom-divide crossing with vector and scalar fields</a><span class="id">[2601.21274]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In generalized Proca theories, characterized by a vector field with broken $U(1)$ gauge invariance, late-time cosmic acceleration can be realized with a dark energy equation of state in the regime $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$. In such scenarios, however, a phantom-divide crossing, as recently suggested by DESI observations, is not achieved without encountering theoretical inconsistencies. We incorporate a canonical scalar field with a potential, in addition to the vector field, and show that the phantom-divide crossing from $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$ can occur at low redshifts. We propose a minimal model that admits such a transition and identify the region of parameter space in which all dynamical degrees of freedom in the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors are free from ghost and Laplacian instabilities. We further investigate the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations by applying the quasi-static approximation to modes well inside the Hubble radius. The dimensionless quantities $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, which characterize the growth of matter perturbations and the bending of light rays, respectively, depend on the sound speed $c_\psi$ of the longitudinal scalar perturbation associated with the vector field. Since $c_\psi$ is influenced by the transverse vector mode, the model exhibits sufficient flexibility to yield values of $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ close to 1. Consequently, unlike theories such as scalar Galileons, the present model can be consistent with observations of redshift-space distortions and integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A redshift survey of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 2199 : No upturn of the faint-end slope of galaxy luminosity function</a><span class="id">[2601.21329]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We determine the galaxy luminosity function of cluster galaxies in the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 2199 (A2199), focusing on the faint-end slope down to $M_r \sim -14.5$. To achieve this, we augment the existing dataset by adding redshift data from our deep MMT/Hectospec survey and from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), significantly improving the spectroscopic completeness down to $r_{\mathrm{petro},0} = 20.8$ within the central $30^\prime$ region. The resulting luminosity function is well described by a Schechter function with a characteristic magnitude $M^* = -21.30 \pm 0.27$ and a faint-end slope $\alpha = -1.23 \pm 0.05$. This faint-end slope is consistent with those measured in the nearby Coma and Virgo clusters and in a cluster from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, and is slightly shallower than that of field galaxies. These findings indicate that the previously claimed steep faint-end upturn (with $\alpha \sim -2$) in nearby galaxy clusters is not supported. Instead, they indicate that environmental processes in dense cluster cores does not seem to trigger the formation or survival of low-mass galaxies, thereby preventing a steep faint-end upturn in the luminosity function.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross-correlating galaxies and cosmic dispersion measures: Constraints on the gas-to-halo mass relation from 2MASS galaxies and 133 localized fast radio bursts</a><span class="id">[2601.21336]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We conduct a cross-correlation analysis between large-scale structures traced by the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) galaxy catalog and the cosmic dispersion measures of 133 localized fast radio bursts (FRBs). The cross-correlation signal is measured as a function of the comoving separation $R$ between 2MASS galaxies and background FRB sightlines, making full use of the available redshift information for both datasets. Our measurements are consistent with a null detection over the range $0.01 &lt; R\, [h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}] &lt; 1$. Using a halo-based model in which free-electron density profiles are drawn from the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG-300 (TNG300), we show that the null signal at $R \sim 0.01\, h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ is inconsistent with the TNG300 prediction. This discrepancy indicates that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos with masses of $10^{12-13}\, M_\odot$ hosting 2MASS galaxies must be lower than that predicted by TNG300. A simple phenomenological modification of the TNG300 model suggests that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos of $10^{12-13}\, M_\odot$ should be below $\sim 10\%$ of the global baryon fraction in the nearby universe, implying the need for stronger feedback in this mass range. Our constraints are consistent with those inferred from X-ray emission and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements in galaxies, while providing a direct estimate of the hot-gas mass fraction that does not rely on electron-temperature measurements. These results demonstrate that galaxy-FRB cross correlations offer a powerful probe of feedback processes in galaxy formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coupled thermal-chemical evolution models of sub-Neptunes reveal atmospheric signatures of their formation location</a><span class="id">[2601.21377]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The observed masses and radii of sub-Neptunes can be explained by a variety of bulk compositions, with the two leading scenarios being the gas dwarf and the water world scenario. The evolutionary history of sub-Neptunes on a population level has been proposed as a method to distinguish between the possible bulk compositions. Previous evolutionary models, however, neglected the crucial role of chemical interactions between the atmosphere and interior. We present a novel evolution framework for sub-Neptunes that not only considers the thermal evolution but also takes the chemical coupling of atmosphere and interior into account. Using this model, we examine how planets formed inside and outside the ice line can be observationally distinguished. Young sub-Neptunes store the majority of their volatile budget in the interior, independent of formation location and thus initial composition. Nevertheless, the atmospheric metallicity is a factor 4 higher for the planet formed outside the ice line. As the planet cools, hydrogen and oxygen exsolve from the interior, leading to an increase in atmosphere mass fraction for both planets, counteracting the contraction due to cooling. Consequently, radius evolution alone cannot distinguish sub-Neptunes formed inside the water ice line from water-rich planets formed outside of it. Instead, a key discriminator is the abundance of carbon-bearing species and the resulting atmospheric C/O ratio. For water-rich sub-Neptunes formed outside the \ice line, almost all carbon is in the gaseous phase. We find that high molar fractions of CH$_4$ ($\&gt;10^{-2}$) and H$_2$O ($&gt; 5\times10^{-2}$), and a high C/O ratio $(&gt; 5\times10^{-1})$ are indicative of formation outside the ice line. In contrast, sub-Neptunes formed inside the ice line exhibit strongly suppressed CH$_4$ abundances, yielding C/O ratios ranging widely from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$.

We employ this framework to constrain the amplitude and logarithmic slope of the linear matter power spectrum at $k_\star=0.009\,\mathrm{km^{-1}s}$ and redshift $z=3$, obtaining $\Delta^2_\star=0.379\pm0.032$ and $n_\star=-2.309\pm0.019$. The robustness of these constraints is validated through the analysis of mocks and a large number of alternative data analysis variations, with cosmological parameters kept blinded throughout the validation process. We then combine our results with constraints from DESI BAO and temperature, polarization, and lensing measurements from Planck, ACT, and SPT-3G to set constraints on $\Lambda$CDM extensions. While our measurements do not significantly tighten the limits on the sum of neutrino masses from the combination of these probes, they sharpen the constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N_\mathrm{eff}=3.02\pm0.10$, the running of the spectral index, $\alpha_\mathrm{s}=0.0014\pm0.0041$, and the running of the running, $\beta_\mathrm{s}=-0.0006\pm0.0048$, by a factor of 1.18, 1.27, and 1.90, respectively.

We investigate the response of the system using three distinct wave proxies (compressible parallel, compressible transverse and incompressible parallel) as well as Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for decoupling and analyzing the resultant MHD wave behavior. We find that OR generates a slow magnetoacoustic wave of period $P$ that propagates outwards in all directions along the spine and fan plane of the 3D null point. We also find the generation of a propagating Alfvén wave of period $P$, exclusively along the $y$-axis in the fan plane, i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the spine motion.

We report the relativistic reverberation of the reflection hump in the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy IC 4329A based on a long {\it NuSTAR} observation. We find a delayed response of the 20–30 keV X-ray band, with a lag time of $\sim1825$ s at frequencies $0.5-1.5 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz. The lag amplitude drops to $\sim195$ s as the frequencies increase to $(1.5-10)\times10^{-4}$ Hz. Including IC 4329A, so far five sources have been explored for reflection hump reverberation. We perform reverberation modelling of the 3–50 keV lag-energy spectra using the general relativistic transfer function code, which provides independent timing-based measurements of the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}=1.37_{-0.36}^{+0.33}\times10^8~M_{\odot}$ and the coronal height $h=2.45_{-2.36}^{+1.92}~R_{\rm g}$ (with uncertainties at 90\% confidence). Within the uncertainties, the measured mass is found to be consistent with the previous finding. Furthermore, we undertake reflection spectroscopy to account for the hump feature and the associated relativistic effect using the time-averaged flux spectrum. Further sampling of the {\it NuSTAR} data (with a bin width of 0.2/0.4 keV below and above 10 keV) that reshapes the spectral resolution allows us to constrain the coronal temperature at $50.26_{-4.03}^{+5.58}$ keV – consistent with the previous result from the combined {\it Suzaku} and {\it NuSTAR} data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The dynamically hazardous asteroid 2025 TV$_{10}$.

We investigated the meteoroids of this shower using fireball data from the European Fireball Network supplemented by video data of faint meteors. We first derived the criteria for assigning meteors to this shower. A fragmentation model was then applied to selected shower fireballs with good deceleration data and light curves. Meteoroid fragmentation strengths and bulk densities were derived and compared with three other showers. We have confirmed the four year periodicity in the activity of eta-Virginids and their presence in the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. The orbital period of four years was directly measured for the fireballs. Fainter meteors showed somewhat longer periods but the shower is poor in faint meteors. No member fainter than magnitude +1 was observed instrumentally. The physical properties of meteoroids are different from cometary streams and are similar to the Geminids. The limiting fragmentation strength of 0.5 MPa and typical bulk density of cm-sized meteoroids of 1500 kg/m3 suggest that the parent body is a carbonaceous asteroid. Besides Geminids, eta-Virginids is another stream of asteroidal origin. Some small meteoroids have densities around 2500 kg/m3. Three asteroids of the sizes between 40 - 120 meters have been found to have similar orbits but their relation to eta-Virginids remains uncertain.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21689" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the emission signatures of pulsar halo candidate HESS J1813-126</a><span class="id">[2601.21689]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extended gamma-ray sources surrounding middle-aged pulsars, primarily observed at teraelectronvolt energies, have been interpreted as pulsar halos, where relativistic $e^\pm$ diffuse into the interstellar medium and produce inverse-Compton (IC) emission. HESS J1813-126, associated with the energetic, radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar PSR J1813-1246, has been suggested as a candidate pulsar halo, though its nature remains uncertain. We interpreted the high-energy emission of PSR J1813-1246 using the synchro-curvature (SC) radiation model and tested whether the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1813-126 can be explained as a pulsar halo powered by PSR J1813-1246. We explain the X-ray and gamma-ray SEDs of the pulsar using the SC framework. We further computed the transport and losses of $e^\pm$ injected by the pulsar through time-dependent diffusion-loss equations, exploring various common pulsar halo transport models. The resulting IC emission was compared with \textit{Fermi}-LAT, H.E.S.S., HAWC, and LHAASO data. We present predictions for the surface brightness profiles (SBPs) and the aperture-dependent emission for the different transport models, providing key diagnostics for assessing the observability of HESS J1813-126 with current and future instruments. The SC framework successfully reproduces the emission of PSR J1813-1246. The SED of HESS J1813-126 can be consistently reproduced within different pulsar halo frameworks, albeit with distinct predictions across different transport models. The corresponding SBP predictions and aperture-dependent emission offer testable signatures for future imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, which will be crucial for discriminating between the transport models. We further examined the link between the pulsar central engine and its extended halo by comparing the pair multiplicities in the magnetospheric and halo regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mixing-induced thermal instabilities and coronal condensations</a><span class="id">[2601.21691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cool, dense material is frequently observed to permeate the hot, tenuous solar corona in the form of prominences, spicules and coronal rain. Both the cool material and surrounding corona exist at temperatures that are effectively thermally stable, in that their local radiative losses occur on relatively long timescales compared to the dynamics. However, as the solar atmosphere evolves, driving mixing between the condensations and surrounding hot material, intermediate temperatures form, which can become subject to highly efficient radiative losses. The thermal energy lost due to radiation can far exceed the turbulent heating thus the system undergoes mixing-induced cooling. Here, a 3D radiative MHD simulation is performed of the shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) occurring between a cool condensation and the hot solar corona. During the evolution, thermal instabilities form naturally within the mixing layer, and grow with time to produce long, narrow structures that extend perpendicular to the magnetic field. The thermal instabilities form self-consistently within the mixing layer as small isolated events, and are then stretched by the background flows to create long structures in relatively narrow planes. The turbulent flows agitate the condensations and cause them to fragment, creating smaller localised clumps of cool, dense (prominence-like) material that can merge and further fragment. In the presented simulation, the thermal instabilities act to replenish the cool, dense material lost due to mixing, with the total mass of cool material being approximately constant through time. By analysing the thermal energy loss due to optically-thin radiation, thermal instabilities are found to account for 15-20\% of all radiative losses in the turbulent plasma.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21693" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulse-resolved Classification and Characteristics of Long-duration GRBs with \emph{Swift}-BAT Data.I.

Both precursors and main bursts have durations and hardness broadly consistent with Type II GRBs. However, precursors show longer MVTs (by factors of 3-10) and diverse lags with near-zero median values, while main bursts display variable MVTs and positive lags. These differences suggest precursors may originate from distinct dissipation conditions, possibly due to cocoon shock breakout or early magnetically dominated outflows.

Among other things, they demonstrated that although the damping rate of the oscillations in the core of many red giants appears to be negligible, other red giants exhibit high core damping rates that are sometimes consistent with the infinite value limit. Up until now, it has not been possible to link the mixed mode visibilities to core damping rates in a quantitative way. In this study, we use the progressive wave picture to derive an analytical function expressing the approximate resonance pattern of red giants up to a proportionality factor. This function can model the influence of the damping on the oscillations, as well as take into account other effects such as mode asymmetries. In particular, this expression can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate for the visibility of mixed modes and to predict the detectability of mixed mode and multiplet signatures under different core damping rates. Here, we conduct a parameter study to investigate how the damping processes affect these aspects. We find that the visibility approaches the value expected for an infinite core damping rate already at finite values. Furthermore, we find that both the mixed mode and the multiplet signatures disappear at finite core damping rates. This implies that the observational characteristics of red giants with finite core damping rates can appear as if their core damping rate were infinite, providing an explanation for the observed populations. Moreover, we have used our method to quantitatively estimate the core damping rates of red giants with unusually low mixed mode amplitudes from their observed visibilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hidden Gems in TESS: sherlock finds two new rocky planets around nearby M dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2601.21774]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Hidden Gems project searches the TESS data for additional planets transiting low-mass stars in confirmed systems.

Spectral similarity analysis is performed by comparing the spectrum of Kamo`oalewa to the mean spectra of various types in the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy to make a preliminary constraint on the combined characteristics of surface mineralogy and space weathering effects. To further characterize the mineral composition, a detailed analysis of the 1 {\mu}m band center is conducted based on spectral data below 1.25 {\mu}m that have higher signal-to-noise ratios. Empirical models for normalized spectra are developed to estimate the Is/FeO content. The results suggest that asteroid Kamo`oalewa has higher olivine abundance than that of typical S-type asteroids and the Moon, exhibiting an immature to submature degree of space weathering.

Over 1000 realizations, we find an average of 0.2(2.4) qualified events with the LVK O5(post-O5) network. Whereas with the ET+CE network, we find an average of 73.2 qualified events over 100 realizations. Using the Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) lens model, we jointly estimate waveform parameters and the impact parameter with doubly lensed GW signals, and then forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters and modified GW propagation by combining time-delay cosmography and the standard siren approach. The average posterior gives a constraint on $H_0$ with a relative uncertainty of $14\%$, $10\%$ and $0.42\%$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model for the LVK O5, LVK post-O5, and ET+CE network, respectively. While the LVK network gives uninformative constraints on the $(w_0,w_a)$ dynamical dark energy model, the ET+CE network yields a moderate constraint of $w_0=-1.02^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$ and $w_a=0.48^{+0.99}_{-1.54}$. In addition, our method can provide precise constraints on modified GW propagation effects jointly with $H_0$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Late-time X-ray afterglows of GRBs: Implications for particle acceleration at relativistic shocks</a><span class="id">[2601.21827]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations are currently among the most advanced tools to investigate particle acceleration at relativistic shocks. Still, they come with limitations imposed by finite computing power, whose impact is not straightforward to evaluate a priori. Observational features are hence required as verification. energy electrons accelerated at external shocks, provides a testbed for such predictions. Current numerical studies suggest that in GRB afterglows the maximum synchrotron photon energy, which corresponds to the limit of electron acceleration, may fall within the $\sim$ 0.1–10 keV X-ray energy band at late times, $t\gtrsim 10^6 - 10^7$ s. To test this prediction, we analyzed the X-ray spectra of six GRBs with \emph{Swift}/XRT detections beyond $10^7$ s: our analysis reveals no clear evidence of a spectral cutoff. Using a model that accounts for the effect of the finite opening angle of the shock on the observed maximum synchrotron photon energy, we show that these observations are incompatible with PIC simulation predictions, unless one or more physical afterglow parameters attain values at odds with those typically inferred from afterglow modeling (small radiative efficiency, low ambient density, large equipartition fraction $\epsilon_{\rm B}$ of the magnetic field). These findings challenge existing numerical simulation results and imply a more efficient acceleration of electrons to high-energies than seen in PIC simulations, with important implications for our understanding of particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21870" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme-Value Distribution Analysis of the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog: Assessing the Rarity of the One-off FRB 20250316A</a><span class="id">[2601.21870]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a statistical analysis of the extreme brightness of the fast radio burst FRB 20250316A, a luminous, apparently non-repeating event detected by CHIME/FRB. Employing a model-agnostic framework based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution applied to the second CHIME/FRB catalog, we quantify its rarity within the current population. Bayesian fitting of GEV models to block maxima of peak flux and fluence data reveals FRB 20250316A to be a profound statistical outlier. For the peak flux, the analysis yields a return period of $\sim$ 600 years ($1\sigma$ credible level), with the underlying distribution being of the heavy-tailed, unbounded Fréchet type ($\xi &gt; 0$). The fluence analysis indicates greater complexity: while the full sample suggests a Fréchet-type distribution with a $\sim50$-year return period in $1\sigma$ credible level, the removal of three other notable outliers points toward a light-tailed Weibull-type distribution ($\xi &lt; 0$) with a finite upper bound far exceeded by FRB 20250316A. This dichotomy highlights the challenge in characterizing the tail of the FRB luminosity function with limited data. Although less extreme in recurrence time than the “Brightest Of All Time” gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, FRB 20250316A constitutes a similarly exceptional event (a potential FRB “BOAT”) within the short observational history of wide-field radio surveys. Our results underscore the existence of rare, highly luminous events that may probe the upper limits or distinct sub-populations of the FRB luminosity distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21974" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectroscopic Variability of the Broad H$β$ Emission Line in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasars</a><span class="id">[2601.21974]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a catalog of broad H$\beta$ variability properties for all spectra of quasars with $z&lt;0.8$ and at least two observations included in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16 quasar catalog.

We measure the luminosity, FWHM, equivalent width, centroid, and Pearson skewness coefficient of broad H$\beta$ and provide derived physical properties such as the single-epoch black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity. For each pair of spectra in the sample, we calculate the change in radial velocity of the centroid of broad H$\beta$ emission ($\Delta v_{rad}$) as well as other derived properties related to broad H$\beta$ shape variability. We use forward-modeling methods to estimate the uncertainty in our measurements and discuss an improved method for estimating the uncertainty in $\Delta v_{rad}$ in the case where a spectral decomposition is used to isolate the broad H$\beta$ emission.

Tests for bias were performed using a sample of 20,000 synthetic Be stars drawn from a Salpeter initial mass function and computed libraries of spectral energy distributions and H$\alpha$ profiles. The spectroscopic method showed substantial bias against high inclinations ($i &gt; 80^\circ$).

In this Letter we propose a new, purely geometric null test of the late-time expansion history that is exactly independent of the Hubble constant. By combining strong-lensing time-delay distances with gravitational-wave standard-siren luminosity distances, we construct a dimensionless ratio that depends only on the redshift dependence of the expansion rate and can be both predicted from early-Universe data and measured directly at late times, without relying on the cosmic distance ladder or the sound horizon. We show that the comparison between the early- and late-time determinations of this ratio provides a transparent consistency test of the standard cosmological expansion. When combined with an independent standard-siren measurement of $H_{0}$, this framework allows one to unambiguously distinguish between early- and late-time origins of the Hubble tension. With the forthcoming detection of lensed gravitational-wave standard sirens, the proposed test provides a timely and robust framework for probing this long-standing cosmological puzzle.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Sound Speed of Dark Energy with a Lunar Laser Interferometer</a><span class="id">[2601.22084]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The sound speed of dark energy encodes fundamental information about the microphysics underlying cosmic acceleration, yet remains essentially unconstrained by existing observations. We demonstrate that a lunar-based laser interferometer, such as the proposed Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA), can directly probe the sound speed of dark energy by measuring the real-time evolution of horizon-scale gravitational potentials. Operating in the ultra-low-frequency gravitational band inaccessible from Earth, LILA is sensitive to scalar metric perturbations sourced by dark energy dynamics. Using both fluid and effective field theory descriptions, we develop a complete framework linking dark energy sound speed to observable strain signatures. We construct a likelihood pipeline and Fisher forecasts, showing that LILA can either detect clustering dark energy or exclude broad classes of models with unprecedented sensitivity. This establishes lunar interferometry as a novel and powerful probe of the physics driving cosmic acceleration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22115" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Densities of small planets around the M dwarfs TOI-4336 A and TOI-4342 with ESPRESSO: Three sub-Neptunes, one super-Earth, and a Neptune-mass candidate</a><span class="id">[2601.22115]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the characterization of two planetary systems orbiting the M dwarfs TOI-4336 A (M3.5V) and TOI-4342 (M0V), each hosting two transiting planets previously validated with TESS and ground-based observations. We refined the photometry of the TOI-4342 system using TESS and LCOGT data, and characterized the host stars with NIRPS and ESPRESSO spectroscopy. High-precision ESPRESSO radial velocities allowed us to constrain the planetary masses and investigate their potential compositions. The TOI-4336 A system is composed of a sub-Neptune with a period of 16.34 days, a radius of $2.14 \pm 0.08$ Re, and a mass of $3.33 \pm 0.36$ Me, along with an inner super-Earth on a 7.59-day orbit with a radius of $1.25 \pm 0.07$ Re and a mass of $1.55 \pm 0.13$ Me. The TOI-4342 system hosts two sub-Neptunes of similar sizes ($2.33 \pm 0.09$ Re and $2.35 \pm 0.09$ Re), with periods of 5.54 and 10.69 days. Their masses are measured to be $7.3 \pm 1.3$ Me and $4.8 \pm 1.4$ Me, respectively. The RVs also reveal a planet candidate around TOI-4342, likely non-transiting, with a period of 47.5 days and a minimum mass of $17.8 \pm 3.0$ Me. With precise radii and masses, we derived bulk densities and explored possible compositions. The TOI-4336 A sub-Neptune and super-Earth have densities of $1.87 \pm 0.30$ and $4.35 \pm 0.79$ g cm$^{-3}$, while the two similar-sized sub-Neptunes in TOI-4342 show distinct densities of $3.18 \pm 0.67$ and $2.01 \pm 0.63$ g cm$^{-3}$. All four planets are excellent targets for future atmospheric characterization with JWST, and their multi-planet nature makes them especially interesting for comparative planetology. Notably, TOI-4336 A b stands out as one of the best-known targets in its size and temperature regime, with a TSM of 138, comparable to benchmark planets such as K2-18 b and LHS 1140 b.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rethinking Resonance Detectability during Binary Neutron Star Inspiral: Accurate Mismatch Computations for Low-lying Dynamical Tides</a><span class="id">[2601.21086]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We compute deviations from observed gravitational wave signals, where the amplitude of the signal is unchanged. As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exact analytic rotating black-hole solutions with primary hair</a><span class="id">[2601.21163]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Exact, analytic, asymptotically flat rotating black-hole solutions are exceedingly rare, with only a handful of examples known.

In this work we investigate how the most general field theories in the context of general relativity can accomodate a phantom-to-quintessence transition which may be essential element of realistic Dark Energy scenarios in the late Universe. As we demonstrate in a very detailed manner, this is impossible for a canonical and minimally coupled single scalar field theory, but it may be possible for ghost condensate theories like $k$-essence theories. We point out how the ghost instabilities may be eliminated, and we analyze the quantitative features of a $k$-essence theory that may realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition in the late Universe. We also qualitatively compare the difficulties and fine-tunings required for $k$-essence theories to realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition, and how such a transition is naturally realized in modified gravity, without unnecessary fine-tunings and ghost eliminations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21364" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected Tachyon Scalar Field Inflation, the ACT Data, and Phantom Transition</a><span class="id">[2601.21364]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Phantom divide line transitions are not possible in the context of single scalar field scalar-tensor theories. In this article we study a combined framework of a tachyonic minimally coupled single scalar field theory in the presence of an $\mathcal{R}^2$ correction term and with a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term of the form $\sim \lambda \frac{\mathcal{R}}{16\pi G}$. Such terms can be part of an $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity which in the large curvature regime yields such correction terms effectively. Alternatively, such terms can simply be quantum corrections to the scalar field action. We aim to answer two questions, firstly if this framework can lead to phantom divide line transitions and secondly whether the resulting model can be compatible with the ACT data. The model we studied is an inverse square power-law model, well known from tachyon inflation models. As we show, the field equations can be cast in terms of the scalar field solely, however the resulting theory is distinct from a single scalar field theory, because the phantom divide line is crossed during inflation. Thus initially the tachyonic nature of the scalar field generates a phantom equation of state parameter, and during inflation the phantom divide line is crossed, with the effective equation of state parameter at the end of inflation being $w=-1/3$ which corresponds to the non-accelerating state of the Universe. The model is proved to be compatible with the ACT data, only when the gravity during inflation is stronger than Einstein-Hilbert gravity, with the effective gravitational constant during inflation being $\frac{G}{\lambda}$. The effective theory is valid only during inflation, thus Big-Bang nucleosynthesis is not affected by the rescaling of the Einstein-Hilbert gravity. The feature of a phantom crossing in $f(\mathcal{R},\phi)$ frameworks is new in the literature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Pressure Torsion-Induced Transformation of Adenosine Monophosphate: Insights into Prebiotic Chemistry of RNA by Astronomical Impacts</a><span class="id">[2601.21378]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of life is yet a compelling scientific mystery that has sometimes been attributed to high-pressure impacts by small solar system bodies such as comets, meteoroids, asteroids, and transitional objects. High-pressure torsion (HPT) is an innovative method with which to simulate the extreme conditions of astronomical impacts and offers insights relevant to prebiotic chemistry. In the present study, we investigated the polymerization and stability of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), a key precursor to ribonucleic acid (RNA), in dry and hydrated conditions (10 wt% water) under 6 GPa at ambient and boiling water temperatures. Comprehensive analyses with the use of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning electron microscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed no evidence of polymerization, while AMP partly transformed to other organic compounds such as nucleobase-derived fragments of adenine, phosphoribose fragments, dehydrated adenosine, protonated adenosine, and oxidized adenosine. The torque measurements during HPT further highlight the mechanical behavior of AMP under extreme conditions. These findings suggest that, while HPT under the conditions tested does not facilitate polymerization, the formation of various compounds from AMP confirms the significance of astronomical impacts on the prebiotic chemistry of RNA on early Earth.

These are the so called bulk flows, the presence of which has come to be treated as a problem for the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. However, the limits of the $\Lambda$CDM model are based on Newtonian studies, which predict the mediocre $v\propto t^{1/3}$ growth-rate for the peculiar-velocity field ($v$). Recently, a few fully relativistic treatments have appeared in the literature, arguing for a much stronger velocity growth that could explain the reported fast and deep bulk flows. What separates the Newtonian from the relativistic studies is the gravitational input of the peculiar flux, namely of the kinetic energy triggered by the moving matter. The latter has no direct gravitational contribution in Newtonian theory, but it does so in general relativity. This drastically changes the driving agent of the peculiar-velocity field and boosts its linear growth. The aim of this work is to directly compare the two treatments, as well as identify and discuss the reasons for their different results. In the process, we also demonstrate how one could recover the relativistic growth-rate from a Newtonian setup by selectively including certain (typically ignored) source-free terms into the Poisson equation. This way, we provide a unified covariant comparison of the Newtonian, the quasi-Newtonian and the fully relativistic studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compact Stars Sourced by Perfect Fluid Dark Matter Halos</a><span class="id">[2601.21848]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent studies have shown that dark matter halos can support regular black holes or compact stars by assuming an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor.

Using adaptive mesh refinement to resolve the bubble wall, we identify three dynamical outcomes: type B (supercritical) PBHs with an interior baby universe and a bifurcating trapping horizon, type A (subcritical) PBHs with an apparent horizon formed by direct wall collapse, and dispersal with no PBH formation. To separate these three cases, we evaluate two commonly used PBH-formation criteria: the time scale ratio $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ (horizon crossing time versus vacuum-energy domination time) and the local density contrast $\delta(t_\mathrm{H})$ at horizon crossing. For the parameter space explored, we find that $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ is a more robust predictor of outcome: type B PBHs form when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V} \gtrsim 1$ (critical range $\sim 1.1 - 1.6$ in our survey), type A PBHs arise when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ is below this threshold but remains above a lower bound (typical range $\sim 0.35 - 0.7$), and no-PBH dispersal occurs when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ falls below this lower bound. When a clear thin-wall FVD boundary exists, $\delta(t_\mathrm{H})$ can correspondingly distinguish different outcomes (roughly $\delta_c(t_\mathrm{H}) \sim 1 - 1.7$ for type B and $\delta_c(t_\mathrm{H}) \sim 0.35 - 0.5$ for type A), but is highly sensitive to wall structure and model details and thus less universal.

We report a neutrino flare candidate spatially and temporally coincident with the TDE ATLAS17jrp, occurring 19 days after the onset of its X-ray activity and lasting for 56 days, with a post-trial $p$-value of 0.01. This significance is modest, representing a hint of an association. We illustrate the neutrino emission using a simple lepton-hadronic model, where X-ray photons serve as target fields. While this model can account for the neutrino data around 100 TeV, the low-energy neutrinos may imply contributions from an additional component. Although constrained by the sample size of X-ray-detected TDEs, these results underscore the need for high-cadence X-ray monitoring and future neutrino observatories to further explore the connection between TDEs and high-energy neutrinos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19053" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Convective stability analysis of massive neutron stars formed in binary mergers</a><span class="id">[2501.19053]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers over $100\,\rm ms$ post-merger to investigate the dynamics of remnant massive neutron stars (NSs). Our focus is mainly on the analysis of convective stability and mode characteristics of the massive NSs. We derive stability criteria for hot, differentially rotating relativistic stars that account for both buoyant and rotational restoring forces, and apply them for the first time to the post-merger massive NSs. Our results show no evidence of large-scale convective instability, as both angle-averaged specific entropy and specific angular momentum increase outward within the massive NSs. Rotational effects significantly enhance stability for local regions that would be otherwise unstable by the Schwarzschild criterion. Additionally, our mode analysis of matter fields and gravitational waves reveals no excitation of observable inertial modes after the damping of quadrupolar $f$-modes in the massive NSs, contrasting with previous studies. As in many previous works, we observe the excitation of an $m=1$ one-armed mode. However, we also find that the growth of the $m=1$ mode amplitude after the merger may correlate strongly with the violation of linear momentum conservation, indicating that we cannot reject the possibility that the excitation of the one-armed mode has a numerical origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Press-Schechter Formalism and The PBH Mass Distributions</a><span class="id">[2502.05194]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) can form during radiation domination from rare primordial perturbations that re-enter the Hubble radius and undergo gravitational collapse.

We define the smoothed density contrast $\delta_R$ and its variance $S(R)=\sigma^2(R)$, and connect $S$ to the primordial curvature spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal R}(k)$ through the radiation-era transfer. For Gaussian statistics and a constant collapse threshold $\delta_c$, the formation fraction is an $\operatorname{erfc}$ tail with a controlled rare-event asymptotic. For a sharp-$k$ filter, $\delta(S)$ is Markovian; solving the diffusion equation with an absorbing barrier yields the first-crossing density $f(S)=\frac{\delta_c}{\sqrt{2\pi}}S^{-3/2}\exp\!\big(-\delta_c^2/(2S)\big)$. This gives a differential formation fraction $\mathrm{d}\beta/\mathrm{d}\ln M=f(S)\,\big|\mathrm{d}S/\mathrm{d}\ln M\big|$ and a mass-conserving formation-era mass function $\mathrm{d}n_{\mathrm{PBH}}/\mathrm{d}M$.

Here we show for the first time that this effect is also present at higher redshifts $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.04$. Instead of calculating the CMB temperature around individual galaxies as in previous works, we analyze mean CMB temperature profiles associated to cosmic filaments in three dimensions. We have considered different thresholds in the linear K-band luminosity density of the filaments as a proxy to mass density. Furthermore, we have analyzed the dependence of the results on the average orientation of filaments with respect to the line of sight. These studies were implemented to test the expected dependence on mass density as well as on photon trajectory length within the cosmic filaments. We find a $3-4\sigma$ detection of a temperature decrement trend towards the spine of the filaments, the larger the mass and the more radially oriented the filament, the stronger the temperature decrement. This trend is seen independently in both redshift ranges $0.004&lt;z&lt;0.02$ and $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.04$. We therefore conclude that our results provide strong evidence for a lower CMB temperature along massive cosmic filaments in the nearby universe $z&lt;0.04$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large $n$-point Functions in Resonant Inflation</a><span class="id">[2508.19240]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a qualitatively new regime of inflationary models with small and rapid oscillations in the potential–resonant non-Gaussianity.

This behavior emerges when the oscillation frequency $\omega$ exceeds the naive cutoff of the theory, $4\pi f$. However, as noted by Hook and Rattazzi [ 2306.12489 ], the actual cutoff is somewhat higher – though only logarithmically – when the amplitude of the oscillations is small.

We model the tidal response as a set of driven harmonic oscillators, where the natural frequencies are given by the quasinormal modes of a nonrotating neutron star. These modes are calculated in general relativity by applying linear perturbation theory to stellar models that include a solid crust and compositional stratification. For the mode spectrum, we find that the canonical interface mode associated with the crust-core boundary vanishes in stratified neutron stars and is replaced by compositional gravity modes with mixed gravity-interfacial character, driven primarily by strong buoyancy in the outer core. We also find that fluid modes such as the core gravity mode and the fundamental mode can penetrate the crust, and we establish a criterion for such penetration. Regarding the tidal interaction, we find that transfer of binding energy to oscillations is dominated by the fundamental mode despite its frequency being too high to resonate with the tidal forcing. In general, we find that lower-frequency modes induce gravitational-wave phase shifts smaller than $\sim 10^{-3},\rm rad$ for the equation of state we consider. We discover that nonresonant fundamental and crustal shear modes can trigger crust breaking already near the first gravity-mode resonance, while gravity-mode resonance concentrates strain at the base of the crust and may marginally crack it. These results suggest that both resonant and nonresonant excitations can overstress the crust and may channel energy into the magnetosphere prior to merger, potentially powering electromagnetic precursors. Our work represents an important step toward realistic modeling of dynamical tides of neutron stars in multimessenger observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for the dynamical dark energy with evolving Hubble constant</a><span class="id">[2510.14390]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hubble constant tension, together with the recent indications of dynamical dark energy proposed from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, poses significant challenges to the standard cosmological model. We investigate the possible redshift evolution of dark energy and the Hubble constant through a data-driven approach, and assess whether such evolution can alleviate the Hubble constant tension. We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the dark-energy equation of state $w(z)$, jointly with an evolving Hubble constant $H_0(z)$. The analysis combines the DESI DR2 BAO dataset with multiple Type Ia supernova samples and evaluates the statistical preference for the reconstructed model using Bayesian evidence. The reconstructed $w(z)$ varies with redshift and exhibits two potential phantom crossings at $z\sim0.5$ and $z\sim1.5$. Meanwhile, $H_0$ decreases continually from local to high redshift, alleviating the Hubble constant tension effectively. The joint $w(z)$-$H_0(z)$ model is favored over the $w$CDM ($\Lambda$CDM) framework, with a logarithmic Bayes factor $\ln \boldsymbol{\mathcal B}= 5.04~(8.53)$. The results remain stable under different prior choices and dataset combinations. Our data-driven reconstructions suggest redshift evolution in both $w(z)$ and $H_0(z)$, offering a potential route to mitigate the Hubble constant tension. Future BAO measurements from Euclid and next-generation CMB experiments will provide critical tests of these results and bring deeper insights into the nature of dark energy and the evolution of cosmic expansion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atmospheric collapse and re-inflation through impacts for terrestrial planets around M dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2510.25896]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detection of an atmosphere around a terrestrial exoplanet will be a major milestone in the field, but our observational capacities are biased towards to tidally locked, close-in planets orbiting M-dwarf stars. The atmospheres of these planets are vulnerable to atmospheric erosion and collapse due to condensation of volatiles on the nightside. However, these collapsed volatiles accumulated as nightside ice constitute a stable reservoir that could be re-vaporised by meteorite impacts and re-establish the atmospheres. Through a simple energy balance model applied to atmospheric evolution simulations with stochastic impacts, we assess the viability and importance of this mechanism for CO$_2$ atmospheres. We find that moderate-sized impactors ($5-10 \rm{km}$ diameter) occurring at a frequency of $1-100 \rm{Gyr}^{-1}$ can regenerate observable transient atmospheres on previously airless planets. We focus on specific targets from the JWST DDT Rocky Worlds programme, and compute the fraction of their evolution spent with a transient CO$_2$ atmosphere generated through this mechanism. We find this fraction can reach $70\%$ for GJ 3929 b, $50\%$ for LTT 1445 Ac, $80\%$ for LTT 1445 Ab, at high impact rates and strong CO$_2$ outgassing over the planet's lifetime. We also show that atmospheric collapse can shield volatiles from escape, particularly in the early, high-XUV phase of M-dwarf evolution. Overall, our work suggests that terrestrial planet atmospheres may not evolve monotonically but instead may be shaped by episodic external forcings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27579" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">String-induced vacuum decay and its gravitational wave signatures</a><span class="id">[2510.27579]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>False vacuum decay typically proceeds via the nucleation of spherical bubbles of true vacuum, described by $O(4)$ symmetric field configurations in Euclidean time.

We compare simulations of F, G, K and M main-sequence stars with a small-scale dynamo (SSD) to faculae-like spatially averaged field strengths (from 100 to 500 G). We focus on the effect of imposed magnetic field on the thermodynamic stratification and velocities, along with the bolometric intensity and surface field strength. Imposed magnetic fields result in reduced average density and gas pressure near the surface compared to the SSD simulations. The temperature stratification also shows a dip at and just below the stellar surface. The changes in average bolometric intensity are within a percent, with different trends with field strength for different stellar types. In addition, the convective velocities are reduced. The magnitude of changes in thermodynamic quantities are related to field strength as well as the stellar $T_{\rm eff}$. Faculae-strength magnetic fields modify the near surface convection by reducing gas pressure and density as well as suppressing convection in regions with strong field concentrations.

In white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion, outflows are associated with either strong winds from the donor star, the accretion disk, or a thermonuclear runaway explosion on the white dwarf surface. To date, only six accreting white dwarfs are known to harbour disk-wind driven bow shocks that are not associated to thermonuclear explosions. Here, we report the discovery of a bow shock associated with a high-proper-motion disk-less accreting white dwarf, 1RXS J052832.5+283824. We show that the white dwarf has a strong magnetic field in the range B 42-45 MG, making RXJ0528+2838 the a bonafide known polar-type cataclysmic variable harbouring a bow shock. The resolved bow shock is shown to be inconsistent with a past thermonuclear explosion, or being inflated by a donor wind, ruling out all accepted scenarios for inflating a bow shock around this system. Modelling of the energetics reveals that the observed bow shock requires a persistent power source with a luminosity significantly exceeding the system accretion energy output. This implies the presence of a powerful, previously unrecognized energy loss mechanism - potentially tied to magnetic activity - that may operate over sufficiently long timescales to influence the course of binary evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Cosmological Constraints from Galaxy Clustering and Weak Lensing</a><span class="id">[2601.14559]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present cosmology results combining galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing measured in the full six years (Y6) of observations by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) covering $\sim$5000 deg$^2$.

We model the data in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM cosmologies. The combined analysis yields $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.789^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$ and matter density $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.333^{+0.023}_{-0.028}$ in $\Lambda$CDM (68\% CL), where $\sigma_8$ is the clustering amplitude. These constraints show a (full-space) parameter difference of 1.8$\sigma$ from a combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropy datasets from Planck 2018, ACT-DR6, and SPT-3G DR1. Projected only into $S_8$ the difference is $2.6\sigma$. In $w$CDM the Y6 3$\times$2pt results yield $S_8 = 0.782^{+0.021}_{-0.020}$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.325^{+0.032}_{-0.035}$, and dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w = -1.12^{+0.26}_{-0.20}$.

Starting from the exact Laplace-space solution derived from the generalized master equation with memory kernel $K(t) \propto t^{-\nu}e^{-t/\tau_c}$, we develop a systematic perturbation expansion in the turbulence strength parameter $\xi$. The expansion is performed around the high-density matter basis where $\cos 2\theta_m \approx 1$, rather than the vacuum basis, reflecting the physical conditions in supernova cores. We obtain explicit expressions for the first few perturbation terms and derive the general structure of higher-order terms, which involve Mittag-Leffler functions that emerge from the fractional dynamics. Using high-precision numerical methods (multiple-precision arithmetic and asymptotic expansions), we analyze the convergence radius and rate of the perturbation series. We find that for $\xi &lt; \xi_c \approx 0.8$, the series converges with error decreasing geometrically. For $\xi = 0.16$ (typical supernova conditions), third-order perturbation theory achieves $\sim 1\%$ accuracy. We provide practical guidelines for applying perturbation theory to realistic astrophysical scenarios and validate all analytical results with extensive numerical computations. Our work clarifies several subtle aspects of the perturbative approach that were not addressed in the original literature, offering a complete toolkit for researchers studying neutrino-turbulence interactions. In particular, we systematically address the ultraviolet divergence of the correlation function at short time scales for spectral indices $\nu \geq 1$, introducing a physical small-scale cutoff regularization that ensures mathematical rigor for the fractional master equation and perturbative expansion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Climates of Terrestrial Exoplanets and Biosignatures</a><span class="id">[2601.20620]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the climates of terrestrial exoplanets and the detectability of biosignatures is an inherently interdisciplinary challenge, requiring the integration of insights from Solar System exploration, exoplanet observations and climate science.

Between 2018 and 2025, PlanetS made major contributions across theory, modelling, instrumentation and mission preparation. On the modelling side, the Generic Planetary Climate Model enabled climate studies across a wide range of planetary regimes, from early Venus to temperate terrestrial exoplanets including Proxima b, incorporating advanced developments such as a dynamical slab ocean. In parallel, the THOR global climate model was developed to avoid Earth-centric assumptions and to stably simulate diverse atmospheric regimes. PlanetS has also advanced atmospheric retrieval techniques combining forward modelling, Bayesian inference and machine learning, applied to targets ranging from Solar System bodies to exoplanet phase curves and directly imaged spectra. These efforts have helped assess the scientific return of future missions, notably the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) and to define instrumental requirements for detecting Earth-like atmospheres and biosignatures. Within the Solar System, PlanetS contributed key technologies for biosignature detection, including ORIGIN and SenseLife, enabling in-situ and remote detection of organics, isotopic ratios and microstructures. Finally, PlanetS has played a major role in preparing the next generation of observatories, from JWST, VLT and ELT instruments to LIFE and the Habitable Worlds Observatory.

Violations of LGIs can be probed by neutrino flavour oscillations if the correlators of consecutive flavour measurements are approximately stationary. We discuss here several improvements of the methodology used in previous analyses based on accelerator and reactor neutrino data.

Fortunately, there exist the so-called universal relations among the NS macroscopic quantities that are found to be insensitive to the underlying EOS. Studying the origin of these relations can lead to a better understanding of NSs and the gravitational interaction. We develop a new perspective of view to analyze the I-C and I-Love universal relations for NSs. At the linear order, we separate the deviation of the universal relations into two factors that are multiplied together. One is the EOS difference while the other factor only depends on the background star structure. The smallness of the second factor that does not depend on the EOS difference then indicates the origin of the universality. We discuss the validity of our linear approximation when considering the difference among realistic EOSs.

Incorporating the electric charge $q_E$ and the magnetic charge $q_M$, we first show that nonsingular BHs can exist only if $q_M = 0$. We then study the stability of purely electric BHs by analyzing the behavior of perturbations in the metric and the vector field. Nonsingular electric BHs are unstable due to a Laplacian instability in the vector perturbation near the regular center. In the absence of the HVT coupling ($\beta=0$), singular BHs in power-law NED theories can be consistent with all linear stability conditions, while Born-Infeld BHs encounter strong coupling due to a vanishing propagation speed as $r \to 0$. In power-law NED and Born-Infeld theories with $\beta \neq 0$, the electric fields for singular BHs are regular near $r=0$, while the metric functions behave as $\propto r^{-1}$. Nevertheless, we show that Laplacian instabilities occur for regions inside the outer horizon $r_h$, unless the HVT coupling constant $\beta$ is significantly smaller than $r_h^2$. For $\beta \neq 0$, we also reconstruct the NED Lagrangian so that one of the metric functions takes the Reissner-Nordström form. In this case, there exists a branch where all squared propagation speeds are positive, but the ghost and strong coupling problems are present around the BH center. Thus, the dominance of the HVT coupling generally leads to BH instability in the high-curvature regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02083" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Updating GUT-Scale Pole Higgs Inflation After ACT DR6</a><span class="id">[2510.02083]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider models of chaotic inflation driven by the real parts of a conjugate pair of Higgs superfields involved in the spontaneous breaking of a grand unification symmetry at a scale assuming its value within MSSM. We combine a superpotential, which is uniquely determined by applying a continuous R symmetry, with two fractional shift-symmetric Kaehler potentials introducing two free parameters (p,N). The inflationary observables provide an excellent match to the recent ACT data for 1.355&lt;=p&lt;=6.7 and 6x10^-5&lt;= N&lt;=0.7. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and possibly detectable primordial gravitational waves with (p,N) values of order unity. A solution to the mu problem of MSSM and baryogenesis via non-thermal leptogenesis can be also accommodated by embedding the model into a B-L extension of MSSM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial magnetogenesis in loop quantum cosmology</a><span class="id">[2510.13742]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) are magnetic fields generated during the early universe. These fields are thought to be the seeds of extragalactic magnetic fields. The origin of PMFs is not well known. Further, if they are indeed sources of extragalactic fields, then there is a possibility that observations of extragalactic magnetic fields could provide insights into the primordial physics. With this motivation, we study the generation of the primordial magnetic field in the context of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). In LQC, inflation is preceded by a quantum bounce. In this work, we consider an electromagnetic field coupled to the background as a test field and study its evolution through the bounce and through the subsequent inflationary phase. We investigate the power spectra generated in LQC and show that it is scale-dependent. We study the power spectra with different initial conditions, discuss equivalent forms of coupling functions, investigate backreaction, and compute the amount of primordial magnetic field which can be measured today. We conclude the article with a summary and discussion of the results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GWTC-4.0: Searches for Gravitational-Wave Lensing Signatures</a><span class="id">[2512.16347]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves can be gravitationally lensed by massive objects along their path. Depending on the lens mass and the lens–source geometry, this can lead to the observation of a single distorted signal or multiple repeated events with the same frequency evolution. We present the results for gravitational-wave lensing searches on the data from the first part of the fourth LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA observing run (O4a). We search for strongly lensed events in the newly acquired data by (1) searching for an overall phase shift present in an image formed at a saddle point of the lens potential, (2) looking for pairs of detected candidates with consistent frequency evolution, and (3) identifying sub-threshold counterpart candidates to the detected signals. Beyond strong lensing, we also look for lensing-induced distortions in all detected signals using an isolated point-mass model. We do not find evidence for strongly lensed gravitational-wave signals and use this result to constrain the rate of detectable strongly lensed events and the merger rate density of binary black holes at high redshift. In the search for single distorted lensed signals, we find one outlier: GW231123_135430, for which we report more detailed investigations. While this event is interesting, the associated waveform uncertainties make its interpretation complicated, and future observations of the populations of binary black holes and of gravitational lenses will help determine the probability that this event could be lensed.</p></div></details></article></body>
