[Ne V]$\lambda$3427 is known as one of the &quot;coronal lines,&quot; which are a species of emission lines present in AGN spectra with high ionization potentials ($\geq$ 100 eV) that can serve as tracers for AGN activity. The spatial extent of the coronal line region has been studied with only spatial resolving techniques that are not sensitive to the innermost regions of AGN. Through our reverberation mapping analysis of [Ne V]$\lambda$3427, we measure a nominal `optimal emission radius' for [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 of $381.1^{+16}_{-22}$ light days (observed-frame). We place the coronal line region in context with other AGN regions by comparing it with the characteristic radius of H$\alpha$, the dust-sublimation radius, and the dusty torus. The coronal line region is located at a larger radius from the black hole than the characteristic radius of the dusty torus, measured using a torus-radius luminosity relationship. The virial product ($v^2 R/G$) of both H$\alpha$ and [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 is consistent within the uncertainties, implying that the coronal line region, as probed by the [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 line, may be in a virialized orbit that is dominated by the gravitational potential of the black hole. This plausibly suggests that coronal lines could be an effective method for estimating black hole masses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: The Fast Metal Enrichment of Massive Galaxies at z 5</a><span class="id">[2510.16106]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the stellar mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and mass-metallicity-star formation relation (&quot;fundamental metallicity relation&quot;; FMR) of 18 massive (log(M/M$_\odot$) = 9.5-11) main-sequence galaxies at z 5 from the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST sample. This sample complements recent studies by JWST at up to two orders of magnitude lower stellar masses. The metallicities are derived using strong optical lines, and verified by temperature-based oxygen abundance measurements for five galaxies for which faint auroral lines are detected. We find little evolution at the massive end of the MZR between z 5 and cosmic noon at z 2, suggesting a fast metal enrichment at early times. The FMR at z=5 exhibits a 5x larger scatter (preferentially to lower metallicities) compared the local FMR relation. This scatter can be explained by a bursty star formation and the direct build-up of metals in early galaxies as well as differences in age and outflow efficiencies. Capitalizing on all available samples, we find that the observed MZR and FMR over three orders of stellar mass is generally in good agreement with results from cosmological simulation, although some underestimate the metal enrichment at low stellar masses. This may be due to too efficient metal-rich outflows. We show that the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST galaxies likely joined the current FMR at z 10 and will evolve into massive (log(M/M$_\odot$) 11.4) galaxies with super-solar metallicities by z=0.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: JWST/IFU Optical Observations for 18 Main-Sequence Galaxies at z=4-6</a><span class="id">[2510.16111]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To fully characterize the formation and evolution of galaxies, we need to observe their stars, gas, and dust on resolved spatial scales. We present the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST survey, which combines kpc-resolved imaging and spectroscopy from HST, JWST, and ALMA for 18 representative main-sequence galaxies at z=4-6 and log(M/$M_\odot$) &gt; 9.5 to study their star formation, chemical properties, and extended gas reservoirs. The co-spatial measurements resolving the ionized gas, molecular gas, stars, and dust on 1-2 kpc scales make this a unique benchmark sample for the study of galaxy formation and evolution at z 5, connecting the Epoch of Reionization with the cosmic noon. In this paper, we outline the survey goals and sample selection, and present a summary of the available data for the 18 galaxies. In addition, we measure spatially integrated quantities (such as global gas metallicity), test different star formation rate indicators, and quantify the presence of H$\alpha$ halos. Our targeted galaxies are relatively metal rich (10-70% solar), complementary to JWST samples at lower stellar mass, and there is broad agreement between different star formation indicators. One galaxy has the signature of an active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on its emission line ratios. Six show broad H$\alpha$ emission suggesting type 1 AGN candidates. We conclude with an outlook on the exciting science that will be pursued with this unique sample in forthcoming papers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: NIRSpec IFU Data Processing and Spatially-resolved Views of Chemical Enrichment in Normal Galaxies at z=4-6</a><span class="id">[2510.16116]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a statistical study of spatially resolved chemical enrichment in 18 main-sequence galaxies at $z=4$–6, observed with \jwst/NIRSpec IFU as part of the ALPINE-CRISTAL-\jwst\ survey. Performing an optimized reduction and calibration procedure, including local background subtraction, light-leakage masking, stripe removal, and astrometry refinement, we achieve robust emission-line mapping on kiloparsec scales. Although line-ratio distributions vary across galaxies in our sample, we generally find mild central enhancements in [O \textsc{iii}]/H$\beta$, [O \textsc{ii}]/[O \textsc{iii}], [S \textsc{ii}]$_{6732}$/[S \textsc{ii}]$_{6718}$, H$\alpha$/H$\beta$, and $L_{\rm H\alpha}/L_{\rm UV}$, consistent with elevated electron density, dust obscuration, and bursty star formation accompanied by reduced metallicity and ionization parameter. These features point to inside-out growth fueled by recent inflows of pristine gas. Nevertheless, the median metallicity gradient is nearly flat over a few kpc scale, $\Delta \log({\rm O/H}) = 0.02 \pm 0.01$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, implying efficient chemical mixing through inflows, outflows, and mergers. From pixel-by-pixel stellar and emission-line characterizations, we further investigate the resolved Fundamental Metallicity Relation (rFMR). Metallicity is described by a fundamental plane with stellar mass and SFR surface densities, but with a stronger dependence on $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ than seen in local galaxies. Our results indicate that the regulatory processes linking star formation, gas flows, and metal enrichment were already vigorous $\sim$1 Gyr after the Big Bang, producing the nearly flat metallicity gradient and a stronger coupling between star formation and metallicity than observed in evolved systems in the local universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective cosmic ray diffusion in multiphase galactic environments</a><span class="id">[2510.16125]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic-ray (CR) feedback is widely recognized as a key regulator of galaxy formation. After being accelerated at supernova remnant shocks, CRs propagate through the interstellar medium (ISM), establishing smooth large-scale distributions and driving galactic outflows. The efficiency of this feedback is controlled by the effective transport speed of the CR population, which in turn depends on the competition between CR-driven plasma instabilities and wave damping processes that vary strongly with ISM phase. In cold, dense gas, ion-neutral damping dominates, whereas in warm, diffuse environments, weaker non-linear Landau damping prevails, leading to enhanced CR scattering and slower transport. To investigate these effects, we employ the moving-mesh code Arepo and model CR transport using a two-moment description within the multiphase ISM framework Crisp, which self-consistently computes CR diffusion coefficients and transport velocities from coarse-grained plasma physics. The intrinsic CR diffusion coefficient depends inversely on the scattering rate of CRs and Alfvén waves, covering 15 orders of magnitude. In contrast, we show that the effective CR diffusion coefficient, which quantifies the propagation speed of CRs through the ISM, converges toward the canonical range of $10^{28}$-$10^{29}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$. Simulations with only non-linear Landau damping yield transport rates up to an order of magnitude slower than those including both Landau and ion-neutral damping. Overall, CR transport speeds increase systematically with gas density, for which we provide a density-dependent fit of the effective CR diffusion coefficient. We demonstrate that, despite strong ion-neutral damping in the cold and warm phases of the galactic disk, CRs are transported at speeds only a few times the local Alfvén speed as they traverse alternating ISM phases on their way out of the galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16210" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The factors that influence protostellar multiplicity II. Gas temperature and mass in Perseus with APEX</a><span class="id">[2510.16210]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Protostellar multiplicity is a common outcome of the star formation process. To fully understand the formation and evolution of these systems, the physical parameters of the molecular gas together with the dust must be systematically characterized. Using observations of molecular gas tracers, we characterize the physical properties of cloud cores in the Perseus molecular cloud (average distance of 295 pc) at envelope scales (5000-8000 AU). We used Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) and Nobeyama 45m Radio Observatory (NRO) observations of DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$ in several transitions to derive the physical parameters of the gas toward 31 protostellar systems in Perseus. Gas kinetic temperature was obtained from DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$ line ratios. Column densities and gas masses were then calculated for each species and transition. Gas kinetic temperature and gas masses were compared with bolometric luminosity, envelope dust mass, and multiplicity to search for statistically significant correlations. Gas kinetic temperature derived from DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$ line ratios have average values of 14 K, 26 and 16 K, respectively, with a range of 10-26 K for DCO$^+$ and c-C$_3$H$_2$. The gas kinetic temperature obtained from H$_2$CO line ratios have a range of 13-82 K. Column densities of all three molecular species are on the order of 10$^{11}$ to 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, resulting in gas masses of 10$^{-11}$ to 10$^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$. Statistical analysis of the physical parameters finds: i) similar envelope gas and dust masses for single and binary protostellar systems; ii) multiple (&gt;2 components) protostellar systems tend to have slightly higher gas and dust masses than binaries and single protostars; iii) a continuous distribution of gas and dust masses is observed regardless of separation between components in protostellar systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distinct barium isotope ratios in CEMP-s and CEMP-rs stars</a><span class="id">[2510.16275]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a spectroscopic analysis of ten carbon enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars of type CEMP-s and CEMP-rs and determine their NLTE abundances of Ba and Eu, as well as the fractions of the odd Ba isotopes (F_odd). The Ba abundances inferred from the resonance Ba II 4554 and 4934 A lines depend on the adopted Ba isotope mixture. We perform calculations for different F_odd from 0.1 to 1.0 and determine the corresponding abundances from the Ba II resonance lines in each sample star. In addition, we determine the Ba abundances from the Ba II subordinate lines, which are almost independent of F_odd. We then compare the Ba abundances derived from the subordinate lines with those from the Ba II resonance lines. We found different F_odd values in CEMP-s and CEMP-rs stars. CEMP-s stars exhibit F_odd = 0.05$_{-0.03}^{+0.07}$, 0.17$_{-0.14}^{+0.63}$, 0.19$_{-0.14}^{+0.50}$, and 0.19$_{-0.12}^{+0.33}$. The obtained values agree, within the error bars, with the s-process F_odd = 0.10 and the solar F_odd = 0.18. Although the uncertainties are large, in three of four stars, the possibility of Ba isotopes origin in a pure r-process with F_odd = 0.75 can be excluded. CEMP-rs stars show F_odd = 0.34$_{-0.21}^{+0.55}$, 0.36$_{-0.14}^{+0.23}$, 0.44$_{-0.22}^{+0.43}$, 0.53$_{-0.38}^{+0.47}$, and 0.57$_{-0.31}^{+0.43}$, which are higher compared to those in CEMP-s stars. Although the uncertainties are large, in four of five stars, the possibility of a pure s-process origin for the Ba isotopes can be excluded. The obtained values agree, within the error bars, with the predicted i-process F_odd = 0.6 to 0.8. Our analysis of CEMP-rs stars with [Ba/Eu] &gt; 0 argues that their [Ba/Eu] and F_odd cannot be jointly explained by a mixture of material produced by the r- and s-processes. The obtained results argue that the i-process is responsible for the chemical composition of these CEMP-rs stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The metallicity dependence of long-duration gamma-ray bursts</a><span class="id">[2510.16307]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Both theoretical models and observations of collapsar created gamma-ray bursts – typically long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) – suggest that these transients cannot occur at high metallicity, likely due to angular momentum losses via stellar winds for potential progenitor stars. However, the precise metallicity threshold (if it is a hard threshold) above which the formation of LGRBs is suppressed is still a topic of discussion. We investigated observed LGRBs and the properties of their host galaxies to constrain this metallicity dependence. In order to compute LGRB rates we modelled the cosmic history of star formation, as a function of host galaxy metallicity and stellar mass, and added a LGRB efficiency function that can include various shapes including abrupt cutoffs and more gradual variations in the GRB yield with metallicity. In contrast to previous work, this model includes scatters in the relations between mass, metallicity, and star formation rate, as well as a scatter in the metallicity distribution inside galaxies. We then varied both the threshold value and shape, and compared it to observed LGRBs and the properties of their host galaxies. In our model a sharp cutoff at an oxygen abundance $Z_{\text{O/H}}=12+\log(\text{O/H})=8.6\pm0.1$ (corresponding to $\sim0.6Z_{\odot}$) provides the best explanation for the observed LGRB data. In contrast, a lower threshold proposed in literature (i.e. at $Z_{\text{O/H}}=8.3$ or $\sim0.3Z_{\odot}$) fits observations poorly. We therefore conclude that, in contrast to most theoretical LGRB models, a relatively high metallicity threshold at near-solar values provides the best match between our model and observed LGRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxygen isotopes reveal low-mass star dominance in the Small Magellanic Cloud</a><span class="id">[2510.16343]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Oxygen isotope abundances and their ratios are fingerprints of stellar evolution and therefore provide a powerful tool in tracing the enrichment history of galaxies. However, their behavior in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies remains largely unexplored. The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby analog of young high-redshift galaxies, offers an ideal laboratory to investigate this regime. Using the Atacama Compact Array, we observed the $J=2\to 1$ transitions of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, and C$^{17}$O from the massive star-forming region LIRS 36 (aka N12A), achieving the first detection of C$^{17}$O in the SMC. This detection enables the first direct measurement of the $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O abundance ratio of 0.87$\pm$0.26 in this galaxy, substantially lower than all values in the literature, including molecular clouds in the Milky Way and other galaxies. Such a low ratio of $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O, together with a high $^{13}$CO/C$^{18}$O ratio, indicates chemical enrichment dominated by low-mass stars, consistent with the observed paucity of high-mass stars in the SMC. We suggest that the SMC is governed by a top-light integrated galaxy-wide initial mass function, predicted by the SMC's persistently low star-formation activities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CO in MASsive Spirals (CO-MASS): an IRAM 30m CO emission line survey of the CGM-MASS sample</a><span class="id">[2510.16441]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There exist extremely massive spiral galaxies in isolated environments, with stellar masses several times that of the Milky Way, yet their star formation rates (SFRs) are comparable to or even lower than that of the Milky Way. In this paper, we investigate the molecular gas properties of such galaxies to better understand the origin of their low SFRs. We present IRAM 30m CO observations of five extremely massive spirals from the CGM-MASS sample. We compare their star formation efficiencies (SFEs) with the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and find that these massive spirals generally exhibit low efficiency in converting molecular gas into stars. We further compare their molecular gas masses with their atomic gas and stellar masses, and also include the CHANG-ES sample galaxies observed with the IRAM 30m telescope in a similar manner for comparison. Our sample galaxies show low efficiency in converting atomic to molecular gas and have lower molecular gas fractions, suggesting that their suppressed star formation stems from both limited gas supply and inefficient star formation. Considering potential cold gas sources in massive spirals, we argue that their current reservoirs likely originate from past starburst or merger events rather than ongoing accretion in present isolated environments. Finally, we examine the location of these galaxies on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, finding them baryon-deficient and deviating from the trend of lower-mass galaxies. This suggests either a significant undetected baryonic component or a flattening/turnover of the relation at the high-mass end, consistent with the stellar mass-halo mass relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A UV to X-Ray View of Soft Excess in Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei. II. Broadband Correlations</a><span class="id">[2510.16525]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The physical origin of soft X-ray excess (SE) is a long lasting question, with two prevailing theories – “warm corona” and “ionized reflection” – dominating the discussion. In the warm corona scenario, SE originates from upscattered disk photons and should therefore correlate strongly with UV emission. Conversely, in the ionized reflection scenario, SE arises from the illumination of the accretion disk by the hot corona and should primarily correlate with the hard X-ray primary continuum (PC). In this second paper of the series, we investigate the correlations among SE, UV and PC, leveraging a sample of 59 unobscured type 1 AGNs compiled in \citet{Chen+2025a}. Our extensive analysis reveals a strong intrinsic correlation between SE and UV that remains robust after controlling for PC ($p_\mathrm{null}\lesssim 10^{-7}$). In contrast, the correlation between SE and PC is weaker but still statistically significant ($p_\mathrm{null}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-2}$). These findings suggest that, in addition to ionized reflection – a natural outcome of the hot corona illuminating the disk – a warm corona component is essential, and may even dominate, in producing the soft excess. Additionally, we report a mild anti-correlation between SE strength ($q$) and PC photon index ($\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$) ($p_\mathrm{null}=10^{-2}$), suggesting a potential competition between the warm and hot coronae. Finally, we find that the $\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$ values we derived with SE properly incorporated exhibit a much weaker correlation with $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ ($p_\mathrm{null}=2\times 10^{-2}$) than previously reported in the literature. This highlights the critical role of accurately modeling SE in studies of the $\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$–$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Fast Could Supermassive Black Holes Grow At the Epoch of Reionization?</a><span class="id">[2510.16532]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Utilizing cosmological hydrodynamic simulations we show that there is a brief super-Eddington accretion phase in typical halos at high redshift, impervious to AGN self-regulation. However, once having attained a black hole mass of $10^4-10^5\msun$, AGN feedback process can self-regulate to guide the SMBHs to grow at a significantly slower, sub-Eddington rate. By redshift $z\sim 10$ the black hole mass with an initial super-Eddington jump-start is caught up by that in the case with a steady Eddington limited case. Thus a continuous Eddington limit case represents the fastest possible route to maximally grow SMBHs. To account for the observed $z=7-10$ quasars with supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses, our analysis establishes firmer ground for the need of seed masses of $10^4-10^5\msun$ that are not grown via an earlier super-Eddington phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XRISM-Subaru views of Abell 754: Energetic ICM Motions Revealed by XRISM/Resolve</a><span class="id">[2510.16553]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the merging cluster Abell 754 using \textit{XRISM}/Resolve. In GO1 phase, \textit{XRISM}/Resolve observed Abell 754 in two deep pointings, targeting the eastern primary core (114 ks) and the middle of the X-ray filamentary structure (190 ks). Spectral fits to full field-of-view data reveal a line-of-sight velocity difference of $656 \pm 35$ km s$^{-1}$ between the two pointing, corresponding to a bulk Mach number of 0.45$\pm$0.03. Velocity dispersions are measured to be $220^{+26}_{-29}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $279^{+24}_{-23}$ km s$^{-1}$ in the eastern and middle pointing, respectively. Within the eastern core, the velocity dispersion shows spatial variation, reaching $497^{+144}_{-117}$ km s$^{-1}$ in the southern core with high temperature – among the largest values yet reported in galaxy clusters to date. Narrow-band analysis of the Fe–K complex in this region reveals systematically higher temperatures derived from He-like and H-like Fe line ratio compared to those obtained via broadband fits, indicating multi-phase structures. Two-temperature modeling further separates a cooler core phase from a hotter, shock or turbulence-heated phase whose velocity is blueshifted, similar to that of the middle pointing. These results point to a mixing interface where post-shock gas from the south overlaps, in projection, with cooler core gas, inflating the observed line widths in this region. Weak-lensing analysis with Subaru/HSC and Suprime-cam confirms that the eastern component is about twice as massive as the western one, consistent with disruption and gas stripping of the latter. The curved morphology of the eastern X-ray core, together with the measured kinematics, is naturally explained by an off-axis, post–core-passage merger that imparts angular momentum and drives large-scale rotational and fallback flows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16705" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The origin of the spectral versus dynamical age discrepancy in radio galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.16705]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the effect of turbulent magnetic fields on the observed spectral properties of synchrotron radio emission in large-scale radio galaxy lobes. We use three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of fast, high-powered jets to study the structure of the lobe magnetic fields and how this structure affects the radio spectrum of the lobes. It has previously been argued that lobe ages inferred from radio spectra underestimate the true ages of radio galaxies due to re-acceleration of electrons in the lobe, mixing of electron populations, or the presence of turbulent magnetic fields in the lobes. We find that the spectral ages with and without accounting for the lobe magnetic field structure are consistent with each other, suggesting that mixing of radiating populations of different ages is the primary cause of the underestimation of radio lobe ages. By accounting for the structure of lobe magnetic fields, we find greater spectral steepening in the equatorial regions of the lobe. We demonstrate that the assumptions of the continuous injection, Jaffe-Perola, and Tribble models for radio lobe spectra do not hold in our simulations, and we show that young particles with high magnetic field strengths are the dominant contributors to the overall radio lobe spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16737" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unbound Tails and Compressed Heads: A JCMT Study of the SFO 38 Cloud</a><span class="id">[2510.16737]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>SFO 38, located in the Cepheus molecular cloud within the northern part of the HII region IC 1396, is shaped by intense ultraviolet radiation from the nearby O6.5V-type star HD 206267 and represents a classic example of a bright-rimmed cloud (BRC) undergoing radiatively driven implosion (RDI). While previous studies have examined the southern globule using CS and 13CO (1-0), we present a refined analysis using high-resolution JCMT-HARP observations in the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O (J = 3-2) lines, deriving key physical parameters along with virial mass and turbulence properties of the southern head. We also perform the first detailed investigation of the northeastern and northwestern tails, determining their morphological dimensions and internal conditions, including excitation temperature, column density, mass, and volume density. Spectral and stability analyses reveal that the tail regions are gravitationally unbound and dynamically expanding, explaining the lack of active star formation. Our results further shed light on the evolutionary fate of these structures, assessing whether they may accumulate sufficient material to become future sites of star formation or remain quiescent. Overall, this work highlights the dual role of RDI in this BRC: while it triggers star formation in the dense head, it simultaneously disperses and dynamically reshapes the extended tails.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SS 433 - On flares affecting the slaved accretion disk</a><span class="id">[2510.16842]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Variations in the polar angle of the precessing jets in SS 433 are negatively correlated with variations in the speed of the jets.

We utilize the single-photon limit for PAH heating and emission to treat individual photon absorptions as independent events. This allows the construction of a set of single-photon emission &quot;basis spectra&quot; that can be scaled to produce an output emission spectrum given any input heating spectrum. We find that this method produces agreement with PAH emission spectra computed accounting for multi-photon effects to within $\simeq10\%$ in the $3-20~{\rm \mu m}$ wavelength range for radiation fields with intensity $U&lt;100$. We use this framework to explore the dependence of PAH band ratios on the radiation field spectrum across grain sizes, finding in particular a strong dependence of the 3.3 to $11.2~\mu$m band ratio on radiation field hardness. A Python-based tool and a set of basis spectra that can be used to generate these emission spectra are made publicly available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studying the Dust Distribution Around Accreting Black Holes with Reverberation Mapping Using PRIMA</a><span class="id">[2510.16977]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Variability studies are a powerful tool for studying the structures of unresolved sources. One such type of variability study, called reverberation mapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission, which demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the accretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a corresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the surrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been learned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of a potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust outflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how AGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as  50% of energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in the near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust sublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of the dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the dust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar outflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to high-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated from the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and ground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed modeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the distribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to the accretion disk luminosities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compact vs. Scattered: Suitability of Southern 6.7GHz Methanol Masers for VLBI astrometry</a><span class="id">[2510.16998]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 6.7 GHz methanol maser transition is exclusively associated with young, high-mass stars and represents a potential target for astrometric studies, including accurate determination of their distance through trigonometric parallax measurements.

We have used the Long Baseline Array to observe 187 southern 6.7 GHz methanol masers and identify 69 sources with one or more maser spots that are sufficiently compact and intense to be suitable targets for very long baseline interferometry astrometry with current instruments. Maser compactness appears to be a strong function of Galactic position, with masers that are likely in nearby spiral arms being more compact, while those associated with distant arms or the central Galactic region being less compact - a relationship we associate with scatter broadening.

Characterized by one-third to half-solar metallicity and strong UV radiation fields, the environment of the LMC allows us to study the physics and chemistry of star-forming regions under the conditions similar to those at earlier cosmological epochs. We detected five icy complex organic molecules (COMs): methanol (CH$_3$OH), acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH), methyl formate (HCOOCH$_3$), and acetic acid (CH$_3$COOH). This is the first conclusive detection of CH$_3$COOH ice in an astrophysical context, and CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, and HCOOCH$_3$ ices are the first secure detections outside the Galaxy and in a low-metallicity environment. We address the presence of glycolaldehyde (HOCH$_2$CHO, a precursor of biomolecules), an isomer of HCOOCH$_3$ and CH$_3$COOH, but its detection is inconclusive. ST6's spectrum is also rich in simple ices: H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, SO$_2$, H$_2$CO, HCOOH, OCN$^{-}$, HCOO$^{-}$, NH$_3$, and NH$_4^{+}$. We obtain the composition and molecular abundances in the icy dust mantles by fitting the spectrum in the 6.8-8.4 $\mu$m range with a large sample of laboratory ice spectra using the ENIIGMA fitting tool or the local continuum method. We found differences in the simple and COM ice abundances with respect to H$_2$O ice between ST6 and Galactic protostars that likely reflect differences in metallicity and UV flux. More laboratory ice spectra of COMs are needed to better reconstruct the observed infrared spectra of protostars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photoionization Modeling of Planetary Nebulae in the Galactic Bulge</a><span class="id">[2510.17265]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we present the results of photoionization modeling for 124 planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Galactic bulge.

The inner radii of the ionized regions range from 0.003 to 0.31 pc, with nebula diameters varying from 1.8&quot; to 34&quot;, averaging 7\% larger than the observed visible diameters. Elemental abundances for Helium, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Neon, Sulphur, Chlorine and Argon relative to hydrogen derived from the models show consistency within 0.5 dex, with notable variations in Sulphur, Nitrogen, and Chlorine. The study also compares elemental abundances from photoionization models with previous observations, showing overall good agreement, particularly for Cl/H, but notable discrepancies in He/H and S/H ratios. The models' goodness of fit, quantified by $\chi^{2}$ values, varies widely, with higher values linked to discrepancies in WISE photometric data. The evolutionary tracks of the central stars from H-R diagrams suggest progenitor masses ranging from 0.8 to 4.2 $M_\odot$ and progenitor final masses between 0.53 and 0.87 $M_\odot$, indicating significant mass loss during evolution. These PNe have post-AGB ages ranging from 150 to 20,000 years, consistent with the Galactic PNe distribution. Most of the PNe are in an intermediate evolutionary stage with larger nebular sizes. Our results provide the most comprehensive photoionization modeling to date, with key implications for central stars of PNe, gas, and dust.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estimating Orbital Parameters of Direct Imaging Exoplanet Using Neural Network</a><span class="id">[2510.17459]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we propose a new flow-matching Markov chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC) algorithm for estimating the orbital parameters of exoplanetary systems, especially for those only one exoplanet is involved.

For example, in the orbital parameter inference of beta Pictoris b, our model achieved a substantial speed-up while maintaining comparable accuracy-running 77.8 times faster than Parallel Tempered MCMC (PTMCMC) and 365.4 times faster than nested sampling. Moreover, our FM-MCMC method also attained the highest average log-likelihood among all approaches, demonstrating its superior sampling efficiency and accuracy. This highlights the scalability and efficiency of our approach, making it well-suited for processing the massive datasets expected from future exoplanet surveys.

However, the dependence of heating efficiency on jet properties is not fully understood. In this work, we present three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster, including both single-jet and self-regulated models, to investigate how jet density affects bubble evolution and the thermal balance of the intracluster medium. Our results confirm previous findings that lighter jets inflate more spherical bubbles and are more easily deflected by cold gas, enabling isotropic energy deposition throughout the cluster core. However, despite their broader spatial impact, lighter jets display lower overall heating efficiency, requiring higher average jet power to maintain self-regulation compared to heavier jets. We also find that the distribution and amount of cold gas significantly influence the effectiveness of jet heating. These results highlight jet density as a critical parameter in AGN feedback and emphasize the need to incorporate additional physical processes such as magnetic fields, viscosity, and cosmic rays in future studies for realistic comparisons with observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17565" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MEGADES: MEGARA galaxy disc evolution survey.

Using the MEGARA (Multi-Espectrografo en GTC de Alta Resolucion para Astronomia) instrument, our data combine relatively high spectral (R   6000) and spatial (0.62 arcsec) resolution to study the ionised gas through classic BPT diagnostics in the [N II] and [S II] variants. We examine how these diagrams vary with radius and with the velocity dispersion of the H-alpha line, and we propose a new diagnostic based on the ratio between the velocity dispersions of the [N II] 6584 and H-alpha lines to disentangle the relative roles of AGN, shocks and H II regions. Many regions, regardless of galactocentric distance, show shock-like emission, inferred from their line ratios (high [N II]6584/H-alpha and intermediate [O III]5007/H-beta) and their location between H II and AGN regimes. This improved selection of H II-like regions enables robust oxygen abundance estimates using the N2 indicator. Most galaxies show negligible metallicity gradients, especially low-abundance (&lt;8.37 dex) fast rotators, with an average slope of 0.005 dex Re^-1 and a dispersion of 0.42 dex Re^-1. Above 8.37 dex, fast rotators display mildly negative gradients (mean -0.68 dex Re^-1, dispersion 0.93). For the full MEGADES sample, the mean gradient is -0.03 dex Re^-1 with a dispersion of 0.77. We discuss the implications for the influence of galactic winds on abundance gradients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17579" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extending the [C/N]-Age Calibration: Using Globular Clusters to Explore Older and Metal-Poor Populations</a><span class="id">[2510.17579]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the coming years, detailed chemical abundances from large-scale high-resolution spectroscopic surveys will become available for vast numbers of stars across the Milky Way. Previous work has suggested that abundance ratios from these spectra can allow us to estimate ages from a large number of stars. These data will be leveraged to calibrate chemical clocks to age-date field stars, as reliable stellar ages remain elusive. In this work, we extended our empirical relationship between stellar age and their carbon-to-nitrogen ([C/N]) abundance ratio for evolved stars to older and more metal-poor stars by combining the original open cluster calibration sample and four globular clusters: 47 Tuc, M 71, M 4, and M 5. With this extension, [C/N] can be used as a chemical clock for evolved field stars to investigate not only regions within the metal rich disk, but also more metal-poor regions of our Galaxy. We have established the [C/N]-age relationship for APOGEE DR17 red giant stars, that have experienced the first dredge up but have not yet undergone any extra-mixing, in clusters usable for ages between $8.62 \leq \log(Age[{\rm yr}]) \leq 10.13$ and for metallicites of $-1.2\leq[Fe/H]\leq+0.3$. This relationship can be uniformly applied to these stars within the APOGEE DR17 sample. This measured [C/N]-age APOGEE DR17 relationship is also shown to be consistent with stellar ages derived from asterosiesmic results of APOKASC and APO-K2.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17693" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relics of High-redshift Compaction in our Backyard: The Most Metal-poor Stars in the Proto-Galaxy</a><span class="id">[2510.17693]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The earliest assembly of the Milky Way (MW) remains poorly understood, yet the spatial, chemical, and kinematic properties of its most metal-poor stars provide a unique fossil record of its proto-Galaxy phase. Understanding how this ancient component formed is essential for linking near-field Galactic archaeology to high-redshift galaxy evolution. We construct the currently largest 3-D map of inner-Galaxy metal-poor giants by combining several narrow/medium-band photometric surveys, reaching metallicities down to [Fe/H]$\sim-$3.5. Comparing observational data with Auriga 18 (Au18) from the Auriga cosmological simulations, we find that the proto-Galaxy population ([Fe/H]$\lesssim-$1.4) is highly centrally concentrated within the Galactocentric distance $r_{\rm gc}\lesssim$15 kpc, and forms a dispersion-supported structure with negligible rotation. The spatial and chemo-dynamical properties of observed proto-Galaxy population closely match those of the metal-poor stars in Au18. Considering Au18 as an analog of the MW, we propose a new scenario in which the formation of the proto-Galaxy is linked, for the first time, to episodes of high-z (z$\gtrsim$3) gas compaction, blue-nugget phases, and quenching processes. This framework provides a unified physical picture for the first $\sim$1-2 Gyr of the MW's evolution, bridging local fossil records with future studies of early star-forming galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A search for black holes with metal-poor stellar companions: I.

Motivated by the recent discovery of Gaia BH3, a $33 M_\odot$ BH with a very metal-poor giant companion, we conduct a systematic search for additional systems. Approximately 900 candidates are identified with Gaia as having significant deviations from single-star astrometric motion, evidence of RV variability, and low metallicities inferred from Gaia XP spectra. We obtain single epoch high-resolution spectra for over 600 of these sources with Magellan/MIKE and Lick/APF and measure independent RVs with $\approx 1$ km s$^{-1}$ precision. After removing contaminants such as hot stars, pulsators, eclipsing binaries, and hierarchical triples, we identify about 15 promising candidates with large RV amplitudes or offsets from the Gaia reported values. This program establishes a well-characterized sample of BH candidates for detailed orbital modeling once Gaia DR4 epoch astrometry and RVs are released in late 2026; multi-epoch RV follow-up is ongoing. Together, the Gaia and ground-based data will place new constraints on the demographics of BHs with metal-poor companions and test theoretical predictions linking low metallicity to the formation of the most massive stellar remnants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QUIJOTE scientific results XIX. New constraints on the synchrotron spectral index using a semi-blind component separation method</a><span class="id">[2510.17761]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a novel approach to estimate the spectral index, $\beta_s$, of polarised synchrotron emission, combining the moment expansion of CMB foregrounds and the constrained-ILC method. We reconstruct the maps of the first two synchrotron moments, combining multi-frequency data, and apply the `T-T plot' technique between two moment maps to estimate the synchrotron spectral index. This approach offers a new technique for mapping the foreground spectral parameters, complementing the model-based parametric component separation methods. Applying this technique, we derive a new constraint on the spectral index of polarised synchrotron emission using QUIJOTE MFI wide-survey 11 and 13 GHz data, Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data at K and Ka bands, and Planck LFI 30 GHz data. In the Galactic plane and North Polar Spur regions, we obtain an inverse-variance-weighted mean synchrotron index of $\beta_s = -3.11$ with a standard deviation of $0.21$ due to intrinsic scatter, consistent with previous results based on parametric methods using the same dataset. We find that the inverse-variance-weighted mean spectral index, including both statistical and systematic uncertainties, is $\beta_s^{\rm plane} = -3.05 \pm 0.01$ in the Galactic plane and $\beta_s^{\rm high\text{-}lat} = -3.13 \pm 0.02$ at high latitudes, indicating a moderate steepening of the spectral index from low to high Galactic latitudes. Our analysis indicates that, within the current upper limit on the AME polarisation fraction, our results are not subject to any appreciable bias. Furthermore, we infer the spectral index over the entire QUIJOTE survey region, partitioning the sky into 21 patches. This technique can be further extended to constrain the synchrotron spectral curvature by reconstructing higher-order moments when better-quality data become available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Increased molecular gas velocity dispersion and star formation efficiency in barred galaxy centres</a><span class="id">[2510.17768]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Work by the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) collaboration found higher molecular gas surface densities and velocity dispersions in the centres of barred galaxies compared to unbarred galaxies.

Comparisons of the molecular gas surface density, velocity dispersion, star formation rate, and depletion time reveal that these quantities are different in the centres of barred and unbarred galaxies. Gas depletion times are found to be shorter in barred galaxy centres. Even when we control for the presence of an AGN, the velocity dispersion and depletion time are found to be statistically different between barred and unbarred galaxy centres.

A dichotomy in star-forming galaxy disks</a><span class="id">[2510.17770]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The mass-size relations of galaxies are generally studied considering only stars or only gas separately. Here we study the baryonic mass-size relation of galaxies from the SPARC database, using the total baryonic mass ($M_{\rm bar}$) and the baryonic half-mass radius ($R_{\rm 50, bar}$). We find that SPARC galaxies define two distinct sequences in the $M_{\rm bar} - R_{\rm 50, bar}$ plane: one that formed by high-surface-density (HSD), star-dominated, Sa-to-Sc galaxies, and one by low-surface-density (LSD), gas-dominated, Sd-to-dI galaxies. The $M_{\rm bar} - R_{\rm 50, bar}$ relation of LSD galaxies has a slope close to 2, pointing to a constant average surface density, whereas that of HSD galaxies has a slope close to 1, indicating that less massive spirals are progressively more compact. Our results point to the existence of two types of star-forming galaxies that follow different evolutionary paths: HSD disks are very efficient in converting gas into stars, perhaps thanks to the efficient formation of non-axisymmetric structures (bars and spiral arms), whereas LSD disks are not. The HSD-LSD dichotomy is absent in the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation ($M_{\rm bar}$ versus flat circular velocity $V_{\rm f}$) but moderately seen in the angular-momentum relation (approximately $M_{\rm bar}$ versus $V_{\rm f}\times R_{\rm 50, bar}$), so it is driven by variations in $R_{\rm 50, bar}$ at fixed $M_{\rm bar}$. This fact suggests that the baryonic mass-size relation is the most effective empirical tool to distinguish different galaxy types and study their evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17804" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resolving the dusty star-forming galaxy GN20 at z=4.055 with NOEMA and JWST: A similar distribution of stars, gas and dust despite distinct apparent profiles</a><span class="id">[2510.17804]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-resolution (0.13&quot;-0.23&quot;) NOEMA observations of the dust continuum emission at 1.1 mm (rest-frame 220 micron) and JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of the z=4.055 starburst galaxy GN20. The sensitive NOEMA imaging at 1.6 kpc resolution reveals extended dust emission,  14 kpc in diameter (r_e 2.5 kpc, b/a=0.5), that is centrally asymmetric and clumpy. The dust emission is as extended as the stellar emission and the molecular gas traced by CO(2-1), with a common center, and is brightest in the strongly-obscured nuclear part of the galaxy. Approximately one-third of the total dust emission emerges from the nucleus and the most prominent clump to the south, and (only) 60% from the central 3.5x1.5 kpc (0.5&quot;-0.2&quot;), implying that the starburst is very extended. The combined JWST and NOEMA morphology suggests GN20 experienced a recent interaction or merger, likely invigorating the starburst. The radial surface brightness profiles of the molecular gas and near-IR stellar emission are similar, while in contrast, the dust emission appears significantly more concentrated. Through self-consistent radiative transfer modeling of the integrated and resolved CO and dust emission, we derive an $M_{mol}=2.9^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\times10^{11}$ Msun with $\alpha_{CO}=2.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$. We find that the extended dust implies a lower global dust optical depth than previously reported, but a high dust mass of $M_{dust}=5.7^{+0.8}_{-0.6}\times 10^{9}$ Msun and gas-to-dust ratio of  50. Furthermore, we show the distinct apparent radial profiles of the gas and dust can be explained purely by radiative transfer effects and the observations are consistent with the gas and dust mass being similarly distributed throughout the starburst. The latter highlights the importance of accounting for radiative transfer effects when comparing molecular gas and dust distributions from different tracers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The deep-MOND limit – a study in Primary vs secondary predictions</a><span class="id">[2510.16520]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In default of a fundamental MOND theory – a FUNDAMOND – I advocate that, alongside searching for one, we should try to identify predictions that follow from wide classes of MOND theories, if not necessarily from all.

This is shown by a Lagrangian model formulated in the framework of integrable Weyl geometry. It contains a Bekenstein-type (“aquadratic”) term and a second order term generating additional mass energy for the scalar field. Both are switched on only if the gradient of the scalar field is spacelike and below a MOND-typical threshold, like in the superfluid model of Berezhiani/Khoury. The mass term induces non-negligible energy and pressures of the scalar field and leads to gravitational light deflection compatible with MOND-ian free fall trajectories. In the weak field (Newton-Milgrom) approximation the Bekenstein term implies a deep MOND equation for the scalar field. In this model the external field effect of the MOND approach has to be reconsidered. This has important consequences for hierarchical systems like clusters, which may suffice for explaining their dynamics without additional dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pair creation in the vortex-driven magnetic fields of black holes</a><span class="id">[2408.01611]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the effects of pair creation on the radiation emerging from black holes under the assumption that the magnetic fields are vortex driven. In particular, for a sufficiently broad range of supermassive black holes, we investigated the energies at which photons undergo decay under the influence of a strong magnetic field, producing electron-positron pairs. Depending on particular physical parameters, it has been shown that in certain scenarios high or very high energy emission generated by black holes will be strongly suppressed, thus, will be unable to escape a zone where radiation is generated. In particular, photons with energies exceeding $\sim 1$ GeV will never leave the magnetosphere if they are generated at the scale 10$R_g$ and the threshold is of the order of $1$ TeV, if the emission is produced at $\sim 100\; R_g$. Analysing the process versus the black hole mass, assuming the region $100\; R_g$, it has been shown that for the considered lowest mass, the photons with energies $250$ GeV will never leave the black hole and for the considered highest mass the corresponding value is $\sim 250$ TeV.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00804" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on the Hubble and matter density parameters with and without modelling the CMB anisotropies</a><span class="id">[2410.00804]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti &amp; Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, &amp; Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &amp; Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of cosmic ray feedback during the epoch of reionisation</a><span class="id">[2501.17239]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxies form and evolve via a multitude of complex physics. In this work, we investigate the role of cosmic ray (CR) feedback in galaxy evolution and reionisation, by examining its impact on the escape of ionising radiation from galaxies. For this purpose, we present two Sphinx cosmological radiation-magneto-hydrodynamics simulations, allowing for the first time a study of the impact of CR feedback on thousands of resolved galaxies during the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). The simulations differ in their feedback prescriptions: one adopts a calibrated strong supernova (SN) feedback, while the other simulation reduces the strength of SN feedback and includes CR feedback instead. We show that both comparably regulate star formation, reasonably match observations of high-redshift UV luminosity functions, and produce a similar amount of hydrogen ionising photons. In contrast to the model with strong SN feedback, the model with CRs lead to incomplete reionisation, which is in strong disagreement with observational estimates of the reionisation history. This is due to CR feedback shaping the ISM differently, filling with gas the low density cavities otherwise carved by SN explosions. As a result, this reduces the escape of ionising photons, at any halo mass, and primarily in the close vicinity of the stars. Our study indicates that CR feedback regulates galaxy growth during the EoR, but negatively affects reionisation, a tension which paves the way for further exploration and refinement of existing galaxy formation and feedback models. Such improvements are crucial in order to capture and understand the process of reionisation and the underlying evolution of galaxies through cosmic time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Massive Black Hole Seed Formation in Strong X-ray Environments at High Redshift</a><span class="id">[2504.10581]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Direct collapse of pristine gas in early galaxies is a promissing pathway for forming supermassive black holes (BHs) powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at the epoch of reionization (EoR). This seeding mechanism requires suppression of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) cooling during primordial star formation via intense far-ultraviolet radiation from nearby starburst galaxies clustered in overdense regions. However, non-detection of 21 cm signals from the EoR reported by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) experiment suggests that such galaxies may also emit X-rays more efficiently than in the local universe, promoting H$_2$ production and thereby potentially quenching massive BH seed formation. In this study, we examine the thermal and chemical evolution of collapsing gas in dark matter halos using a semi-analytic model incorporating observationally calibrated X-ray intensities. We find that strong X-ray irradiation, as suggested by HERA, significantly suppresses direct collapse and leads most halos to experience H$_2$ cooling. Nevertheless, massive BH seeds with $M_\mathrm{BH} \gtrsim 10^4~M_\odot$ still form by $z\simeq 15$, particularly in regions with baryonic streaming motion, and their abundance reaches $\sim 10^{-4}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ sufficient to explain the SMBHs identified by JWST spectroscopy at $3&lt;z&lt;6$. While the formation of highly overmassive BHs with masses comparable to their host galaxies is prohibited by X-ray ionization, our model predicts that BH-to-stellar mass ratios of $\simeq 0.01-0.1$ were already established at seeding.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11445" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixel-level modelling of group-scale strong lens CASSOWARY 19</a><span class="id">[2504.11445]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first high-precision model for the group-scale strong lensing system CASSOWARY 19 (CSWA19), utilising images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Sixteen member galaxies identified via the red-sequence method, and the main halo, all modelled as the dual Pseudo Isothermal Elliptical profile (dPIE), are incorporated into a parametric lens model alongside an external shear field. To model the system, we adopt the PyAutoLens software package, employing a progressive search chain strategy for realizing the transition of source model from multiple Sérsic profiles to a brightness-adaptive pixelization, which uses 1000 pixels in the source plane to reconstruct the background source corresponding to 177,144 image pixels in the image plane. Our results indicate that the total mass within the Einstein radius is $M_{\theta_\mathrm{E}}$ $\approx 1.41\times10^{13}$M$_{\odot}$ and the average slope of the total mass density $\rho (r)\propto r^{-\gamma}$ is $\tilde{\gamma}=1.33$ within the effective radius. This slope is shallower than those measured in galaxies and groups but is closer to those of galaxy clusters. In addition, our approach successfully resolves the two merging galaxies in the background source and yields a total magnification of $\mu=103.18^{+0.23}_{-0.19}$, which is significantly higher than the outcomes from previous studies of CSWA19. In summary, our research demonstrates the effectiveness of the brightness-adaptive pixelization source reconstruction technique for modelling group-scale strong lensing systems. It can serve as a technical reference for future investigations into pixel-level modelling of the group- and cluster-scale strong lensing systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical friction for circular orbits in self-interacting ultralight dark matter and Fornax globular clusters</a><span class="id">[2504.19219]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of repulsive self-interaction in ultralight dark matter (ULDM) on dynamical friction in circular orbits in ULDM halos and its implications for the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy's globular clusters.

Our results show that self-interactions reduce the dynamical friction effect further than both the non-interacting ULDM and standard cold dark matter models. Furthermore, we derive the low Mach number approximation to simplify the analysis in the subsonic motion, where the tangential component of dynamical friction dominates. Applying these findings to the Fornax dSph, we calculate the infall timescales of globular clusters, demonstrating that strong self-interaction can address the timing problem more effectively.

Most of these models assume star formation efficiencies (SFE) of only a few percent, motivated by observations of nearby galaxies. In this work, we incorporate a scaling of SFE with gas surface density (which we refer to as Density Modulated SFE; DMSFE), motivated by cloud-scale simulations and theory, into a semi-analytic cosmological model (SAM) of galaxy formation which is calibrated to match the observed rest-UV sizes of high redshift galaxies. We also model the impact of dust and bursty star formation on the SAM-predicted properties of observed galaxies. We show that with plausible values of the main parameters, such as the fraction of gas in dense clouds $f_{\rm dense}$, our new models easily reproduce or even exceed the observed galaxy number densities at $z\sim 6$-17. While no single value of $f_{\rm dense}$ is able to reproduce the very shallow observed decline of the galaxy number density at $z\gtrsim 12$, it is plausible and even expected for $f_{\rm dense}$ to have some effective dependence on cosmic time, which could bring these models into closer agreement with the data. We show that the combined effects of DMSFE, decreasing dust attenuation, and increasingly bursty star formation at earlier cosmic epochs could conspire to reproduce the observed evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES) – XIX: Supermassive black hole mergers in the early Universe and their environmental dependence</a><span class="id">[2505.12591]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory, LISA, is expected to detect GW signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers occurring at high redshifts.

In this work, we utilize the First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, to study SMBH mergers at $5 \lesssim z \lesssim 10$ across a wide range of environments. Most mergers in FLARES involve secondary SMBHs near the seed mass ($m_{\rm seed} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$) while primary SMBHs span up to $10^{9}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$, resulting in mass ratios from $q \sim 10^{-4}$ to $1$, with a peak at $q \sim 1$. The number of mergers increases rapidly towards lower redshifts, and the comoving total number density scales with overdensity as $n_{\rm merger} = 10^{-3.81} (1 + \delta)^{4.78}$. Denser regions host more massive mergers, with higher merger redshifts and lower mass ratios. Within the FLARES redshift range, LISA is expected to detect mergers with $10^{5} \lesssim M_{\rm tot}/{\rm M}_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{8}$ and $q \gtrsim 10^{-2}$, corresponding to a detection rate of $0.030~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for events with signal-to-noise ratio ${\rm SNR} \geq 10$. Our study demonstrates the sensitivity of GW predictions at high redshifts to SMBH seed models and merger time delays, highlighting the need for improved modeling in future cosmological simulations to maximize LISA's scientific return.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scintillation Properties of PSR B1133+16 Measured with Very Long Baseline Interferometry</a><span class="id">[2506.02165]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The scintillation of pulsars reveals small-scale structure of the interstellar medium.

The LAE Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function (LF) is an essential measurement for making progress on both of these aspects. Although several studies have computed the LAE LF, very few have delved into how the function varies with environment. The large area and depth of the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey makes such measurements possible at the cosmic noon redshifts of z 2.4,  3.1, and  4.5. In this initial work, we present algorithms to rigorously compute the LAE LF and test our methods on the  16,000 ODIN LAEs found in the extended COSMOS field. Using these limited samples, we find slight evidence that protocluster environments either suppress the numbers of very faint and very bright LAEs or enhance medium-bright LAEs in comparison to the field.

This polarization-shape alignment effect was previously observed in a small sample of local spirals. If this is prevalent for disk galaxies out to cosmological redshifts, novel measurements of cosmic birefringence and cosmic shear will be enabled by leveraging radio continuum surveys synergized with galaxy shape measurements. We calculate the polarization-shape misalignment angle for star-forming galaxies in the \texttt{IllustrisTNG50} simulation at $0 &lt; z &lt; 2$, assuming that additional polarized radio emission from an AGN is negligible. The alignment found for $z=0$ is consistent with local spiral data, but significantly deteriorates as redshift increases. Moreover, it degrades toward lower frequencies due to internal Faraday depolarization. Thanks to cosmic redshifting, observing higher-$z$ galaxies at a fixed frequency greatly mitigates degradation due to reduced Faraday depolarization at the source-frame frequency. We present analytic fits to the non-Gaussian misalignment angle distribution, and evaluate Fisher information per galaxy for measuring cosmic birefringence. For observation at 4.8 GHz, the effective RMS misalignment angle $\sigma_{\alpha,{\rm eff}}$ is $18^\circ$, $23^\circ$ and $33^\circ$ at $z=0$, $1$ and $2$, respectively. Analyzing $N$ independent galaxies reduces the uncertainty on an isotropic cosmic birefringence signal to $\sigma_{\alpha,{\rm eff}}/\sqrt{N}$, providing competitive sensitivity once large samples are available. Our results motivate pilot observations to empirically characterize polarization-shape alignment, facilitate forecasts of cosmology and fundamental physics applications that exploit this effect.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-redshift AGN population in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations</a><span class="id">[2507.11605]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) have long been recognized as key probes of early black hole growth and galaxy evolution. However, modeling this population remains difficult due to the wide range of luminosities and black hole masses involved, and the high computational costs of capturing the hydrodynamic response of gas and evolving radiation fields on-the-fly. In this study, we present a new suite of simulations based on the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation framework, enhanced with on-the-fly radiative transfer, to examine AGN at high redshift (z &gt; 5) in a protocluster environment extracted from the MillenniumTNG simulation. We focus on the co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies, as well as the radiative impact on surrounding intergalactic gas. The model predicts that black holes form in overdense regions and lie below the local black hole-stellar mass relation, with stellar mass assembly preceding significant black hole accretion. Ionizing photons are primarily produced by stars, which shape the morphology of ionized regions and drive reionization. Given the restrictive black hole growth in the original IllustrisTNG model, we reduce the radiative efficiency from 0.2 to 0.1, resulting in higher accretion rates for massive black holes, more bursty growth, and earlier AGN-driven quenching. However, the resulting AGN remain significantly fainter than observed high-redshift quasars. As such, to incorporate this missing population, we introduce a quasar boosted model, in which we artificially boost the AGN luminosity. This results in strong effects on the surrounding gas, most notably a proximity effect, and large contributions to He ionization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A kinematic and structural study of young open clusters in the Milky Way Galaxy using Gaia DR3 catalogue</a><span class="id">[2507.13069]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We aim to identify the cluster members, estimate cluster properties, study the dynamical state of the clusters as a function of mass, trace the existence of dynamical effects in massive stars, and check for spatial patterns of members in young clusters.

We used the CIGALE spectral energy distribution fitting code to obtain star formation histories and infer the time since quenching for all the QGs in our sample. We used this information to gain insight into the time evolution of the dust content after quenching. Most QGs in our sample quenched around a redshift of $z\sim1.3$, following the peak of cosmic star formation. The majority of QGs observed at $z&gt;1$ are recently quenched (i.e. quenched for no longer than 500 Myr), whereas the majority of QGs observed at $z&lt;1$ have already been quenched for a significant amount of time ($\gtrsim1$ Gyr). This implies that high-redshift galaxies ($z\gtrsim2$) are ideal for studying the mechanisms of quenching and its effects on the ISM, while lower-redshift galaxies are more suitable for studying the long-term effects of the QG environment on their ISM. We obtain upper limits on the dust mass fraction of the QG population that indicate a lower dust content than what was found by earlier stacking studies, and significantly lower (by a factor of $\sim2-6$) than that of normal star-forming galaxies. We also place constraints on the initial gas fraction right after quenching. We find that within the first $\sim600$ Myr after quenching, QGs already lose on average $\gtrsim70\%$ of their cold ISM.

We report clear evidence for hot-dust emission in the \textit{median} stacked spectral energy distribution (SED), featuring a rising near-infrared continuum up to rest-frame $\lambda_{\rm rest}$$\sim$ 3$\mu$m, which is best explained by a standard dusty AGN structure. Although LRDs are likely a heterogeneous population, our findings suggest that most ($\gtrsim$50\%) LRDs show AGN-heated dust emission, regardless of whether the Optical/Ultraviolet (UV) continuum is stellar or AGN-dominated. In either case, the best-fit dusty-AGN SED, combined with the lack of X-ray detection in the deep \textit{Chandra} stacks, suggests that Compton-thick ($N_{\rm H}$$&gt;$3$\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius ($R$$_{\rm sub}$$\sim$0.1 pc).

At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment stellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the cluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for sufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar progenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We estimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF), with a PISN-induced cut-off $&lt;55{\rm M}_\odot$, gets shifted to values within the upper BH mass gap, $\sim 60-130{\rm M}_\odot$, or higher, as observed by Gravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.

The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a surprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent in the range $\approx 4-6$.

We discover a triaxial, nearly oblate dark-matter halo with $q_{\rm DM} = Z/X= 0.92\pm0.08$, $p_{\rm DM} = Y/X= 0.8\pm0.2$ averagely within 50 kpc, where $Z$ axis is defined perpendicular to the stellar disk. The axes ratio $q_{\rm DM} &gt; p_{\rm DM}$ is strongly preferred; the long-intermediate axis plane of the dark-matter halo is unexpectedly vertical to the Galactic disk, yet aligned with the `plane of satellites'. This striking configuration suggests that the Galactic disk (and the inner halo) has flipped, likely torqued by minor mergers, from an original alignment with the outer dark-matter halo and satellite plane, as supported by Milky Way analogues from Auriga and TNG50. By allowing $q_{\rm DM}(r)$ and $p_{\rm DM}(r)$ vary with radii, we find tentative evidence that the dark-matter halo is twisted, that it agrees alignment with the disk in the inner regions and transitions to a vertical orientation at $r\gtrsim 20$ kpc, supporting the disk flip scenario prediction. Such disk reorientation is non-trivial yet its physical mechanism is straightforward to comprehend and naturally originates a vertical satellite plane.

We show that the marginal case $\eta = 1$ is singled out by renormalization group (RG) and dimensional arguments, leading to a logarithmic potential and a $1/r$ force law at large distances, while smoothly recovering Newtonian gravity at short scales. The logarithmic correction is universal and regulator independent, indicating that the $1/r$ force arises as the robust IR imprint of quantum–field–theoretic scaling. This provides a principled alternative to particle dark matter, suggesting that galactic rotation curves and related anomalies may be understood as manifestations of the IR running of Newton's constant.</p></div></details></article>

This paper presents a comprehensive trade-off analysis of lunar frozen-orbit constellations for the Lunar Augmented Navigation Service (LANS), focusing on how the number of satellites and orbital parameters influence coverage, position dilution of precision (PDOP), orbit determination accuracy, receiver noise, and orbit insertion cost. Three Walker-constellation families based on frozen elliptical and circular orbits are examined to characterize their relative advantages across different semi-major axes and inclinations. Results show that larger semi-major axes enhance both polar and global coverage, though the optimal inclination depends on the constellation type and target service region. The south elliptical lunar frozen orbit (ELFO) Walker constellation provides superior performance for polar coverage and PDOP, whereas the circular lunar frozen orbit (CLFO) Walker configuration achieves the best global uniformity. Orbit determination errors and receiver noise both increase with larger semi-major axes and higher inclinations, reflecting weaker geometric observability and reduced received signal power at apolune for eccentric orbits. Orbit insertion analysis reveals clear trade-offs among transfer duration, characteristic energy ($C_3$) at trans-lunar injection, and insertion $\Delta V$: shorter transfers require higher insertion $\Delta V$, while low-energy transfers achieve smaller $\Delta V$ at the cost of months-long durations and higher $C_3$. These findings provide a systematic framework for designing LANS constellations for both regional and global coverage.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surprise non-detection of Upsilon Andromedae b with MIRC-X and MYSTIC at the CHARA Array</a><span class="id">[2510.16105]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ground-based long baseline interferometry is a powerful tool for characterizing exoplanets which are too close to their host star to be imaged with single-dish telescopes. The CHARA Array can resolve companions down to 0.5 milli-arcseconds, allowing us in principle to directly measure the near-infrared spectra of non-transiting &quot;Hot Jupiter&quot; exoplanets. We present data taken with the MIRC-X and MYSTIC instruments at the CHARA Array on the Hot Jupiter Upsilon Andromedae b. By resolving the star-planet system, we attempt to directly detect the flux from the planet. We describe our self-calibration methods for modeling systematics in the closure phase data, which allows us to reach sub-degree precision. Through combining multiple nights of data across two MIRC-X runs in 2019 and 2021, we achieved a very tentative detection of Ups And b in the H-band at a planet/star contrast of 2-3 x 10^-4. Unfortunately, we cannot confirm this detection with 2021 MYSTIC data in the K-band, or in a 2023 joint MIRC-X and MYSTIC dataset. We run updated global circulation models and create post-processed spectra for this planet, and report the resulting model spectra in H- and K-bands as a function of orbital phase. We then run planetary injection tests to explore H/K-band contrast limits, and find that we can confidently recover planets down to a planet/star contrast of 1-2 x 10^-4. We show that we are probing contrasts fainter than predicted by the model, making our non-detection surprising. We discuss prospects for the future in using this method to characterize companions with interferometry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linear Image Regridding and Coaddition with Oversampled Point Spread Functions: Lessons from 1D</a><span class="id">[2510.16110]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Image regridding and coaddition have a wide range of applications in astronomical observations. {\sc Imcom}, an algorithm that provides control over point spread function (PSF) and noise in coadded images, has been found to meet the stringent requirements of weak gravitational lensing cosmology with the forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. In this work, I introduce a new algorithm, Fast {\sc Imcom}, which outperforms traditional {\sc Imcom} in terms of both efficiency and quality. After explaining the underlying philosophy and mathematical formalism, I conduct systematic comparisons between {\sc Imcom} and Fast {\sc Imcom} in terms of PSF reconstruction in 1D. While a 2D implementation is beyond the scope of this paper, I demonstrate how to generalize Fast {\sc Imcom} to 2D and discuss practical issues involved. This new algorithm has the potential of reducing both the computational costs and storage requirements (current estimates are $\sim 100\,{\rm M}$ core hours and $\sim 1.5 \,{\rm PB}$, respectively) of the Roman High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS) by an order of magnitude. Meanwhile, it provides implications for the dithering patterns of Roman surveys.

Today, the majority of these measurements are derived from Echelle spectra in the optical wavelength region using cross-correlation techniques. Although for certain stars these approaches can produce RVs with sub-1 m s$^{-1}$ measurement errors, for many others, we are now in a regime where instrumental precision is fundamentally below the intrinsic RV variations of the star that result from astrophysical processes that can be correlated in both time and wavelength. We explore new methods for measuring exoplanet orbital parameters that take advantage of the fact that RV data sets are fundamentally multi-wavelength. By analyzing NEID extremely precise radial velocity (EPRV) data of three known exoplanet systems, we show that fitting a single Keplerian model to multi-wavelength RVs can produce a factor of 1.5 – 6.8 better $M_p \sin i$ uncertainties compared to fitting RVs that are derived from a weighted average across wavelength.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why every solar eclipse viewing event needs a disco ball</a><span class="id">[2510.16169]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar eclipses offer unparalleled opportunities for public engagement in astronomy.

Traditional methods like least-squares fitting and Markov Chain Monte Carlo have become computationally prohibitive for large-scale analysis, requiring minutes to days per star. Furthermore, these methods impose fundamental limitations on model complexity by requiring explicit likelihood functions, typically restricting them to Gaussian assumptions. We present neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based inference technique that directly approximates posterior distributions through neural networks trained on simulated spectra. Our approach provides accurate parameter inference in milliseconds per star after upfront training costs, enabling statistical tests of the procedure's reliability. We demonstrate NPE's effectiveness on DA, DB, and carbon-atmosphere white dwarfs, validating its calibration with simulation-based calibration and tests of accuracy with random points. Application to SDSS data shows excellent agreement with previous studies, recovering parameters from previous work within 6.8% for effective temperature and 2.1% for surface gravity, on average. We also apply our technique on WD 1153+012, a hot DQ star with a carbon-oxygen-hydrogen atmosphere, using high-resolution spectroscopy. This methodology combines computational efficiency with the flexibility to model complex atmospheres, making it ideal for upcoming surveys. Our approach also integrates spectroscopic and photometric constraints through an iterative procedure, providing comprehensive characterization of white dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Practical Framework for Estimating the Repetition Likelihood of Fast Radio Bursts from Spectral Morphology</a><span class="id">[2510.16338]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The repeating behavior of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is regarded as a key clue to understanding their physical origin, yet reliably distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters with current observations remains challenging. Here we propose a physically interpretable and practically quantifiable classification framework based on spectral morphology. Using dimensionality reduction, clustering, and feature-importance analysis, we identify the spectral running $r$ and spectral index $\gamma$ as the most critical parameters for distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME/FRB sample. In the $\gamma$-$r$ space, repeaters preferentially occupy regions with steeper, narrower-band spectra, whereas non-repeaters cluster in flatter, broader-band regions, resulting in a clear density separation. We further construct an empirical probability map in the $\gamma$-$r$ space, showing a clear gradient of repetition likelihood, from $\sim 65\%$ in the high-repetition region to $\sim 5\%$ in the low-repetition region. Combining this with Gaussian Mixture Model posterior analysis, we identify several apparent non-repeaters with high inferred repetition probability, recommending them as priority targets for future monitoring. This framework provides a simple and generalizable tool for assessing repeatability in the CHIME/FRB sample and highlights the diagnostic power of spectral morphology in unveiling FRB origins.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implications of Joint Spectral Analysis of Gamma-Ray Bursts detected by Fermi Large Area Telescope and Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on Phenomenological Correlations</a><span class="id">[2510.16475]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have emerged as powerful cosmological probes for exploring the distant Universe, owing to their immense luminosities and detectability at high redshifts. Several empirical correlations have been established, particularly involving their energy properties. This work aims to enhance the precision of these correlations through joint spectral analysis, focusing on reducing uncertainties in both the spectral indices and the peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$) derived from spectral fitting. We extend previous studies using both traditional and novel spectral models, utilizing a sample of 37 GRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope (LAT), incorporating the LAT Low-Energy (LLE) technique, over the period 2008-2024. Our analysis compares results from joint fits (GBM-LAT-LLE) against those from GBM-only fits. The study focuses on fitting time-integrated ${\rm T}_{90}$ and peak flux in the rest frame. Among the observable phenomenological correlations, we revisit the Amati and Yonetoku relations: the Amati relation links the intrinsic peak energy ($E_{i,\rm p}$) to the total isotropic energy ($E_{\rm iso}$) emitted during ${\rm T}_{90}$, while the Yonetoku relation connects $E_{i,\rm p}$ to the isotropic luminosity ($L_{\rm iso}$). Refining these correlations aims to deepen our understanding of GRB energetics and improve the precision of cosmological parameter estimates derived from GRB observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Readout of Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) Arrays for Habitable Worlds Observatory Using a Polyphase Filterbank Algorithm</a><span class="id">[2510.16600]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a nextgeneration ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope, will require detector technologies capable of supporting substantially larger pixel-count arrays than those flown on previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) provide a scalable solution through microwave multiplexing and have already been demonstrated in balloon-borne instruments using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for real-time signal processing. A central element of MKID readout is the Polyphase Filter Bank (PFB) spectrometer, which converts digitized timedomain signals into finely resolved frequency channels for subsequent analysis.

We employ traditional Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams along with their modern extensions, the Mass-Excitation (MEx) and Colour-Excitation (CEx) diagrams, to classify AGNs from among up to 600+ candidates. We extract the spectral properties utilising an indigenous spectral fitting code. In addition, the code also incorporates inputs from a state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis model (Bruzual and Charlot, 2003, MNRAS, 344, 1000), extracting the host galaxy ages and metallicities as model parameters. Redshift values for all the studied spectra are obtained from the literature. Using these redshift values, we are able to assign a 'lookback time' (using standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters). When this lookback time is combined with the galaxy ages (from spectral fitting), it enables us to study galaxy evolution even up to early cosmological epochs ($\sim$13 Gyr), despite restricting the studied field of galaxies to $z\sim 1$ (lookback time of $\sim$8 Gyr). We conclude that galaxies ultimately evolving into AGN hosts originate earlier ($\sim$8 Gyr ago) than non-AGN host galaxies ($\sim$6 Gyr ago). We relate this fact, that AGN hosts date back to an earlier epoch than non-AGN galaxies, as being likely due to higher cosmic temperatures at that time, probably enhancing black hole accretion. We emphasise that host galaxy age is an additional crucial parameter (apart from cosmological redshift) in defining our understanding of AGN and star formation co-evolution across cosmological time scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16758" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estimating Flux Densities of Diffuse Cosmological Radio Sources Exploiting Vision Transformers</a><span class="id">[2510.16758]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present TUNA, a Vision-Transformer based network adapted from segmentation to flux regression for faint, diffuse radio emission.

We find that using DALI, which extends the traditional Fisher Matrix (FM) method to higher orders, allows for a good approximation of the posterior with a $55$ times smaller computational cost, and that the cost-benefit of the doublet-DALI is better than that of the triplet-DALI.

However, the rarity of transient events and the extensive human labeling required for a large number of samples pose significant challenges in constructing training datasets for RB classification. Given these challenges, point source injection techniques, which inject simulated point sources into optical images, provide a promising solution. This paper presents the first detailed comparison of different point source injection strategies and their effects on classification performance within a simulation-to-reality framework. To this end, we first construct various training datasets based on Random Injection (RI), Near Galaxy Injection (NGI), and a combined approach by using the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network datasets. Subsequently, we train convolutional neural networks on simulated cutout samples and evaluate them on real, imbalanced datasets from gravitational wave follow-up observations for GW190814 and S230518h. Extensive experimental results show that RI excels at asteroid detection and bogus filtering but underperforms on transients occurring near galaxies (e.g., supernovae). In contrast, NGI is effective for detecting transients near galaxies but tends to misclassify variable stars as transients, resulting in a high false positive rate. The combined approach effectively handles these trade-offs, thereby balancing between detection rate and false positive rate. Our results emphasize the importance of point source injection strategy in developing robust RB classifiers for transient (or multi-messenger) follow-up campaigns.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Brief History of Inference in Astronomy</a><span class="id">[2510.17433]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this short review, we trace the evolution of inference in astronomy, highlighting key milestones rather than providing an exhaustive survey.

This motivates directional searches for astrophysical and cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds, as well as continuous-wave emitters. We present results of such a search using data from the first observing run through the first portion of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations. We apply gravitational-wave radiometer techniques to generate skymaps and search for both narrowband and broadband persistent gravitational-wave sources. Additionally, we use spherical harmonic decomposition to probe spatially extended sources. No evidence of persistent gravitational-wave signals is found, and we set the most stringent constraints to date on such emissions. For narrowband point sources, our sensitivity estimate to effective strain amplitude lies in the range $(0.03 - 8.4) \times 10^{-24}$ across all sky and frequency range $(20 - 160)$ Hz. For targeted sources – Scorpius X-1, SN 1987A, the Galactic Center, Terzan 5, and NGC 6397 – we constrain the strain amplitude with best limits ranging from $\sim 1.1 \times 10^{-25}$ to $6.5 \times 10^{-24}$.

A critical technical challenge is mitigating tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise, which is expected to be the third dominant noise source after laser frequency and clock noises. This noise is unavoidable in the presence of the residual angular movement of satellites, movable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and test masses (TMs), and needs to be subtracted after reducing the first two types of noises using time-delay interferometry (TDI). Previous works have shown that TTL coupling coefficients can be estimated from the null TDI channel $\zeta$ and used for noise subtraction in other combinations. However, it was found that correlated MOSA yaw jitters have a negative impact on the TTL calibration, and the effects of realistic residual angular jitters from drag-free and pointing control (DFPC) are yet to be investigated. In this paper, we use closed-loop DFPC simulations to generate more realistic jitters in the science mode and test TTL calibration capability. Our simulations reveal that rotating only one MOSA is more favorable, compared to symmetrically rotating two MOSAs, for enhancing the accuracy of TTL coefficient estimation, while employing only high-frequency data (0.1 - 1 Hz). Moreover, we propose two other methods to further improve estimation accuracy. Firstly, using different null channel combinations, such as $C_3^{14}$, enhances the least squares estimation accuracy even in the case of high correlations in MOSAs' yaw jitters. Secondly, injecting different sinusoidal artificial maneuvers to the six MOSAs also shows improvements. These methods can help TianQin to meet the 0.3 pm/Hz$^{1/2}$ requirement after the TTL noise subtraction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StarWhisper Telescope: An AI framework for automating end-to-end astronomical observations</a><span class="id">[2412.06412]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The exponential growth of large-scale telescope arrays has boosted time-domain astronomy development but introduced operational bottlenecks, including labor-intensive observation planning, data processing, and real-time decision-making.

Deployed across Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey's network of 10 amateur telescopes, the StarWhisper Telescope has detected transients with promising response times relative to existing surveys. Furthermore, StarWhisper Telescope's scalable agent architecture provides a blueprint for future facilities like the Global Open Transient Telescope Array, where AI-driven autonomy will be critical for managing 60 telescopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parameter estimation of gravitational-wave signals with frequency-dependent antenna responses and higher modes</a><span class="id">[2503.09627]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We implement frequency-dependent antenna responses and develop likelihood classes (standard likelihood, multibanded likelihood, and the relative binning (RB) likelihood) capable of handling the same within the framework of \texttt{Bilby}. We validate the approximate likelihoods by comparing them with the exact likelihood for a GW170817-like signal (signal-to-noise ratio   1900) containing higher-order modes of radiation. We use the relative-binning likelihood to perform parameter estimation (PE) for a GW170817-like signal, including Earth-rotation effects, detector-size effects, and higher-order modes. We study the system in several detector networks consisting of a single 40 km Cosmic Explorer, a 20 km CE and a present-generation detector at A+ sensitivity. The PE runs with RB take around a day to complete on a typical cluster.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atmospheric Dispersion Measurement at Hanle Site</a><span class="id">[2509.17300]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Atmospheric dispersion introduces wavelength-dependent effects that significantly impact ground-based observations, particularly in slit- and fibre-fed spectroscopic studies. These effects reduce the signal entering the spectrograph and introduce systematic errors in radial velocity measurements. To address this challenge, atmospheric dispersion correctors are utilised. However, many existing designs of these correctors, which are based on theoretical models, often lack practical validation and consistency. The forthcoming National Large Optical Telescope (NLOT) will be installed at Hanle, a site known for its favourable astronomical sky conditions. Thus, the design of an effective dispersion corrector for the instruments on the NLOT, specifically one that compensates for the measured dispersion, is crucial. For the first time, we have directly measured atmospheric dispersion at the Hanle site using the Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph mounted on the Himalayan Chandra Telescope. In this study, we present our methodology, the dispersion measurements obtained within the 400 to 700 nm wavelength range, and a comparison with modelled dispersion values.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calibration of the ComPair Balloon Instrument</a><span class="id">[2510.12938]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>ComPair, the prototype of the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO) mission concept, is a combined Compton imager and pair production telescope. It consists of four subsystems: a double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) Tracker, a virtual Frisch-grid cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) Low Energy Calorimeter, a cesium iodide (CsI) High Energy Calorimeter, and a plastic scintillator Anti-Coincidence Detector (ACD) to reject the charged particle background. These subsystems work together to reconstruct events, by tracking the locations and energies of gamma-ray scatters and pair production events. To quantify ComPair's scientific capabilities prior to a balloon launch in 2023, calibrations were performed to benchmark the instrument's performance in terms of angular resolution, energy resolution, and effective area. In this paper we provide an overview of the ComPair instrument and detail the calibration campaign. Finally, we compare our results to the expected performance based on simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03091" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sensitivity of a Gigahertz Fabry-Pérot Resonator for Axion Dark Matter Detection</a><span class="id">[2506.03091]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-Pérot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waging a Campaign: Results from an Injection-Recovery Study involving 35 numerical Relativity Simulations and three Waveform Models</a><span class="id">[2506.19990]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Bayesian inference results from an extensive injection-recovery campaign to test the validity of three state of the art quasicircular gravitational waveform models: \textsc{SEOBNRv5PHM}, \textsc{IMRPhenomTPHM}, \textsc{IMRPhenomXPHM}, the latter with the \textsc{SpinTaylorT4} implementation for its precession dynamics. We analyze 35 strongly precessing binary black hole numerical relativity simulations with all available harmonic content. Ten simulations have a mass ratio of $4:1$ and five, mass ratio of $8:1$. Overall, we find that \textsc{SEOBNRv5PHM} is the most consistent model to numerical relativity, with the majority of true source properties lying within the inferred 90\% credible interval. However, we find that none of the models can reliably infer the true source properties for binaries with mass ratio $8:1$ systems. We additionally conduct inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) consistency tests to determine if our chosen state of the art waveform models infer consistent properties when analysing only the inspiral (low frequency) and ringdown (high frequency) portions of the signal. For the simulations considered in this work, we find that the IMR consistency test depends on the frequency that separates the inspiral and ringdown regimes. For two sensible choices of the cutoff frequency, we report that \textsc{IMRPhenomXPHM} can produce false GR deviations. Meanwhile, we find that \textsc{IMRPhenomTPHM} is the most reliable model under the IMR consistency test. Finally, we re-analyze the same 35 simulations, but this time we incorporate model accuracy into our Bayesian inference. Consistent with the work in Hoy et al. 2024 [arXiv: 2409.19404 ], we find this approach generally yields more accurate inferred properties for binary black holes with less biases compared to methods that combine model-dependent posterior distributions based on their evidence, or with equal weight.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A flexible, GPU-accelerated approach for the joint characterization of LISA instrumental noise and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds</a><span class="id">[2507.06300]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>LISA data analysis represents one of the most challenging tasks ahead for the future of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. Characterizing the instrument's noise properties while fitting for all the other detectable sources is a key requirement of any robust inference pipeline. Noise estimation will also play a crucial role in searches and parameter estimation of cosmological and astrophysical stochastic signals. Previous studies have tackled this topic by assuming perfect knowledge of the spectral shape of the instrumental noise and of different possible types of GW Stochastic Backgrounds (SGWBs), usually resorting to parametrized templates. Recently, various works that employ template-agnostic methods have been presented. In this work, we take an additional step further, introducing flexible spectral shapes in both the instrumental noise and the stochastic signals. We account for the lack of knowledge of the exact shape of the individual contributions to the overall power spectral density by using splines to represent arbitrary perturbations of the noise and signal spectral densities. We implement a data-driven Reversible Jump MCMC algorithm to fit different components simultaneously and to infer the level of flexibility required under different scenarios. We test this approach on simulated LISA data produced under different assumptions. We investigate the impact of this increased flexibility on the reconstruction of both the injected signal and the noise level, and we discuss the prospects for claiming a successful SGWB detection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demonstration of a 1820 channel multiplexer for transition-edge sensor bolometers</a><span class="id">[2507.10929]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The scalability of most transition-edge sensor arrays is limited by the multiplexing technology which combines their signals over a reduced number of wires and amplifiers. In this Letter, we present and demonstrate a multiplexer design optimized for transition-edge sensor bolometers with 1820 sensors per readout unit, a factor of two more than the previous state-of-the-art. The design is optimized for cosmic microwave background imaging applications, and it builds on previous microwave superconducting quantum interference device multiplexers by doubling the available readout bandwidth to the full 4-8 GHz octave. Evaluating the key performance metrics of yield, sensitivity, and crosstalk through laboratory testing, we find an end-to-end operable detector yield of 78%, a typical nearest-neighbor crosstalk amplitude of  0.4%, and a median white noise level of 83 pA/rtHz due to the multiplexer, corresponding to an estimated contribution of 4% to the total system noise for a ground-based cosmic microwave background telescope. Additionally, we identify a possible path toward reducing resonator loss for future designs with reduced noise. We expect these developments to alleviate the system complexity, cryogenic requirements, and cost of future large arrays of low temperature detectors.</p></div></details></article></body>
