Analytical studies have reached different conclusions regarding loop capture in galaxies: early treatments argued for efficient capture, while later analyses incorporating the loop rocket force throughout halo formation found that capture efficiency is reduced and strongly dependent on loop size. In this work, we employ the N-body simulation code GADGET-4, introducing non-backreacting tracer particles subject to a constant recoil force to model cosmic string loops with the rocket effect. We simulate the formation of a Milky-Way-like halo from redshift $z=127$ to $z=0$, considering loop populations characterized by a range of length parameters $\xi$, inversely proportional to the rocket acceleration. We find that the number of captured loops exhibits a pronounced peak at $\xi_{\textrm{peak}}\simeq 12.5$, arising from the competition between rocket-driven ejection at small $\xi$ and the declining intrinsic loop abundance at large $\xi$. For fiducial string tensions, this corresponds to $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ loops within the halo. We further find that loops with weak rocket forces closely trace the dark-matter distribution, while those subject to stronger recoil but still captured – particularly the most abundant loops near $\xi_{\textrm{peak}}$ – are preferentially concentrated toward the central regions of the halo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23815" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COBIPLANE: A Systematic Search for Compact Binary Millisecond Pulsars at Low Galactic Latitudes</a><span class="id">[2512.23815]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the main results obtained from the COmpact BInary Pulsar search in the low-LAtitude NEighborhood (COBIPLANE), an optical photometric survey designed to find new `spider' binary millisecond pulsars. We conducted observations targeting 30 unidentified sources from the 4FGL-DR3 Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) catalog, selected for their pulsar-like $\gamma$-ray properties. Extending to Galactic latitudes as low as $\pm3^{\circ}$, this survey reaches closer to the Galactic plane than its predecessor survey, the COmpact BInary PULsar SEarch (COBIPULSE). We report the discovery of five optical variables coincident with the localizations of 4FGL J0821.5-1436, 4FGL J1517.9-5233, 4FGL J1639.3-5146, 4FGL J1748.8-3915, and 4FGL J2056.4+3142. These systems show optical flux modulation at the presumed orbital periods of $0.41576(6) \ \mathrm{d}$, $0.305(2) \ \mathrm{d}$, $0.204(7) \ \mathrm{d}$, $0.3(2) \ \mathrm{d}$, and $0.4395(1) \ \mathrm{d}$, respectively, and photometric temperatures of $4000$–$6000 \ \mathrm{K}$, consistent with the companion stars of `redback' subtype of spider pulsar binaries. Based on their optical light curve shapes and X-ray properties characteristic for spider systems – namely, a luminosity of $1.5 \times 10^{32} \ (D / 3.9 \ \mathrm{kpc})^2 \ \mathrm{erg} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ($0.3$–$10 \ \mathrm{keV}$) for 4FGL J1748.8-3915, and upper limits of $\sim10^{31}$–$10^{33} \ \mathrm{erg} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ($0.2$–$12 \ \mathrm{keV}$) for the others – we classify these sources as new spider candidate systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A secondary orbiter under collisions with an accretion disk</a><span class="id">[2512.23826]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dynamics of stellar orbits in dense stellar systems and nuclear star clusters (NSC) with an embedded supermassive black hole (SMBH) is governed a complex interplay of different forces. In particular, star–star gravitational collisions (relaxation), physical collisions between stars, and the hydrodynamical interaction with any surrounding gaseous environment, such as an accretion disk. These processes influence the stellar distribution, the feeding of the central black hole, and the generation of observable phenomena. Furthermore, the self-gravity of the accretion medium modulates the long-term evolution, adding significant complexity to the system's dynamics. By employing elementary arguments we outline the mentioned influences in their mutual competition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tianlai-WIYN North Celestial Cap Redshift Survey</a><span class="id">[2512.23899]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the results of a small, low redshift spectroscopic survey of galaxies within 3 degrees of the North Celestial Pole (NCP) selected using V-band photometry obtained from the North Celestial Cap Survey (NCCS) (Gorbikov &amp; Brosch 2014). The purpose of the current survey is to create a redshift space template for 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen with which to correlate radio line intensity observations by the Tianlai dish and cylinder interferometers. A total of 898 redshifts were obtained from the 2102 extended objects in the NCCS with m_V &lt; 19 in the survey area. After accounting for extinction, the survey geometry and selection effects, the number density and clustering pattern of galaxies in the redshift catalog are consistent with other low redshift surveys. We were also able to identify 11 galaxy cluster candidates from this redshift catalog.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time-Dependent Accretion Disks with Magnetically Driven Winds: Green's Function Solutions</a><span class="id">[2512.23999]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Green's function solutions for a geometrically thin, one-dimensional Keplerian accretion disk that includes angular momentum extraction and mass loss due to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds. The disk viscosity is assumed to vary radially as $\nu \propto r^{n}$. We derive solutions for three types of boundary conditions applied at the inner radius $r_{\rm in}$: (i) zero torque, (ii) zero mass accretion rate, and (iii) finite torque and finite accretion rate, and investigate the time evolution of a disk with an initial surface density represented by a Dirac-delta function. The mass accretion rate at the inner radius decays with time as $t^{-3/2}$ for $n = 1$ at late times in the absence of winds under the zero-torque condition, consistent with Lynden-Bell &amp; Pringle (1974), while the presence of winds leads to a steeper decay. All boundary conditions yield identical asymptotic time evolution for the accretion and wind mass-loss rates, though their radial profiles differ near $r_{\rm in}$. Applying our solutions to protoplanetary disks, we find that the disk follows distinct evolutionary tracks in the accretion rate-disk mass plane depending on $\psi$, a dimensionless parameter that regulates the strength of the vertical stress driving the wind, with the disk lifetime decreasing as $\psi$ increases due to enhanced wind-driven mass loss. The inner boundary condition influences the evolution for $\psi &lt; 1$ but becomes negligible at higher $\psi$, indicating that strong magnetically driven winds dominate and limit mass inflow near the boundary. Our Green's function solutions offer a general framework to study the long-term evolution of accretion disks with magnetically driven winds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine-learning approaches to dispersion measure estimation for fast radio bursts</a><span class="id">[2512.24003]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, mostly millisecond-duration transients of extragalactic origin whose emission mechanisms remain unknown. As FRB signals propagate through ionized media, they experience frequency-dependent delays quantified by the dispersion measure (DM), a key parameter for inferring source distances and local plasma conditions. Accurate DM estimation is therefore essential for characterizing FRB sources and testing physical models, yet current dedispersion methods can be computationally intensive and prone to human bias. In this proof-of-concept study, we develop and benchmark three deep-learning architectures, a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), a fine-tuned ResNet-50, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, for automated DM estimation. All models are trained and validated on a large set of synthetic FRB dynamic spectra generated using CHIME/FRB-like specifications. The hybrid CNN-LSTM achieves the highest accuracy and stability while maintaining low computational cost across the investigated DM range. Although trained on simulated data, these models can be fine-tuned on real CHIME/FRB observations and extended to future facilities, offering a scalable pathway toward real-time, data-driven DM estimation in large FRB surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atmospheric Mass Flux as a Function of Ionospheric Emission on Unmagnetized Earth</a><span class="id">[2512.24004]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore ion escape from, and solar ion deposition to, \hll{an unmagnetized Earth-like planet}. We use RHybrid, an ion-kinetic electron-fluid code to simulate the global plasma interaction of unmagnetized Earth with the solar wind. We vary the global ionospheric emission rate, and quantify the resultant planetary ion escape rates ($O^+$ and $H^+$) and the solar wind deposition rate ($H^+$). We use these results to compute the net mass flux to the atmosphere and find that the solar ion deposition rate could be comparable to planetary ion escape rates. For the emission rates simulated, our results show that under typical solar wind conditions ($v_{sw} = 400 \ km \ s^{-1}$, $n_{sw} = 5 \ cm^{-3}$), the mass of the atmosphere would decrease by less than 3\% over a billion years, indicating that Earth's intrinsic magnetic field may be unnecessary for retention of its atmosphere. Lastly, we present a hypothesis suggesting that ionospheric emission may evolve through time towards a critical emission rate that occurs at a net mass flux of zero.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24085" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSC Radiation in the ICMART Model: Spectral Simulations and Application to the Record-Breaking GRB 221009A</a><span class="id">[2512.24085]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents simulations of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectrum within the Internal-Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. We investigate how key parameters like the magnetization $\sigma_0$ shape the broadband spectral energy distribution by regulating the electron distribution and magnetic field strength. The overall spectrum typically comprises two components: synchrotron radiation peaking at $E_{\rm p}$ with a low-energy spectral index $\alpha$ between -1 and -1.5, and an SSC component peaking at $E_{\rm ssc}$. At high energies, Klein-Nishina suppression causes an exponential cutoff. The flux ratio Y between these components is critical: when Y is small, the SSC peak can be suppressed. Spectral features of the synchrotron component reveal the underlying physical conditions: harder spectra with $\alpha\sim-1$ indicate a large Y parameter and strong KN suppression. We find a positive correlation between Y and $\sigma_0$, contrasting with internal shock model predictions. Applied to GRB 221009A, our model suggests $\sigma_0\leq20$ can reproduce the MeV-TeV observations. This study underscores the value of combined MeV-TeV observations in probing GRB emission mechanisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of Accretion Properties in Mrk 1040 using long-term X-ray Observations</a><span class="id">[2512.24141]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive long-term, multi-epoch spectral and timing study of the Seyfert 1 Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) Mrk 1040, utilizing X-ray observations spanning from 2009 to 2024 ($\sim$15 years). The source exhibits pronounced spectral and temporal variability, indicative of transitions between different accretion regimes in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole. The earlier reported soft excess is re-examined within a uniform, physically motivated multi-epoch framework. We confirm the presence of this soft excess in the 2009 observation, where it is well described by a warm, extended Comptonizing corona with $kT_{\rm e,warm} \sim 0.26$ keV and a radial extent of $R_{\rm warm} \sim 30~r_g$. In subsequent epochs, the soft excess is not statistically significant, possibly due to a combination of enhanced ionized absorption, intrinsic weakening of the warm Comptonizing region, or partial truncation of the inner disc. A strong correlation between the soft and hard X-ray fluxes suggests a common physical origin for both components, likely within a multi-layered Comptonizing structure that evolved into a compact and thermally stable corona after 2013. The observed spectral variability, together with changes in the Fe K$\alpha$ line strength, reflects the evolving coronal geometry and accretion flow dynamics. Variations in the intrinsic column density ($N_H$) further indicate that Mrk 1040 is embedded within a clumpy, dynamically variable absorber responding to changes in the accretion rate. Using the TCAF model, we estimate the black hole mass as $M_{\rm BH} = (4.50 \pm 1.62) \times 10^7~M_\odot$, consistent with previous estimates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24178" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Seyfert galaxy as a hidden counterpart to a neutrino-associated blazar</a><span class="id">[2512.24178]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin and production mechanisms of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos remain open questions in multimessenger astronomy. Previous studies have hinted at a possible linear correlation between the hard X-ray and high-energy neutrino emission in active galactic nuclei. New \textit{NuSTAR} observations, first presented here, reveal that blazar PKS 1424+240, located within a prominent IceCube neutrino hotspot, is far fainter in hard X-rays than expected from this trend. Motivated by this apparent ambiguity, we identify the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 5610, also coincident with the hotspot, whose unabsorbed hard X-ray flux exceeds that of PKS 1424+240 by about an order of magnitude. When the local IceCube neutrino flux is apportioned between the two AGN in proportion to their hard X-ray emission, both align with the previously suggested X-ray-neutrino correlation. This suggests that certain IceCube hotspots may be unresolved blends of multiple AGN, and supports a multimessenger scenario in which high-energy neutrinos and hard X-rays originate from the same hadronic interactions, with the X-ray emission produced through cascade reprocessing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidally Trapped Two-pole Pulsations Discovered in a Close Binary with a Massive $β$ Cephei Star</a><span class="id">[2512.24185]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidally tilted pulsators (TTPs), whose pulsation axis aligns with the binary's semi-major axis, represent a newly established class of oscillators in binary systems. While all previously known TTPs are either $\delta$ Scuti or subdwarf B-type stars, their existence has remained unidentified in more massive $\beta$ Cephei variables. Here, we report the discovery of tidally trapped pulsations in the massive ellipsoidal variable HD 329379, based on photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Our analysis reveals a $\beta$ Cephei pulsator in a 2.25-day orbit whose pulsation mode amplitude is strongly modulated with the orbital frequency. Based on our analysis, we concluded that this modulation can be explained by pulsations with significantly larger amplitude near the star's two tidal poles (apsides). We interpret this as a tidally distorted quadrupole pulsation chariacteristiced by trapped two-pole pulsations, with a pulsation axis aligned with the tidal axis. This represents the first identification of such a pulsation mode in a $\beta$ Cephei star, which differs from single-sided pulsations observed in previous works, marking a rare and important discovery. Our work extends the family of TTPs beyond $\delta$ Scuti and subdwarf B-type stars to include more massive $\beta$ Cephei variables. In particular, the two-pole pulsator HD 329379 stands out as the prototype of a new class of TTPs in massive stars. These results not only provide a new insight to probe the interior structure and evolutionary state for massive stars but also offer a unique opportunity to study the interaction between pulsations and strong tidal distortions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24203" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abundance Stratification in Type Iax SN 2020rea with TARDIS</a><span class="id">[2512.24203]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using the 1D Monte Carlo-based radiative transfer code TARDIS, we investigate the spectral evolution of the Type Iax supernova (SN) 2020rea from -7 days before to +21 days after maximum light.

As the SN evolves, the ejecta transition from a layered to a more homogeneous composition, posing an alternative to pure deflagration models that predict fully mixed ejecta.

The very-high-energy (VHE, E &gt; 100 GeV) spectra of blazars are always affected by $\gamma\gamma$ absorption by the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) and subsequently, no blazars have been detected in VHE $\gamma$-rays at redshifts exceeding 1. Extending the redshift range of VHE-detected blazars to $z \gtrsim 1$ will yield insights into the cosmological evolution of both the VHE blazar population and the EBL. This is the goal of a target-of-opportunity (ToO) programme by H.E.S.S. to observe flaring high-redshift ($z \gtrsim 1$) blazars. We report on H.E.S.S. ToO and multi-wavelength observations of the blazar PKS 0346$-$27. Along with H.E.S.S., simultaneous data from {\it Fermi}-LAT, {\it Swift} (XRT and UVOT), and ATOM have been analysed and modelled using single-zone leptonic and hadronic models. PKS 0346-27 has been detected by H.E.S.S at a significance of 6.3$\sigma$ during one night, on 3 November 2021, while for other nights before and after this day, upper limits on the VHE flux are determined. No evidence for intra-night $\gamma$-ray variability has been found. A flare in high-energy (HE, $E &gt; 100$ MeV) $\gamma$-rays detected by {\it Fermi}-LAT preceded the H.E.S.S. detection by 2 days. A fit with a single-zone emission model to the contemporaneous spectral energy distribution during the detection night was possible with a proton-synchrotron-dominated hadronic model, requiring a proton-kinetic-energy-dominated jet power temporarily exceeding the source's Eddington limit, although alternative (e.g. multi-zone) models can not be ruled out. A one-zone leptonic model is, in principle, also able to fit the flare-state SED, however, requiring implausible parameter choices, in particular, extreme Doppler and bulk Lorentz factors of $\gtrsim 80$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Improved lanthanide constraints for the kilonova AT 2017gfo</a><span class="id">[2512.24257]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spectroscopic observations of the kilonova AT 2017gfo provide a unique opportunity to identify signatures from individual heavy elements freshly synthesised via the {\it r}-process, the nucleosynthetic channel responsible for producing $\sim$half of all trans-iron-group elements. Limitations in the available atomic data have historically hampered comprehensive line identification studies; however, renewed interest has led to the generation of improved (more complete and accurately calibrated) line lists for {\it r}-process species. Here we demonstrate the utility of such data, by exploiting newly generated line lists for the lanthanides to model the photospheric-phase 3.4d X-shooter spectrum of AT 2017gfo with the radiative transfer tool \textsc{tardis}. We find the data can only be reproduced by invoking a substantially diminished lanthanide mass fraction ($X_{\textsc{ln}}$) than that proposed by previous studies. Specifically, our model necessitates $X_{\textsc{ln}} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-3}$, a value $20 \times$ lower than previously claimed. This substantial reduction in $X_{\textsc{ln}}$ is driven by our inclusion of much more complete lanthanide line information that enables better estimation of their total contribution to the observations. We encourage future modelling works to exploit all atomic data advances, and also encourage continued efforts to generate the necessary data for the remaining {\it r}-process species of interest.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24309" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$S_8-H_0$ tension in a SI-ULDM scenario</a><span class="id">[2512.24309]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the cosmological impact of a transient self-interaction phase in Ultra-Light Dark Matter (ULDM), focusing on its simultaneous effects on the sound horizon and the late-time growth of structure. In the presence of a quartic self-interaction, the scalar field undergoes a short-lived radiation-like phase before evolving into matter-like behaviour, inducing a localized modification of the expansion history at early times. We develop a perturbative and model-independent framework in which the self-interaction energy density is parametrized as a localized contribution to the total energy budget. Within this approach, the responses of the sound horizon and the linear growth factor can be expressed as weighted integrals over cosmic time, with distinct kernels encoding the temporal sensitivity of each observable. This structure leads to a simple analytic relation linking the corresponding early- and late-time responses, and naturally predicts correlated shifts in $H_0$ and $S_8$ whose sign and magnitude depend on the timing of the self-interaction episode. Our results show that a single transient modification of the expansion history can interpolate between early-time effects on the sound horizon and late-time suppression of structure growth within a unified physical framework, providing an analytical understanding of their joint response.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Likelihood of Hosting Undetected Brown Dwarfs in the Solar Vicinity</a><span class="id">[2512.24319]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Based on the spatial distribution of objects in the solar neighbourhood with a radius of 20 parsecs, and after correcting for the incompleteness of observational data, an expression was obtained for estimating the probability of finding an object at a given distance from the Sun.

We focus on the role of self-interactions, assuming all other non-gravitational couplings to Standard Model particles are negligible. Such ultra light dark matter (ULDM) is expected to form stable self-gravitating scalar field configurations (solitons), whose properties depend on the particle mass and self-coupling $\lambda$. Using solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, we explore how galactic-scale observations can constrain $m$ and $\lambda$. We show that observational upper limits on the mass enclosed in central galactic regions can probe both attractive and repulsive self-interactions with strengths $\lambda \sim \pm 10^{-96} - 10^{-95}$. We further demonstrate that self-interactions can allow ULDM to describe observed rotation curves as well as satisfy an empirical soliton-halo mass relation in low surface brightness galaxies for $m \sim 10^{-22}\ \text{eV}$ and $\lambda \gtrsim 10^{-90}$. We also study tidal effects in satellite dwarf galaxies and find that attractive self-interactions can extend their lifetimes over cosmological timescales, allowing ULDM to evade recent constraints derived for the non-interacting case. Finally, we explore machine learning based inference of dark matter and baryonic parameters from galaxy rotation curves, showing that neural networks can recover parameters consistent with observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24369" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Integrated Sachs-Wolfe maps from the Gower Street $w$CDM simulations</a><span class="id">[2512.24369]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The late-time linear Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect directly probes the dynamics of cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark energy. Detecting these weak, secondary temperature anisotropy signals of the CMB requires accurate theoretical predictions of their amplitude across cosmological models. By extending the pyGenISW package, previously limited to $\Lambda$CDM, we aim to generate full-sky ISW maps for a suite of 791 $w$CDM cosmologies using the Gower Street N-body simulations, thereby enabling ISW analyses across a broader dark-energy parameter space. We make our code and ISW data publicly available. We compute the ISW signals by tracing the time evolution of the gravitational potential across large-volume simulations that span dark energy equation of state parameters from phantom to quintessence, $-1.79 \lesssim w \lesssim -0.34$. These data are projected onto the sphere using HEALPix to obtain full-sky temperature maps. We validate our pipeline by comparing the measured ISW angular power spectra and ISW-density cross-correlations against linear theory expectations ($2 \leq \ell \leq 200$) computed with benchmarks from the pyCCL library. The agreement is excellent across the multipole range where the ISW contribution is expected to dominate, confirming the reliability of our modelling of gravitational-potential evolution. With additional tests of the ISW signal's strength in density extrema, as well as comparing all models to a reference $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we found that quintessence-like models ($w &gt; -1$) show higher ISW amplitudes than phantom models ($w &lt; -1$), consistent with enhanced late-time decay of gravitational potentials. The consistency of our $w$CDM ISW maps and their agreement with theory predictions confirm the robustness of our methodology, establishing it as a reliable tool for theoretical and observational ISW-LSS analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbulence-Driven Corrugation of Collisionless Fast-Magnetosonic Shocks</a><span class="id">[2512.24425]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Collisionless fast-magnetosonic shocks are often treated as smooth, planar boundaries, yet observations point to organized corrugation of the shock surface. A plausible driver is upstream turbulence. Broadband fluctuations arriving at the front can continually wrinkle it, changing the local shock geometry and, in turn, conditions for particle injection and radiation. We develop a linear-MHD formulation that treats the shock as a moving interface rather than a fixed boundary. In this approach the shock response can be summarized by an effective impedance determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot base state and the shock geometry, while the upstream turbulence enters only through its statistics. This provides a practical mapping from an assumed incident spectrum to the corrugation amplitude, its drift along the surface, and a coherence scale set by weak damping or leakage. The response is largest when the transmitted downstream fast mode propagates nearly parallel to the shock in the shock frame, which produces a Lorentzian-type enhancement controlled by the downstream normal group speed. We examine how compression, plasma $\beta$, and obliquity affect these corrugation properties and discuss implications for fine structure in heliospheric and supernova-remnant shock emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D Radiative MHD Modeling of Particle Beam Heating of the Solar Atmosphere</a><span class="id">[2512.24507]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While solar flares are primarily associated with enhanced ultraviolet and X-ray emission, a subset of flares exhibit significant continuum brightening in visible light and are classified as white-light flares (WLFs). Despite extensive observational and modeling efforts, the physical mechanisms responsible for the compact, short-lived photospheric brightenings in WLF kernels observed during the impulsive phase of solar flares remain uncertain. Thick-target electron-beam models typically deposit energy in the upper chromosphere, and their ability to reproduce the magnitude and spatial localization of photospheric continuum enhancements observed in white-light flare kernels remains an open question. To investigate the role of realistic atmospheric structuring and multidimensional transport in flare energy deposition, we perform three-dimensional radiative MHD simulations of electron-beam heating using the StellarBox code for beam fluxes of $10^{12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and low-energy cutoffs of 10–25 keV. We then compute Fe I 6173 Å Stokes profiles using the RH 1.5D radiative transfer code for direct comparison with Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) observations. The simulations produce strong upper-chromospheric heating, multiple shock fronts, and continuum enhancements up to a factor of 2.5 relative to pre-flare levels, comparable to continuum enhancements observed during strong X-class white-light flares. Comparison with one-dimensional RADYN simulations highlights the influence of fine-scale structuring on flare dynamics and continuum emission that arises in three-dimensional geometry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24538" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seafloor Weathering and Stochastic Outgassing Unlikely to Significantly Shorten the Future Lifespan of Earth's Terrestrial Biosphere</a><span class="id">[2512.24538]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current understanding suggests that as the Sun brightens in the far future, Earth's carbonate-silicate cycle will offset increasing temperatures by drawing CO$_2$ out of the atmosphere, ultimately leading to the extinction of all terrestrial plant life via either overheating or CO$_2$ starvation. Most previous estimates put the future lifespan of Earth's terrestrial biosphere at $\sim$1 billion yr, but recent work used a new coupled climate-continental weathering model with up-to-date parameter constraints to revise this estimate upward to 1.6-1.86 billion yr. In this study, we extend the model to examine the impacts of seafloor weathering and stochastic variations in CO$_2$ outgassing rates on the remaining lifespan of Earth's terrestrial biosphere. We find that if seafloor weathering has a stronger feedback than continental weathering and accounts for a large portion of global silicate weathering, then the remaining lifespan of the terrestrial biosphere can be shortened, but a lifespan of more than 1 billion yr (Gyr) remains likely. Similarly, stochastic fluctuations in outgassing rates can have a significant impact if the size of the fluctuations exceed those observed over the last 1 billion yr. The impact of weak seafloor weathering and lower variability stochasticity are minor. Our work provisionally supports a lengthened lifespan of Earth's terrestrial biosphere, suggests robustness of this lengthened lifespan to planetary parameters that may vary among exoplanets, and identifies seafloor weathering as a key process that requires further study and constraint.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for the transition from thermal to non-thermal emission in the prompt emission of GRB 161117A</a><span class="id">[2512.24563]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRB 161117A is a long-duration GRB with three main overlapping peaks. By analyzing the time-resolved spectra of its data observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi mission, we find that the spectral evolution shows a transition from thermal (single BB) to hybrid (PL$+$BB), and finally to non-thermal (Band and CPL) emissions. Such a transition suggests that the jet composition of GRB 161117A should be changed from a fireball to a Poynting-flux-dominated jet. The bulk Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{\rm ph}$), radii ($R_{\rm ph}$ and $R_{0}$), magnetization factor at the central engine ($\sigma_0$), and dimensionless entropy ($\eta$) of the outflow can be inferred by invoking the observed quasi-thermal component within two models (e.g., pure fireball and hybrid). It is found that $\Gamma_{\rm ph}$ seems to be tracking with the light curve, and $R_{0}$ remains a constant at $\sim$ $10^{8}$ cm. The low magnetization ($1+\sigma_0 \sim$ 1) and high dimensionless entropy ($\eta \gg$ 1) during the first seven time-intervals suggest to be a pure fireball outflow. Moreover, we also estimate the lower limit of magnetization parameter at the photosphere radius ($\sigma_{\rm ph}\sim 1.4$ and 0.75) for late phase via the non-thermal spectra, and it indicates that the particle acceleration mechanism is dominated by internal shocks rather than magnetic dissipation processes. Finally, the $\nu \bar{\nu}$ annihilation mechanism of NDAF model to explain the thermal emission of GRB 161117A is also discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inferring Solar Magnetic fields From the Polarization of the Mg II h and k Lines</a><span class="id">[2512.24578]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The polarization of the Mg II h and k lines holds significant diagnostic potential for measuring chromospheric magnetic fields, which are crucial for understanding the physical processes governing the energy transport and dissipation in the solar upper atmosphere, as well as the subsequent heating of the chromosphere and corona.

At linear order, this framework predicts time- and scale-dependent bias parameters in a self-consistent manner, encompassing peak bias as a special case while clarifying how velocity bias and higher-derivative effects arise. Applying the resulting bias model to redshift-space distortions, we show that the Boltzmann-equation approach reproduces the power spectrum of biased tracers obtained in the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure up to $k^4$ terms with fewer independent parameters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24729" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The role of PSR J0614-3329 in defining the high-density matter at Neutron star cores</a><span class="id">[2512.24729]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we investigate how astrophysical observations from NICER and GW data constrain the matter properties at high densities, with a primary focus on the recent PSR J0614-3329 data. We have constructed three distinct classes of an ensemble of agnostic equation of state by speed of sound parametrisation. Bayesian inference is then employed to constrain the EoS construction parameters-namely, the squared speed of sound and chemical potential at each interpolation segment-using the observational data. Both the NICER and GW constraints hint towards a smoother EoS where PT occurs late, significantly reducing the maximum mass of NS. Also, the maximum-mass and maximum-compact sequences are distinctly different, as the former allows for the maximally stiff EoS to maximise the star mass. In contrast, the latter prefers a softer low-density and stiffer high-density EoS to maximise the compactness. The Bayesian analysis demonstrates that the observational bounds are effective in significantly constraining the low-density region of the equation of state. It is also seen that the astrophysical bound prefers the phase transition in the intermediate-density range and also prefers a small density jump for a discontinuous equation of state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24749" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coronal flux tube illuminated by strong shock spot: New Year's Eve solar eruption of 2023-Dec-31</a><span class="id">[2512.24749]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Powerful solar eruptions are known to produce fast and wide shock waves in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. The relationship between the coronal shock waves, solar energetic particles and different types of radio emission is a subject of long-lasting research activity. In this work, we perform a case study of 31 December 2023 eruption that occurred near eastern limb of the Sun. It produced a X5.0 class X-ray flare, a global EUV wave, a fast $\sim3000$ km/s Coronal Mass Ejection, strong radio emissions (including several type III and type II bursts), solar energetic particles in-situ, and long duration high-energy gamma-ray emission. We employ a technique that combines the reconstructed coronal shock from observations with background coronal MHD simulations to produce shock-mediated synthetic radio spectrum, assuming local emission at plasma frequency. We show that transient high Mach number and quasi-perpendicular coronal shock region explains both a “hot flux tube” precursor seen in EUV observations and reverse drifting radio spectral features observed by ground-based facilities. The occurrence of this evanescent strong shock patch was observed when it propagated across pseudo-streamer's cusp where the magnetic field was particularly low. We also find evidence that, at higher coronal altitudes, the low-frequency type II radio burst detected by several spacecraft, is triggered by the interaction of the shock with the heliospheric current sheet. This study provides additional evidence that high-$M_A$ regions of coronal shock surface are instrumental in energetic particle phenomenology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological dynamics and observational constraints of an interacting early scalar field coupled to radiation</a><span class="id">[2512.24918]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the cosmic evolution of an interacting scalar field radiation model, in which a minimally coupled scalar field exchanges energy with the radiation sector through an exponential coupling.

Analytical expressions for the background expansion are derived and characterized using kinematic diagnostics. We constrain the model using observational Hubble data, Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (including DESI DR2), and compressed cosmic microwave background distance information, performing a Bayesian MCMC analysis. The interaction parameter is found to be consistent with zero, though small deviations from standard radiation scaling are allowed. These deviations can partially alleviate the Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon, but this is accompanied by correlated shifts in the matter density. The reconstructed expansion history remains close to LCDM at late times.

Bursts were detected in both Band 4 (550 - 950 MHz) and Band 5 (1060 - 1460 MHz), with the last Band 5 burst occurring on 24 May, while Band 4 activity persisted until 28 May, indicating a frequency-dependent decline.

The waiting-time and energy distributions are bimodal, suggesting at least two distinct emission timescales and energy modes. Burst fluence ranges from 1.72 - 78.47 Jy ms, and the cumulative fluence distribution follows a broken power law.

This parameter is the product of four functions of physical characteristics: total mass, semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination angle. Using the previously estimated marginal probability densities of eccentricity and semimajor axis, and assuming an isotropic orientation of binary systems, the sample distribution of mass was adjusted using a concordance metric of the observed and synthetic distributions of orbital momenta and an ad hoc functional model. The best-fitting mass density model is found to faithfully reproduce the observed dependence of orbital momenta on apparent separation, although the absolute luminosity distributions indicate a tendency of the widest systems to more frequently include solar-type primaries. The anticipated manifestation of MOND is computed in the investigated parameter space \{separation, momentum\}. This effect is absent in the given data. The median total mass of the widest Gaia binaries is found to be somewhat higher than that of the tighter pairs, which is interpreted as a dynamical age effect.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25040" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards precision cosmology with Voids x CMB correlations (I): Roman-Agora mock catalogs and pipeline validation</a><span class="id">[2512.25040]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We construct and validate a set of multi-purpose mock galaxy catalogs designed to capture, to different degrees of accuracy, the main characteristics of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope survey. These catalogs provide a foundation for void statistics and various CMB cross-correlation analyses. Our approach differs from traditional halo occupation or abundance matching methods by directly translating a reference mock catalog – containing basic properties of the host halos – into a new simulation (in our case Agora). This technique, which we call analog matching, assigns a halo counterpart in the new simulation to each reference galaxy through a nearest-neighbor search in a multi-dimensional parameter space. This space can include halo mass, environmental measures and other galaxy-specific attributes. By varying the composition of this parameter vector, we can generate catalogs of differing complexity and conduct systematic tests to examine the influence of modelling choices on LSS statistics. We find that analog matching based on halo mass alone, or halo mass and galaxy-type indicators, successfully reproduces the expected Roman emission-line galaxy statistics. We also show that reproducing two-dimensional galaxy clustering does not guarantee consistent void properties. Our results highlight the importance of matching void statistics for improved mock accuracy, and demonstrate that measuring voids provides independent and sensitive constraints on galaxy-halo connections beyond the matter power spectrum. An important by-product of our setup is that it is fully general and can be applied to any combination of simulation and reference catalog, provided that the desired parameter space for both is specified. The resulting Roman-Agora mock catalogs offer a versatile resource for LSS x CMB studies and a benchmark for assessing the impact of mock accuracy on cosmological observables.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25064" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feeling Blue: Constructing a Robust SALT3 UV Template and Constraining its Redshift Dependency</a><span class="id">[2512.25064]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Upcoming cosmological surveys will obtain numerous rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), yet there is concern about how standardizable SNe Ia are in the UV. In this work, we train a robust optical–UV SED model for SNe Ia (SALT3-UV) with the open-source model-training software $\texttt{SALTshaker}$. We incorporate a spectroscopic UV data sample from HST, including 67 UV spectra from 18 nearby SNe Ia. Unlike previous training spectra, the HST spectra have sufficiently precise calibration that they do not require additional warping to match coincident photometric data. Additionally, while including this new SN Ia sample necessitates incorporating auxiliary photometric data from ZTF and ATLAS that have insufficient calibration for cosmological analyses, the improvements in the calibration of these data is anticipated in the near future. Compared to the previous SALT3-K21 model, the SALT3-UV model shows a significant improvement in the UV down to $2000\mathring{\text{A}}$, with over a threefold improvement in model uncertainty and a more physically accurate continuum and line features. We further evaluate potential redshift evolution in the UV template by separating the UV training sample into low- and high-$z$ subsamples. Our results reveal a non-negligible $\gtrsim 0.05$ mag difference between low- and high-$z$ SALT3-UV models in the $g-$band at $z\gtrsim0.5$ and the $u-$band at $z\gtrsim0.2$.

Due to the usual Kaluza-Klein mechanism, the resulting excitations carry properties of both particles and unparticles, so we dub this scenario “gapped unparticles&quot;. We derive a two-point function of the gapped unparticles by performing dimensional reduction. We then compute, in the collapsed limit, the four-point correlation function of conformally coupled scalars exchanging a gapped unparticle, which are used as seed functions to obtain the correlation function of primordial density perturbations. The phenomenology of the resulting correlators presents some novel features, such as oscillations with an envelope controlled by the anomalous dimension, rather than the usual value of 3/2. Depending on the value of the five-dimensional scaling dimension and effective mass of the gapped unparticles, we find a clear strategy to distinguish gapped unparticles from heavy massive scalars. If we assume the interactions are localized on a brane, gapped unparticles with different effective masses will share a universal coupling, and their exchanges produce an interesting interference pattern.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflationary QCD phase diagram</a><span class="id">[2512.24024]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Motivated by the cosmological collider program, which aims to probe high-energy physics through inflation, we investigate the phase diagram of multi-flavor QCD in de Sitter spacetime with a flavor-universal axial chemical potential induced by a rolling inflaton coupled to fermions.

We find that moderate positive anisotropy can increase the maximum supported mass up to approximately $2.4\;M_\odot$ and enhance stellar compactness by up to $20\%$ relative to isotropic configurations, while remaining broadly consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints. To probe the internal gravitational field, we compute curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor contraction, the Kretschmann scalar, and the Weyl scalar. We show that curvature measures directly tied to the matter distribution exhibit a strong sensitivity to anisotropy, whereas the Weyl curvature remains comparatively insensitive, reflecting its role as a measure of the free gravitational field. Within the phenomenological BL framework, the maximum compactness increases with anisotropy and reaches values as high as $\mathcal{C}_{\max}\approx 0.25$-$0.38$ for $\lambda_{\rm BL}\in[-4,+4]$, although the physical realizability of such highly compact configurations depends sensitively on the underlying anisotropy mechanism.

The puzzle of how positrons and anti-protons can be well represented at all energies, is explained, initially, by the low energy capture of particles of either sign by the sun's magnetic dipole field. Later, as the magnetic field bending has become negligible compared to the gravitational bending, both positive and negative beams will have survived the gradual transition from predominantly magnetic to predominantly gravitational bending. Later, anti-particles produced in QED beam-beam collisions of sufficiently high energy, are also accelerated. The high quality of cosmic ray data collected over recent decades, at steadily increasing energies, especially by the International Space Station (ISS), make the study of cosmic ray production mechanisms both timely and essential. The paper describes how longitudinal electric fields, explained by the Parker solar wind theory can enable the sun to serve as a “booster” accelerator of cosmic rays, increasing the maximum cosmic ray energies enough to produce the observed 13 orders of magnitude maximum particle energy and the energy flux needed to maintain the observed cosmic ray atmosphere equilibrium within the solar system. A steady state mechanism is described, based on semi-quantitative discussion of a relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, according to which the highest energy cosmic rays observed can have been produced by the Parker longitudinal electric field component, during fractionally brief, but periodic, circular or semi-circular turns centered on the sun.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24481" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Memories of Prof. George Lazarides</a><span class="id">[2512.24481]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I present some memories of my Ph.D supervisor and, later, collaborator but always encouraging supporter Prof. G.

Motivated by the increasing precision of cosmic microwave background and large-scale-structure observations, we examine whether Higgs-like inflation remains compatible with current data in this extended gravitational setting. Working within the slow-roll approximation, we analyze the inflationary dynamics both analytically and numerically. In the dominant-coupling regime we derive closed-form expressions for the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio as functions of the number of e-folds, and we subsequently relax this assumption by numerically solving the slow-roll equations. Confrontation with the latest constraints from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR1, and BICEP/Keck shows that Higgs-like inflation in $f(T,\phi)$ gravity is fully consistent with current bounds, naturally accommodating the preferred shift in the scalar spectral index and leading to distinctive tensor-sector signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar modeling within regularized 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in light of current astrophysical constraints</a><span class="id">[2512.24554]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study we obtain interior solutions and investigate structural properties of isotropic compact stars in the framework of four-dimensional regularized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity. For stellar matter content, we adopt a widely used quark-matter model that approximates a realistic equation of state (EoS). By numerically integrating the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we obtain interior solutions for static, spherically symmetric fluid spheres. The resulting sequences are compared directly with the predictions of General Relativity (GR). Our analysis focuses on three diagnostic indicators: (i) the mass-radius profiles under GR and three representative choices of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling; (ii) the stellar compactness factor, $C \equiv M/R$; and (iii) the relation between stellar mass and central energy density. Recent observational studies suggest that the maximum masses inferred from the mass-radius relation may be larger than previously expected. To address this, we include a comparative set of constraints from multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational-wave event GW190814, as well as X-ray measurements from NICER for PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451. These data provide stringent, astrophysically grounded tests of the viability of the models discussed here. Our results indicate that compact stars within 4DEGB gravity are systematically less compact and achieve moderately higher maximum masses compared to the GR case. This trend is consistent with recent theoretical analyses of compact stars in higher-curvature gravity theories and with constraints from multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these findings suggest that regularized Gauss-Bonnet corrections constitute a plausible extension of GR in the strong-field regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aspects of Sommerfeld Enhancement in the light of Halo gamma-ray excess</a><span class="id">[2512.24662]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine Sommerfeld enhancement in dark matter annihilation as a potential origin of the halo-like gamma-ray excess near $E_\gamma \simeq 20$ GeV reported by Totani.

This difference has an impact on dynamical tide, which is the lowest-order effect we know of that can distinguish quark stars and neutron stars from the gravitational wave during the inspiral phase.

Theoretical waveform predictions, however, remain uncertain, motivating robust searches that avoid specific echo modeling. We present a model-independent search framework targeting long-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs) expected from strong interior reflection. By employing a generalized phase-marginalized likelihood that coherently combines data for each QNM across a detector network, our method enhances sensitivity to the signals. To handle real detector noise, we implement an optimized notching procedure to suppress instrumental spectral lines and refine the Bayesian parameter settings. We validate the performance of this framework using injection studies on O1 background data, demonstrating reliable signal recovery in realistic noise conditions. We then apply this method to three binary black hole merger events with high ringdown signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) from observing runs O1 to O4: GW150914, GW231226, and the recently detected GW250114. No statistically significant evidence for postmerger echoes is found. Consequently, we derive 90% upper limits on the network SNR and the average amplitude of the long-lived QNMs, setting the first model-independent constraints on late-time echo signatures from LVK data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loop-Level Lepton Flavor Violation and Diphoton Signals in the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model</a><span class="id">[2512.25019]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The left-right symmetric model (LRSM) could not only restore parity of the weak interaction, but also provide natural explanations of the tiny active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanisms.

If $H_3$ is light, say below the GeV scale, it will lead to rich signals, e.g. the LFV muon and tauon decays $\ell_\beta \to \ell_\alpha + X$ ($X$ being either visible or invisible final states) and the anomalous supernova signatures. Combined with the diphoton coupling of $H_3$, the right-handed scale $v_R$ is excluded up to $2\times10^9$ GeV.

In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\,M_\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\rm PBH}\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints. The resulting sharp features in the scalar power spectrum also imply potentially observable scalar-induced gravitational-wave signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effect of Magnetised Discontinuity on Diffusive Shock Acceleration</a><span class="id">[2401.08969]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of magnetic fields and diffusion mechanisms on the energy spectra of particles accelerated via diffusive shock acceleration. We analyse magnetised shock jump conditions and demonstrate how magnetisation and angular dependence modify upstream and downstream velocities, which enter the transport equation within a Monte Carlo simulation framework. We consider constant, momentum-dependent, and pitch-angle-dependent diffusion coefficients to assess their influence on particle acceleration. Our results show that magnetic fields enhance particle confinement and facilitate more efficient energy gain. In the absence of magnetisation, particle spectra tend to be steeper due to rapid escape and weaker scattering effects, whereas magnetised shocks systematically produce flatter spectra across all diffusion models. Among them, pitch-angle-dependent diffusion leads to the strongest spectral flattening, underscoring its role in sustaining extended acceleration. It is also seen that an increased upstream pressure, associated with enhanced magnetic turbulence, broadens the spectral range by improving particle scattering efficiency and enabling multiple shock crossings. As the shock inclination angle increases, the velocity contrast between upstream and downstream regions diminishes, modulating the spatial extent of the acceleration zone. Notably, pitch-angle-dependent diffusion remains robust under varying shock conditions, ensuring sustained acceleration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observation of the $γ$-ray Emission from W43 with LHAASO</a><span class="id">[2408.09905]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we report the detection of the very-high-energy (VHE, $ 100{\rm\ GeV} &lt; E &lt; 100{\rm\ TeV} $) and ultra-high-energy (UHE, $E &gt; 100\rm\ TeV$) $\gamma$-ray emissions from the direction of the young star-forming region W43, observed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observation (LHAASO).

This provides a rare opportunity to spatially resolve the component of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and supernova remnant (SNR) at UHE. This paper conducted a dedicated data analysis of 1LHAASO J0007+7303u using the data collected from December 2019 to July 2023. This source is well detected with significances of 21$\sigma$ and 17$\sigma$ at 8$-$100 TeV and $&gt;$100 TeV, respectively. The corresponding extensions are determined to be 0.23$^{\circ}\pm$0.03$^{\circ}$ and 0.17$^{\circ}\pm$0.03$^{\circ}$. The emission is proposed to originate from the relativistic electrons and positrons accelerated within the PWN of PSR J0007+7303. The energy spectrum is well described by a power-law with an exponential cutoff function $dN/dE = (42.4\pm4.1)(\frac{E}{20\rm\ TeV})^{-2.31\pm0.11}\exp(-\frac{E}{110\pm25\rm\ TeV})$ $\rm\ TeV^{-1}\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}$in the energy range from 8 TeV to 300 TeV, implying a steady-state parent electron spectrum $dN_e/dE_e\propto (\frac{E_e}{100\rm\ TeV})^{-3.13\pm0.16}\exp[(\frac{-E_e}{373\pm70\rm\ TeV})^2]$ at energies above $\approx 50 \rm\ TeV$. The cutoff energy of the electron spectrum is roughly equal to the expected current maximum energy of particles accelerated at the PWN terminal shock. Combining the X-ray and gamma-ray emission, the current space-averaged magnetic field can be limited to $\approx 4.5\rm\ \mu G$. To satisfy the multi-wavelength spectrum and the $\gamma$-ray extensions, the transport of relativistic particles within the PWN is likely dominated by the advection process under the free-expansion phase assumption.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultrahigh-Energy Gamma-ray Emission Associated with Black Hole-Jet Systems</a><span class="id">[2410.08988]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Black holes (BH), one of the most intriguing objects in the universe, can manifest themselves through electromagnetic radiation initiated by the accretion flow.

Non-thermal emission from the radio to tera-electronvolt (TeV) gamma-ray band has been observed from microquasars, indicating the acceleration of relativistic particles. Here we report detection of four microquasars (SS 433, V4641 Sgr, GRS 1915+105, MAXI J1820+070) of spectrum extending to the ultrahigh-energy (UHE; photon energy $E&gt;100$ TeV) band and one microquasar (Cygnus X-1) of spectrum approaching 100 TeV, using the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Notably, the total emission associated with SS 433 cannot be interpreted with a single leptonic component. In the UHE band, its emission is in spatial coincidence with a giant atomic cloud, which is consistent with a hadronic origin. An elongated source is discovered from V4641 Sgr with the spectrum continuing up to 800 TeV. The detection of UHE gamma rays demonstrates that accreting BHs and their environments can operate as extremely efficient accelerators of particles out of 1 peta-electronvolt (PeV), suggesting microquasars to be important contributors to Galactic cosmic rays especially around the `knee' region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unraveling the Nature of HAWC J1844-034 with Fermi-LAT Data Analysis and Multi-wavelength Modeling</a><span class="id">[2501.12065]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The extended ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray source HAWC J1844-034 is closely associated with two other sources, HAWC J1843-032 and HWC J1846-025.

In standard cosmological analyses, DM is typically modeled as pressureless dust with $w_{\rm DM} = 0$, an assumption that aligns with large-scale structure formation, supports the empirical success of the $\Lambda$CDM model, and simplifies cosmological modeling. However, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a non-zero $w_{\rm DM}$ from the cosmological framework. In this work, we explore this possibility through non-parametric and parametric reconstructions based on Gaussian Process Regression. The reconstructions use Hubble parameter measurements from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR1 and DR2. Our findings suggest that a dynamical EoS for DM, although only mildly supported statistically, cannot be conclusively ruled out.

In this work, we analyze in detail the effects of PBHs evaporating before BBN, with various intermediate steps understood analytically, and obtain the BBN constraint on PBHs within a transparent and reproducible framework. We find that, to produce observable effects on BBN, the PBH mass must exceed $10^{9}$ g, a threshold higher than that reported in some earlier studies. Slightly above $10^{9}$ g, the BBN sensitivity rapidly increases with the mass and then decreases, with the turning point occurring at $2\times10^{9}$ g. For PBHs in the mass range $[10^{9},\ 10^{10}]$ g, current measurements of BBN observables set an upper bound on the initial mass fraction parameter $\beta$ ranging from $10^{-17}$ to $10^{-19}$.

We present the first blazar-boosted dark-matter search that incorporates full detector-response modeling, using public data from XENON1T and LZ for the blazar TXS 0506+056.

We have shown that the spectral and temporal features of the TeV gamma-ray spectrum of M87 are consistent with this two-zone model, where the contribution from the sub-parsec scale jet significantly increases during the flare state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Architectures of S-type Transiting Planets in Binaries II: A Dichotomy in Orbital Alignment of Small Planets in Close Binary Systems</a><span class="id">[2509.25332]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar multiplicity plays a crucial role in shaping planet formation and dynamical evolution. We present a survey of 54 TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) within 300 pc that exhibit significant Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric accelerations. We identified 35 TOIs with stellar companions at projected separations between $0.1^{\prime\prime}$ to $2^{\prime\prime}$ (or $10-200$ AU). We also identified 12 TOIs that could host planetary-mass or brown dwarf companions, including 6 that are newly discovered. Furthermore, we perform three-dimensional orbital characterization for 12 binaries hosting confirmed planets or planet candidates, allowing us to constrain the line-of-sight mutual inclination, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$, between the planetary and binary orbits. Combining our sample with previous measurements, we apply Bayesian hierarchical analysis to a total of 26 binary systems with S-type transiting planets ($r_p&lt;5R_{\oplus}$). Specifically, we fit the $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$ distribution with both single (Rayleigh) and mixture models (two-component Rayleigh and Rayleigh-isotropic mixture). We find the mixture models are strongly favored ($\log Z\gtrsim13.9$, or $\approx$5$\sigma$), indicating the observed planet-binary $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$ values likely originate from two underlying populations: one nearly aligned ($\sigma_1 = 2^{\circ}.4^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$) and one with more scattered mutual inclinations ($\sigma_2 = 23^{\circ}.6^{+8.8}_{-7.1}$). Alternatively, the misaligned systems can be equally well described by an isotropic distribution of inclinations. This observed dichotomy likely reflects different dynamical histories. Notably, the misaligned population only emerges in systems with stellar periastron distances $&gt;40$ AU while systems with close-in or eccentric stellar companions (periastron distances $&lt;40$ AU) preserve planet-binary alignment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effects of Coronal Mass Ejection on PSR J1022+1001 and Possible Mode Change of PSR J2145-0750 in the InPTA DR2</a><span class="id">[2510.26594]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) has recently published its second data release (DR2), comprising the timing analysis of seven years of data on 27 millisecond pulsars (MSPs), observed simultaneously in the 300-500 MHz (band 3) and 1260-1460 MHz (band 5), using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). The low-frequency data, particularly in band 3, is highly sensitive to propagation effects such as dispersion measure (DM) fluctuations, which can be imprints of some astrophysical phenomena (scientific outliers). Here, we analyze the two outliers of possible astrophysical origin coming from the band 3 DM time series of two pulsars: PSR J1022+1001, with an ecliptic latitude of -0.06 degree, and PSR J2145-0750, one of the brightest MSPs, with multi-component profile morphology. Our study reveals compelling evidence for a coronal mass ejection (CME) event traced in the data of PSR J1022+1001, and reports evidence for a potential mode-changing event in PSR J2145-0750. By contrasting these two cases, we show that DM fluctuations due to CME interacions and intrinsic mode-changing events produce distinct observational signatures, enabling a physically informed classification of scientific outliers in PTA datasets. Extending the analyses presented here to the full sample of InPTA-DR2 pulsars is expected to reveal additional CME events, and possible mode-changing events. Such detections will not only improve our understanding of solar and pulsar magnetospheric plasma interactions but will also enable more accurate modelling of DM variations, leading to improved pulsar timing solutions, which are crucial for high-precision Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) science.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An alternative theory of magnetic flux tubes in strong fields via axion origin photons</a><span class="id">[2511.04346]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In our alternative theory, built around the coincidence of experimental and theoretical data, three &quot;free&quot; parameters – the magnetic field in the tachocline of the order of  10^7 G (see Fig.(A.1) and Eq.(A17) in V.

By uncovering the associated multimessenger signals, we investigate the origin of the 220 PeV $\nu_\mu$ event KM3-230213A from an unknown transient that accelerated cosmic rays to $\sim 10$ EeV. Unlike an astrophysical origin, where the $\nu_\mu$ is produced inside the source, here we consider UHECR protons that escape the source interact with the cosmic background radiation, producing a PeV-EeV cosmogenic neutrino spectrum. The secondary $e^\pm$ and $\gamma$-rays initiate an electromagnetic cascade, resulting in a cosmogenic $\gamma$-ray spectrum. The latter peaks at a delayed time of $\gtrsim 10^4$ years compared to the light travel time from the transient to observer, due to deflection of charged particles in the extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF). Our results shed light on the nature of the UHECR source for the $\nu_\mu$ event and provide crucial insights into the detection of multi-TeV $\gamma$-rays of cosmogenic origin from similar past cosmological transients. Using the $\gamma$-ray sensitivity of currently operating and next-generation imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, the flux and time-delay distribution can constrain the source distance. We further show that the detection of such a $\gamma$-ray signal above the background depends on the EGMF strength. Together with the non-detection of coincident spatial or temporal photon counterparts at the current epoch, this detection is the first compelling candidate for a sub-EeV cosmogenic neutrino.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Properties of GRB Accreting Magnetar with $R/I$ Evolutionary Effects Using \emph{Swift}/XRT Data</a><span class="id">[2511.22149]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A newly born millisecond magnetar has been proposed as one possible central engine of some long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with X-ray plateau. In this work, we used a universal correlation between initial spin period ($P_0$) and surface magnetic field ($B_p$) of newborn magnetar based on an LGRB sample in \cite{Lan2025} to explore the propeller properties of accreting magnetars with $R/I$ evolutionary effects. We found that $B_p-P_0$ relation is approximately consistent with $B_p\propto P_{\rm eq}^{7/6}$. Here $P_{\rm eq}$ is equilibrium spin period in magnetic propeller model. The $B_p-P_0$ relation indicates that $P_0$ may not be true initial spin period of newborn magnetar but had reached an equilibrium spin period via fallback accretion in propeller model. The magnetar accretion rate in our LGRBs is in range of $\dot{M}\sim10^{-5}-10^{-2} M_{\odot} \rm s^{-1}$ by incorporating $R/I$ evolutionary effects and using the transition relation between gravitational mass $M_g$ and baryonic mass $M_b$ in different equations of state. Such accretion rates ensure that the accreting magnetars in our sample survive until reaching the equilibrium spin period, and the accretion rate is one order of magnitude lower compared to the statistical results in \cite{Stratta2018} and \cite{Linweili2020}, which used constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario. We suggested that adopting a constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario for modeling propeller regime in accreting magnetar results in a higher mass accretion rate, which may impair our understanding of the physical nature and its surroundings of accreting magnetar, and low-metallicity progenitors can provide enough material to satisfy the accretion requirements of newborn accreting magnetar in LGRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Polarized X-ray Universe: Insights and Discoveries</a><span class="id">[2512.11488]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polarization is one of the fundamental natures of electromagnetic radiation. The detection of polarization or polarized photons from distant X-ray radiating systems (such as X-ray binaries (XBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), pulsars, and stars) complements the timing, spectral, and imagining analysis to better understand the physical mechanisms taking place in these sources. Polarization has enhanced the understanding of the internal geometry of these systems and their vicinity. Polarized X-rays can be generated either directly through non-thermal physical processes in the presence of a magnetic field(B) or through the scattering of unpolarized thermal radiation within plasma structures such as an accretion disk. X-ray polarization can measure the two important independent parameters, the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) of the X-ray photons. These parameters are crucial as they reveal the characteristics of particles in such a strong magnetic and gravitational field.

The post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars remains poorly understood, particularly for blue supergiants. These objects play a crucial role in the dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxies and exhibit pronounced photometric and spectroscopic variability, often quasi-periodic rather than strictly periodic. Aims. We investigate the variability of the evolved B-type star rho Leo to determine its physical properties, identify the underlying mechanisms driving its variability, and constrain its evolutionary stage. Methods. We analyse long-term spectroscopic and photometric datasets obtained from multiple sources, including the TESS and Kepler space missions and observations with the 1.5 m telescope in Estonia. Period analysis is performed using the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, Lomb-Scargle pre-whitening, and the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform. Fundamental stellar parameters are derived by fitting synthetic line profiles computed with the FastWind code to the HARPS spectrum, while the stellar rotation inclination is estimated using the ZPEKTR code. Results. The He I 6678.151 A line shows significant radial-velocity and line-profile moment variations. We detect a set of periods and harmonics spanning approximately 0.8 to 35 days. Some periods remain stable over time, whereas others vary between observing seasons. A comparison of spectroscopic and photometric variability, together with phase-curve morphology, allows us to constrain the origin of several signals. In particular, the approximately 11 day period is attributed to stellar rotation, while the approximately 17 day period is linked to radial pulsations. Conclusions. Although the variability is quasi-periodic, most detected periods persist across multiple seasons. The wide range of timescales suggests that rho Leo is likely evolving along a blue loop following the red supergiant phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decoupling perturbations from background in $f(Q)$ gravity: the square-root correction and the alleviation of the $σ_8$ tension</a><span class="id">[2512.16551]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a perturbation-level modification of symmetric teleparallel gravity of the form $f(Q)=F(Q)+M\sqrt{Q}$ and assess its ability to ease the $\sigma_8$ tension.

Here, we present results from a long-term monitoring campaign of FRB 20220912A using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in the frequency range from 300 to 750 MHz. Over the course of nearly two years, we detected a total of 643 bursts in this frequency range. The source exhibited extreme activity for a few months after its discovery and sustained its active phase for over 500 days, with unsystematic modulations in the activity during this phase. The cumulative energy distributions in both bands show a break, consistent with other active repeaters like FRB 20121102A, FRB 202011124A, etc., suggesting common underlying emission mechanisms. Moreover, we show that the energy distribution shape for FRB 20220912A remains broadly same across a large range of frequencies and over time. Overall, the extended high activity, estimated total energy output, persistent power-law tails in the energy distributions, and the lack of detectable short timescale periodicity favor progenitor models invoking young dynamic magnetars, potentially emitting pulses across large rotation phase ranges.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16091" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baryogenesis via the Chiral Magnetic Effect in a First-Order Electroweak Phase Transition</a><span class="id">[2409.16091]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we investigate the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe during the first-order electroweak phase transition.

The subsequent decay of these RHNs into Standard Model particles not only drives the transition to a radiation-dominated era but also generates the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. In this typical reheating scenario, gravitational waves (GWs) can be produced during inflaton decay, both through bremsstrahlung and inflaton scattering processes. While GW production via bremsstrahlung dominates near the end of the reheating phase, inflaton scattering leads to a non-negligible GW contribution near the maximum temperature of the Universe. The combined GW spectrum from both decay and scattering processes lies within the sensitivity range of proposed resonant cavity experiments. This framework thus offers a compelling and unified approach to addressing neutrino mass generation, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis, and probing the dynamics of a non-instantaneous reheating era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electromagnetic helicity flux density for radiative systems</a><span class="id">[2507.14966]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that the helicity flux density is distinguished from magnetic helicity by analysing Hopf solitons.

These binaries emit bursts of gravitational radiation during each pericenter passage. In isolated systems, the intrinsic timing of these bursts is solely determined by the properties of the binary. The presence of a nearby third body perturbs the system and alters the burst timing. Accurately modeling such perturbations therefore offers a novel approach to detecting the presence of a nearby companion. Existing timing models account for Newtonian dynamics and leading-order radiation reaction effects but neglect the higher order post-Newtonian (PN) contributions to the inner binary. In this paper, we present an improved timing model that incorporates conservative PN corrections that lead to the precession of the binary's pericenter. We find that these PN corrections significantly impact the binary's orbital evolution and the timing of the GW burst. In particular, 1PN precession gives rise to distinctive modulation features in the binary's semilatus rectum and eccentricity. These modulations encode valuable information about the presence and properties of the third body, including its mass and distance. Furthermore, unmodeled 1PN effects significantly bias the tertiary's mass and distance. Finally we assess the detectability of GW bursts from such perturbed systems and demonstrate that the inclusion of PN corrections is crucial for accurately capturing the orbital dynamics of hierarchical triples.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02083" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Updating GUT-Scale Pole Higgs Inflation After ACT DR6</a><span class="id">[2510.02083]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider models of chaotic inflation driven by the real parts of a conjugate pair of Higgs superfields involved in the spontaneous breaking of a grand unification symmetry at a scale assuming its value within MSSM.

Yet, because the compactness depends sensitively on the unknown equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter, the simple question: “how compact can a neutron star be?” remains unanswered. To address this question, we adopt a statistical approach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all known constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given EOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of the sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture for a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking. However, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that it is true in general. Exploiting the conjecture, we can concentrate on the compactness of the maximum-mass stars and show that an upper limit appears for the maximum compactness and is given by $\mathcal{C}_{\rm max} = 1/3$. Importantly, this upper limit is essentially independent of the stellar mass and a direct consequence of perturbative-QCD constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Matter Capture in a Core-Collapse Supernova Revives Dark Photons</a><span class="id">[2511.11219]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Core-collapse supernovae serve as powerful probes of light, weakly coupled particles, such as dark photons. The conventional SN1987A cooling bound constrains the dark photon mass-mixing parameter space by requiring that the luminosity from the proto-neutron star core not exceed the observed neutrino emission. In this work, we revisit these limits by including the effect of dark matter (DM) captured inside the progenitor star before collapse. The trapped DM acts as an additional scattering target for dark photons, modifying their free-streaming length and, consequently, the supernova cooling rate. We perform a self-consistent analysis for both annihilating and asymmetric DM scenarios, incorporating light-mediator effects in the capture rate calculation. For annihilating DM, the equilibrium density remains too small to affect the bounds significantly. In contrast, asymmetric DM can accumulate to large densities, leading to the formation of a &quot;dark photosphere&quot; that suppresses the dark-photon luminosity and reopens previously excluded regions of parameter space. Our results emphasise the importance of accounting for astrophysical DM populations when deriving stellar-cooling constraints on dark sectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Net Charge Accretion in Magnetized Kerr Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2511.22356]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the charging process of a rotating Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$ immersed in a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically uniform magnetic field of strength $B_{0}$. In Wald's classic analysis (Wald 1974), which was based on the assumption of vanishing injection energy, the black hole was predicted to acquire a universal &quot;saturation charge&quot; $Q_{\mathrm{w}}=2B_{0}J$. However, the physical mechanism that sets the saturation charge must ultimately be governed by the competition between the absorption rates of positively and negatively charged particles. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the problem in the framework of a simple accretion model, where two dilute, equivalent fluxes of charged particles of opposite signs are injected from infinity along the magnetic field lines. The problem then reduces to that of individual particle motion in the electromagnetic field of the magnetized Kerr black hole. Using a combination of numerical and analytical tools, we determine the domains of absorption and establish both lower and upper bounds on the corresponding absorption cross sections. At $Q=Q_\mathrm{w}$ these bounds reveal a systematic difference between the two charge signs. In particular, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the lower bound on the absorption cross section for the &quot;attracted&quot; charge exceeds the upper bound for the &quot;repelled&quot; one. This charge accretion imbalance (which we find to become extreme at the limit of large $B_{0}$) indicates a persistent net charge accretion at $Q=Q_{\mathrm{w}}$, implying that the actual saturation charge must differ from Wald's charge $Q_{\mathrm{w}}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09845" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relativistic accretion process onto rotating black holes in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamic gravity</a><span class="id">[2512.09845]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we uncover the accretion dynamics and oscillatory behavior around rotating black holes within the EEH nonlinear electrodynamic framework by analyzing both the motion of test particles and numerically solving the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations. Using EEH geometry, we compute the structure of circular motion, the effective potential and force, and we evaluate the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies together with the Lense-Thirring and periastron precession rates. Our calculations show that, compared to the Kerr model, the charge parameter $Q$ and the spin parameter $a$ significantly modify the strong gravitational field and shift the characteristic frequencies. We then model the dynamical structure formed by matter accreting toward the EEH black hole through the BHL mechanism, finding that the parameter $Q$ increases the amount of infalling matter and strengthens shock-cone instabilities near the horizon, while farther from the black hole it suppresses accretion and reduces turbulence. Time-series analysis of the accretion rate reveals robust QPOs, whose low-frequency components arise from the precession of the shock cone, while high-frequency components appear as a consequence of strong-field instabilities modified by $Q$ and $a$. A systematic parameter-space exploration identifies the regions where EEH corrections maximize QPO activity, indicating that nonlinear electrodynamics can leave observable imprints on accretion flows and may be testable with QPO and horizon-scale observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09971" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can the 3 neutrino masses really be found using SN 1987A data?</a><span class="id">[2512.09971]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutrino masses remain a significant unsolved problem in physics and their nonzero value proves the Standard Model is incomplete. Currently, the values of the three masses only have upper limits from cosmology and experiments like KATRIN. This paper shows that the SN 1987A neutrino data can remarkably yield values for the three neutrino masses, and not merely upper limits. Although this seemingly preposterous idea was suggested a dozen years ago by the author, here it is demonstrated in a much more convincing manner with many new elements, including a stronger statistical treatment, and a thorough explanation of why the method used to find the three masses from supernova SN 1987A neutrino data really works. The key to finding the three neutrino masses is realizing why three normally accepted assumptions are unjustified, The three rejected assumptions are:(a) the 5-hr early LSD (Mont Blanc) neutrinos are unrelated to SN 1987A, (b) any neutrino masses $m_k&gt;1 eV/c^2$ cannot be reconciled with upper limits on the “effective mass&quot; from KATRIN and other data, and (c) the spread in neutrino emission times from SN 1987A data is too great for the method to work. A particularly crucial piece of evidence supporting the claim made in the paper's title involves a recent negative KATRIN result finding an absence of sterile neutrinos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A mini-review on combinatorial solutions to the Marcus-Lushnikov irreversible aggregation</a><span class="id">[2512.11459]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</p></div></details></article></body>
