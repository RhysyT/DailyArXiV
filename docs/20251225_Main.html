Space weather and its potential negative consequences for life on Earth has received increasing attention in recent decades. Particularly predicting CME onset has become important from a security perspective. To predict CMEs, one must first understand the dynamics leading to pre-eruptive magnetic field configurations such as flux ropes. Aims. In this study, we investigate the realistic formation of coronal flux ropes above the solar photosphere. The aim is to find if and how flux ropes can form there, and how the formation is related to flux cancellation at the photosphere. Methods. We run a convective non-symmetric 3D radiative MHD simulation with the code Bifrost. A linear force-free field with sheared coronal arcades is slowly inserted in the 24Mmx24Mmx30Mm simulation box. After this, the self-consistent stochastic plasma flows of the convection zone drive several small-scale flux cancellations and magnetic reconnection, without external influence. Lagrangian markers called corks are used to track the dynamic evolution of the magnetic field. Results. Over a period of 2.5 h, a flux rope is generated with photospheric footpoints separated by up to 12Mm. The flux rope forms gradually through several individual events, such as slipping reconnection, U-loop emergence, and thick-photosphere tether-cutting reconnection. Conclusions. Flux ropes can be formed in the solar atmosphere solely driven by convection and flux cancellations at the photosphere. However, not all flux cancellations contribute to the build-up of the flux rope, and some coronal reconnection events that do are not clearly related to flux cancellation. The formation process of flux ropes from coronal sheared arcades driven by convection is therefore more complex than in the original smooth flux cancellation model. But the end result is qualitatively the same. Flux cancellation works. A flux rope is formed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Physics Informed Neural Network For Deriving MHD State Vectors From Global Active Regions Observations</a><span class="id">[2512.20747]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar active regions (ARs) do not appear randomly but cluster along longitudinally warped toroidal bands ('toroids') that encode information about magnetic structures in the tachocline, where global-scale organization likely originates. Global MagnetoHydroDynamic Shallow-Water Tachocline (MHD-SWT) models have shown potential to simulate such toroids, matching observations qualitatively. For week-scale early prediction of flare-producing AR emergence, forward-integration of these toroids is necessary. This requires model initialization with a dynamically self-consistent MHD state-vector that includes magnetic, flow fields, and shell-thickness variations. However, synoptic magnetograms provide only geometric shape of toroids, not the state-vector needed to initialize MHD-SWT models. To address this challenging task, we develop PINNBARDS, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-Based AR Distribution Simulator, that uses observational toroids and MHD-SWT equations to derive initial state-vector. Using Feb-14-2024 SDO/HMI synoptic map, we show that PINN converges to physically consistent, predominantly antisymmetric toroids, matching observed ones. Although surface data provides north and south toroids' central latitudes, and their latitudinal widths, they cannot determine tachocline field strengths, connected to AR emergence. We explore here solutions across a broad parameter range, finding hydrodynamically-dominated structures for weak fields ( 2 kG) and overly rigid behavior for strong fields ( 100 kG). We obtain best agreement with observations for 20-30 kG toroidal fields, and  10 degree bandwidth, consistent with low-order longitudinal mode excitation. To our knowledge, PINNBARDS serves as the first method for reconstructing state-vectors for hidden tachocline magnetic structures from surface patterns; potentially leading to weeks ahead prediction of flare-producing AR-emergence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simultaneous JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA Monitoring of Sgr A*: A Unified Picture of the Variable IR, X-ray and Radio Emission</a><span class="id">[2512.20786]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Flux variability is a fundamental channel of information from Sgr A* because of its direct probe of processes occurring within an accretion disk under strong gravity. We present simultaneous IR, X-ray and radio observations of Sgr A* on 2024 Apr 05 using JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA. We report the detection of a strong X-ray flare with a luminosity of $\sim5.2x10^{35}$ erg/s coincident with a bright near-IR flare, and a brightening in radio about an hour later. We investigate the candidate physical mechanisms for the X-ray flare emission and conclude that this can best be explained by inverse Compton scattering of near-IR flare radiation. We propose a dynamic scenario analogous to a coronal mass ejection in which a magnetic flux rope is ejected from Sgr A*'s inner accretion flow with a current sheet extending down from the rope to the bulk of the accretion flow. Reconnection within the sheet produces oppositely directed flows of accelerated particles moving upwards towards the rope and downwards towards the accretion flow. Infrared radiation from the approaching energetic electrons is enhanced by beaming and up-scattered by thermal electrons in the accretion flow to produce the strong X-ray flare. Meanwhile, the relativistic electrons moving in the opposite direction away from the disk experience weaker magnetic fields so radiate at longer wavelengths by feeding into the magnetic flux tube and adiabatically cooled during its subsequent expansion. This physical picture attempts to unify the origin of the variable emission from Sgr A* at IR, X-ray and radio/submm wavelengths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thawing Quintessence: Priors, evidence, and likely trajectories</a><span class="id">[2512.20832]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform a Bayesian comparison between thawing quintessence and a cosmological constant, incorporating theoretically motivated priors on the phenomenological Padé-w parameters used to model thawing dynamics. We find that thawing quintessence is consistently preferred over a cosmological constant when combining BAO data from DESI DR2 and CMB data from Planck+ACT with any of the major supernova compilations, including the recently updated DES-Dovekie sample. This preference is not sensitive to our choice of prior, but it is contingent on the inclusion of supernovae in the analysis. We comment on the consistency between various information criteria and Bayesian evidence ratios, finding that the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) tracks the Bayesian evidence more reliably than either the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Finally, we use observational likelihoods to identify which thawing trajectories are compatible with the available data, independently of theoretical priors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20834" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the Mass Step: Environmental Dependence of Type Ia Supernovae in Low-Metallicity Host Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2512.20834]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Despite the tremendous impact of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) on the field of cosmology, their underlying physics are still poorly understood. Studies have found an intriguing correlation between standardized Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities and host galaxy masses, commonly referred to as the &quot;mass step&quot;. SNe Ia in massive galaxies appear systematically brighter than in lower-mass, star-forming hosts after standardization. However, previous analyses use host galaxy mass estimates derived largely from optical data alone and assume parametric forms for host star formation histories (SFHs), both of which are known to misestimate galaxy stellar masses. In this work, we re-examine the mass-step relation with a sample of SN Ia host galaxies complete in broadband optical (3000 Angstrom to 1 micron) and near-infrared (up to 1.8 micron) data, and in some cases including mid-infrared observations (up to 4.5 micron), using Prospector to derive nonparametric SFHs. We find that while the masses for these galaxies have indeed been underestimated, the overall trend in SN Ia luminosity versus host mass remains largely unchanged. We also uncover an environmental metallicity-dependent trend, in which low-metallicity galaxies (Z &lt; -1 Zsol) may drive much of the observed SN Ia luminosity-mass correlation, suggesting that the chemical composition of the SN environment plays a central role in shaping the standardized brightness of SNe Ia.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20867" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal relations between the quasinormal modes of neutron stars and magnetic tidal deformability</a><span class="id">[2512.20867]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal deformabilities are one of the observable quantities characterizing neutron stars, which are strongly associated with the stellar compactness, the ratio of the stellar mass to the radius. In addition to the tidal deformability, the quasinormal modes excited in a neutron star are also an important property for extracting information about the neutron star interior, adopting gravitational wave asteroseismology. In this study, we especially focus on the magnetic tidal deformability, which acts on the gravitational waveform from a neutron star binary merger as a higher-order effect than the electric tidal deformability, and derive the universal relations expressing the quasinormal modes, such as the fundamental ($f$-), 1st pressure ($p_1$-), and 1st spacetime ($w_1$-) modes, as a function of the magnetic tidal deformability. The universal relations derived in this study exhibit accuracy more or less comparable to those of the electric tidal deformability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Relationship Between Nanoflare Energy and Delay in the Closed Solar Corona</a><span class="id">[2512.20875]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Determining the relationship between nanoflare energies and their delays is the key for understanding the physical mechanism of the events and the plasma response. Nanoflares analyzed in this study were generated self-consistently via prescribed photospheric motions in a 3D multi-strand simulation of a subset of active region magnetic flux. Energies and durations were quantified using three distinct methods. In this study, we investigated the correlation between nanoflare energies (E) and delays ($\tau_D$) using two non-parametric, rank-based statistical tests. Across all methods, results consistently show little to no correlation. This is further supported by the distribution of the exponent $\alpha$ in the assumed relation $E \propto \tau_D^\alpha$, which peaks near zero, and by broad delay distributions within fixed energy bins. These findings are irrespective of whether delays are correlated with the energy of the preceding or subsequent event. They also hold for a subset of high-energy nanoflares. The absence of correlation suggests that nanoflare onset is not solely determined by a critical value of magnetic stress and may involve triggering by other events, perhaps related to a locally complex topology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20890" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Considering lensing effect on gravitational wave signals from black holes in mass gap</a><span class="id">[2512.20890]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The pair-instability supernova (PISN) mechanism predicts a mass gap in the black hole population, where no stellar-origin black holes are expected to form. However, the binary black hole merger events GW190521 and GW231123 appear unusual, as current analyses place their component masses within the PISN mass gap. In this work, we investigate the relationship between different lensing magnifications and the inferred source-frame black hole masses for these two events. If the gravitational wave source is lensed, neglecting lensing effect can bias the inferred luminosity distance and hence the redshift, leading to an underestimation of the luminosity distance and consequently an overestimation of the source-frame masses, potentially placing them in the mass-gap region. For the two events in mass gap, when adopting a lower bound of $60 M_{\odot}$ for the mass gap, the minimum magnifications required to shift the inferred source-frame masses below this gap boundary are found to be $\mu=12.2$ for GW190521 and $\mu=320.1$ for GW231123, corresponding to lensing-corrected luminosity distances of $11155\, \mathrm{Mpc}$ and $15207\, \mathrm{Mpc}$, respectively. These results provide a quantitative reference for assessing the lensing hypothesis as a possible explanation for the existence of black holes in the PISN mass gap.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The polar IL Leo in a low accretion state</a><span class="id">[2512.20955]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We performed an optical study of the magnetic period-bouncer candidate IL Leo. Long-term photometric analysis over $\approx 20$ years reveals multiple state transitions. Modelling the ultraviolet and optical spectral energy distribution refined the white dwarf parameters, yielding a mass of $M_\textrm{wd} = 0.74 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$ and an effective temperature of $T_\mathrm{eff} = 12700 \pm 360$ K. We analyzed phase-resolved spectroscopy obtained with the 6-m BTA telescope and the VLT during the low state. Orbital variability of the H$\alpha$ emission, inferred from dynamical spectra and Doppler tomograms, suggests that it originates in the accretion stream. Zeeman splitting gives a mean magnetic field of $B = 40.7 \pm 0.5$ MG. Modelling two sets of cyclotron spectra determined a low-state accretion rate of $\dot{M} = (2.5 - 4.1) \times 10^{-13}~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a magnetic field of $B_\mathrm{m} \approx 41$ MG near magnetic pole.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum scattering of hot H/D on CO$_2$: Cross sections and rate coefficients for planetary atmospheres and their evolution</a><span class="id">[2512.21044]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Collisions between hot hydrogen atoms and CO$_2$ play a central role in energy transfer and atmospheric escape in CO$_2$-rich planetary atmospheres. We present quantum mechanical $j_z$-conserving coupled-states calculations of state-resolved cross sections for H/D–CO$_2$ collisions at energies up to 5 eV, benchmarked to within 7\% of close-coupling results. Scattering is strongly forward-peaked, yielding momentum-transfer cross sections substantially smaller than commonly assumed: mass-scaling from O/C–CO$_2$ systems overestimates H–CO$_2$ total cross sections by factors of 30–45, while existing empirical fits underestimate the low-energy regime by up to $\sim$45\%. Isotopic substitution (H/D) produces energy-dependent differences of up to 35\% at $E&lt;0.1$ eV, invalidating uniform scaling approaches for D/H fractionation. Maxwellian-averaged rate coefficients derived from our cross sections are significantly smaller than mass-scaled values, implying reduced H–CO$_2$ energy transfer efficiency. In atmospheric escape modelling, these revisions can shift Martian exobase altitudes by 10–20 km, leading to order-unity changes in thermal escape rates, and have implications for hydrogen loss in early CO$_2$-dominated planetary atmospheres. Our results provide essential quantum-mechanical inputs for revisiting atmospheric evolution scenarios on Mars, early Earth, and CO$_2$-rich exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The transport of angular momentum for massive stars I. Formation of slowly rotating WNE stars</a><span class="id">[2512.21074]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The evolutionary scenario of early-type nitrogen-sequence Wolf-Rayet (WNE) stars predicts a slowly rotating subclass that typically forms after the red supergiant (RSG) phase. Their slow rotation rates are attributed to stellar winds that remove angular momentum transferred outward during core contraction. We incorporate improved prescriptions for internal gravity waves and the magnetic Tayler instability into single massive star evolution models. Our simulations successfully produce slowly rotating WNE stars and determine optimal parameters for both mechanisms ($A \ge 10$ for internal gravity waves (IGWs), $\alpha = 0.01$ for revised Tayler instability (TSF)). The results demonstrate that the efficiency of angular momentum transfer in massive stars is significantly enhanced compared to low-mass stars, both processes can self-consistently explain the slow rotation of WNE stars, confirming their efficiency in angular momentum redistribution and providing crucial theoretical support for the existence of this predicted stellar population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21123" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asteroseismology and Dynamics Reveal Interior Structure and Coeval Evolution in the Triply Post-Main-Sequence system DG Leo</a><span class="id">[2512.21123]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>$\delta$ Scuti stars in binary or multiple systems serve as crucial probes for studying stellar pulsation and evolution. However, many such systems are not ideal for asteroseismology due to uncertainties in mass transfer with close companions and the challenges of dynamically measuring all components' physical properties. The triple system DG Leo, comprising an inner binary and a distant $\delta$ Scuti star, is an ideal target due to its well-separated pulsator. By combining new \textit{TESS} photometry with archival spectroscopy, our dynamical analysis shows that the system's three components share similar masses, radii, and luminosities within errors, occupying coincident Hertzsprung–Russell diagram positions, indicative of coeval evolution. By fitting seven observed $\delta$ Scuti frequencies through asteroseismic modeling with dynamically constrained theoretical grids, we simultaneously trace the pulsating star's evolution and constrain the triple system's evolutionary stage, with the derived fundamental parameters showing consistency with the dynamical solutions. Our analysis reveals that all three components of DG Leo are in the post-main-sequence phase, with a system age of $0.7664^{+0.1402}_{-0.1258}$ Gyr. Additionally, the $\delta$ Scuti component shows multiple non-radial modes with significant mixed-character frequencies, providing precise constraints on its convective core extent ($R_{\mathrm{cz}}/R = 0.0562^{+0.0137}_{-0.0021}$).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of the 2021 Outburst of GX 339-4 with AstroSat</a><span class="id">[2512.21139]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive study of the 2021 outburst of GX 339-4 using AstroSat observations in the hard-intermediate (HIMS) and soft-intermediate states (SIMS). Spectral and timing analyses across these states suggest that during the SIMS, unabsorbed flux (0.1-3 keV), inner disc temperature, and &quot;apparent&quot; inner disc radius do not change, suggesting the stability of the disc. In the SIMS, the photon index decreases from 2.1 to 1.7, indicating spectral hardening. The power density spectra (PDS) suggest the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the HIMS and SIMS. The QPO frequency evolves from 0.1 Hz to 0.2 Hz in the HIMS, and further to 5.7 Hz in the SIMS. We also observe a decrease in QPO frequency from 5.7 Hz to 4.5 Hz during the SIMS. We discuss the evolution of the QPO, fractional root mean square (rms) amplitude, and time-lag spectra. We discover that variations in disc normalization, disc temperature, and coronal heating rate can reproduce the observed rms and lag spectra with a time delay between them.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The disc instability model: original recipe and additional ingredients</a><span class="id">[2512.21188]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The disc instability model successfully reproduces many of the observed properties of cataclysmic variables. However, additional ingredients such as mass-transfer variations, disc irradiation, stream-disc overflow, or inner-disc truncation must be included to explain certain systems. The physics underlying these processes is often poorly constrained, and our lack of knowledge is typically absorbed into extra free parameters, much like the $\alpha$-prescription for viscosity.

We compare three types of models: a broken power-law disk emissivity profile with no assumption about the coronal shape used in the previous work of the same observations, a compact lamppost corona, and an extended disk-like corona motivated by recent X-ray polarization results. Our goal is to measure the systematic uncertainties caused by the assumed geometry, with a focus on key parameters such as the black hole spin and the inclination of the inner accretion disk. We find that the disk-like corona gives a fit that is statistically similar to the broken power-law and lamppost models, but it leads to more physically reasonable results, such as a lower inclination angle of about $30^{\circ}$. By using a variable disk density model, we measure the disk density to be $n_{\rm e}\approx10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, which is similar to earlier results. While the extended corona model infers a wider allowed parameter space for black hole spin and the inner radius of the disk-shaped coronal region, this reflects the additional physical freedom of the model. Even so, the disk-like corona remains a strong and physically well-motivated candidate for explaining the X-ray emission from Cyg X-1.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minijets and Broken Stationarity in a Blazar : Novel Insights into the Origin of $γ$-ray Variability in CTA 102</a><span class="id">[2512.21240]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-energy blazar light curves, in X-rays and beyond, have historically preferred a log-normal flux distribution, signifying multiplicative processes either in the jet itself or due to connection(s) with accretion. Here we present 18 year archival Fermi-LAT light curves (0.1-100 GeV) of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) CTA 102 from August 2008 to November 2025, which underwent a huge flare in 2017, with a $\sim$ factor of 100 jump in $\gamma$-ray flux, along with similar flaring in X-rays. Our statistical analyses confirm that neither the pre nor the post-flare total GeV light curves follow a strictly log-normal distribution. Instead, we observe a statistically significant reduction in skewness from the pre to the post-flare light curves, which implies the blazar transitioned from an energetic state with frequent flaring to a more plateaued state with occasional flaring. We further find that this state transition can be explained through magnetic relaxation, where many reconnection events caused the 2017 flare, after which the magnetic field was ordered and its energy reached a minimum. To explain this further, we use a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model where GeV flares are produced only when a maximum number of minijets move toward the broad line region and towards the line of sight, in the context of an external Compton model. The flux distributions (both observed and simulated) could be fit by a modified log-normal power-law distribution, implying our minijets model can reproduce the GeV flares in CTA 102 as well as their flux distributions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21289" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Near-Infrared and Optical Study of NGC 5822: An Open Cluster Hosting Barium-stars and Lithium-Enriched Giant Stars</a><span class="id">[2512.21289]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a chemical abundance study of giant stars in the Galactic open cluster NGC 5822, which hosts two barium stars (#002 and #201) and three lithium-enriched giants (#006, #102, and #240). Using high-resolution optical and near-infrared ($H$ and $K$ band) spectra from FEROS and IGRINS, we determine atmospheric parameters and abundances for 23 elements (Li, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Y, Ce, Nd, Yb, and Pb). This includes species not yet studied in this cluster, such as F, P, K, Yb, and Pb, as well as oxygen isotopic ratios $^{16}$O/$^{17}$O and $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O. Membership was assessed using astrometry and chemical abundances, providing insight into the evolutionary stages of Li-enriched giants and cluster parameters (age, distance, extinction). However, the identification of Ba-stars remains challenging due to their binary nature and less reliable astrometric solutions. The cluster's abundances are broadly consistent with expectations for the Galactic thin disk. The mean fluorine abundance agrees with chemical evolution models predicting that young clusters (&lt;2 Gyr) exhibit elevated [F/Fe], with production from SN II, SN Ia, AGB, and Wolf-Rayet stars. No distinct chemical or rotational features were found to explain the lithium enrichment, likely occurring either during the red clump phase or near the RGB tip. For the Ba-stars, nucleosynthesis models combined with the cluster's turn-off mass suggest polluting companion masses of 3.00 and 3.75 $M_{\odot}$ for stars #002 and #201.

The depths of extrema show non-random behaviour: minima in particular display strong similarity in depth over extended intervals, with a mean depth difference of 0.26 magnitude for adjacent minima compared to a 0.38 magnitude difference for random pairs. Depth coherence persists for up to about 43 years. Examination of extrema depths over the full observational history of the star reveals gradual long-term changes, consistent with evolution of the circumstellar dust environment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quirks Live in Cool Universes</a><span class="id">[2512.20696]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We demonstrate that cosmological observations place strong bounds on the reheat temperature $T_\text{RH}$ of the Standard Model (SM) in minimal models of `quirks' – heavy fermions transforming under the SM gauge group together with a new non-Abelian gauge interaction with a confinement scale far below the mass of the fermions. These models have unique collider signals associated with the confining flux strings, which cannot break due to the large mass of the quirks. Our work shows that in these models $T_\text{RH} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV for the entire `quirky' parameter space where the effects of the flux string are important. These bounds are in tension with most models of baryogenesis, showing that the discovery of quirks at colliders can have far-reaching implications for cosmology. The bounds arise because the irreducible relic abundance of glueballs from UV freeze-in, combined with their long lifetimes, leads to constraints from the disruption of BBN, distortions of the CMB, excess $\gamma$-rays, an over-abundance of self-interacting dark matter, and contributions to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. The glueball freeze-in abundance has a strong dependence on $T_\text{RH}$, making the bounds relatively insensitive to strong interaction uncertainties. The bounds are robust to the SM quantum numbers of the quirks and the presence of Yukawa couplings with the Higgs. In non-minimal extensions of the model where the glueballs can decay to an additional dark sector, the bounds remain for models where the flux string has a macroscopic length at colliders. We also show that for quirk masses above $\sim 10$ TeV, the dark glueballs can be the dominant component of dark matter. This work illustrates a striking connection between quirky collider signals and cosmological probes of new physics, strengthening the case for targeted quirk searches at colliders.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comparing next-generation detector configurations for high-redshift gravitational wave sources with neural posterior estimation</a><span class="id">[2512.20699]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The coming decade will be crucial for determining the final design and configuration of a global network of next-generation (XG) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, including the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). In this study and for the first time, we assess the performance of various network configurations using neural posterior estimation (NPE) implemented in Dingo-IS-a method based on normalizing flows and importance sampling that enables fast and accurate inference. We focus on a specific science case involving short-duration, massive and high-redshift binary black hole (BBH) mergers with detector-frame chirp masses $M_{\mathrm{d}} &gt; 100$ M$_\odot$. These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Echoes of $R^3$ modification and Goldstone preheating in the CMB-BAO landscape</a><span class="id">[2512.20730]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $R^2$ and the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation are disfavored by the observed high spectral index $n_s$ from the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements at the $\sim2\sigma$ level.

Unlike thermally modified earlier studies, SNS and CSNS constitute fully non-thermal, number-state-dependent quantum configurations. By embedding these states within the framework of semiclassical theory of gravity, we derive state-resolved expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy variation, and corresponding mass loss of an evaporating black hole. The influence of the squeezing parameter $\rho$ and number state parameter $n$ on Hawking emission is examined through a series of analytical results supported by twelve detailed plots. The analysis reveals that the Hawking temperature exhibits monotonic growth with increasing $\rho$ and $n$, thereby elevating the effective temperature experienced at the black hole horizon. The entropy variations $\Delta \mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{SNS}}$ and $\Delta \mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{CSNS}}$ show strong nonlinear enhancement, especially at moderate and large squeezing values. Overall, the study extends earlier thermal squeezed-state approaches to a fully number-state-resolved framework, highlighting the sensitivity of Hawking emission to nonclassical quantum configurations. These findings contribute a new perspective on gravitational particle creation in cosmological settings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axion-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields</a><span class="id">[2512.21108]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate axion-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields, focusing on the evolution of the photon intensity and polarizations induced by conversion into axions.

In the presence of a Chern–Simons coupling between the inflaton and a U(1) gauge field, the homogeneous evolution of the inflaton induces a tachyonic instability in one circular polarization of the gauge field, resulting in the production of helical magnetic fields. In this work, we show that, in the case of a gauged lepton flavor symmetry, U(1)$_{L_i-L_j}$, this mechanism can lead to the generation of a sizable lepton asymmetry. In a simple setup, however, the resulting lepton asymmetry is typically too small to have an observational consequences, even setting aside constraints from baryon overproduction via sphaleron processes, due to the backreaction of the produced gauge fields and fermions on the inflationary dynamics. We demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by implementing a mechanism to suppress fermion production during inflation. As a result, a much larger lepton asymmetry can be generated from the subsequent decay of magnetic helicity. Remarkably, for the gauged U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry, the generated asymmetry can be sufficiently large to suppress the primordial helium abundance, as may be inferred from recent cosmic microwave background observations by ACT.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21151" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acoustic gravitational waves from primordial curvature perturbations</a><span class="id">[2512.21151]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Standard perturbative calculations of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) have neglected nonperturbative effects in the large-amplitude regime. We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power. Comparing with SIGWs computed perturbatively from the same real-space configuration, we show that acoustic GWs can be amplified by an order of magnitude and display a peak shifted to a lower frequency in the large-amplitude regime. These results highlight the importance of nonperturbative effects for accurate predictions of stochastic GW signals induced from primordial curvature perturbations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Lovelock)$^2$ inflation: explaining the ACT data and equivalence to Higgs-Gauss-Bonnet inflation</a><span class="id">[2512.21167]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit the Starobinsky model of inflation in light of recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which indicates a potential preference for a slightly larger scalar spectral index $n_s$ than predicted by the standard $R^2$ scenario.

Scalar-tensor formulation of this theory yields an Einstein-frame Starobinsky-type scalar potential augmented by Gauss–Bonnet and derivative couplings, which modify the inflationary slow-roll dynamics.

This review presents a coherent and pedagogical framework that bridges foundational theory with observational frontiers. We begin by developing the theory of gravitational radiation within linearized general relativity, deriving gravitational waves as solutions to the linearized Einstein equations and clarifying their physical interpretation, polarization states, and key properties. We then deepen the discussion through a geometric perspective, tracing the connection between gravitational radiation and the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor and its role in defining energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extending beyond flat backgrounds, we examine gravitational waves in an expanding universe, following their evolution across cosmological epochs and their generation during inflation. Within this setting, we discuss adiabatic modes and consistency relations that reveal universal properties of long-wavelength perturbations, and derive the inflationary spectrum of vacuum gravitational waves together with their contribution to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also survey the main observational strategies for detecting gravitational waves across a broad frequency range, including cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing arrays, ground- and space-based laser interferometers, and resonant cavity detectors. We then discuss the astrophysical and cosmological mechanisms responsible for generating gravitational radiation. We conclude by summarizing the current status of the field and outlining promising directions for future theoretical and observational developments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data-driven core collapse supernova multilateration with first neutrino events</a><span class="id">[2410.11984]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A Galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) is likely to be observed in neutrino detectors around the world minutes to hours before the electromagnetic radiation arrives. The SNEWS2.0 network of neutrino and dark matter detectors aims to use the relative arrival times of the neutrinos at the different experiments to point back to the supernova so as to facilitate follow-up observation. One of the simplest methods to estimate the CCSN direction is to use the first neutrino events detected through the inverse beta decay (IBD) process, $\overline{\nu}_e p\rightarrow e^+n$. We will consider neutrino detectors sensitive to IBD interactions with low backgrounds. The difference in signal arrival times between a large and a small detector will be biased, however, with the first event at the smaller detector, on average, arriving later than that at the larger detector. This bias can be mitigated by using these first events in a data-driven approach without recourse to simulations or models. The resulting method requires, at minimum, only the times of the first events at most detectors, along with a longer time series of events from one larger detector to act as a reference lightcurve. In this article, we demonstrate this method and its uncertainty estimate using pairs of detectors of different sizes and with different supernova distances. Finally, we use this method to calculate probability skymaps using four detectors currently in operation (Super-Kamiokande, JUNO, LVD, and SNO+) and show that the calculated probabilities yield appropriate confidence intervals for all supernova directions. The area of the 68\% confidence interval varies by distance and direction, but is expected to be a few thousand square degrees. The resulting skymaps should be useful for the multi-messenger community as a rapid, initial pointing to follow up on the SNEWS2.0 Galactic CCSN neutrino alert.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Novel Technique for Long-term Timing of Redback Millisecond Pulsars</a><span class="id">[2412.08688]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present timing solutions spanning nearly two decades for five redback (RB) systems found in globular clusters (GC), created using a novel technique that effectively &quot;isolates&quot; the pulsar. By accurately measuring the time of passage through periastron ($T_0$) at points over the timing baseline, we use a piecewise-continuous, binary model to get local solutions of the orbital variations that we pair with long-term orbital information to remove the orbital timing delays. The isolated pulse times of arrival can then be fit to describe the spin behavior of the millisecond pulsar (MSP). The results of our timing analyses via this method are consistent with those of conventional timing methods for binaries in GCs as demonstrated by analyses of NGC 6440D. We also investigate the observed orbital phase variations for these systems. Quasi-periodic oscillations in Terzan 5P's orbit may be the result of changes to the gravitational-quadruple moment of the companion as prescribed by the Applegate model. We find a striking correlation between the standard deviation of the phase variations as a fraction of a system's orbit ($\sigma_{\Delta T_0}$) and the MSP's spin frequency, as well as a potential correlation between $\sigma_{\Delta T_0}$ and the binary's projected semi-major axis.

During this process, they also exchange energy with the medium, heating and cooling the HI. In addition, we expect X-ray photons to heat the mostly neutral gas during this era. We solve this coupled system (Lyman-$\alpha$-HI system along with X-ray heating) for a period of 500 Myr (redshift range $8 &lt;z &lt; 25$). Our main results are: (a) Without X-ray heating, the temperature of the gas reaches an equilibrium which is nearly independent of photon intensity and only weakly dependent on the expansion of the universe. The main determinant of the quasi-static temperature is the ratio of injected and continuum Lyman-$\alpha$ photons. (b) While X-ray photons provide an additional source of heating at initial times, for large enough Lyman-$\alpha$ photon intensity, the system tends to reach the same quasi-static temperature as expected without additional heating. This limit is reached when the density of photons close to the Lyman-$\alpha$ resonance far exceeds the HI number density. (c) We compute the global HI signal for these scenarios. In the limit of the large density of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, the spin temperature of the hyperfine line is fixed. This freezes the global HI signal from the era of cosmic dawn and the cross-over redshift from absorption to emission. This feature depends only on the ratio of injected to continuum Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, and the global HI signal can help us determine this ratio.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromatic activity window of periodic FRBs: FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B</a><span class="id">[2507.04609]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Two fast radio bursts, FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B, show periodic activity with cycles of 159.3 and 16.33 days, respectively. These cycles consist of active and inactive windows, with peak activity centered within the active phase. For FRB 20180916B, studies have reported a frequency-dependent-or “chromatic”-behaviour, where the activity window starts earlier and becomes narrower at higher frequencies. The activity across frequencies is typically modeled with a power law. In this work, we develop a simple model that combines the phase and frequency dependence of the activity windows of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B. Our goal is to perform a chromaticity study for FRB 20121102A, incorporating model improvements to account for the cyclic nature of its activity window, and to compare the chromatic behaviour between both periodic FRBs. We standardise the detections from the 425 observing epochs for FRB 20121102A and the 214 epochs for FRB 20180916B to account for differences in radio telescope sensitivity. To the normalised detection rate phase distribution, we fit a von Mises distribution and extract the peak activity phase and activity width. These quantities, as a function of frequency, are then modelled as power-laws to construct the chromatic model. For both sources, the activity window starts earlier at higher frequencies. However, FRB 20121102A shows an activity window broadening at higher frequencies, while FRB 20180916B broadens at lower frequencies. Interestingly, it appears to remain active during at least 80% of the cycle at C-band. The observed chromatic behaviour of FRB 20180916B is consistent with previous findings. For FRB 20121102A, a chromaticity in its activity window is also seen; however, the source appears to be active for longer at higher frequencies, opposite to the behaviour of FRB 20180916B.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can cosmic rotation resolve the Hubble tension?

The 21-cm signal from EoR is expected to be highly non-Gaussian; therefore, we need to use higher-order statistics, e.g., bispectrum. Moreover, the forward modeling of the signal and its statistics for a varying set of model parameters requires rerunning the simulations many times, which is computationally very expensive. To overcome this challenge, many artificial neural network (ANN) based emulators have been introduced, which produce the 21-cm summaries in a fraction of the time. However, ANN emulators have a drawback: they can only produce point-value predictions; thus, they fail to capture the uncertainty associated with their predictions. Therefore, when such emulators are used in the Bayesian inference pipeline, they cannot naturally propagate their prediction uncertainties to the estimated model parameters. To address this problem, we have developed Bayesian neural network (BNN) emulators for the 21-cm signal statistics, which provide the posterior distribution of the predicted signal statistics, including their prediction uncertainty. We use these BNN emulators in our Bayesian inference pipeline to infer the EoR parameters through 21-cm summaries of the mock observation of 21-cm signal with telescopic noise for $1000$ hr of SKA-LOW observation. We show that BNN emulators can capture the prediction uncertainty for the 21-cm power spectrum and bispectrum, and using these emulators in the inference pipeline provides better and tighter constraints on them. We reduced the training dataset and showed that, for smaller training datasets, BNN outperforms the ANN emulators. We also show that using the bispectrum as a summary statistic gives better constraints on EoR parameters than the power spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19645" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the optical emission in the mini-outburst of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630</a><span class="id">[2508.19645]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the optical emission of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630 during its 2019 minioutburst.

Our key findings are as follows: (1) The X-ray Comptonization flux lags behind the optical emission by about 8.5 days, a delay naturally explained by the disk instability model (DIM). (2) The optical and X-ray fluxes show a power-law correlation with a slope about 0.4, which lies between the predicted values for viscous heating and X-ray reprocessing, consistent with the DIM framework.

Asteroseismology has become a unique tool for the measurement of internal structure of the WDs, such as their masses, radii, temperatures and rotation profiles. A few stable periodicities have been observed for accreting WDs, but the lack of complete and accurate theoretical models has hindered the real diagnosis of the observed pulsations. Though the associated pulsations in accreting WDs are thought to be $g$-modes, some work in the literature suggests that these pulsations could be Rossby modes ($r$-modes). Here, to elucidate this, we present a first simultaneous analysis of $g$- and $r$-mode pulsations in accreting white dwarfs including a full computation of visibility accounting for the distribution of variation over the WD surface. We show that, up to the second lowest degree ($\ell =2$), neither $g-$ nor $r$-modes have a clear advantage in visibility. Although a few retrograde $r$-mode orders exhibit a larger visibility, the low-order $g$ modes possess higher frequency in the star's frame, making them more likely to be driven within the convective driving scenario commonly applied to isolated WDs. Therefore, we favor a $g$-mode origin for the observed periods in accreting WDs, though $r$-modes will be important for stars with more observed modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00102" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Cold and Super-Puffy Planet on a Prograde Orbit</a><span class="id">[2510.00102]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of TOI-4507 b, a transiting sub-Saturn with a density $&lt;$ 0.2 g/cm$^3$ on a 105-day prograde orbit around a 700 Myr old F star.

With these characteristics, TOI-4507 is one of the longest-period systems for which the stellar obliquity has been measured, and the planet is among the longest-period and youngest ”super-puff” planets yet discovered.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The GAPS programme at TNG XYZ. A sub-Neptune suitable for atmospheric characterization in a multiplanet and mutually inclined system orbiting the bright K dwarf TOI-5789 (HIP 99452)</a><span class="id">[2510.11490]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sub-Neptunes with planetary radii of $R_{p} \simeq 2-4 R_{\oplus}$ are the most common planets around solar-type stars in short-period ($P&lt;100$ d) orbits. It is still unclear, however, what their most likely composition is, that is whether they are predominantly gas dwarfs or water worlds. The sub-Neptunes orbiting bright host stars are very valuable because they are suitable for atmospheric characterization, which can break the well-known degeneracy in planet composition from the planet bulk density, when combined with a precise and accurate mass measurement. Here we report on the characterization of the sub-Neptune TOI-5789 c, which transits in front of the bright ($V=7.3$ mag and $K_{s}=5.35$ mag) and magnetically inactive K1V dwarf HIP 99452 every 12.93 days, thanks to TESS photometry and 141 high-precision radial velocities obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph. We find that its radius, mass, and bulk density are $R_{c}=2.86^{+0.18}_{-0.15} R_\oplus$, $M_{c}=5.00 \pm 0.50 M_\oplus$, and $\rho_{c}=1.16 \pm 0.23$ g cm$^{-3}$, and we show that TOI-5789 c is a promising target for atmospheric characterization with both JWST and, in the future, Ariel. By analyzing the HARPS-N radial velocities with different tools, we also detect three additional non-transiting planets, namely TOI-5789 b, d, and e, with orbital periods and minimum masses of $P_{b}=2.76$ d, $M_{b}\sin{i}=2.12 \pm 0.28 M_\oplus$, $P_{d}=29.6$ d, $M_{d}\sin{i}=4.29 \pm 0.68 M_\oplus$, and $P_{e}=63.0$ d, $M_{e}\sin{i}=11.61 \pm 0.97 M_\oplus$. TOI-5789 is a mutually inclined system as the difference between the orbital inclinations of planets b and c must be higher than $\sim4$ deg. Nevertheless, from sensitivity studies based on both the HARPS-N and archival HIRES radial-velocity measurements, we can exclude that these relatively high mutual inclinations are due to the perturbation by an outer gaseous giant planet.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarization Dynamics of X-Ray Synchrotron Emission from a Multi-Zone Blazar Jet</a><span class="id">[2510.13776]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The polarization of X-ray synchrotron emission in blazars directly probes the magnetic field geometry and particle acceleration processes in relativistic jets. We use particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection and magnetized turbulence, coupled to polarization-sensitive radiative transfer code, to interpret IXPE observations of Mrk 421 during a high flux state recorded in December of 2023. To evaluate the fitness of the two theoretical scenarios, we rely on a quantitative comparison of the statistical properties of simulated and observed X-ray flux and polarization light curves using five evaluation metrics, rather than attempting to fit individual data points. We propose a turbulence-driven multi-zone model where jet emission is represented as the sum of the radiative output of N independent cells, each described by a particle-in-cell simulation. Comparison of ensembles of simulated Stokes-parameter light curves with IXPE data shows that magnetic reconnection dominated models provide the best match to the observed X-ray flux and polarization dynamics. The optimal configuration corresponds to N = 15 emitting cells, which reproduces the observed amplitudes and timescales of the X-ray flux and polarization variations. Magnetized turbulence models underpredict both the flux and polarization variability. Our results indicate that a multi-zone, reconnection-powered emission scenario can describe the X-ray polarization behavior of Mrk 421 and establish a quantitative framework for testing theoretical models against IXPE observations of other high-synchrotron-peaked blazars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23037" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the cosmic distance duality relation using model-independent approach</a><span class="id">[2510.23037]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) using the arbitrary redshift pivot Padé-(2,1) expansion methodology developed in arXiv:2509.16196 . This approach allows us to constrain cosmography parameters and test CDDR at any redshift. Further, it does not rely on data reconstructions or extrapolations of the cosmography parameters to higher redshifts. We employ observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation dataset, cosmic chronometers (CC), and Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon Plus (PP) and Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilations. We find no significant deviations from the standard CDDR relation in the range $0\lesssim z \lesssim 1$ when considering DESI$+r_d$ dataset in combination with PP$+$CC and DESY5$+$CC datasets. However, on imposing a Gaussian prior on $M_B \in \mathcal{N}(-19.253, 0.027)$ (instead of treating it as a free parameter) in the dataset combination PP$+$CC, we find CDDR violation at a level of $(3-5)\sigma.$</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planet Across Space and Time (PAST). VII. The origin and tidal evolution of hot Jupiters constrained by a broken age-frequency relation</a><span class="id">[2510.26084]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of hot Jupiters has challenged the classical planet formation theory. Although various formation mechanisms have been proposed, the dominant channel and relative contributions remain unclear. Furthermore, hot Jupiters offer a unique opportunity to test tidal theory and measure the fundamental tidal quality factor, which is yet to be well-constrained. In this work, based on a hot Jupiter sample around single Sun-like stars with kinematic properties, {we find that the declining trend of their frequency is broken with a ridge at about 2 Gyr, providing direct evidence that hot Jupiters are formed with multiple origins of different timescales. By fitting with the theoretical expectations, we provide a constraint of tidal factor for Sun-like stars, which aligns well with the detected number of hot Jupiters with orbital decay. Moreover, we simultaneously constrain the relative importance of different channels: although the majority of hot Jupiters are formed early, within several tenths of Gyr via 'Early' models (e.g., in-situ formation, disk migration, planet-planet scattering and Kozai-Lidov interaction), a significant portion (about 40%) should be formed late on a relatively long timescale extending up to several Gyr mainly via the secular chaos mechanism, further supported by the obliquity distribution of 'late-arrived' hot Jupiters. Our findings provide a unified framework that reconciles hot Jupiter demographics and long-term evolution with multichannel formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Dark Energy Dynamical in the DESI Era?

The result indicates that it is not a problem in the UV region but a question of the contributions of heavy fields being suppressed. Then, we explore an effective description via scale decoupling. The parameter spaces suggest that the vacuum energy of active neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV $(10^{-3}$ eV) is expected. The normal ordering neutrinos are preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Challenging $Λ$CDM with Higher-Order GUP Corrections</a><span class="id">[2508.20644]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study quantum corrections to the $\Lambda$CDM model model arising from a minimum measurable length in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We focus on a higher-order Generalized Uncertainty Principle, beyond the quadratic form. This generalized GUP introduces two free parameters, and we determine the modified Friedmann equation. This framework leads to a perturbative cosmological model that naturally reduces to $\Lambda$CDM in an appropriate limiting case of the deformation parameters. We construct the modified cosmological scenario, analyze its deviations from the standard case, and examine it as a mechanism for the description of dynamical dark energy. To constrain the model, we employ Cosmic Chronometers, the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the DESI DR2 release, and Supernova data from the PantheonPlus and Union3 catalogues. Our analysis indicates that the modified GUP model is statistically competitive with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, providing comparable or even improved fits to some of the combined datasets. Moreover, the data constrain the deformation parameter of the GUP model, with the preferred value found to be negative, which corresponds to a phantom regime in the effective dynamical dark energy description.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14790" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Theory of Bulk Viscosity of Cold Plasmas</a><span class="id">[2511.14790]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solving the kinetic equation for ionization-recombination processes in cold plasmas for temperatures much lower than the first ionization potentials, we derive an explicit expression for the bulk viscosity.

The simplest versions of $\alpha$-attractors, T- and E-models, originate from theories with non-singular potentials. In canonical variables, these potentials have a plateau that is approached exponentially fast at large values of the inflaton field $\varphi$. In a closely related class of polynomial $\alpha$-attractors, or P-models, the potential is not singular, but its derivative is singular at the boundary. The resulting inflaton potential also has a plateau, but it is approached polynomially. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of potentials, which can be singular at the boundary of the moduli space, S-models. These potentials may have a short plateau, after which the potential may grow polynomially or exponentially at large values of the inflaton field. We will show that this class of models may provide a simple solution to the initial conditions problem for $\alpha$-attractors and may account for a very broad range of possible values of $n_{s}$ matching the recent ACT, SPT, and DESI data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinetic theory and the speed of sound in dense matter</a><span class="id">[2512.19770]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We discuss a constraint on the speed of sound, $c_s^2$, derived from relativistic kinetic theory and show how it can be expressed in terms of the average sound speed, $\langle c_s^2 \rangle$.
