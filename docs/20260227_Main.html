We observe a gradual dispersion measure (DM) decline of $-0.881\pm0.001~\mathrm{pc}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}~\mathrm{year}^{-1}$ ($-1.235\pm0.001~\mathrm{pc}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}~\mathrm{year}^{-1}$ in the rest frame), implying a $\geq3.5\pm0.2$% decrease of the total electron column in the source environment, and we see scattering timescale variations over weeks to years. We observe a short-lived excursion in which the DM rises by $\sim 1~\mathrm{pc}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, immediately preceding a transient $\sim 2000~\mathrm{rad}~\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ Faraday rotation measure (RM) increase previously reported for this source, before returning to its gradual DM decline. We identify a local line-of-sight magnetic field around FRB 20220529A during this DM/RM excursion of $3.4 \pm 0.2~\mathrm{mG}$, corresponding to one of the most strongly magnetized FRB environments. We measure a decrease in the linear polarization fraction of FRB 20220529A bursts with decreasing frequency that we attribute to depolarization from multi-path propagation in the source environment. We also place a $5\sigma$ upper limit on the spectral luminosity of an associated persistent radio source of $\leq 5\times10^{28}~\mathrm{erg}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at 1.5 GHz. These observations are consistent with FRB 20220529A originating from a young ($\sim$ years to centuries old) expanding supernova remnant, with short-lived DM and RM variability arising from interactions with the supernova remnant or with a binary companion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XRISM Observation of the Supernova Remnant N103B: Velocity Structure and Thermal Properties</a><span class="id">[2602.22321]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first analysis of the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) observation of the supernova remnant (SNR) N103B. We fit the X-ray spectrum taken with the Resolve microcalorimeter, which captured emission lines from the predominantly ejecta elements Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, and Fe. Notably, our fits require a previously unidentified high-temperature, highly-ionized, Fe-dominated plasma component with particularly high Cr and Mn abundances, matching a feature also present in the recent XRISM analysis of the SNR N132D. We find that all ejecta in N103B exhibits significant line broadening arising mostly from thermal Doppler broadening: increasing from $\sigma_{\rm th}\sim1700$ km s$^{-1}$ for intermediate-mass element (IME: Si, S, Ar, and Ca) ejecta to $\sim$2800 km s$^{-1}$ for Fe-rich ejecta. These velocities correspond to reverse shock velocities of $\sim$3500 and $\sim$5900 km s$^{-1}$, respectively, in the ejecta frame of rest. Finally, we find that the IMEs are redshifted with a bulk velocity of $\sim$360 km s$^{-1}$ while the Fe-dominated components are split: one redshifted at $\sim$1560 km s$^{-1}$ and the other blueshifted at $\sim$1020 km s$^{-1}$. Our results provide further support for the double-ring structure of N103B as it expands into the bipolar winds of a non-degenerate companion and highlight the strength of high-resolution spectroscopic observations of SNRs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST COMPASS: NIRSpec/G395H Transmission Observations of the Sub-Neptune HD 15337 c</a><span class="id">[2602.22327]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the 3-5 $\mu$m transmission spectrum of HD 15337 c (TOI-402.02), a sub-Neptune (2.526 R$_{\oplus}$, 6.792 M$_{\oplus}$, T$_{\rm eq}$$\sim$656 K) around a K1V star observed as part of the JWST COMPASS program. We reduce these observations with two pipelines and find consistent transmission spectra. The resulting median precisions in 30 pixel spectroscopic bins for visit 1 are $\sim$40 ppm and $\sim$70 ppm and for visit 2 are $\sim$30 ppm and $\sim$54 ppm for NRS1 and NRS2, respectively. We attribute the differing precisions to the lack of adequate pre-transit baseline in visit 1 from an early transit arrival caused by previously undetected transit timing variations (TTVs), hinting at a potential exterior companion. Our median JWST timing precision is 10 seconds, revealing TTVs $&gt;$20 minutes when combined with previous TESS and CHEOPS data, highlighting JWST's TTV measurement capabilities. The transmission spectrum of HD 15337 c is featureless and can best be described by a step function with an offset between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors, likely caused by instrumental systematics. From thermochemical equilibrium retrievals we find that, to $&gt;$3$\sigma$, the data can rule out atmospheres with metallicities $&lt;$600 or $&lt;$310 $\times$ solar, depending on the reduction, for opaque pressures greater than a few millibars. HD 15337 c joins other sub-Neptunes with similar masses, radii, and temperatures in possessing a featureless transmission spectrum indicative of high metallicity and/or high-altitude aerosols and adds support to recent studies showing that aerosol opacity reaches a maximum for planets with equilibrium temperatures of 500-700 K.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST COMPASS: A NIRSpec G395H Transmission Spectrum of Radius Valley-Dweller TOI-260 b</a><span class="id">[2602.22329]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a JWST/NIRSpec G395H transmission spectrum of TOI-260 b, a $T_\mathrm{eq}\sim 490$ K, $R_\mathrm{p} = 1.76\,R_\oplus$ planet. The transmission spectrum is derived by combining two transit observations, collected as part of the JWST COMPASS program. We achieved the same median transit depth precision of 37 ppm in both visits, and a median precision of 26 ppm when combining the spectroscopic light curves from the two visits. Implementing a 30-pixel-wide ($R\sim 200$) spectroscopic binning scheme, we find that the transmission spectrum is mostly featureless, with a possible feature around 3.17 $\mu$m. We assess the significance of any features in the transmission spectrum with a suite of non-parametric models, which confirm the presence of a potential feature in the NRS1 bandpass and an offset between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors. To investigate the atmospheric composition of TOI-260 b, we run a series of PLATON retrievals. We do not detect any clear molecular signatures, but the combined data from the two visits are sufficient to constrain the atmospheric metallicity to greater than $200\times$ solar, assuming no opaque deck $\lesssim2.5$ mbar. We also investigate causes of the potential feature near 3.17 $\mu$m; while we find some compatible gaseous species and cannot fully discard an astrophysical origin, we suspect a systematics origin due to the variance in strength and position of the feature. Overall, this look at TOI-260 b adds to the small sample of radius-valley planets, which already seem to show a diversity in their atmospheric compositions. Determining the true nature of these enigmatic planets will require a larger telescope time investment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling the X-ray properties of the eclipsing Cataclysmic Variable UU Aqr: spatially and spectrally-resolved two-component emission</a><span class="id">[2602.22337]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Non-magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) show two distinct X-ray components: a hard, optically thin component and a soft, optically thick, blackbody-like component, both produced in the boundary layer between the accretion disk and the White Dwarf (WD). An additional soft component originating from a more extended region has been reported in few CVs. In a short Chandra exposure, we identified a tentative X-ray eclipse in UU Aqr, a non-magnetic CV which shows deep optical eclipses. Using observations with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and the XMM-Newton, we detect total eclipses in the orbital intensity profiles of this system in the hard X-ray band (3-10 keV with XMM and 3-25 keV with NuSTAR). However, the soft X-ray band (0.3-2.0 keV) shows no evidence of an eclipse. Detailed eclipse modeling, energy-resolved power spectral analysis and broadband spectral modeling indicate that the hard absorbed X-ray emission originates from a compact region near the WD, such as a boundary layer, while the soft, unabsorbed and un-eclipsed X-ray emission originates in an extended region. Neither scattering of hard X-rays nor colliding winds can account for the observed un-eclipsed soft emission. We instead propose that this component is produced by shocks within vertically extended, radiatively driven accretion-disk winds. We also provide new estimates on the emitting regions, mass and radius of the WD and the donor star using eclipse modeling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Determination of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation Temperature at $z\!=\!0.68$ Using Molecular Absorption Lines</a><span class="id">[2602.22399]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyzed millimeter-wave data toward the quasar B0218+357 observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and obtained absorption spectra of the $J$=2-1 and $J$=3-2 rotational transitions of HCN, HCO$^{+}$, HNC, H$^{13}$CN, and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ at the cosmological redshift of $z\!=\!0.68$. For HCN, HCO$^{+}$, and HNC, we identified two distinct absorption components that are common to both transitions, whereas a single component was detected in the isotopologue spectra. In this paper, we accurately evaluate the excitation temperatures and their uncertainties from the absorption strengths of these components, and use them to determine the CMB temperature. Uncertainties in the continuum covering factor were propagated into the excitation temperature via Monte Carlo sampling. We further corrected the observed optical depths for biases due to column-density nonuniformity by assuming a lognormal column-density distribution. Under the assumption that the rotational levels are in radiative equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we derived excitation temperature profiles in the optically thin regime. Because the excitation of HCO$^+$ is biased by an additional velocity component and partial collisional excitation, this species was excluded from the final determination of the CMB temperature. From a weighted mean of the excitation temperatures obtained from HCN and HNC, we determined the CMB temperature at $z\!=\!0.68$ to be ${4.50\pm0.17\,\mathrm{K}}$. This constitutes the first measurement of the CMB temperature at $z\!=\!0.68$ based on a quasar absorption line system and represents the most precise determination at this redshift, highly consistent with the standard Big Bang cosmological model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZTF Monitoring of $γ-$ray emitting Narrow Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2602.22410]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $\gamma$-ray-emitting narrow-line Seyfert-I ($\gamma$-NLSy1) are among the most interesting systems for studying disk-jet coupling. The soft X-ray properties of these systems suggest the presence of a disc component, which peaks in the optical/UV regime, in addition to the active jet. In this work, we investigate the optical emission from $\gamma$-NLSy1 using long-term Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations and discussed in the context of blazars. We have reported the long-term flux and color variability in the g- and r-bands. The fractional variability ($F_{\rm var}$) goes as high as 72\%, with a mean value of 23\%, while the amplitude of variability ($\psi$) values range from 0.24 to 3.20, which is consistent with the long-term Swift-UVOT variability studies. The color-magnitude diagrams exhibit an RWB or BWB trend similar to that of blazars. The $t_{\rm var}$ suggests an emitting region size of $10^{15-17}$ cm, aligned with emissions coming from the inner accretion disk or base of the jet. The PSD analysis using both DRW and CARMA modeling exhibits a characteristic break timescale of a few days to hundreds of days, which is likely linked to fundamental physical timescales in the system, such as thermal or viscous timescales in the accretion disk or timescales for acceleration and energy dissipation in the jet. The existence of these timescales acts as another signature of the disc-jet connection. These time scales are correlated with black hole mass, and the relation is consistent with previous studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo Photometry and Asteroseismology for 98 of the Brightest Stars Observed by TESS</a><span class="id">[2602.22472]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has facilitated studies of asteroseismology, eclipsing binaries, and transits in many stars. However, the brightest stars saturate TESS, yet they are the most amenable to photon-hungry high-resolution studies and have long observational histories. In this work, we adapted the halo photometry used in $K$2 to extract light curves from the unsaturated halo pixels of the star's point spread function. We used this method to extract light curves for 98 of the brightest stars observed by TESS in Sectors 1-93. These bright stars include 15 red giants, five $\delta$ Scuti variables, eight stochastic low-frequency variables, eight eclipsing binaries, and 46 other variables. We measured $\nu_{\rm max}$ for 13 red giants using pyMON and $\Delta\nu$ for one of them, $\beta$ Gem (Pollux). For five of them, this represents the first time that oscillations were detected. We derived their stellar masses using the measured $\nu_{\rm max}$ and previous interferometric and radiometric angular diameters. We also discovered $\delta$ Scuti and $\gamma$ Doradus variability in $\alpha$ Cep, possible asteroseismic binary signatures in $\epsilon$ Car, and a new eclipsing binary, $\gamma$ And. Furthermore, we identified 18 stars in our sample that will be observed by the future PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission, and 69 stars that have Stellar Observations Network Group (SONG) observations, including some simultaneous with TESS. The light curves are publicly available on the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22476" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High Spectral Resolution X-ray Observations of the Evolved Supermassive Stellar Binary System $η$ Carinae - Iron K$α$ Band Profile Revealed with XRISM</a><span class="id">[2602.22476]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The supermassive binary system, $\eta$ Carinae, is experiencing enormous wind-driven mass loss at a rate unparalleled in the rest of the Galaxy. Their wind-wind collision (WWC) continuously produces shock heated, X-ray emitting plasmas. The XRISM X-ray observatory observed the system in 2023 and 2024 when the X-ray emission began to increase toward periastron passage in 2025. This manuscript reports unprecedentedly high-resolution X-ray spectra in the iron K$\alpha$ band between 6.2 and 7.1 keV, obtained with the Resolve X-ray microcalorimeter. The hydrogen-like (Ly$\alpha$) and helium-like (He$\alpha$) lines reveal three velocity components. Two of them are broadened with maximum velocities of 2000-3000 km/s, likely originating from the post-shock companion wind. The other is relatively narrow, with a Gaussian broadening of only  290 km/s in 1 sigma, which may originate from the post-shock companion wind at the WWC stagnation point or penetrating the primary wind. The iron fluorescent lines exhibit a moderate blueshift and broadening with velocities at 100-200 km/s, consistent with the primary wind's velocity field. The spectra also confirm a Compton shoulder of the He$\alpha$ line complex for the first time. Both fluorescing and scattering spectral profiles indicate that the binary system is seen from the companion side during these observations. The flux ratio of the Compton scattering emission to the fluorescent line suggests substantial hydrogen depletion of the primary wind, expected from CNO-cycled hydrogen nuclear fusion gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadows of Giants: Constraints on Stupendously Large Black Holes from Negative Sources against the Cosmic Microwave Background</a><span class="id">[2602.22587]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stupendously large astrophysical black holes (SLABs) are hypothetical black holes with masses of more than a trillion Suns. Because observable consequences of their existence have only recently been seriously considered, there have been relatively few constraints on their abundance. This work motivates a simple yet powerful constraint on SLABs: their huge shadows are visible against the cosmic microwave background. SLABs could thus appear as negative sources in microwave data. In fact, the shadow of a SLAB with a fixed mass becomes easier to detect with increasing redshifts past $1.6$. The limits are powerful enough to rule out SLABs of mass $\gtrsim 10^{17}\ M_{\odot}$ within the last scattering surface, and imply $\Omega_{BH} \lesssim 10^{-5}$ for masses $10^{15}$–$10^{18}\ M_{\odot}$. I also discuss the effects of accretion and their implications for the limits: SLAB growth, positive accretion luminosity, and obscuring material.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Multi-Diagnostic Observational Framework for Magnetosonic Solitary Waves During Geomagnetic Storms in Solar Cycles 24 and 25 using Cluster II Mission</a><span class="id">[2602.22614]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solitary structures, commonly known as solitons, are a class of nonlinear plasma waves that are abundantly found in near-Earth plasmas and planetary magnetospheres. They are nonlinear, localized plasma waves that maintain their shape and velocity over time and distance. While their occurrence in various space plasma environments has been extensively reported, their observation during geomagnetic storms, large-scale disturbances driven by interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, remains limited. In this study, we present a comparative investigation of magnetosonic soliton signatures during geomagnetic storms associated with Solar Cycles 24 and 25. Using high-resolution in-situ magnetic field measurements from the Cluster II mission, we systematically examine the plasma conditions favorable for soliton generation and their evolution during storm-time dynamics. A comprehensive multi-diagnostic observational framework, incorporating several state-of-the-art analytical techniques, is developed to reliably detect and characterize magnetosonic solitons. The results demonstrate that solitary structures in both storms predominantly occur during the early storm intervals, prior to the main phase, suggesting that they may serve as potential precursor signatures of enhanced geomagnetic activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST-DECO: Temporal Variations in the Mid-IR Silicate Features of Two T Tauri Discs Based on Spitzer and JWST observations</a><span class="id">[2602.22615]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mid-infrared spectra of planet-forming discs commonly show prominent silicate emission, whose spectral shape is sensitive to the disc temperature distribution as well as its mineralogical composition. We report new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the discs around Sz 96 and IP Tau and find that their silicate emission significantly changes in the 20 years since they were observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). Significant differences between the SST and JWST spectra are found for both sources, with flux variations of 10–15\% in Sz 96 and 30–35\% in IP Tau. Sz 96 dimmed at $\le$ 18 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ and did not change significantly at longer wavelengths, whereas IP Tau became brighter across the entire wavelength range, with a particularly strong enhancement around 10 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ in the JWST data compared to the SST data. We propose that this large degree of variability is explained by structural changes in the inner regions of the discs. Specifically, we also find that crystalline silicates exhibit lower temperatures than amorphous silicates in the JWST data of both sources. This result supports the idea that crystalline grains, formed through high-temperature annealing in the inner disc regions, have been transported outward, leading to their presence in cooler regions of the disc. While similar behavior had been reported in previous SST-based studies, the much higher spectral resolution of JWST enables clearer identification of the crystalline features.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22641" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universality in Space Time $ω$ modes of Quarkyonic Stars</a><span class="id">[2602.22641]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The gravitational wave $\omega$ mode spectrum presents a unique window into the dense interior of neutron stars, probing physics inaccessible to electromagnetic observations. This work investigates the $\omega$ modes of compact stars composed of quarkyonic matter. The quarkyonic model, which describes a cross-over transition between nucleonic and quark matter treated as quasi-particles, is formulated within the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) theory using the G3 and IOPB-I parameterizations. This core is surrounded by a mantle of hadronic matter, creating a multicomponent stellar interior. The overall Equation of State (EOS) is governed by two key parameters: the transition density ($n_t$), the QCD confinement scale ($\Lambda_{\rm cs}$), which are varied to construct models consistent with current astrophysical constraints on mass and radius. We compute the complex eigenfrequencies (damped oscillations) of the fundamental and first excited $\omega$ modes using the phase-amplitude method within a full general relativistic framework. Our simulations reveal that the admixed quarkyonic structure produces a unique $\omega$ mode signature, distinctly different from pure hadronic or hybrid stars. The spectrum exhibits a strong, degenerate dependence on the EOS, where the stiffening effect of the quarkyonic matter influences oscillation frequencies and damping times in a characteristic manner. We also demonstrate that $\omega$ mode frequencies for quarkyonic stars follow approximate universal relations, largely independent of the EOS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relativistic Tidal Dissipation and the Gravitational-wave Signal of a White Dwarf Orbiting an Intermediate-Mass Black Hole</a><span class="id">[2602.22688]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Finding intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and measuring their masses and spins are key to understanding massive black hole formation. White dwarf (WD)-IMBH binaries provide a unique probe because they emit both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves (GWs), thereby conveying richer information. However, such multi-messenger sources often enter the regime of strong gravity, where existing models fail to capture their relativistic dynamics. Here, we develop a fully relativistic model for the tidal response of a WD close to an IMBH and use it to study the secular orbital evolution as well as the GW signal. We find that for IMBHs more massive than 10^5 solar masses, tidal interaction becomes relativistic and sensitive to IMBH spin. The interaction generally dissipates binary orbital energy and angular momentum, but due to relativistic frame rotation, which reduces phase coherence across pericenter passages, the orbit-averaged tidal dissipation rate can be suppressed by up to about 50% relative to Newtonian predictions. Including tidal dissipation leads to more rapid damping of the orbital eccentricity, to the extent that the pericenter distance may even increase over time, potentially explaining quasi-periodic eruptions and secular orbital period growth. Such tidal effects accumulate into measurable phase and amplitude deviations in the GW signal. For typical space-based observations, the GW waveform mismatch can reach values of order 0.1 within 6 months. Our results indicate that relativistic tidal dissipation is both dynamically important and observationally essential for reliably predicting the multi-messenger signals of WD-IMBH systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(1+1)-Dimensional Schrödinger-Poisson equation with contact interaction</a><span class="id">[2602.22795]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the role of contact interactions in the dynamics of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) modeled through the Schrödinger-Poisson equation in one spatial dimension. While the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm successfully explains structure formation on large scales, its small-scale predictions remain in tension with observations. FDM offers an alternative framework, where local self-interactions can further influence the formation and evolution of structures. We explore both attractive and repulsive contact interactions in static and expanding backgrounds. Using numerical simulations, we examine their impact on three key scenarios: the properties of the lowest-energy stationary solution, the relaxation of localized initial states, and the gravitational collapse of nonlocalized states. Our results show that contact interactions modify the density profile of the stationary solution and affect the onset of characteristic stages of gravitational collapse, particularly the shell-crossing event. In the (1+1) model, we confirm that relaxation does not converge to the lowest-energy stationary solution, even when local self-interactions are included. Taken together, local self-interactions play a relevant role in shaping the nonlinear dynamics of FDM and motivate further studies in higher-dimensional and cosmologically realistic settings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistical Study of Rapid Blue Excursions as Mass Conduits in Solar Atmosphere</a><span class="id">[2602.22811]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rapid Blue Excursions (RBEs) are transient blue-shifted chromospheric absorption features widely interpreted as the on-disk counterparts of Type II solar spicules. We investigate their dynamic properties using high-cadence spectral observations combined with automated detection and spatio-temporal tracking algorithms. RBEs were identified through blue-wing Doppler asymmetry criteria and tracked using spatial connectivity and centroid continuity methods to determine lifetimes and kinematic evolution. The statistical analysis shows that RBEs are short-lived events with lifetimes predominantly between 20 to 60 s and a mean duration of approximately 75 s. The lifetime distribution follows an exponential decay profile, indicative of impulsive driving. Line-of-sight velocities range from 20 to 140 km s-1, with a mean near 26 km s-1. Projected lengths span 1.2-5.5 Mm with sub-arcsecond widths, and recurrence analysis reveals repeated activity at localized magnetic footpoints.

Using high-quality Gaia DR3 spectra and a reference set of spectra from the literature consisting exclusively of asteroids with robust spectroscopic taxonomic types, we construct a principal-component (PC) representation of the Gaia reflectances. For each major spectral complex (C, S, X) and several end-member classes (B, D, A, L, K, V), we model the distribution of reference objects in PC space using multivariate kernel density estimation (KDE). This yields likelihoods for each spectral class and provides a quantitative measure of classification confidence. Validation against a sample of objects with known spectral classes demonstrates good performance for classes with distinctive reflectance signatures, including the S-complex, D, V, and A types. Spectrally continuous classes (B-C-complex, K-L-S-complex, and X-complex) show the expected degrees of mixing given the limited wavelength range of Gaia's spectrophotometry. We further explore the compositional structure of six major asteroid collisional families using our Gaia-derived spectral classes, finding excellent agreement with ground-based spectroscopy and revealing enhanced detections of olivine-rich A type material in the Flora and Eunomia families, as well as new insights into the spectral diversity of the Tirela family. The resulting catalogue constitutes a fully probabilistic taxonomic classification for the full Gaia DR3 asteroid sample. It offers a resource for studying the compositional structure of the main belt, identifying family interlopers, and linking asteroid populations to meteorite groups, and establishes a methodological framework for future Gaia releases, in particular for the validation of the Gaia DR4, expected by the end of 2026.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22824" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black hole Limits Redefined: Extreme Efficiency in Black Hole Jets</a><span class="id">[2602.22824]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Relativistic jets from black holes can extract energy not only from accretion but also directly from the black hole's spin, as described by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. A longstanding question is whether magnetic flux can accumulate near the event horizon to such an extent that it halts accretion entirely, enabling energy extraction purely from spin. Previous studies have shown that accretion persists through instabilities and that jet power only modestly exceeds the accretion energy budget, yet some observational results suggest much higher efficiencies. Here we present state-of-the-art general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations that sustain a quasi-steady magnetically arrested disk state for approximately 10,000 dynamical times, during which accretion is globally suppressed across the full azimuthal extent. In this regime, jet power exceeds the accretion energy input by more than two orders of magnitude, demonstrating a previously unachieved level of efficiency. These results challenge conventional assumptions about the limits of black hole energy extraction and suggest a new framework for interpreting powerful jet systems. Our findings raise important questions about the long-term stability of such states and the fundamental limits of the Blandford-Znajek process.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22830" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Atmospheres of Young Long-Period Sub-Neptune Progenitors with ELT/ANDES</a><span class="id">[2602.22830]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) has emerged as a powerful technique for detecting and characterizing exoplanet atmospheres from the ground. While it has been highly successful for ultra-hot Jupiters and hot Jupiters, next-generation facilities such as ELT/ANDES will extend its reach to smaller and longer-period planets, including young sub-Neptunes and their progenitors. We investigate whether HRCCS with ELT/ANDES can robustly recover orbital parameters and atmospheric signals of the long-period sub-Neptunes V1298Taub and TOI-451c. For such systems, the slow Doppler drift of the planetary signal over a single night reduces its separation from stationary telluric contamination, increasing the risk of signal removal while detrending. We therefore quantify the impact of including out-of-transit exposures on signal recovery and parameter estimation. We simulate transmission observations in the YJH bands using the Ratri pipeline and analyze them with the HRCCS framework Upamana. For V1298Taub, we inject atmospheric signals consistent with HST, Spitzer, and JWST constraints. For TOI-451c, we explore models spanning sub-solar to super-solar C/O ratios to assess compositional sensitivity. We find that incorporating out-of-transit exposures significantly enhances detectability, provided that the detrending effects are consistently propagated to the template models prior to cross-correlation. Without this reprocessing step, recovered orbital parameters can deviate substantially from injected values or yield reduced detection significance. For V1298Tau b, &gt;5$\sigma$ detections of H2O, H2S, and CO are achievable within $\lesssim$10 hours ( 2 nights). For TOI-451c, distinguishing sub-solar from super-solar C/O ratios requires $\geq$18 hours. HRCCS with ELT/ANDES will therefore be a key tool for probing the atmospheric diversity of young, long-period sub-Neptunes in the ELT era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of circumstellar disks around nearby young brown dwarf candidates</a><span class="id">[2602.22832]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is important to detect and study circumstellar disks around late-M and brown dwarfs of nearby young associations to understand how these very low-mass objects form and how rocky planets form around them. The detection of new very low-mass members of nearby young associations will also significantly improve our current understanding of young associations. We searched for new young very low-mass members with circumstellar disks in a sample of 3928 candidates. We constructed spectral energy distributions of all candidates using observational photometric data from DENIS, 2MASS, and WISE and trigonometric parallaxes from Gaia to detect infrared excess emission that indicates the presence of circumstellar disks. We then followed up spectroscopic observations of candidates to search for lithium to confirm their youth. The H_alpha emission line was used to detect accretion. We detected 23 among the 3928 candidates with circumstellar disks: Ten objects are new, and 13 were previously reported in the literature. Our mass estimates also indicate that 21 are brown dwarf candidates and 2 are very low-mass stars. DENIS J0534552-104808 has a Gaia distance of 238 pc and might be the first brown dwarf candidate member of a foreground population in front of the Orion D cloud. This foreground population is probably associated with the supergiant kappa Ori. Based on our spectroscopic observations, we detected lithium in 11 candidates. We also identified seven accretors and one potential accretor. The intense long-lived accretion detected in DENIS-P J0500245-333042, a 20 Myr old brown dwarf candidate may be additional evidence to favor the formation of rocky planets around very low-mass objects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redshift evolution of the Hubble constant: Constraints and new insights from an interacting dark energy model</a><span class="id">[2602.22840]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a modified interacting dark energy (IDE) model to study the redshift evolution of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), in light of the Hubble tension.

We evaluate the model against a comprehensive suite of observations, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2 and SDSS, cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon sample, and Planck CMB distance priors. Analysis of late-Universe data yields $\alpha = 0.0107^{+0.0032}_{-0.011}$, with the best-fit value on the order of $10^{-2}$, revealing a decreasing trend of $H_0$ with redshift. This supports a power-law evolution beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Incorporating CMB data further tightens the constraint to the order of $10^{-5}$, which we attribute to the suppression of dark-sector interactions at high redshifts, a consequence of the strong baryon–photon coupling.

Since light r-process elements shape the early ($\sim$0.5-1.5$\mathrm{d}$) ejecta opacity, a detailed study of the selenium element with a focus on atomic data calculation, expansion opacity estimation and spectral analysis is presented. Se atomic data are calculated from Se I to Se X using the GRASP2018 code. A systematic analysis and evaluation of their precision is performed through detailed comparison with the NIST ASD, and other works available in the literature. These atomic data are then used to estimate expansion opacity at different temperatures (e.g., T=5000 K, 10000 K, 20000 K, 100000 K) and densities (e.g., $\rho = 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}},\,3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$). Spectral analysis has been performed with radiative transfer code POSSIS with a pre-computed opacity grid calculated with new densities and temperatures, ranging from -19.5 to -4.5 $\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$ in log-scale and from 1 000 to 51 000 K, respectively. Two scenarios are considered: one in which the opacity contribution comes from 100\% Se ejecta, and another in which Se contributes only partially to the total opacity ($\sim$ 10\% of the total mass). Se atomic calculations show a good agreement with NIST ASD, with accurate energy levels and transitions determined alongside atomic data for higher ionisation stages not fully covered by NIST. The expansion opacities calculated with these new Se data exhibit differences in comparison to existing literature works. Se spectral features can only be observed in the KN scenario consisting of 100\% Se. When Se accounts for about 10\% of the total KN mass, these features become undetectable. All Se results are now available in the new open-source MARTINI platform dedicated to element nucleosynthesis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulse-resolved Classification and Characteristics of Long-duration GRBs with \emph{Swift}-BAT Data.II. Main Burst versus Extended Emission</a><span class="id">[2602.22926]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) frequently exhibit complex prompt emission structures with multiple temporally distinct episodes, such as a main emission (ME) phase followed by a weak extended emission (EE) tail. Whether these subcomponents from a common physical origin with similar classification properties, or instead represent fundamentally different emission mechanisms within a single event, remains an open question. Here, we present a systematic, pulse-resolved analysis of 22 \emph{Swift}/BAT long-duration GRBs, each exhibiting a well-separated, bright ME ($G_1$) followed by a fainter EE ($G_2$) after a background-consistent quiescent gap. For each component, we independently measure standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), spectral hardness ratio (HR), minimum variability timescale (MVT), and spectral lag. We then compare these properties between the ME and EE within individual bursts. We find that the EE is systematically softer (lower HR in 19 of 22 events), smoother (longer MVT in 17 of 22 events), and more diverse in spectral lag than the ME. However, both components still occupy the long-GRB track in the traditional duration-hardness and duration-MVT planes, indicating a common Type II (collapsar) origin. These results suggest that the EE in long GRBs represents a physically distinct regime of the central engine, characterized by a lower luminosity, longer emission timescales, and evolved spectral properties, rather than a simple continuation of the main burst. This picture is consistent with late-time fallback accretion onto a black hole or proto-magnetar spin-down.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Evolution of Nulling in Pulsars</a><span class="id">[2602.22956]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nulling is a phenomenon where the emission from a pulsar becomes undetectable (or significantly weaker) for a relatively short period of time, followed by a return to a normal emission state. The timescale of nulling ranges from a few pulse periods to many hours or even days. The fraction of time a nulling pulsar spends in a null state varies across the population of canonical pulsars, from 0 to 95 per cent. The long-term behaviour of a pulsar's nulling fraction, however, is currently unknown, as published values have typically been obtained through single observations. Here, we present the first long-term analysis of nulling behaviour in eight pulsars observed in the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey over the course of eight to ten years. We also apply a new Bayesian method for pulse-energy analysis, yielding posterior estimates of the nulling fraction per observation. In several cases, the nulling affects only specific components of the pulse profile, rather than the entirety of the emission. Our analysis reveals that, while most pulsars show no significant trend in their nulling fraction over time, a subset exhibit some evidence for non-zero gradients in nulling fraction. In particular, PSRs J1048$-$3832, J1745$-$3040, and J1825$-$0935 show statistically significant trends over the span of the data. Studying the behaviour of nulling over years and decades is valuable as it can provide insights into the physical emission processes within pulsars. Studying how nulling evolves also provides valuable insights into pulsar evolution and the characterisation of the broader pulsar population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eating planets makes you younger: The magnetic dynamo rejuvenation of GJ 504 by planetary engulfment</a><span class="id">[2602.22979]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the discovery of a few thousand exoplanets, questions have been raised regarding star-planet interactions and whether the presence of a companion may affect stellar properties. GJ 504 is an evolved (2 Gyr) Sun-like star with a short rotation period (3.4 d) and an intense magnetic activity, which is in stark contrast with what would be expected at such an evolutionary stage. One possible explanation is that a close-in, Jupiter-mass planet was pushed starwards by the action of stellar tides, inducing a stellar spin-up and ultimately a rejuvenation of the stellar magnetic dynamo. By characterising the large-scale magnetic field and magnetised wind of GJ 504, we aim to provide additional observational constraints to test such scenario. We analysed spectropolarimetric observations of GJ 504 collected with ESPaDOnS. Using Zeeman-Doppler imaging, we found a large-scale, dipolar, non-axisymmetric magnetic field with an average strength of 5.3 G, similar to that of evolved early-G type stars. We fed the magnetic field information into our 3D MHD simulation of the stellar wind and space environment of GJ 504, from which we constrained the wind-driven angular momentum loss ($\rm \dot{J}$). We then compared $\rm \dot{J}$ to rotational evolutionary tracks of GJ 504 for two scenarios: evolution with and without the engulfment of a close-in, Jupiter-mass companion. Between the two scenarios, only the planet engulfment can explain the observational constraints obtained previously in the literature, such as the stellar rotation and X-ray luminosity, and the $\rm \dot{J}$ we derived and rescaled to account for underestimated magnetic field strength. Although there are many other stars with similar masses and rotation periods whose rotation evolution does not require planet engulfment, we also identified HD 75332 as a candidate for planet engulfment, suggesting that GJ 504 may not be an isolated case.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energy Deposition by Galactic Cosmic Rays and Implications for Ozone Chemistry</a><span class="id">[2602.22987]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a Monte Carlo study of galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) energy deposition and its implications for stratospheric chemistry, performed with the Geant4 toolkit.

The simulations resolve the variation of energy deposition with altitude for primary and secondary particles, revealing that $\sim$ 96\% of the stratospheric energy budget arises from cascade secondaries within the 15–35 km domain. By converting layer-resolved energy deposition into ion pair production rates, we quantify the resulting formation of odd nitrogen (NO$_{\rm x}$) and odd hydrogen (HO$_{\rm x}$) radicals, which catalyze the destruction of ozone. The modeled production rates peak between 18 and 22 km altitude, leading to an estimated fractional ozone decrease of order $10^{-3}$–$10^{-2}$ under average GCR fluxes, consistent with observed background modulation over the solar cycle.

We thus calculate the sensitivity of voids to the nature of dark matter (DM), using ultra-light axions as a concrete model and the ongoing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and \textit{Euclid} galaxy surveys as observational settings. We simulate axion effects on voids using mass-peak patch simulations and find that: (i) axions suppress the formation of lower-mass halos leading to the merging of smaller (radius $&lt; 25\,\mathrm{Mpc}/h$) voids into fewer larger (radius $&gt; 25\,\mathrm{Mpc}/h$) voids; and (ii) voids in the presence of axions are emptier of halos, thereby suppressing the void-halo correlation function. These effects strengthen as axion particle mass $m_\mathrm{a}$ decreases. We forecast improvements in axion constraints from the void size function (VSF; the void number density as function of their radius). A \textit{Euclid}-like survey (effective volume of $73\,\mathrm{Gpc}^3$ with a prior on the other $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters from the Simons Observatory cosmic microwave background experiment) can limit the axion energy density (for $m_\mathrm{a} = 10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$) to $&lt; 4.6\%$ of the DM (at $95\%$ credibility), about two times stronger than current limits. Conversely, we show that a Universe with a dark sector consisting of axions at the $10\%$ level, as motivated by the string axiverse, can be recovered with $\sim 2 \sigma$ preference. A DESI-like survey achieves comparable results. Axion and $\Lambda$CDM parameters have different degeneracies given VSF and galaxy power spectrum data, indicating future combined analyses will be most powerful in disentangling the DM nature. We anticipate our results will extend to other (e.g., warm or interacting) DM models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tight bounds on the Mawell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw parameters using Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2602.22996]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate {the arrival time and the Faraday rotation} of extragalactic electromagnetic signals from fast radio bursts (FRBs) propagating through chiral cosmic media within the framework of Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw {(MCFJ)} electrodynamics.

Infrared excesses are identified through SED fitting and validated using conservative, source-by-source checks. This approach yields a final sample of 12 debris disk candidates including ten new detections. Stellar age research indicate that most of the host stars are several billion years old. NEOWISE monitoring reveals no significant W1/W2 variability, consistent with a circumstellar origin of the infrared excess. while a search for co-moving companions using Gaia DR3 reveals possible companions for only two candidates at very large projected separations ($\gtrsim 10^4$ au). Three candidates exhibit excess emission in both the W3 and W4 bands, allowing estimates of characteristic dust properties.

This process governs the star's mass assembly, the transfer of angular momentum, and the shaping of the protoplanetary disc, thereby influencing planet formation. For classical T Tauri stars (cTTSs), which are low-mass YSOs, accretion is a well-understood process. Their strong, dipolar magnetic field truncates the disc at a few stellar radii. Material is then channelled along these magnetic field lines, creating accretion funnel flows that fall onto the star's surface. However, this paradigm, known as magnetospheric accretion, is limited to isolated stars. The accretion process in multiple systems has not yet been fully understood. This work is part of a series of studies designed to build a framework to understand the accretion process in multiple star systems. The specific goal here is to determine how the magnetospheric accretion model can be used to describe DF Tau, a binary system where only the primary star is accreting material. To investigate how accretion occurs in a system where a single star is orbited by a non-accreting stellar companion, we used a time series of high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations from the ESPaDOnS instrument. This allowed us to study the accretion-related emission line variability, the veiling, and the magnetic field topology of the primary star in the system. Our research concludes that the primary star of the DF Tau system undergoes typical magnetospheric accretion. This process is driven by a strong dipolar magnetic field, which funnels accreting material onto the stellar surface, creating an accretion shock. We also identified a significant difference in the magnetic topology of the two stars querying the influence of accretion of the evolution of the magnetic field, or capture of the secondary star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Correlated residuals in Tully-Fisher and Fundamental Plane relations and their impact on peculiar velocity measurements</a><span class="id">[2602.23033]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Tully-Fisher (TF) and Fundamental Plane (FP) relations are widely used to infer extragalactic distances and peculiar velocities, enabling measurements of large-scale velocity statistics and cosmological parameters. Using the Millennium-TNG hydrodynamical simulation, we assess the accuracy of these methods in the presence of realistic galaxy formation physics. We find that, while the 2-point statistics of velocities are reliably inferred on scales larger than $\sim10\,\hMpc$, significant systematic deviations arise on smaller scales. These deviations originate from spatially correlated residuals in the TF and FP relations, driven by correlations between galaxy structural properties, star-formation history, and the local environment. As a result, TF- and FP-inferred velocity fields exhibit spurious correlations with the galaxy density field that cannot be explained by random scatter alone. We show that extending the TF and FP relations to include additional galaxy properties – such as star formation rate, gas mass, and stellar mass – mitigate these environmental correlations, particularly for late-type galaxies. Our results demonstrate that galaxy formation physics induces significant systematics in peculiar velocity measurements on non-linear scales, and that neglecting these effects may bias cosmological analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The LOFAR sub-arcsecond view of the high-redshift radio relic in PSZ2G091.83+26.11</a><span class="id">[2602.23046]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Enhanced inverse Compton (IC) losses at high redshift steepen diffuse radio spectra in galaxy clusters, making low-frequency ( 100 MHz) observations favorable. However, low-frequency studies often lack the resolution needed to locate particle acceleration sites or separate diffuse emission from radio galaxies. In this paper, we unveil the properties of the radio relic in the distant cluster PSZ2G091.83+26.11 (z=0.822) by resolving the acceleration site and inspecting the downstream region. Using the European LOFAR (ILT) at 145 MHz, we study a radio relic at (sub-)arcsecond resolution for the first time below 1 GHz, complemented by arcsecond-resolution VLA data at higher frequencies. We confirm the diffuse emission is not a radio galaxy. A spectral index gradient toward the cluster center matches previous 5” maps. High-resolution 0.4” and 1.9” images reveal emission ahead of the shock, connecting the relic to a radio galaxy. 1.9” profiles across the downstream at 145 MHz and 3.0 GHz follow a log-normal magnetic field distribution. The 145 MHz shock surface shows a sharp discontinuity at the same location of a change in electron density, Rotation Measure, and fractional polarization, likely tied to magnetic field changes. Finally, we find hints of redshift evolution of the radio power versus cluster mass correlation. The impressive angular resolution achievable by the LOFAR long baselines is opening an unprecedented view of the low energetic plasma in galaxy clusters. This is extremely significant in the case of high-redshift clusters, where radio emission at low frequencies is less affected by energy losses but its detection is strongly limited by poor resolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for low-mass stars with magnetically-induced hyper-inflated radii</a><span class="id">[2602.23147]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Precise empirical estimates of stellar radii have revealed that the radii of certain low-mass stars are inflated relative to stellar structure predictions: the largest inflations occur in magnetically active stars. Theoretically, the radii of magnetically active stars are in some cases found to be 'hyper-inflated' to roughly double the radius of a non-magnetic star with equal mass. Here we ask, do data exist which could allow us to search for empirical evidence in support of hyper-inflated stars? A photometric study of 44 eclipsing binaries in the Kepler field by Cruz et al. may help us in our search. The Cruz et al. study, although subject to large uncertainties, hints at the presence of hyper-inflation in some of the 88 stars in their sample. Their data enable us to set theoretical limits on the maximum strength Bc of magnetic fields inside their sample stars. According to our magneto-convective model, the average empirical inflations found from analysis of the Cruz et al. data can be replicated if Bc approx. 10 kG inside stars with masses greater than   0.6 MSun. On the other hand, in stars with masses less than about 0.4 MSun, our model predicts that the average empirical inflations of the stars may approach hyper-inflated status. Such stars may require significantly stronger internal fields, i.e. Bc approx. 100-300 kG. High-resolution spectroscopy of the Kepler binaries could help to confirm or refute our conclusions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sulfur fractionation in coronal plumes as observed by Solar Orbiter/SPICE</a><span class="id">[2602.23170]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronal plumes are bright, narrow structures rooted in coronal holes that contribute to the solar wind. Their composition, particularly elemental fractionation as a function of first ionization potential (FIP), provides diagnostics of plasma properties and magnetic connectivity. Earlier plume studies of fractionation using low-FIP elements reached conflicting conclusions. Intermediate-FIP elements may provide additional diagnostic insight, since their fractionation is thought to involve processes beyond those affecting low-FIP species. We investigate sulfur (intermediate-FIP element) in plumes to assess the presence of fractionation, its evolution, and its relation to wave activity. We analyzed Solar Orbiter observations of two plumes in an equatorial coronal hole during March–April 2024, using Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) to derive the sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio. EUV imaging and magnetograms provided additional context. Data were processed with the open-source Python tool Spectral Analysis Fitting Framework and Reduction of Noise (SAFFRON). Both plumes showed sulfur fractionation that remained constant within uncertainties. The fractionated plasma was co-located with strong magnetic footpoints, in contrast with the surrounding interplume plasma. These results provide the evidence for sulfur fractionation in plumes and suggest, consistent with the ponderomotive force model, wave dynamics in the chromosphere as a driver.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The extremely low-luminosity Type Iax SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx</a><span class="id">[2602.23175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the optical follow-up of SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx, two examples from the Iax subclass of thermonuclear supernova (SN) events. With peak absolute magnitudes of $M_\mathrm{V} = -13.7$ and $-14.4$ mag, respectively, both objects belong to the extremely low-luminosity (EL) population of the class. A common origin of SNe in the Iax subclass is still under debate since the distribution of certain observables may indicate that the extremely low-luminosity explosions form a distinct population. We aim to estimate the physical properties of the two EL objects, including mapping the ejecta structure. We perform spectral tomography on the spectral series of SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx around their maxima to map the physical properties of the ejecta. Together with the analysis of BgVriz photometry, a wide range of observables can be studied to investigate their distribution against luminosity. The constrained chemical abundances of the ejecta are compared to the predictions of the hydrodynamic simulations with similar peak luminosities. Constant abundances provide a good match for the distribution of chemical elements for both SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx. The discrepancies compared to the least luminous pure deflagration model N5def_hybrid are minor, especially at post-maximum epochs. The two SNe also share similar characteristics in their constrained density structures, as well as the evolution of the photosphere. The analysis supports the assumption that pure deflagration models can reproduce the main characteristics of SNe Iax, even for the EL population. The presented indirect observational evidence indicates that these objects show similar intrinsic properties to the relatively luminous Iax sample and fit into the velocity distribution of the subclass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23195" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Lorentz-Covariant Spectral Universality of Stochastic Fields</a><span class="id">[2602.23195]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive a Lorentz-covariant spectral universality for stationary stochastic fields in Minkowski spacetime.

For constant fields, we derive exact probabilities and identify a perturbative plateau regime where photon survival scales as quartic order of magnetic field, isolating the four-point magnetic correlation as a sensitive probe of non-Gaussianity. For Gaussian stochastic fields, we obtain–for the first time–analytical formulas for non-exponential-decay components in the strong-attenuation regime. Contrary to the widely used domain-like model, photon survival is suppressed by 4-6 orders of magnitude, while both conversion and survival probabilities exhibit distinct multi-peak structures from mass-equal resonance, stochastic resonance, and EBL attenuation. Extending to non-Gaussian fields, we show that non-Gaussianity can enhance photon survival by several orders of magnitude relative to the Gaussian case, potentially explaining the unexpectedly VHE photon event observed by LHAASO. Our results demonstrate that stochastic magnetic fields cannot be reduced to domain-like coherence without losing essential physics, and that VHE gamma-ray spectra encode observable information about both the power spectrum and non-Gaussian structure of intergalactic magnetic fields–critical as next-generation observatories push toward PeV sensitivities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elevated Eccentricities in the Radius Valley Hint at Water-Rich Mini-Neptunes</a><span class="id">[2602.23250]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While recent planet-formation models broadly reproduce the observed population of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, as well as the bimodal radius distribution (the “radius valley”), it remains unclear whether all these planets share a common rocky composition (a single popoulation of planets) or instead comprise two distinct populations – rocky planets and icy planets (two populations of planets). The inferred eccentricity-radius relation, which shows a modest peak near the radius valley, provides a useful diagnostic for distinguishing between these scenarios. Here we use N-body simulations to examine how the radii and eccentricities of close-in planets depend on the masses and orbital configurations of their progenitor protoplanets. We find that final planetary eccentricities scale with the system initial Safronov number. In two-population systems, energy equipartition between rocky and relatively more massive icy protoplanets creates a strong eccentricity contrast between the two groups, which appears as a peak near the radius valley. This signature does not appear if planetary systems are composed exclusively of rocky planets (with or without H-rich atmospheres), as assumed in photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss models. Because the eccentricity-radius relation traces a dichotomy in the underlying protoplanet mass distribution – most plausibly arising from formation at different disk locations – our results suggest that a significant fraction of mini-Neptunes are water-worlds. The observed radius and eccentricity distributions may reflect a mixture of systems that host exclusively rocky planets, systems dominated by icy planets, and systems with both rocky and icy planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal Synchronization of Binaries in Pleiades</a><span class="id">[2602.23251]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal interactions in close binaries play a key role in the long-term rotational and orbital evolution. The distributions of circularization across open clusters (OCs) place strong observational constraints on tidal dissipation in binaries. However, direct observational constraints on synchronization among binaries in OCs remain limited. For the 125 Myr OC Pleiades, this work combines cluster membership from Gaia Data Release 3, rotation periods from the K2 mission, and orbital solutions of the binary population from a long-term spectroscopic survey, to investigate the degree of tidal synchronization in each binary by comparing the pseudo-synchronization period to the rotation period of the primary stars. Among 42 binaries with reliable orbital periods Porb and rotation periods, we identify seven tidally synchronized systems with Porb &lt; 8.6 days, including one early-type system and six late-type systems. For binaries with longer Porb, primaries generally are super-synchronized, and most systems are eccentric. We find a synchronization transition near Porb   8.6-14 days, comparable to the known circularization period (Porb   7.2 days) in the Pleiades, which suggests similar critical period scales for synchronization and circularization in this coeval population. Synchronization depends much more strongly on mass ratio than on primary mass. Most synchronized systems in Pleiades have high mass ratios and are likely to evolve into double white dwarf systems. Tides likely impose strong rotational braking on close early-type binaries, while their influence on late-type close binaries is weaker, and their spins largely follow the single-star sequence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A White Dwarf Tidal Disruption by an Intermediate-Mass Black Hole as the Progenitor of Ultra-long GRB 250702B</a><span class="id">[2602.23299]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recent detection of GRB 250702B, the longest gamma-ray burst observed to date with prompt emission lasting $\sim 2.5\times 10^4$ seconds, challenges the conventional collapsar model.

Here we show that these multiwavelength signatures can be consistently explained by a relativistic jet powered by successive partial tidal disruptions of a white dwarf (WD) by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). By modeling the time-dependent accretion rate from repeated partial disruptions and the resulting jet evolution, we show that the external forward and reverse shocks account for the long-term X-ray, near-infrared, and radio afterglow, whereas the luminous X-ray flare originates from internal energy dissipation caused by collisions between fast and slow relativistic ejecta associated with the final complete disruption. Our findings establish IMBH-WD tidal disruption events as a viable engine for ultra-long GRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23309" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A precessing jet from a supermassive black hole: multi-wavelength observations of S5 1044+71</a><span class="id">[2602.23309]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The bright gamma-ray blazar S5 1044+71 has been identified as showing very significant quasi-periodic oscillations in the Fermi-LAT data in recent studies, with a periodicity of about 3 years. With the completion of a new gamma-ray cycle, we aim to revisit the periodicity in Fermi-LAT data, and analyze all available multi-wavelength (MWL) data to search for possible correlations and time-lags. These observations will be used to test for the compatibility of the observed periodicity with a precessing jet from the supermassive black hole. We analyze data from Fermi-LAT, NuSTAR, Swift, AstroSat, ASAS-SN, ZTF, Pan-STARRS, and NEOWISE. In addition we present an analysis from historical observations from Palomar and Pulkovo. Single-band spectral variability, MWL correlations, and cross-correlations are computed. We then model the Fermi-LAT light curve with a precessing jet model, providing constraints on the geometry of the system and providing the evolution of the Doppler factor with time. The latter is used as input for MWL fitting of the spectral energy distribution. We confirm previous claims on the existence of a periodic gamma-ray signal. We detect significant spectral variability in gamma-ray, X-rays, and optical/UV data. We detect significant correlation between low-energy (infrared/optical/ultraviolet) data and gamma-rays, with a correlation index of about 1; the correlation between X-rays and gamma-ray is milder, with a correlation index of about 0.3. We do not detect any significant time-lag between bands. The Fermi-LAT light curve is successfully fit by a precessing jet model. The fit to the spectral energy distributions indicate that S5 1044+71 is a typical blazar, in which the gamma-ray emission is located beyond the broad-line region.

We have surveyed 8134 mid-to-late M dwarfs observed by TESS with a custom built pipeline and recover 77 vetted transiting planet candidates. We characterize the sensitivity of our survey via injection-recovery and measure the occurrence rate of planets as a function of orbital period, instellation, and planet radius. We measure a cumulative occurrence rate of $1.10\pm0.16$ planets per star with radii $&gt;1\, R_\oplus$ orbiting within 30 days. This value is consistent with the cumulative occurrence rate around early M dwarfs, making M dwarfs collectively the most prolific hosts of small close-in planets. Unlike the bimodal Radius Valley exhibited by close-in planet population around FGK and early M dwarfs, we recover a unimodal planet radius distribution peaking at $1.25\pm0.05 \, R_\oplus$. We additionally find $0.954\pm0.147$ super-Earths and $0.148\pm0.045$ sub-Neptunes per star, with super-Earths outnumbering sub-Neptunes 5.5:1, firmly demonstrating that the Radius Valley disappears around the lowest mass stars. The dearth of sub-Neptunes around mid-to-late M dwarfs is consistent with predictions from water-rich pebble accretion models that predict a fading Radius Valley with decreasing stellar mass. Our results support the emerging idea that the sub-Neptune population around M dwarfs is composed of water-rich worlds. We find no hot Jupiters in our survey and set an upper limit of 0.012 hot Jupiters per mid-to-late M dwarf within 10 days.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21296" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lepton asymmetry leading to baryogenesis by primordial black holes</a><span class="id">[2602.21296]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Baryogenesis remains an unresolved problem in cosmology, with existing mechanisms facing significant caveats. We show that the effects of primordial black holes (PBHs) on neutrinos produce the lepton asymmetry $\sim 10^{-10}$ which subsequently produces the baryon asymmetry. We consider the Dirac Lagrangian in curved spacetime in local coordinates exhibiting Hermitian pseudo-vector and non-Hermitian vector terms. These terms lead to energy splitting between weakly interacting neutrinos and antineutrinos, resulting in their unequal number densities and hence a lepton asymmetry. While the non-Hermitian effect leads to a non-conserved total probability of neutrinos, the leptogenesis due to gravitational effects of a PBH could be significant until the nucleosynthesis era. This in turn produces baryon asymmetry from the symmetry of lepton and baryon numbers via the sphaleron process in the electro-weak era. We show that in the most conservative scenario, the PBHs of mass $\sim 10^{12}$ g and spin $\sim 0.01$ produce the observed baryogenesis at temperature 130 GeV, when such PBHs are available abundantly. However, massive PBHs also could produce the observed asymmetry, assuming the non/anti-Hermitian vector couplings for neutrino and anti-neutrino get canceled from the Lagrangian, leading the system to be Hermitian.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conformal symmetry in force-free electrodynamics</a><span class="id">[2602.22262]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is shown that conformal symmetry exists in force-free electrodynamics (FFE) in Minkowski spacetime, a foundational framework for describing magnetospheres around astronomical objects. In force-free magnetospheres, charges are constrained to move along magnetic field lines and experience zero Lorentz force, due to the everywhere perpendicular orientation of electric and magnetic fields. However, a general angle-preserving conformal mapping of force-free fields does not necessarily produce another physically admissible force-free configuration when sources are present. In this work, we demonstrate that such invariance can nevertheless arise for certain choices of the free functions. Specifically, the governing stream equation is shown to be invariant under Möbius transformations. This symmetry reveals a structural linkage between known solutions and, notably, maps the region inside a magnetospheric horizon (the lightsurface) of one solution to the exterior of its dual counterpart, and vice versa.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22272" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fluctuating polytropic processes, turbulence, and heating</a><span class="id">[2602.22272]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper explores the thermodynamics of fluctuating polytropic processes and their connection to turbulence. It is shown that random fluctuations of polytropic processes produce a nonzero overall heating of a particle system, e.g., solar wind plasma flowing out through the heliosphere; while any nonturbulent heating can be thermodynamically described by typical nonfluctuating polytropic processes, turbulent heating can be thermodynamically described through fluctuating polytropic processes. First, we derive the expression of the overall process and find that polytropic fluctuations lead to heat entering the system even if the respective nonfluctuating process is adiabatic. The temperature of the solar wind plasma protons decreases with heliospheric distance less than the adiabatic cooling, again, similar to when heating enters the system; this subadiabatic cooling is proportional to the variance of the fluctuations. We derive the heliospheric radial profiles of the thermodynamic expressions of the polytropic index, temperature, and heating rates. Then, we show that the analytical profiles of heating of fluctuating polytropic processes and of turbulent heating are identical, suggesting that turbulence heats plasma particle populations by fluctuating their polytropic processes. We apply the thermodynamics of fluctuating polytropic processes to the energy transfer from pickup ions (PUIs) to solar wind plasma protons, and derive the analytical expressions of PUI turbulent and nonturbulent heating rates, which are well fitted to the respective observations. Finally, we apply the thermodynamic model to the radial profile of PUI energy transfer to the solar wind plasma protons, where we derive the portion of PUI turbulent vs. nonturbulent heating rates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Current-carrying string network evolution in an external magnetic field</a><span class="id">[2602.22396]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic strings are topological defects arising in a variety of cosmological scenarios, as the Universe undergoes symmetry-breaking phase transitions, whose discovery would offer valuable insight into the high-energy physics that shaped the early Universe. To interpret such a detection, robust theoretical models are essential. The Velocity-dependent One-Scale (VOS) model is particularly prominent: it self-consistently treats the network as a thermodynamic system, characterizing its key properties, and predicting its large-scale evolution. This has recently been extended to include superconducting cosmic strings, which carry additional degrees of freedom, giving rise to the Charge-Velocity dependent One-Scale (CVOS) model. One limitation of the latter model is that it only included loss mechanisms for the charge and current. Here, we extend this model by phenomenologically including a possible energy source mechanism, specifically by allowing current-carrying strings interactions with an external magnetic field. We discuss how this coupling impacts the network's evolution, present and classify the physically allowed scaling solutions for this extended CVOS model, and comment on the different impacts of the external magnetic field on the evolution of the network's charge and current. Under our modeling assumptions, one of the ten physically plausible scaling solution enables the network to gain energy by this mechanism.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22418" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anomalous cosmic rays within the inner heliosphere: Observations of helium by the High Energy Telescope onboard Solar Orbiter</a><span class="id">[2602.22418]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radial gradients of cosmic rays are key parameters for understanding the transport of particles in space.

The two double-ended high energy telescopes(HET)onboard the Solar Orbiter measure energetic particles in the energy range between a few MeV/nuc and a few hundred MeV/nuc, which are dominated by anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) during solar quiet times. By obtaining the radial gradient of the ACR helium in the inner heliosphere, we advance our understanding of how the transport of the cosmic rays is affected by the particle drift effect and the large-scale magnetic field. The helium observations at Solar Orbiter/HET between 11.1 and 49 MeV/nuc are analyzed. Since we focus on quiet time measurements, we remove the periods of solar energetic particle (SEP) events. The intensities are averaged over the Carrington rotation period. The helium observations from the Proton and Helium Instrument(EPHIN)onboard SOHO were utilized as the baseline to correct the long-term variation caused by the solar modulations. We present the first observation of ACR helium at Solar Orbiter/HET between 2020 February and 2022 July in the inner heliosphere before the sun became fully active. We derive the radial gradient of the ACR helium between 0.3 and 1 au. The averaged radial gradient between 11.1 and 49MeV/nuc is about 22$\pm$4%/au and the averaged value between 11.1 and 41.2MeV/nuc is raised to 32$\pm$8%/au after removing the GCR contribution, which is estimated by a GCR model.

For scalar-vector coupling differences $0.15 \lesssim x_{\sigma\Delta} - x_{\omega\Delta} \lesssim 0.2$ and $x_{\sigma\Delta} \gtrsim 1.3$, the onset of $\Delta^-$ resonances produces a van der Waals-like instability driven by a self-amplifying feedback in the scalar meson sector, in which the $\Delta^-$ particle fraction acts as the order parameter of a Landau-type transition. A Maxwell construction yields a sharp density discontinuity at baryon densities $n_b \sim (1.3$-$2)\,n_0$, separating a $\Delta$-free outer core from a $\Delta$-rich inner core. The resulting neutron-star sequences satisfy all current multimessenger constraints: maximum masses $M_{\rm max} \approx 2.15$-$2.25\,M_\odot$, radii $R_{1.4} \approx 11$-$12$ km, and tidal deformabilities $\Lambda_{1.4} \approx 190$-$480$, compatible with NICER observations and GW170817. We compute, for the first time for a $\Delta$-induced interface, the $\ell = 2$ composition $g$-mode eigenfrequencies, obtaining $\nu_g \sim 400$-$1100$ Hz with gravitational-wave damping times $\tau_g \sim 10^3$-$10^9$ s. These frequencies overlap quantitatively with those predicted for hadron-quark phase-transition interfaces, demonstrating that the mass-radius “knee”, reduced tidal deformability, and $g$-mode spectrum conventionally regarded as signatures of quark deconfinement can be reproduced by a purely intrahadronic mechanism. This extends the masquerade problem from static observables to the domain of gravitational-wave asteroseismology, implying that a future detection of a discontinuity $g$-mode alone would not suffice to identify quark matter in neutron-star cores.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating potential benefits of future sub-L1 missions with STEREO-A</a><span class="id">[2602.22982]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first statistical study of geomagnetic storm forecasting using in situ data from the STEREO-A spacecraft as a sub-L1 monitor.

This passage provides a unique opportunity to assess future sub-L1 mission concepts by ESA, such as HENON and SHIELD. We identify 32 coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed by both STEREO-A and L1 spacecraft. Eight of these 32 CME events are first detected at L1, indicating that radial spacecraft separations of up to  0.05 au do not always yield lead time advantages.

In this work, we investigate the viability of polynomial potential inflation in light of the latest ACT data, systematically analyzing cases from $n=2$ to $n=5$. By exploring the parameter space and deriving constraints on the model coefficients, we find that the cubic to quintic models can provide a good fit to the data, while the quadratic model struggles to simultaneously accommodate the ACT data and the requirement of sufficient inflation. Notably, the quintic case ($n=5$) not only matches cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations but also produces an inflection point that simultaneously triggers primordial black hole formation and generates a scalar-induced gravitational wave. These findings establish higher-order polynomial potentials as compelling frameworks and reconcile precision CMB measurements with multi-messenger probes of early-universe physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delensing CMB B-modes using galaxy surveys: the effect of galaxy bias and matter clustering non-linearities</a><span class="id">[2507.04666]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The B-mode of polarization of the CMB is a uniquely powerful probe of gravitational waves produced in the very early Universe. But searches for primordial B-mode anisotropies must contend with gravitational lensing, which induces late-time B-modes not associated with gravitational waves. These lensing B-modes can be removed – i.e., delensed – using observations of the E-modes and a proxy of the matter fluctuations along the line of sight that caused the deflections. The number density and redshift reach of galaxy surveys such as the upcoming Rubin observatory offer attractive prospects for using them to delens B-mode data from CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory, LiteBIRD or CMB-S4. However, stochasticity and non-linear galaxy bias may in principle decorrelate the galaxy field from the matter distribution responsible for the lensing effect, thus hindering efforts to delens B-modes. In addition, non-linear gravitational evolution and bias introduce non-Gaussianities in the large-scale structure which further complicate the modelling. We quantify these effects by populating an N-body simulation with a magnitude-limited, photometric sample of galaxies similar to Rubin's gold selection, and using them to delens CMB maps lensed by the same matter distribution. We find that pipelines that treat the galaxy overdensity as a Gaussian field will incur negligible bias on the inferred tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. Moreover, we show that even in a highly conservative scenario where only the linear bias of the galaxies can be determined, the bias on r arising from this simplification is well within statistical uncertainties for a cosmic-variance limited scenario where Rubin-like galaxies are used for delensing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mergers Fall Short: Non-merger Channels Required for Galactic Heavy Element Production</a><span class="id">[2508.06020]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Since the discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its associated kilonova, neutron star mergers have been established as a key production channel for r-process elements in the Universe. However, various lines of evidence, including observations of r-process abundances inferred from stellar spectra of Milky Way disk stars, suggest that additional channels are needed to fully account for r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way. Neutron star-black hole mergers and fast-merging binary neutron star systems are among the leading alternative candidates. In this paper, we combine gravitational-wave observations from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with data from short gamma-ray bursts, Galactic pulsars, and Galactic Eu/Fe versus Fe/H abundance observations to assess the contribution of these mergers to r-process enrichment in the Galactic disk. Our analysis employs a unified, likelihood-based inference framework that consistently propagates uncertainties in merger rates, delay-time distributions, mass- and spin-dependent ejecta yields, and stellar abundance measurements. We find that neither neutron star-black hole mergers nor fast- merging binary neutron star populations can serve as the dominant additional channel without generating strong tension with existing observations and theoretical expectations. These results constrain the viable sources of Galactic r-process enrichment and underscore the necessity of non- merger production channels.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Overview of the ESCAPE Dark Matter Test Science Project for Astronomers</a><span class="id">[2509.22609]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The search for dark matter has been ongoing for decades within both astrophysics and particle physics. Both fields have employed different approaches and conceived a variety of methods for constraining the properties of dark matter, but have done so in relative isolation of one another. From an astronomer's perspective, it can be challenging to interpret the results of dark matter particle physics experiments and how these results apply to astrophysical scales. Over the past few years, the ESCAPE Dark Matter Test Science Project has been developing tools to aid the particle physics community in constraining dark matter properties; however, ESCAPE itself also aims to foster collaborations between research disciplines. This is especially important in the search for dark matter, as while particle physics is concerned with detecting the particles themselves, all of the evidence for its existence lies solely within astrophysics and cosmology. Here, we present a short review of the progress made by the Dark Matter Test Science Project and their applications to existing experiments, with a view towards how this project can foster complementary with astrophysical observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19892" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Superluminal Wave Activation at Relativistic Magnetized Shocks</a><span class="id">[2512.19892]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely energetic radio transients, some are generated in magnetar magnetospheres and winds. Despite a growing number of observations, their emission mechanisms remain elusive. It has recently been proposed that Alfvénic perturbations can convert into superluminal O-modes at magnetized shocks and propagate downstream as a radio signal. We validate this superluminal wave activation mechanism using pair-plasma theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Theory predicts two different downstream modes: nonpropagating Alfvénic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency. Our simulations model both monochromatic upstream waves and broadband spectra with the downstream plasma frequency acting like a high-pass filter for superluminal O-modes. We discuss implications for FRB generation in relativistic magnetized winds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03072" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The winds of OBA hypergiants and luminous blue variables: Dynamically-consistent atmosphere models reveal multiple wind regimes</a><span class="id">[2601.03072]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>OBA hypergiants (OBAHGs) are evolved massive stars with notable wind features in their optical spectrum. Located at the cool edge of the line-driven wind regime, many are candidate luminous blue variables (LBVs) likely near the Eddington limit. Although brief, this evolutionary stage deeply affects their surroundings and subsequent evolution. We study the mechanisms behind OBAHG winds and spectra, covering the temperature range of non-eruptive LBVs. Using the PoWR atmosphere code, we compute models with an Eddington parameter Gamma_e   0.4 and moderate turbulent pressure, typical for cool hypergiants, varying the effective temperature from  12.5 to  38.0 kK at solar metallicity. Our models show a complex temperature-dependent mass-loss pattern, with regions of higher/lower rates linked to two wind solutions: &quot;dense&quot; and &quot;rarefied.&quot; Spectra of known OBAHGs and LBVs match models from all solution regions. We find bi-stability jumps – with sharp mass-loss increases – at temperatures where Fe IV recombines to Fe III (and Fe III to Fe II). &quot;Drops&quot; in mass loss also occur when the leading Fe ion changes at wind onset, signaling a switch to rarefied solutions under insufficient driving opacity. The resulting velocity fields also reflect these different regimes: rarefied solutions match the empirical terminal velocity vs temperature relation, while dense ones deviate. Turbulent pressure is crucial for wind acceleration at cooler temperatures. We demonstrate that the bi-stability jumps exist in OBAHGs but are part of a broader complex behavior not replicated by current mass-loss recipes. Combining our and other recent results, we suggest that the switch between rarefied and dense solutions only occurs within a certain proximity to the Eddington Limit. Testing this requires future models with broader parameters and advanced treatments of radiatively-driven turbulence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19460" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long Photometric Cycles in Double Periodic Variables from Nodal Precession of a Tilted Accretion Disk</a><span class="id">[2602.19460]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate whether the long photometric cycles observed in double-periodic variables (DPVs) can arise from nodal precession of a tilted accretion disk driven by the tidal torque of the companion. Within a simple analytical framework, we derive testable relations linking the long-to-orbital period ratio to the binary mass ratio, the normalized disk size, and the disk tilt angle $\beta$, which itself can be inferred from the long-cycle amplitude, orbital inclination $i$, and disk luminosity fraction. The model naturally reproduces the two observed long-cycle light-curve morphologies – sinusoidal and double-hump – distinguished by the geometric criterion $i+\beta \le 90^\circ$ versus $i+\beta&gt;90^\circ$. Applying these relations to a sample of DPVs, we find that the inferred disk sizes are physically reasonable and consistent with independent light-curve modeling for a non-negligible subset of systems. Our results show that tidal nodal precession represents a viable and potentially important contributor to the long-period variability of DPVs and provide a quantitative framework for future observational and theoretical studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time-variable Scattered Light in Herbig Disks Observed with Subaru/SCExAO</a><span class="id">[2602.20346]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument, we present near-infrared K-band polarimetric imaging of nine Herbig stars selected from a volume-limited sample within 200 pc. We detect the disks around MWC 480, HD 163296, and HD 143006 for the first time with SCExAO, and compare these observations with previous VLT/SPHERE datasets to identify surface-brightness variability. In MWC 480, we resolve two azimuthal brightness dips near the disk minor axis and find evidence that one of them shifted between 2021 and 2022. In HD 163296, we identify an apparent linear azimuthal motion of a localized peak in polarized intensity along the outer ring over a 15-month baseline. The rapid motion of these features relative to the local Keplerian velocity suggests that the observed variability is driven by changing illumination rather than physical material this http URL to uncertainties in the underlying scattering background, however, we cannot determine the precise physical origin of the variability. No significant disk variability is detected in HD 143006 over a 10-month baseline. We also report the first detection of a protoplanetary disk using the fast-PDI mode on SCExAO, illustrating both the promise and current limitations of this observing mode. Finally, we report non-detections toward HD 144432, HD 56895, PDS 76, HIP 80425, HD 148352, and HIP 81474. All non-detections with Meeus classifications belong to Group II systems and are likely self-shadowed.

These exocomets are often treated as analogs of Solar System comet, yet the stellar environments they inhabit spans a wide range in terms of luminosity, stellar winds, and evolutionary stage, leading to potentially very diverse physical behaviors. Within our Solar System, small bodies lose material through a range of mechanisms, including sublimation, desorption, impacts, and/or sputtering. Once released, the composition and dynamics of the ejecta are then altered by additional processes, such as dust sublimation, ionization, and radiation pressure. In extrasolar systems, these mechanisms unfold under vastly different radiative and plasma conditions, leading to a rich diversity of mass-loss pathways and observable signatures. This work reviews our understanding of the mechanisms driving mass loss from small bodies and the subsequent evolution of ejecta in diverse stellar environments. We compare the physical and chemical mechanisms that drive gas and dust production, and investigate how they scale with stellar luminosity, temperature, and activity. We then examine the processes that modify the composition of the ejecta (e.g., dust sublimation, dissociation, or ionisation) and its dynamics (e.g., radiation pressure or stellar winds). To illustrate how these processes vary across different stellar environments, we use four well-studied planetary systems as case studies: the Sun, $\beta$ Pictoris, AU Microscopii, and WD 1145+017. By exploring how cometary tails behave under such diverse conditions, this work provides a physical framework for interpreting exocometary activity and sheds light on why A-type stars, such as the famous $\beta$ Pictoris, are over-represented in the population of exocomet-hosting stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20064" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonlinear causality of Israel-Stewart theory with diffusion</a><span class="id">[2507.20064]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first fully nonlinear causality constraints in $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions for Israel-Stewart theory in the presence of energy and number diffusion in the Eckart and Landau hydrodynamic frames, respectively. These constraints are algebraic inequalities that make no assumption on the underlying geometry of the spacetime or the equation of state. In order to highlight the distinct physical and structural behavior of the two hydrodynamic frames, we discuss the special ultrarelativistic ideal gas equation of state considered in earlier literature in $D = 1 + 1$ dimensions, and show that our general $D = 3 + 1$ constraints reduce to their results upon an appropriate choice of angles. For this equation of state in both $D = 1 + 1$ and $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions one can show that: (i) there exists a region allowed by nonlinear causality in which the baryon current transitions into a spacelike vector in the Landau frame, and (ii) an analogous argument shows that the solutions of the Eckart frame equations of motion never violate the dominant energy condition, assuming nonlinear causality holds. We then compare our results with those from linearized Israel-Stewart theory and show that the linear causality bounds fail to capture the new physical constraints on energy and number diffusion that are successfully obtained through our nonlinear causality approach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion of a Vlasov gas by a Kerr black hole</a><span class="id">[2508.04783]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the accretion of a collisionless, relativistic kinetic gas by a rotating Kerr black hole, assuming that at infinity the state of the gas is described by a distribution function depending only on the energy of the particles.

The accretion rates are computed in this manner for both monoenergetic particles and the Maxwell-Jüttner distribution and compared with the corresponding results in the non-rotating case.

For $(2,2)$, we extract the fundamental mode, the first three overtones, and the fundamental mirror mode with relative errors below $10\%$, and show that residual waveforms exhibit the expected damped sinusoids together with distinctive resonance signatures. For $(3,1)$, we demonstrate that resonances can not only amplify but also reduce quasinormal mode excitations, reshaping the overtone hierarchy and rendering the sharp resonance more pronounced in ringdown.
