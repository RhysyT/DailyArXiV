<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Questions related to the Deflection of Light by Gravity determined by Soldner, Einstein and Schwarzschild</a><span class="id">[2512.04128]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Before we discuss the deflection of light in a gravitational field, we give a brief overview of some basic physical formulas on photon properties, generation and propagation. The much debated problems of the redshift and the photon propagation in a gravitational field is then considered and applied to the calculation of the speed of light. Many citations are given in direct quotations to avoid any misunderstandings. If the quotations are in German, an English translation is provided. Based on this speed, calculated and measured results are recalled on the deflection of light, with emphasis on the deflection near the Sun. We conclude that the speed of light and the deflection angle can be determined by energy and momentum conservation principles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Geometric Origin of Time's Arrow: Loschmidt Resolved</a><span class="id">[2511.03843]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We resolve Loschmidt's paradox-the 150-year-old contradiction between time-reversible microscopic dynamics and irreversible macroscopic evolution. The resolution requires both quantum mechanics and classical chaos; neither alone suffices. Quantum uncertainty without chaos produces slow, polynomial spreading-not fundamentally irreversible. Classical chaos without quantum uncertainty produces computational intractability-trajectories diverge exponentially, yet the system remains on one trajectory, reversible in principle with sufficient precision. Only together do they produce geometric impossibility: chaos exponentially amplifies irreducible $\hbar$-scale uncertainty until stable manifolds contract below quantum resolution, rendering time-reversed trajectories physically inaccessible despite being mathematically valid and equiprobable. Information is never destroyed-it becomes geometrically inaccessible. The Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate is identical in both time directions, preserving microscopic symmetry while explaining macroscopic irreversibility. Three decades of Loschmidt echo experiments confirm perturbation-independent decay consistent with geometric inaccessibility. The framework unifies thermodynamic, quantum, and information-theoretic arrows of time.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Responsible Discovery in Astrobiology: Lessons from Four Controversial Claims</a><span class="id">[2512.04122]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper examines four case studies of life-detection claims in astrobiology, covering both biosignatures and technosignatures: the 1877 &quot;canals&quot; on Mars, the 1976 Mars Viking landers experiments, the 2020 phosphine detection on Venus, and the 2020 Breakthrough Listen Candidate 1 (BLC1) signal. We analyse the process of discovery for each case, including how they were detected, the media reception, the ensuing scientific debate, the correction processes, and the time it took until an expert consensus was reached. We identify lessons learned while providing scientists, the scientific community, and science communicators with recommendations for approaching future claims of astrobiological discoveries. To avoid potential cognitive biases and mitigate premature conclusions, we stress the need for clear communication of uncertainties, as well as thorough debate and verification processes among the scientific community. These responsible approaches can strengthen the credibility of scientists, cultivate a supportive scientific community, and help astrobiology flourish as a field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physical Analysis of a Reported Missile - &quot;Orb&quot; Interaction in 2024: Momentum Constraints, Atmospheric Drag, Sensor Artifacts, and Theoretical Caution</a><span class="id">[2512.04126]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A widely circulated infrared video from 2024 appears to show an air-to-surface missile engaging a small luminous &quot;orb&quot;-like object, producing debris and an apparent deflection of the missile's trajectory. This paper presents a comprehensive physics-based analysis of the event. Using classical mechanics, fluid dynamics, and imaging-system geometry, we examine momentum transfer, debris behavior, gimbal-induced optical distortions, and the physical plausibility of various interpretations. A balloon-like object remains the most conservative explanation compatible with known physics. However, modern physics is incomplete: the extreme weakness of gravity relative to the gauge forces, the existence of dark matter, dark energy, neutrino masses, and the possibility of extra spatial dimensions indicate that the Standard Model is not the final description of nature. For this reason, anomalous observations should not be dismissed outright as &quot;impossible&quot;. Nevertheless, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the present video lacks the multi-sensor, verified, and calibrated data required to support exotic interpretations. The aim is a balanced scientific evaluation based on current knowledge while maintaining appropriate theoretical humility.</p></div></details></article></body>
