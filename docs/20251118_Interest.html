<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11582" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Bayesian inference considerations and other issues concerning Drake's equation of Astrosociobiology</a><span class="id">[2511.11582]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Speculation about the existence of advanced forms of life in the Universe and in our galaxy, has been since ever a subject of fascination and discussion in fiction, as well as in astrophysics, biology and philosophy. The well-known Fermi's 1950s challenge, &quot;Where are the aliens?&quot; has acquired more substance with the realisation of the potentialities of radioastronomy, which led to the paradigmatic Drake's equation. The emergence of astrobiology, together with the discovery up to now of more than seven thousand exoplanets, has brought increasing support to the discussion about putative life cradles. However, after more than six decades, the only quantitative tool available to estimate how widespread is life and, in particular, advanced forms of life, is, besides direct searches, which so far provided no evidence, still Drake's equation. In the present work we review the current knowledge about this equation and present new arguments of multiple origin in order to evaluate one of its most critical terms, namely the one associated to the time span that a technological civilisation must search for detectable signs of the existence and for how long a search must be extended to bear fruits. We propose that this term should be replaced by a more specific one which involves critical parameters in the enterprise of gathering information, such as energy expenditure, searching area and entropy generation. These terms can be regarded as the capability that any cosmic civilisation must show in order to face the challenge of going beyond the climate and other crises that its development inevitably ensues. Our considerations suggest that a typical time span is about a couple of decades, meaning that a successful and systematic searching programme around about hundred stars might take around a few thousand years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bessel-Hagen on the extension of Noether's theorems and their application to classical electromagnetism</a><span class="id">[2511.12015]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work analyses the 1921 article by Erich Bessel-Hagen entitled Über die Erhaltungssätze der Elektrodynamik (&quot;On the conservation laws of electrodynamics&quot;). The article is based on Noether's theorems, which were formulated by Emmy Noether in 1918 and concern consequences of symmetries of actions, including conservation laws. Bessel-Hagen firstly extends Noether's theorems to symmetries up to a divergence and next applies them to the n-body problem and to classical electromagnetism, especially to its conformal symmetries. The work explains the context in which Bessel-Hagen's article was written, the way his explanations proceeded and the significance of his results. It is argued in particular that Bessel-Hagen's article as much as Noether's are best considered as elements of Felix Klein's Erlangen programme. A close reading of Bessel-Hagen's text is also provided, as is its comparison with relevant works, including recent works by philosophers of physics Katherine Brading, Harvey Brown and Peter Holland. Such an approach helps to see where Bessel-Hagen's treatment is confused and to clarify it, as well as to estimate the advancement in our understanding of the relevant topics made within the last one hundred years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12831" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great January Comet of 1910 (C/1910 A1): A Key Opportunity Missed by New Zealand Astronomers</a><span class="id">[2511.12831]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>C/1910 A1 was one of the Great Comets of the twentieth century. Although it was widely observed from the Northern Hemisphere, it was first discovered by observers south of the Equator. The comet arrived just months before the widely anticipated apparition of Comet 1P/Halley and was significantly more spectacular. As a result, the two comets were confused, and many who, in later years, talked about how prominent Comet 1P/Halley was in 1910 were often remembering C/1910 A1. In this paper, we present the results of a detailed search through historical records and media publications in Aotearoa / New Zealand, to investigate how extensively C/1910 A1 was observed from New Zealand. We compare our results with observations reported for Comet 1P/Halley later in 1910, finding that surprisingly few observations of C/1910 A1 were made by New Zealand observers. We discuss cases where the comet was misidentified as being an early sighting of 1P/Halley and compare the observations made in New Zealand with international observations/records/accounts. We find that, although the Great January Comet of 1910 was observed from New Zealand, it was witnessed by few compared to other parts of the world, meaning that the apparition of C/1910 A1 was something of a missed opportunity for New Zealand astronomers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13518" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Birth of Gravitational Particle Creation: the Enduring Legacy of Leonard Parker's 1966 Thesis</a><span class="id">[2511.13518]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper offers a historical overview of the origins and enduring significance of gravitational particle creation, a groundbreaking discovery first formulated in Leonard Parker's 1966 doctoral thesis at Harvard University. By tracing the context in which Parker developed this idea and examining its subsequent influence, the paper highlights how the concept of gravitational particle creation advanced the study of quantum field theory in curved spacetime and profoundly shaped modern cosmology, as well as the quantum theory of black holes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blurred orbits and blurred particles: Heisenberg's 1926 helium atom</a><span class="id">[2504.04116]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work analyses the extent to which the &quot;blurred orbits&quot; of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose–Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11820" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Categorization of Roles in the Quantum Industry</a><span class="id">[2511.11820]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Continued growth of the quantum information science and engineering (QISE) industry has resulted in stakeholders spanning education, industry, and government seeking to better understand the workforce needs. This report presents a framework for the categorization of roles in the QISE industry based on 42 interviews of QISE professionals across 23 companies, as well as a description of the method used in the creation of this framework. The data included information on over 80 positions, which we have grouped into 29 roles spanning four primary categories. For each primary category we provide an overview of what unites the roles within a category, a description of relevant subcategories, and definitions of the individual roles. These roles serve as the basis upon which we generate profiles of these roles, which include information about role critical tasks, necessary knowledge and skills, and educational requirements. Our next report will present such profiles for each of the roles presented herein.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fractional Contribution of Dynamical and Geometric Phases in Quantum Evolution</a><span class="id">[2511.13090]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fundamental division of the total quantum evolution phase into geometric and dynamical components is a central problem in quantum physics. Here, we prove a remarkably simple and universal law demonstrating that this partitioning is governed, at every instant, solely by a single geometric quantity: the Bargmann angle (Bures angle). This result provides a universally applicable and rigorous way to define the exact fraction of the total phase that is geometric versus dynamical in origin, thereby establishing a new quantitative link between the dynamics of quantum evolution and the geometry of the state space. This finding has immediate practical consequences, furnishing a real-time measure of the geometricity of an evolution for designing high-fidelity geometric quantum gates with optimized robustness, and opening new avenues for quantum speed limit and coherent control.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective Note-taking and its Impact on Learning Undergraduate Introductory Physics Courses</a><span class="id">[2507.21326]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Taking notes during lectures is one of the required skills, among many others, that students need (i) to master the topic covered in the lecture, (ii) to actively engage in the learning process with minimal to no distractions, (iii) to retain learned knowledge and skills for a longer time, and (iv) in securing higher letter grades. To learn the role of notetaking in learning undergraduate-level introductory physics courses, we present a comparative study of students' achievement in a mid-terminal exam at a historically black Fayetteville State University (FSU) (i) when students were taught effective notetaking strategies, motivated them to prepare notes and let them use their self-prepared notes in a terminal exam versus (ii) no notetaking scheme was implemented, keeping all other conditions the same. The no-notetaking scheme was used in 4 different sections over a few semesters, and the notetaking scheme was used at the same level of an introductory physics course in 3 different sections in other semesters. Students' scores in one of the mid-term exams are taken as measurement tools. Grade analysis indicates that effective notetaking enhances students' letter grades and lowers failure rates.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13509" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the brachistochrone problem for cycling ascents</a><span class="id">[2511.13509]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>VAM (velocità ascensionale media) is a measurement that quantifies a cyclist's climbing ability. We show that – to minimize the time to attain a given height gain, which is tantamount to maximizing VAM – a cyclist should climb as steep a constant-grade hill as possible. The limit of steepness is imposed, among others, by such factors as the efficiency of pedalling, which is related – among others – to feasible cadence, maintaining balance and preventing skidding of the rear wheel. This article, however, is focused on the primary issue of power available to the cyclist, which can be viewed as a necessary condition to examine other aspects of climbing strategy. We show that – for given start and end points, and for any fixed average-power constraint – the brachistochrone, which is the trajectory of minimum ascent time, is the straight line connecting these points, covered with a constant speed, which along such a line is equivalent to a constant power. This is in contrast to the classical solution of a descent brachistochrone under gravity, which is a cycloid along which the speed is not constant.</p></div></details></article></body>
