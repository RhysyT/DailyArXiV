We consider 2 progenitors of zero-age-main-sequence mass $25M_\odot$ and 8 with zero-age-main-sequence masses of $35M_\odot$. For these models, we explore a range of rotation rates between $0.0$ and $3.5 \mathrm{rad}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, along with initial seed magnetic field of either $10^{12}\mathrm{G}$ or $10^{13}\mathrm{G}$. The analysis of the 10 models presented provides a comprehensive and systematic initial investigation of the interplay between progenitor rotation, magnetic field strength, and progenitor structure in shaping the explosion dynamics and gravitational wave (GW) emission. We find that stronger seed magnetic fields ($10^{13}\mathrm{G}$) suppress the GW strain amplitude relative to models with weaker initial fields ($10^{12}\mathrm{G}$). Increasing the initial rotation rate results in a more dynamical explosion, yielding correspondingly stronger gravitational waves. In addition, the progenitor mass/composition also exhibit a significant impact on the explosion dynamics and the morphology of the resulting waveforms. Finally, we find that all of our models lie above the detectability threshold for 3rd generation detectors aLIGO, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic explorer at a $10\mathrm{kpc}$ distance and most would even still be detectable at $10\mathrm{Mpc}$, opening the possibility for observing gravitational wave emission for CCSNe beyond our galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation and Diagnostic Use of Carbon Lines in Stripped-Envelope Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2509.19438]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Carbon is one of the main end products of nucleosynthesis in massive stars. In this work, we study the emission signatures of carbon in spectra of stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe). A grid of model nebular spectra is created using the NLTE radiative transfer code SUMO, with stellar evolution- and explosion models as inputs. In the models, [C I] {\lambda}8727 and [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 are identified as the only significant optical carbon lines, with contribution from both the O/C and He/C zones. To obtain estimates of L_[C I] {\lambda}8727, which is blended with the Ca II triplet, we introduce and apply the CaNARY code, a publicly available Monte Carlo scattering code. We study carbon lines in a sample of SESNe, and find that luminosities of [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 relative to the optical spectrum increase with time, just as in our model grid. However, the relative luminosities of both [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 and [C I] {\lambda}8727 are overproduced in our models. Multiple explanations for this discrepancy, such as too high carbon abundances in the stellar evolution models and underestimated cooling through molecule formation, are investigated. For those SNe where both lines are clearly observed, we use an analytical formalism to constrain their ejected carbon masses to the range  0.2 - 2 Msun. However, several SNe yield upper limits of 0.05 Msun. We also show that [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 is a useful line to diagnose both carbon mass and the extent of the He/C zone. We strongly encourage observers and instrumentalists to target [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 in future SN observing campaigns.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19442" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational Constraints on Evolution of Dust Disc Properties in Upper Scorpius</a><span class="id">[2509.19442]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Protoplanetary discs in the Upper Scorpius star-forming region are excellent laboratories to investigate late stages of planet formation. In this work, we analyse the morphology of the dust continuum emission of 121 discs from an ALMA Band 7 survey of the Upper Scorpius region. This analysis is done in the visibility plane, to measure the flux, geometry and characterise potential structures. We compare the results with state-of-the art gas and dust evolution models that include external photoevaporation, with mild values of the $F_{\rm{UV}}$ of 1-40$G_0$. From the visibility analysis, 52 of the 121 discs are resolved (43%). From the resolved discs, 24 discs have structures and 28 remain as smooth discs at the mean resolution scale of $\sim$0.1$^{\prime \prime}$ ( 14au). Our results show no significant dust disc size evolution of the surviving discs in UpperSco when compared to discs in younger star-forming regions, such as Lupus. We find a strong, steeper-than-previously-reported correlation between dust disc size and disc millimeter continuum luminosity, in agreement with drift-dominated dust evolution models. We also find positive correlations between the dust disc mass vs. stellar mass and dust disc size vs. stellar mass. The slope of the dust disc size vs. stellar mass relationship is steeper compared to younger star forming regions. Additionally, we observe no significant correlation between dust disc properties and the environmental $F_{\rm{UV}}$, consistent with models predicting that dust disc properties are primarily shaped by drift and dust traps. Our models predict that gas disc masses and sizes should be highly affected by the moderate $F_{\rm{UV}}$ values that Upper Scorpius discs experience in contrast to the dust, highlighting the need for deeper and higher-resolution gas observations of these discs exposed to mild external photoevaporation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19446" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vacuum birefringence in the polarized X-ray emission of a radio magnetar</a><span class="id">[2509.19446]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory predicts that the quantum vacuum becomes birefringent in the presence of ultra-strong magnetic fields – a fundamental effect yet to be directly observed. Magnetars, isolated neutron stars with surface fields exceeding $10^{14}$ G, provide unique astrophysical laboratories to probe this elusive prediction. Here, we report phase- and energy-resolved X-ray polarization measurements of the radio-emitting magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 obtained with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), in coordination with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and Parkes/Murriyang radio observations. We detect a high phase-averaged polarization degree of 65% at 2 keV, where the surface thermal emission is dominant, rising to nearly 80% at certain rotational phases, and remaining at $\gtrsim40\%$ throughout the radio beam crossing. We also observe a strong decrease in polarization from 2 keV to 4 keV. Detailed atmospheric radiative transfer modeling, coupled with geometrical constraints from radio polarization, demonstrate that the observed polarization behavior cannot be consistently explained without invoking magnetospheric vacuum birefringence (VB) influences. These observational findings combined with the theoretical results represent compelling evidence for naturally occurring quantum VB. This work marks a significant advance toward confirming this hallmark prediction of QED and lays the foundation for future tests of strong-field quantum physics using next-generation X-ray polarimeters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling of Dark Matter Prompt and Secondary Signatures in Dwarf Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.19458]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dwarf Spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are very promising laboratories for the indirect search for dark matter (DM), due to their low astrophysical background in radio and gamma-ray frequencies. This is convenient when considering Weakly Interacting Dark Matter (WIMP) that can annihilate and produce radio continuum emission. Radio detections of dSph galaxies, however, prove to be difficult and motivate the consideration of transient galaxies that have just recently become quiescent. For the past several decades, the prompt emission from DM annihilation signatures has been explored through modeling and the setting of limits. In addition to the prompt annihilation signatures from neutrinos, gamma-rays, electrons, positrons, and antimatter, the secondary emission from charged annihilation products undergoing radiative loss processes also contributes to the picture. For instance, synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering of charged products such as electrons and positrons can provide a significant signal. The quantitative modeling of this secondary emission with the astrophysical background is necessary to place stringent constraints on the nature of DM. In this work, the multi-wavelength secondary spectrum of DM annihilation for a dwarf galaxy is calculated using the open-source code CRPropa 3.2, which enables the self-consistent treatment of the astrophysical background and secondary emissions. We present a systematic comparison of signatures from conventional astrophysical processes to those expected from DM annihilation. The morphological differences between the two scenarios are investigated. Tests of the impact of different magnetic fields, DM masses, and DM profiles will be performed in the next steps.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Waves from Hyperbolic Encounters of Primordial Black Holes in Dwarf Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.19462]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by primordial black holes (PBHs) in the dense cores of dwarf galaxies (DGs), considering both hierarchical binary black hole (BBH) mergers and close hyperbolic encounters (CHEs). Extending our previous merger framework, we incorporate up to four successive generations of PBHs within a Hubble time and quantify the GW emission from both channels. Our results show that while BBHs dominate the total emission, CHEs occur earlier, provide the first GW signals, and contribute a continuous though subdominant background that becomes relatively more significant once the initial PBH population is depleted and binary formation is suppressed. We compute the resulting SGWB spectra, demonstrating that BBHs and CHEs imprint distinct frequency dependencies consistent with analytical expectations. We then compare the predicted signals with the sensitivity of observatories such as LISA, DECIGO, ET, IPTA, and SKA. The numerical implementation is publicly available at \href{ this https URL }.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Where did heavy binaries go? Gravitational-wave populations using Delaunay triangulation with optimized complexity</a><span class="id">[2509.19466]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the joint mass-redshift evolution of the binary black hole merger rate in the latest gravitational-wave detection catalog, GWTC-4.0. We present and apply a novel non-parametric framework for modeling multi-dimensional, correlated distributions based on Delaunay triangulation. Crucially, the complexity of the model – namely, the number, positions, and weights of triangulation nodes – is inferred directly from the data, resulting in a highly efficient approach that requires about one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and significantly less calibration than current state-of-the-art methods. We find no evidence for a peak at $M_{\mathrm{tot}} \sim 70\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at low redshift ($z \sim 0.2$), where it would correspond to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature reported in redshift-independent mass spectrum analyses, and we infer an increased merger rate at high redshift $(z \sim 1)$ around those masses, compatible with such a peak. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19468" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Efficiency of viscous angular momentum transport in dissipating Be binaries</a><span class="id">[2509.19468]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Angular momentum transport is a fundamental process shaping the structure, evolution, and lifespans of stars and disks across a wide range of astrophysical systems. Be stars offer a valuable environment for studying viscous transport of angular momentum in massive stars, thanks to their rapid rotation, observable decretion disks, and likely absence of strong magnetic fields. This study analyzes angular momentum loss in 40 Be binary simulations spanning a range of orbital separations and companion masses, using a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code. A novel framework is introduced to define the outer disk edge based on the behavior of the azimuthal velocity, streamlining the analysis of angular momentum transport within the system. Applying this framework reveals that systems with smaller truncation radii tend to reaccrete a larger fraction of their angular momentum during dissipation, thereby inhibiting the stars ability to regulate its surface rotation. Modification of this rate may alter the star's mass-injection duty cycle or long-term evolutionary track. Finally, a subset of the simulations were post-processed using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code \texttt{HDUST}, generating synthetic observables including H$\alpha$ line profiles, V-band polarization, and UV polarization. Suggestions for observational verification of the dynamical results are demonstrated using the simulated data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A self-consistent numerical model of internal wave-induced mean flow oscillations in polar geometry</a><span class="id">[2509.19482]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Earth's Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is a natural example of wave-mean flow interaction and corresponds to the alternating directions of winds in the equatorial stratosphere. It is due to internal gravity waves (IGW) generated in the underlying convective troposphere. In stars, a similar situation is predicted to occur, with the interaction of a stably-stratified radiative zone and a convective zone. In this context, we investigate the dynamics of this reversing mean flow by modelling a stably-stratified envelope and a convectively unstable core in polar geometry. Here, the coupling between the two zones is achieved self-consistently, and IGW generated through convection lead to the formation of a reversing azimuthal mean flow in the upper layer. We characterise the mean-flow oscillations by their periods, velocity amplitudes, and regularity. Despite a continuous broad spectrum of IGW, our work show good qualitative agreement with the monochromatic model of Plumb and McEwan (1978). If the latter was originally developed in the context of the Earth's QBO, our study could prove relevant for its stellar counterpart in massive stars, which host convective cores and radiative envelopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for GEMS: TOI-5349b is a Saturn-like planet orbiting a metal-rich early M-dwarf</a><span class="id">[2509.19492]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the confirmation and analysis of TOI-5349b, a transiting, warm, Saturn-like planet orbiting an early M-dwarf with a period of $\sim$3.3 days, which we confirmed as part of the Searching for GEMS (Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars) survey. TOI-5349b was initially identified in photometry from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission and subsequently confirmed using high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and MAROON-X spectrographs, and from ground-based transit observations obtained using the 0.6-m telescope at Red Buttes Observatory (RBO) and the 1.0-m telescope at the Table Mountain Facility of Pomona College. From a joint fit of the RV and photometric data, we determine the planet's mass and radius to be $0.40\pm 0.02~\mathrm{M_J}$ ($127.4_{-5.7}^{+5.9}~M_\oplus$) and $0.91\pm 0.02~\mathrm{R_J}$ ($10.2\pm 0.3~R_\oplus$), respectively, resulting in a bulk density of $\rho_p=0.66 \pm0.06~\mathrm{g~cm^{-3}}$ ($\sim$0.96 the density of Saturn). We determine that the host star is a metal-rich M1-type dwarf with a mass and radius of $0.61 \pm 0.02~M_\odot$ and $0.58\pm 0.01~R_\odot$, and an effective temperature of $T_\mathrm{eff} = 3751 \pm 59$ K. Our analysis highlights an emerging pattern, exemplified by TOI-5349, in which transiting GEMS often have Saturn-like masses and densities and orbit metal-rich stars. With the growing sample of GEMS planets, comparative studies of short-period gas giants orbiting M-dwarfs and Sun-like stars are needed to investigate how metallicity and disk conditions shape the formation and properties of these planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nulling baryonic feedback in weak lensing surveys using cross-correlations with fast radio bursts</a><span class="id">[2509.19514]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Baryonic feedback is a leading contaminant in studying dark matter and cosmology using cosmic shear. This has meant omitting much of the data during cosmological inference, or forward-modeling the spatial distribution of gas around dark matter halos using analytical or hydrodynamical models for baryonic feedback, which introduces nuisance parameters and model dependence. We propose a novel method of “baryon nulling” using cross-correlations between shear maps and fast radio burst (FRB) dispersion measures. By directly subtracting the dark matter–dispersion measure cross-correlation, the sensitivity of our nulled power spectra to feedback effects can be significantly reduced without any explicit feedback modeling. Using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamic simulations, whose power spectra span a wide yet realistic range of feedback variations, we demonstrate that our method reduces sensitivity to feedback modeling at $k \approx 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ by about an order of magnitude. This points toward a strong synergy between the next generation of sensitive FRB surveys such as CHORD and the DSA-2000, and cosmic shear surveys such as Rubin, Euclid, and Roman.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nature of Transonic Sub-Alfvénic Turbulence and Density Fluctuations in the Near-Sun Solar Wind: Insights from Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations and Nearly-Incompressible Models</a><span class="id">[2509.19534]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent Parker Solar Probe measurements have revealed that solar wind (SW) turbulence transits from a subsonic to a transonic regime near the Sun, while remaining sub-Alfvénic. These observations call for a revision of existing SW models, where turbulence is considered to be both subsonic and sub-Alfvénic. In this Letter, we introduce a new magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of Transonic sub-Alfvénic Turbulence (TsAT). Our model shows that turbulence is effectively nearly-incompressible (NI) and has a 2D + slab geometry not only in the subsonic limit, but also in the transonic regime, as long as it remains sub-Alfvénic, a condition essentially enforced everywhere in the heliosphere by the strong local magnetic field. These predictions are consistent with 3D MHD simulations, showing that transonic turbulence is dominated by low frequency quasi-2D incompressible structures, while compressible fluctuations are a minor component corresponding to low frequency slow modes and high frequency fast modes. Our new TsAT model extends existing NI theories of turbulence, and is potentially relevant for the theoretical and numerical modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas, including the near-Sun SW, the solar corona, and the interstellar medium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Origin of X-ray Flares in the Low-Hard State of GRS 1915+105 Using AstroSat and NuSTAR</a><span class="id">[2509.19546]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We performed a detailed time-resolved spectral study of GRS 1915+105 during its low-flux rebrightening phase using the broadband capabilities of AstroSat and NuSTAR in May-June 2019. The AstroSat light curves revealed erratic X-ray flares with count rates rising by a factor of $\sim$5. Flares with simultaneous LAXPC and SXT coverage were segmented and fitted using two degenerate but physically motivated spectral models: a reflection-dominated model (hereafter Model A) and an absorption-dominated model (hereafter Model B). In Model A, the inner disk radius $(R_{in})$ shows a broken power-law dependence on flux, indicating rapid inward motion of the disk at higher flux levels. In contrast, Model B shows variable column density in the range of $10^{23}$ to $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, displaying a strong anti-correlation with flux. Both models exhibit significant variation in the ionization parameter between low- and high-flux segments. The total unabsorbed luminosity in the 0.7–30 keV energy range ranged from $6.64 \times 10^{36}$ to $6.33 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Across both models, several spectral parameters exhibited step-function-like behavior around flux thresholds of $5$–$10 \times 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, indicating multiple spectral regimes. The disc flux contribution, more evident in Model B, increased with total flux, supporting an intrinsic origin for the variability. These findings point to a complex interplay between intrinsic disk emission, structured winds, and variable local absorption in driving the flare activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19583" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of the latest 22Ne+α reaction rates on nucleosynthesis in massive stars and galactic chemical evolution</a><span class="id">[2509.19583]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In massive stars (initial mass of &gt; 9 solar masses), the weak s (slow neutron capture) process produces elements between Fe and Zr, enriching the Galaxy with these elements through core-collapse supernova explosions. The weak s-process nucleosynthesis is driven by neutrons produced in the 22Ne({\alpha}, n)25Mg reaction during convective He-core and C-shell burning. The yields of heavy elements thus depend on the 22Ne({\alpha}, n)25Mg and the competitive 22Ne({\alpha}, {\gamma})26Mg reaction rates which are dominated by several narrow-resonance reactions. While the accuracy of these rates has been under debate for decades, recent experimental efforts, including ours, drastically reduced these uncertainties. In this work, we use a set of 280 massive star nucleosynthesis models calculated using different 22Ne({\alpha}, n)25Mg and 22Ne({\alpha}, {\gamma})26Mg rates, and a galactic chemical evolution (GCE) study to probe their impact on the weak s-process elemental abundances in the Galaxy. The GCE was computed with the OMEGA+ code, using the new sets of stellar yields with different 22Ne+{\alpha} rates. From GCE, we find that these rates are causing up to 0.45 dex of variations in the [Cu/Fe], [Ga/Fe], and [Ge/Fe] ratios predicted at solar metallicity. The greatest impact on the stellar nucleosynthesis and GCE results derives from uncertainties in the ({\alpha},n) strength ({\omega}{\gamma}({\alpha},n)) of the Ex=11.32 MeV resonance. We show that the variations observed in the GCE calculations for the weak s-proess elements become negligibly smaller than dispersions found in observations once the {\omega}{\gamma}({\alpha},n) is accurately determined within the uncertaintiy of 10 to 20% (typically reported experimental errors for the resonance) in future nuclear physics experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The periodicity of three-dimensional oscillatory reconnection</a><span class="id">[2509.19603]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Oscillatory reconnection is a dynamic, magnetic relaxation mechanism in which a perturbed null point reverts back to equilibrium via time-dependent reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the long-term periodic signal generated by a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic null point, when it is perturbed by a non-periodic driver, for a variety of driving amplitudes. We solve the 3D nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations using a bespoke numerical boundary condition (a sponge region) that damps wave reflections and thus allows the long-term periodic signal at the 3D null point to be investigated. We observe multiple cycles of the 3D oscillatory reconnection mechanism for the first time. We find that the periodicity is both constant and independent of the choice of driving amplitude. Furthermore, the resultant time-dependent current density at the null point normalized by the driving amplitude is invariant. We extract a single period for oscillatory reconnection at a 3D null point, opening the future possibility of using this characteristic period as a diagnostic tool to reveal indirectly the fundamental plasma properties of 3D null points.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19641" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flipping particles with nodal circulations by general relativity under the presence of an inner perturber</a><span class="id">[2509.19641]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>From a secular Hamiltonian up to the quadrupole level with general relativity (GR), we study nodal circulations with orbital flips of test particles of the Habitable Zone (HZ) around a solar-mass star, which are perturbed by an inner planetary-mass companion. Nodal circulations with orbital flips of an HZ test particle with eccentricity e2 are possible for any mass m1 and eccentricity e1 of the inner perturber and a suitable inclination i2. In particular, the greater the values of m1 and e2 , the smaller the minimum extreme inclination i2 capable of producing nodal circulations with orbital flips for each e1. As long as nodal librations with orbital flips are not possible for any i2, the greater the values of m1, e1, and e2, the larger the region of the plane ({\Omega}2, i2) associated with nodal circulations with orbital flips. If nodal librations with orbital flips occur, the region of the plane ({\Omega}2, i2) referred to nodal circulations with orbital flips increases with a decrease in m1 and e2, and with an increase in e1. We observe very good agreements between the analytical criteria and the N-body experiments for m1 ranging from Earth-mass planets to super-Jupiters, and small and moderate e2.

New spectral classifications are obtained by fitting individual XP spectra with templates derived from empirical spectra of young stars. Combining these spectral classifications in this work and in the literature with archival photometry leads to estimates of V-band extinction and stellar luminosities for a total of 8,846 sources. Employing SPOTS models with spot coverages of 0.34 and 0.51 for K and M-type stars harmonizes age estimates between K/M-type and F/G-type stars, with ages older than are obtained for low-mass stars from standard evolutionary models. These older ages lead to a disk lifetime that is approximately two times longer than reported in previous literature. Our re-evaluation of the star formation history with these revised age estimates uncovers evidence of underlying substructures within the Sco-Cen complex.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic Dip Found in a Quiescent Prominence Foot via Observation and Simulation</a><span class="id">[2509.19723]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar prominences (or filaments) are cooler and denser plasma suspended in the much hotter and rarefied solar corona. When viewed on the solar disc filament barbs or feet protrude laterally from filament spine. When observed at the limb of the Sun, they reach into the chromosphere or even further down. For a long time, the magnetic field orientation of barbs has remained a mystery due to the paradox that the barbs possess vertical fine structures and flows but are likely to be supported in a horizontal magnetic field. Here we present unambiguous observations of a magnetic dip in a quiescent prominence foot with an upward-curved field. That is indicated by the horizontal bidirectional outflows probably produced by magnetic reconnection between the fields of a tiny erupting filament and those in a prominence foot. The altitude at the bottom of the dip is about 30 Mm. At the edge of the prominence foot, the angle between the dip field and the local horizontal is about 4 degrees. Additionally, the curvature radius of the dip bottom is estimated to be around 73 Mm. We also conduct magnetofrictional simulation to self-consistently form a large-scale magnetic flux rope with magnetic dips resembling the spine and feet of the quiescent prominence. The observations shed light on the field structure of prominences which is crucial for the instability that accounts for the eruption of prominences and coronal mass ejections.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19739" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variations of the vector magnetic structures in the solar polar regions observed by Hinode</a><span class="id">[2509.19739]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using the polar vector magnetic field data observed by Hinode from 2012 to 2021, we study the long-term variations of the magnetic flux, the flux proportion of different polarities, and the magnetic inclination with respect to the local normal in the solar polar regions above 70 degree latitude during solar cycle 24. In both polar regions after the polarity reversal, the unsigned magnetic fluxes of the dominant polarity increased to a peak of about 1.3$\times$10$^{22}$ Mx during the solar minimum, while those of the non-dominant polarity remained stable at approximately 0.5$\times$10$^{22}$ Mx. The proportions of the dominant polarity flux in the total flux in both polar regions increased to more than 70% at the solar minimum. These results reveal that the total magnetic flux and the number of open field lines in solar cycle 24 were larger than those in solar cycle 23, and also imply the existence of a local dynamo in polar regions. After the polarity reversal, the magnetic inclination of the dominant polarity fields decreased, indicating that the stronger the dominant polarity field, the more vertical the field lines. The inclination angle decreased with the increase of the threshold of radial magnetic flux density, revealing a fanning-out structure of the polar magnetic patches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jet-driven explosion of an accretion-induced white-dwarf collapse via a magnetorotational dynamo</a><span class="id">[2509.19799]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a rotating white dwarf (WD) offers a potential site of millisecond pulsars/magnetars, gamma-ray bursts, and r-process nucleosynthesis. We present three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations including neutrinos of magnetorotational AIC, assuming the WD is rapidly spinning with a weak magnetic field confined below its surface (likely a prerequisite for rapid rotation). Within milliseconds after core bounce, the magnetic field is exponentially amplified near the surface of the proto-neutron star (PNS). We witness the emergence of a small-scale turbulent and mean-field, large-scale MRI-driven dynamo in the neutrino-cooled centrifugally supported disk formed around the PNS, which generates bundles of large-scale toroidal field with alternating polarity. The amplified field becomes buoyant and is advected above the PNS, generating a magnetic tower that drives a mildly relativistic striped jet. The jet breaks out of the WD, clearing the way for a powerful magnetized neutron-rich wind from the disk. Although our simulation cannot follow the long-term Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase of the PNS, the conditions are ripe for the formation of a GRB powered by magnetar spin-down. A similar dynamo may operate in magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19847" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atmospheric Gravity Waves Modulated by the Magnetic Field Configuration</a><span class="id">[2509.19847]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) are buoyancy-driven waves excited by turbulent convection and contribute to the dynamics and energy transport of the lower solar atmosphere. We present high-resolution, multi-wavelength observations from the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer and the Solar Dynamics Observatory to investigate AGW behavior across different viewing geometries and magnetic field configurations. Using Fourier spectral analysis to compute phase differences and coherence spectra, we detect the signature of propagating AGWs carrying energy upwards at temporal and spatial scales consistent with theory, simulations, and prior observations. Although AGW behavior is modulated by the magnetic field configuration, particularly the field inclination, these effects are not highly discernible in our observed $k_{\rm{h}}-\nu$ phase difference diagrams. After filtering to isolate the AGW regime, we compute spatial coherence-weighted phase difference maps and examine binned coherence-weighted phase differences as functions of the field strength and inclination. Our results show that AGWs are efficiently suppressed and/or reflected in intermediate to strong, vertically oriented fields in the upper photosphere, while they propagate rather freely in QS and transverse fields. These findings agree with a simulated vertical 100 G field using CO$^{5}$BOLD. Simulated $k_{\rm{h}}-\nu$ phase differences derived from a 3D magnetohydrodynamic dispersion relation also qualitatively agree with our upper photospheric IBIS diagnostics and reinforce that the magnetic field configuration modulates the propagation of AGWs. This work demonstrates the potential of AGWs as magneto-seismology diagnostics for probing average magnetic field properties in the lower solar atmosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarity inversion line helicities and solar eruptivity</a><span class="id">[2509.19864]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work examines the relationship between solar eruptivity and the relative helicity that is contained around the polarity inversion line (PIL) of the magnetic field, along with its current-carrying component. To this end, we analyze the evolution of the PIL helicities in a sample of $\sim 40$ solar active regions which exhibited more than 200 flares of class M or higher. The computation of the PIL helicities is accomplished with the help of relative field line helicity, the recently-developed proxy for the density of relative helicity, following the extrapolation of the 3D coronal magnetic field with a nonlinear force-free method. We find that, on average, the relative helicity of the PIL decreases significantly, by more than $10\%$, during stronger eruptive flares (M5.0 class and above), while smaller changes are observed for confined and/or weaker flares. The PIL current-carrying helicity shows higher-magnitude decreases in both strong and weak flares, reaching $20\%$ average changes during the stronger eruptive flares. Notably, the PIL current-carrying helicity displays the most pronounced distinction between eruptive and confined flares, indicating its strong potential as a diagnostic of solar eruptivity. We discuss the implications of these findings for solar flare forecasting.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19874" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytical modeling of polarization signals arising from confined circumstellar material in Type II supernovae</a><span class="id">[2509.19874]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations of Type II supernovae (SNe) have brought a challenge in our understanding on the final evolutionary stage of massive stars. The early-time spectra and light curves of Type II SNe suggest that a majority of them have dense circumstellar material (CSM) in their vicinity, the so-called confined CSM. However, the mechanism of these extensive mass loss has not yet been understood. For addressing this problem, we aim to study the spatial distribution of the confined CSM, which has important information on the mechanism. We analytically calculate the polarization signals created by electron scatterings within disk-like confined CSM, and apply the results to the case of SN 2023ixf. The calculated polarization angle remains fixed at the angle aligned with the CSM disk axis, and is insensitive to the disk parameters. The calculated polarization degree evolves over a timescale of &lt; 10 days, depending on the disk parameters: it stays constant or increases slightly while the unshocked CSM is optically thick, peaks as it becomes optically thin, and drops to zero when the shock reaches the disk's outer edge. We also find that the time evolution of the polarization in Type II SNe with confined CSM can be used for estimating the CSM parameters. In particular, the maximum degree and the rise time are strongly connected to the values of the viewing angle and the opening angle of the CSM disk, while the duration and the decline time are sensitive to the values of the mass and extension of the CSM disk. We demonstrate that the time evolution of the polarization of SN 2023ixf can be explained with a disk-like CSM. This information of the CSM is a strong constraint on the mechanism to create the confined CSM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calibration-independent consistency test of DESI DR2 BAO and SNIa</a><span class="id">[2509.19899]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the consistency between DESI DR2 BAO and three SNIa datasets, Pantheon+, Union3, and DES-Y5.

Importantly, the test is also model-agnostic, independent of any model of dark energy or modified gravity. We define a tension parameter to quantify tension across different datasets compared to DESI DR2 BAO. The Pantheon+ and Union3 data have tension $\lesssim\! 1\sigma$ across their redshift ranges, whereas the DES-Y5 tension is $\gtrsim3\sigma$ near $z=1$. This hints that DES-Y5 data has significant offset values for redshifts close to 1, compared to the other SNIa datasets. Since this consistency test is independent of cosmological nuisance parameters, the tension is minimal: other consistency tests involving differences in nuisance parameters may show greater tension.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19934" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical properties of oscillating, viscous, transonic accretion disks around black holes</a><span class="id">[2509.19934]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the time evolution of sub-Keplerian transonic accretion flow onto a non-rotating black hole using axisymmetric viscous hydrodynamic simulations. We simulate the accretion flow using boundary values from semi-analytical analysis and set up three different models. Two of the models do not predict accretion shocks from the semi-analytic analysis, while one of them does. We also consider radiative cooling along with viscosity in the simulation. Our two-dimensional simulation deviated from the one-dimensional semi-analytical solution and admitted shocks in all three models. Viscous dissipation tends to push the shock front outward, and radiative cooling will push it in. Additionally, gravity is attractive. Depending on the competing strengths of all three processes, it may trigger shock oscillation. Different rates of angular-momentum transport in various layers may trigger eddies, which will enhance the shock oscillation. We show that any simple power law cannot approximate these solutions. We find that hot and higher angular-momentum flow requires higher viscosity to produce oscillatory shocks. From the temporal variation of the luminosity, shock oscillations generate QPOs in the range of sub-Hertz to a few Hertz frequencies if a ten solar mass black hole is assumed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Empirical correlation between masses of black holes and Wolf-Rayet stars derived from their mass distributions in spectroscopic binaries</a><span class="id">[2509.19981]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present observationally determined mass distributions of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in WR+OB binaries and black holes (BH) in spectroscopic binaries.

Understanding their early dynamics remains challenging due to observational limitations in the low corona. We present a statistical evaluation of the DIRECD (Dimming InfeRred Estimation of CME Direction) method, which provides a novel approach to determining initial CME propagation directions using coronal dimmings. We analyze 33 coronal dimming events well observed by SDO/AIA and validate our DIRECD results with 3D reconstructions from the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model. We find generally good agreement between the DIRECD-derived inclinations and the GCS model. In the meridional plane (north–south direction), the mean difference in inclinations is $0.3^\circ \pm 7.8^\circ$. In the equatorial plane (east–west direction), the mean difference is $-2.9^\circ \pm 18.9^\circ$. In 3D, the inclinations show a mean difference of $1.2^\circ \pm 10.4^\circ$. We further visually compare our method by projecting the DIRECD cones onto LASCO/C2 observations, and verify the model's ability to capture both the primary CME structure and associated secondary dimming regions. This work establishes DIRECD as a powerful, observationally grounded technique for determining the initial CME direction, offering new insights that complement existing reconstruction methods. The technique's unique capability to determine early CME direction in the low corona using coronal dimmings observed in EUV images makes it particularly valuable for improving space weather forecasting models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20040" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The role of photospheric magnetic flux diffusion in initiation of solar eruptions</a><span class="id">[2509.20040]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar eruptions may occur at different evolutionary stages of active regions, during which the photospheric motions manifest in various forms, including flux emergence, sunspot rotation, shearing, converging, and magnetic flux diffusion. However, it remains unclear what are the specific roles played by these different motions in leading to eruptions. Here, we employ high resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations to demonstrate how solar eruptions can be initiated in a single bipolar configuration, driven by first shearing and then flux diffusion at the bottom surface. Flux diffusion disperses the photospheric magnetic flux, driving portions of it toward the polarity inversion line (PIL). This process leads to the expansion of core field, enhancing the pinching effect to form the current sheet. When magnetic reconnection occurs within this current sheet, the eruption is initiated, characterized by a rapid release of magnetic energy and accompanied by the formation of a erupting flux rope. Additionally, flux diffusion contributes to magnetic cancellation near the PIL, leading to the formation of a weakly twisted magnetic flux rope prior to the eruption. However, this pre-exist flux rope plays a limited role in eruption initiation, as its spatial position remains largely unchanged throughout the eruption. These findings demonstrate that the primary role of flux diffusion is to facilitate current sheet formation, highlighting the critical role of current sheet formation in eruption initiation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of the A-type eclipsing binary system RR Lyncis A and B</a><span class="id">[2509.20047]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A spectroscopic study was carried out for the double-line A-type eclipsing binary system RR Lyn A+B based on the disentangled spectra, with an aim of clarifying the differences in photospheric chemical compositions between the components, where T_eff (effective temperature) and v_t (microturbulence) were determined from Fe lines. The resulting abundances of 30 elements revealed the following characteristics. (1) The brighter/hotter A shows metal-rich trends of classical Am stars; i.e., heavier elements generally show overabundances tending to increase towards higher Z (atomic number) with exceptionally large deficit of Sc, while light elements such as CNO show underabundances. (2) Meanwhile, the abundances of fainter/cooler B are closer to the solar composition ([X/H] 0 for intermediate Z elements such as Fe group) though [X/H] does exhibit a slightly increasing tendency with Z, which suggests that B is a kind of marginal Am star with almost normal metallicity. This consequence is in contrast to the results of previous studies, which reported B to be of metal-deficient nature similar to lambda Boo stars. Such distinctions of chemical abundances between A and B may serve as a key to understanding the condition for the emergence of Am phenomenon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20096" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Residual energy of magnetohydrodynamic shocks</a><span class="id">[2509.20096]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Residual energy quantifies the difference in energy between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations in a plasma. Recent observational evidence highlights that fast-mode interplanetary shock waves have positive residual energy, in sharp contrast to the negative residual energy of the turbulence and magnetic structures that constitute the vast majority of fluctuation power in the solar wind at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) inertial scales. In this work, we apply the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions to derive an equation for the residual energy of an MHD shock jump as a function of the shock angle, density compression ratio and Alfvén Mach number upstream of the shock. An equation for the cross helicity is similarly derived. The residual energy equation gives only positive values for super-Alfvénic (i.e. fast-mode) shocks. The residual energy and cross helicity of slow-mode shocks and tangential, contact and rotational discontinuities are also determined. A simplified form of the residual energy equation applicable to perpendicular shocks has been verified against residual energy values directly estimated from observations of 141 interplanetary shocks; the equation is found to match well with observations, particularly for shocks with higher density compression ratios and Mach numbers. The use of positive residual energy as a signature for fast-mode shock identification in spacecraft data is briefly considered, and insights from this work relating to compressive fluctuations more generally in the solar wind are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the lower mass limit for circumbinary disc fragmentation</a><span class="id">[2509.20125]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In recent years, many wide orbit circumbinary (CB) giant planets have been discovered; some of these may have formed by gravitational fragmentation of circumbinary discs. The aim of this work is to investigate the lower mass limit for circumbinary disc fragmentation. We use the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code SEREN, which employs an approximate method for the radiative transfer, to perform 3 sets of simulations of gravitationally unstable discs. The first set of simulations covers circumstellar discs heated by a single 0.7$\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ star (CS model), the second set covers binaries with the same total stellar mass as the CS model, attended by circumbinary discs with the same temperature profile (CB fiducial model), and the third set covers circumbinary discs heated by each individual star (CB realistic model). We vary the binary separation, mass ratio and eccentricity to see their effect on disc fragmentation. For the circumstellar disc model, we find a lower disc-to-star mass ratio for fragmentation of $\sim\,$0.31. For the circumbinary fiducial disc model we find the same disc-to-star mass ratio for fragmentation (but slightly lower for more eccentric, equal-mass binaries; 0.26). On the other hand, realistic circumbinary discs fragment at a lower mass limit (disc-to-star mass ratio of 0.17 - 0.26), depending on the binary properties. We conclude that circumbinary discs fragment at a lower disc mass (by $\sim 45\%$) than circumstellar discs. Therefore, gas giant planet around binaries may be able to form by gravitational instability easier than around single stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20131" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Search for High-Energy Emission from the Remnant of Supernova 1181</a><span class="id">[2509.20131]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the previous millennium, only five Galactic supernovae were observed and recorded by contemporary astronomers, and their current-day counterparts subsequently identified.

This effect has been attributed to “binary hardening,” whereby the binary's orbital period would have gradually decreased as Dimorphos continuously scattered bound ejecta out of the system and lost angular momentum. We investigated this hypothesis with the goal of constraining the conditions that would lead to a gradual decrease in the binary's orbital period. We used $N$-body simulations to study the dynamical evolution of the Didymos system under the influence of a cloud of massive test particles. We demonstrate that the gravitational scattering of ejecta is not a plausible explanation for Dimorphos's anomalous orbital period drop under any circumstances. This is a result of Dimorphos's escape speed being low compared to its orbital velocity, making it a weak scatterer. If a significant fraction of DART ejecta was launched at low speeds, as impact models and scaling laws suggest, then the binary's orbital period was likely increased as this material was accreted back onto Didymos and Dimorphos. Therefore, some additional mechanism must have overcome this effect, leading to a net orbital period decrease.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar and Stellar Activity</a><span class="id">[2509.20202]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This chapter provides an overview of the magnetic activity of the Sun and stars, discussing its underlying physical origin, manifestations, and fundamental role in exoplanet studies.

Typically most studies assume that the massive stars driving these winds are comoving with their associated clusters. However, it is also known that massive stars can be runaways, after being violently ejected from their birth environment through interactions with other massive stars. In this letter, we show that the well studied system $\sigma~{\rm Ori~AB}$ is actually a runaway system, only now passing through $\sigma~{\rm Orionis}$. There are multiple observable features that indicate this is the case, including significantly larger proper motions for $\sigma~{\rm Orionis}$ than the surrounding stars, an infrared arc of ionising gas along the predicted velocity vector, and a disparity in protoplanetary disc masses across $\sigma~{\rm Orionis}$. We finally use protoplanetary disc evolution models to explain the observed disparity in disc masses, showing that those discs downstream of $\sigma~{\rm Ori~AB}$, i.e. those yet to encounter it, have larger masses than those upstream, consistent with observations. Overall, our work highlights the importance of understanding the dynamical history of star forming regions, since the time varying UV fields provided by runway stars results in a complex history for the evolution of the protoplanetary discs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$S_8$ from Tully-Fisher, fundamental plane, and supernova distances agree with Planck</a><span class="id">[2509.20235]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Peculiar velocity measurements constrain the parameter combination $f\sigma_8$, the product of the linear growth rate $f$ and the fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$.

We exploit this by using three classes of direct-distance tracers – the Tully-Fisher relation, the fundamental plane, and Type Ia supernovae – to infer peculiar velocities. A unified hierarchical forward model jointly calibrates each distance indicator and a linear theory reconstruction of the local Universe. This is the first consistent Bayesian analysis to combine all three major classes of distance indicators within a common framework, enabling cross-checks of systematics across diverse galaxy populations. All three tracers yield consistent values of $S_8$ that are also in agreement with Planck. Our joint constraint is $S_8 = 0.819 \pm 0.030$, with the uncertainty dominated by the 2M++ galaxy field.

In this work, we explore how this phase shift signature is altered in the presence of neutrino interactions with temperature-dependent scattering rates, motivated by physical constructions for neutrino self-interactions and neutrino-dark matter couplings. A key finding is that the phase shift in these realistic models – characterized by gradual rather than instantaneous decoupling – maintains the same functional form as the free-streaming template, with only the asymptotic amplitude decreasing for stronger interactions that delay decoupling. This simple parametrization enables us to directly constrain neutrino interactions through phase shift measurements in the temperature and polarization power spectra from CMB observations. Analyzing the latest data from \textit{Planck}, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope, we derive strong constraints on the neutrino decoupling redshift. Our global analysis indicates that neutrinos have been freely streaming since deep within the radiation-dominated epoch. We also explore flavor-dependent scenarios in which only one neutrino species interacts. Overall, our work establishes a signature-driven framework that exploits the clean phase shift signal in the acoustic oscillations of the CMB as a precise and robust probe of non-standard neutrino interactions in the early universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19428" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-rays from Inelastic Dark Matter Freeze-in</a><span class="id">[2509.19428]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study inelastic dark matter produced via freeze-in through a light mediator with a mass splitting below the electron-positron threshold.

We revisit the inelastic Higgs-portal complex singlet, a minimal framework in which a complex scalar splits into two nearly degenerate real states, with an off-diagonal Higgs-portal interaction that drives coannihilation to set the relic density, while the elastic DM-Higgs coupling can be tuned small enough to evade direct-detection limits. This setup naturally supports a strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT) and can account for the long-standing Galactic Center gamma-ray excess (GCE) via present-day DM annihilation into Higgs pairs. In this work, we show that the same framework, extended by a $Z_2$-symmetric dimension-6 $CP$-violating top Yukawa operator, can also generate the BAU via the electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) mechanism. The cosmological history involves a two-step electroweak phase transition: first, the singlet fields acquire nonzero vacuum expectation values (vevs); then a strongly first-order transition occurs in which the Higgs develops its nonzero vev while the singlet vevs vanish. During this second step, both fields remain nonzero only within the advancing bubble wall, generating wall-localized $CP$ violation that biases sphaleron transitions and enables EWBG. After the phase transition, $CP$ and $Z_2$ symmetries are restored: the lightest singlet state becomes a stable DM candidate, while the vanishing singlet vevs allow the model to naturally satisfy the stringent constraints on $CP$ violation. We delineate the SFOEWPT-favored parameter space, identifying the criteria for the two-step phase transition region that simultaneously yields the observed BAU and relic density, explains the GCE, and predicts gravitational wave spectra accessible to next-generation space-based detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarimetry imprints of exotic compact objects: relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars</a><span class="id">[2509.20344]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations of polarimetric parameters of active galactic nuclei motivate the study of polarization in the spacetime of exotic compact objects which can mimic the features of black holes in the strong field regime of gravity.

Since the dust growth rate depends on the amount of dust, realizing planet formation scenarios based on dust growth is challenging in environments with low metallicity, i.e. less dust. We investigate dust growth during disk evolution, particularly focusing on the relationship with metallicity. We perform two-dimensional thin-disk hydrodynamic simulations to track the disk evolution over 300 kyr from its formation. The dust motion is solved separately from the gas motion, with its distribution changing due to drag forces from the gas. Dust size growth is also accounted for, with the magnitude of the drag force varying according to the dust size. We employ three models with metallicities of 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01 ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$, i.e. dust-to-gas mass ratios of 10$^{-2}$, 10$^{-3}$, and 10$^{-4}$, respectively. In the disks with the metallicities $\ge0.1$ ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$, the dust radii reach cm sizes, consistent with estimations from the dust growth timescale. Conversely, for the metallicity of 0.01 ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$, the maximum dust size is only 10$^{-2}$ cm, with almost no growth observed across the entire disk scale ($\sim$100 au). At the metallicities $\ge0.1$ ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$, the decoupling between grown dust and gas leads to non-uniform dust-to-gas mass ratios. However, deviations from the canonical value of this ratio have no impact on the gravitational instability of the disk. The formation of dust rings is confirmed in the innermost part of the disk ($\sim$10-30 au). The dust rings where the dust-to-gas mass ratio is enhanced, and the Stokes number reaches $\sim$0.1, are suitable environments for the streaming instability. We conjecture that planetesimal formation occurs through the streaming instability in these dust rings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11358" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disentangling CMB $μ$ and $y$ spectral distortions from foregrounds with poorly defined spectral shapes</a><span class="id">[2503.11358]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have presented a new approach to separate small spectral $\mu$ and $y$ distortions of the CMB from foreground components with poorly defined spectral shapes.

However, it is crucial to note that numerical resistivity can fail to replicate essential features of explicit resistivity. In this study, we compare the 1D resistive decay and 2D reconnection properties of four commonly used physical models. We demonstrate that the 1D Ohmic decay of current sheets via numerical dissipation in both ideal MHD and magnetodynamics (MD) is subdiffusive (i.e., sub-linear in time), whereas explicit resistive FFE and resistive MHD simulations match the predictions of resistive theory adequately. For low-resolution, reconnecting current sheets in 2D, we show that ideal MHD and MD have an analogue to the Sweet–Parker regime where the scaling of the reconnection rate depends directly on the resolution. At high resolutions, ideal MHD and MD have an asymptotic reconnection rate similar to resistive MHD. Furthermore, we find that guide field-balanced current sheets in ideal MHD and MD have a qualitative structure similar to that of one in resistive MHD. Similarly, a pressure-balanced current sheet in ideal MHD is found to have a qualitative structure similar to that of one in resistive MHD. For a guide field-balanced sheet, resistive FFE is found to have a nearly identical Sweet–Parker regime compared to resistive MHD and a similar asymptotic reconnection rate for large enough Lundquist numbers, but differs in the timescale for reconnection onset in the asymptotic regime. We discuss the implications of our findings for global simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray polarization of accreting black holes: Cyg X-1 and Swift J1727.8-1613</a><span class="id">[2504.10981]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer is an X-ray observatory measuring the X-ray polarization in the 2-8 keV energy range.

We also perform a deprojection of the observed NSD surface brightness distribution in order to construct a three-dimensional X-ray luminosity density model, which can be directly compared to the existing 3D stellar mass models. Finally, we conclude that the spatial distribution of the X-ray emission from the NSD is consistent with the most recent stellar mass density distribution model within 30%, which suggests that this emission is dominated by unresolved point X-ray sources rather than by diffuse X-ray emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parity violation in framework of nonmetricity gravity</a><span class="id">[2508.10532]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The latest observational data of Planck satellite shows nontrivial value of polarization rotation angle caused by cosmic birefringence in the early universe. Moreover, the asymmetry of baryons versus anti-baryons still remains mysterious. Both of them indicates that there should be hidden new physics such as fundamental symmetry breaking. In this paper, we try to interpret these two events in framework of nonmetricity modified gravity. We introduce an interaction term between nonmetricity-based function and matter current, and calculate both the rotation angle and baryon-to-photon ratio. We also constrain the model parameters using the current observational data. With some specific examples, we demonstrate that in nonmetricity gravity theory, these two events can be interpreted in a unified way. Nevertheless, the minimal coupling of nonmetricity scalar and the matter current might not be favored.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imaging the positron annihilation line with 20 years of INTEGRAL/SPI observations</a><span class="id">[2509.01066]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The e$^+$ e$^-$ annihilation line at 511 keV provides a unique probe for studying the distribution and origin of positrons in our Galaxy. The SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL has observed this gamma-ray line for two decades. We analyze 20 years of INTEGRAL/SPI observations to produce the most sensitive all-sky map of the 511 keV line emission to date, aiming to reveal new features and provide refined measurements of known sources. We perform image deconvolution using the RL algorithm and employ bootstrap analysis to evaluate statistical uncertainties of fluxes from regions of interest. Systematic uncertainties in parameter choices are also considered. We utilize GPU acceleration to enable this computationally intensive analysis. The reconstructed image successfully recovers the basic morphological features reported in model-fitting studies: a bright central component, a broad bulge, and an elongated disk component along the Galactic plane. We also report hints of new spatial features in the reconstructed image, including an asymmetric structure in the broad bulge emission and 511 keV emission potentially associated with massive stars from the Sco-Cen and other OB associations. While the significance of these new features is marginal ($\sim 2\sigma$), they are spatially consistent with $^{26}$Al emission from massive stars in that region, suggesting that this 511 keV emission originates from its $\beta^{+}$ decay. Our 20-year dataset provides the most detailed 511 keV emission map to date, reproducing global structures suggested in model-fitting approach while revealing hints of new spatial features. These findings provide insights into the origin of Galactic positrons and propagation of low-energy positrons in the interstellar medium. Future MeV gamma-ray observations, such as COSI, are expected to confirm the reported features and shed further light on the nature of positrons in our Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equation of State Extrapolation Systematics: Parametric vs. Nonparametric Inference of Neutron Star Structure</a><span class="id">[2509.06145]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The equation of state (EOS) of cold dense matter is a central open problem in nuclear astrophysics. Its inference is hindered by the lack of \textit{ab initio} control above about twice nuclear saturation density, requiring extrapolation. Parametric schemes such as piecewise polytropes (PP) are efficient but restrictive, while nonparametric approaches like Gaussian processes (GP) allow more flexibility at the cost of larger prior volumes. We extend our hybrid EOS framework by replacing the high-density polytropic extension with a GP representation of the squared sound speed, anchored at low densities by the SLy crust EOS and a nuclear meta-model constrained by $\chi$EFT and laboratory data. Using hierarchical Bayesian analysis, we jointly constrain the EOS and neutron star mass distribution with multi-messenger observations, including NICER radii, GW170817 and GW190425 tidal deformabilities, pulsar masses, and neutron skin experiments. We examine four scenarios defined by high-density extrapolation (PP vs.\ GP) and hotspot geometry in the NICER modeling of PSR J0030$+$0451 (ST+PDT vs.\ PDT-U). GP extrapolations generally yield softer EOS posteriors with broader uncertainties. Hotspot assumptions also play an important role, shifting inferred mass–radius relations. Bayesian evidence strongly favors the ST+PDT geometry over PDT-U under both extrapolations, while GP is mildly preferred over PP. These results underscore the impact of observational modeling and EOS extrapolation on neutron star inferences, and show that a GP-based extension offers a robust way to quantify systematic uncertainties in high-density matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmology inference with perturbative forward modeling at the field level: a comparison with joint power spectrum and bispectrum analyses</a><span class="id">[2509.09673]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extend field-level inference to jointly constrain the cosmological parameters $\{A,\omega_{\rm cdm},H_0\}$, in both real and redshift space. Our analyses are based on mock data generated using a perturbative forward model, with noise drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a constant power spectrum. This idealized setting, where the field-level likelihood is exactly Gaussian, allows us to precisely quantify the information content in the nonlinear field on large scales. We find that field-level inference accurately recovers all cosmological parameters in both real and redshift space, with uncertainties consistent with perturbation theory expectations. We show that these error bars are comparable to those obtained from a joint power spectrum and bispectrum analysis using the same perturbative model. Finally, we perform several tests using the Gaussian field-level likelihood to fit the mock data where the true noise model is non-Gaussian, and find significant biases in the inferred cosmological parameters. These results highlight that the success of field-level inference critically depends on using the correct likelihood, which may be the primary challenge for applying this method to smaller scales even in the perturbative regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ringdown mode amplitudes of precessing binary black holes</a><span class="id">[2504.17021]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ringdown phase of a binary black-hole merger encodes key information about the remnant properties and provides a direct probe of the strong-field regime of General Relativity. While quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times are well understood within black-hole perturbation theory, their excitation amplitudes remain challenging to model, as they depend on the merger phase. The complexity increases for precessing black-hole binaries, where multiple emission modes can contribute comparably to the ringdown. In this paper, we investigate the phenomenology of precessing binary black hole ringdowns using the SXS numerical relativity simulations catalog. Precession significantly impacts the ringdown excitation amplitudes and the related mode hierarchy. Using Gaussian process regression, we construct the first fits for the ringdown amplitudes of the most relevant modes in precessing systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COSINUS model-independent sensitivity to the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter signal</a><span class="id">[2504.18263]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>COSINUS is a dark matter direct detection experiment using NaI crystals as cryogenic scintillating calorimeters. If no signal is observed, this will constrain the dark matter scattering rate in sodium iodide. We investigate how this constraint can be used to infer that the annual modulation signal observed in the DAMA/LIBRA experiment cannot originate from dark matter nuclear recoil events, independently of the dark matter model. We achieve this by unfolding the DAMA modulation spectrum to obtain the implied unquenched nuclear recoil spectrum, which we then compare to the expected COSINUS sensitivity. We find that assuming zero background in the signal region, a 1$\sigma$, 2$\sigma$ or 3$\sigma$ confidence limit exclusion can be obtained with 57, 130 or 250 kg day of exposure, respectively. A simple background model indicates that in the presence of background, the exposure requirements may increase by $\sim30\%$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. III. Covariant canonical quantum gravity models</a><span class="id">[2507.02396]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In earlier companion papers, we showed that non-singular primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all the dark matter (DM) over a significantly wider mass range compared to Schwarzschild PBHs. Those studies, mostly based on phenomenological metrics, are now extended by considering the quantum-corrected space-time recently proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma and Yang (ZLMY), derived from an effective canonical (loop) quantum gravity approach explicitly enforcing general covariance. Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perturbative Hyperboloidal Extraction of Gravitational Waves in 3+1 Numerical Relativity</a><span class="id">[2508.05743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a framework to propagate to null infinity gravitational waves computed at timelike worldtubes in the interior of a 3+1 (Cauchy) numerical relativity simulations. In our method, numerical relativity data are used as the inner inflowing boundary of a perturbative time-domain Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli simulation in hyperboloidal coordinates that reaches null infinity. We showcase waveforms from (3+1)D simulations of gravitational collapse of rotating neutron stars, binary black holes mergers and scattering, and binary neutron star mergers and compare them to other extrapolation methods. Our perturbative hyperboloidal extraction provides a simple yet efficient procedure to compute gravitational waves with data quality comparable to the Cauchy characteristic extraction for several practical applications. Nonlinear effects in the wave propagation are not captured by our method, but the present work is a stepping stone towards more sophisticated hyperboloidal schemes for gravitational-wave extraction.</p></div></details></article></body>
