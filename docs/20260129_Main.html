Their period-luminosity and period-age relations make them valuable distance and age indicators, while their light curve morphology, amplitudes, and multiperiodicity reveal the underlying physics of stellar interiors and mass-loss. In this review, we provide an overview of the current status of LPV studies, focusing on their observational properties and applications, including: - Modern classification of LPVs into Miras, semiregular variables (SRVs), and OGLE small-amplitude red giants (OSARGs), which occupy multiple period-luminosity sequences associated with different pulsation modes, chemical compositions, and evolutionary stages - Mira variables as reliable distance indicators across diverse stellar environments and their increasing role as standard candles - The increasing role of SRVs and OSARGs - Long secondary period (LSP) variables as potential tracers of exoplanets Together with advances in theoretical modeling, these developments establish LPVs as valuable tracers of Galactic structure, stellar populations, and the extragalactic distance scale.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar and orbital characterization of three low mass M dwarf binary stars with dynamical spectroscopy from the Habitable Zone Planet Finder</a><span class="id">[2601.19996]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Theoretical models of low-mass stars continue to be discrepant with observations when used to examine the mass-radius relationship and other physical parameters of individual stars. High-resolution spectroscopy that leads to dynamical measurements of binary stars can directly improve these models. We have been using the Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph to monitor binary stars with M dwarf components. Here, we measure the orbital and stellar parameters for three such systems: LSPM J0515+5911, NLTT 43564, and NLTT 45468. Each system has dozens of spectra obtained over a baseline of several years. None of the systems appear to be eclipsing, so our ability to turn them into true benchmark binaries with purely dynamical measurements is limited. We use literature photometry to estimate each system's spectral energy distribution and utilize models in combination with detection limits of our spectroscopic measurements to probe characteristics of the companions. LSPM J0515+5911 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with period of $126.948 \pm 0.029$ days and derived minimum masses, $M_1\sin^3i =0.058 \pm 0.002$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2\sin^3i = 0.046 \pm 0.001$ $M_\odot$ for the primary and secondary components, respectively. We solved NLTT 43564 with period of $1877 \pm 24$ days and NLTT 45468 with period of $9.686 \pm 0.001$ days as single lined systems, and modeled the primary masses to be $M_1 = 0.32\pm{0.02}$ $M_\odot$ and $M_1 = 0.35^{+0.02}_{-0.07}$ $M_\odot$, respectively.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exomoons and Exorings with the Habitable Worlds Observatory II: Finding Endor with Lunar Eclipses</a><span class="id">[2601.20002]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Giant planets in the habitable zone may host exomoons with conditions conducive to life. In this paper we describe a method by which the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) could detect such moons: broadband reflected-light lunar eclipses (e.g., the moon passing into the shadow of the planet). We find that an Earth-like moon orbiting a Jovian-size planet at 1au can outshine its host planet near 1 micron, producing frequent (days time-scale) lunar eclipses with depths of order 50%. We determine that single eclipse events out to $\sim$12pc may be detectable for Earth-like moons around giant planets, down to $0.9R_\oplus$. Detection of smaller moons, $\sim$0.5$R_\oplus$ (corresponding to about the size of Mars or Ganymede), may be possible, but would generally require multiple events for most systems. These several-hour events provide a clear pathway to detecting habitable moons with HWO, given sufficient stare-time on each system to detect lunar eclipses. The occurrence rate of habitable exomoons remains unconstrained, however, making the ultimate yield uncertain. HWO will be capable of placing the first meaningful constraints on the frequency of habitable exomoons around giant planets; if it is non-negligible, HWO could also search for life on these worlds, possibly with lunar eclipse spectroscopy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting Stellar equatorial rotational velocities with Gaia DR3 line broadening – the dependence on temperature, mass and age</a><span class="id">[2601.20008]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We used more than $10^5$ Gaia DR3 line broadening vbroad measurements to examine stellar rotation as a function of stellar temperature, mass and age. The large sample clearly displays the Kraft break at $\sim 6{,}500$ K, or mass of $\sim1.3\,M_{\odot}$-while vbroad are small, on the order of $10$-$20$ km/s, for stars cooler than the Kraft break, they sharply rise above the break, reaching up $\sim100$ km/s with temperature of $7{,}000$ K. To follow the stellar rotation as a function of age, we consider vbroad as a function of scaled age-stellar age divided by the relevant Terminal Age Main Sequence (MS), for four narrow mass bins. We find that stellar rotation deceleration is slow during the MS phase and fast afterwards for stars hotter than the break, whereas deceleration rate is relatively high and does not vary much for the cool stars. Our findings are consistent with the theory that stellar rotation slowing is due to magnetic breaking, emanating from magnetic fields that are anchored to the stellar convective envelopes. Therefore, deceleration is high in cool stars, but in hot stars only after they leave the MS and develop convective outer layers</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20059" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 2025 Evaluation of Experimental Thermonuclear Reaction Rates (ETR25)</a><span class="id">[2601.20059]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work describes the formalism for estimating thermonuclear reaction rates for astrophysical applications, emphasizing modern statistical approaches such as Monte-Carlo sampling and Bayesian models. We discuss related topics including the calculation of resonance energies from nuclear Q values, indirect estimates of particle partial widths, and matching of reaction rates at elevated temperatures to statistical-model results. We have evaluated available experimental data on cross sections, resonance energies and strengths, partial widths, life-times, spin-parities, and spectroscopic factors. Based on these results, we have estimated numerical values of 78 experimental charged-particle thermonuclear reaction rates for target nuclei in the A = 2 to 40 mass region, for temperatures ranging from 1 MK to 10 GK. For each reaction, three rate values are provided: low, median, and high, corresponding to the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles, respectively, of the cumulative reaction rate probability density distribution. Additionally, we present the factor uncertainty of each rate at each temperature grid point. These results enable users to sample the reaction rate probability density in nucleosynthesis calculations, facilitating uncertainty estimates of nuclidic abundances. The rates presented here refer to their laboratory values. For use in stellar model simulations, these values need to be corrected for the effects of thermal excitations of the interacting nuclei. For each reaction, we include graphs that illustrate the fractional contributions to the overall reaction rate along with the associated uncertainty. These visuals are designed to assist both stellar modelers and nuclear experimentalists by identifying the primary sources of rate uncertainty at specific stellar temperatures. A graphical comparison with earlier Monte-Carlo rates is also provided.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20078" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin of Coronal Extreme Ultraviolet Shockwaves without a Coronal Mass Ejection Event</a><span class="id">[2601.20078]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A leading theory of sunquake generation involves flare-accelerated particles depositing energy into the photosphere. Simulations of sunquake excitation suggest co-excitation with wavefronts propagating in the corona and chromosphere, similar to Moreton-Ramsey waves, and large-scale coronal propagating fronts (LCPFs). To investigate observational evidence for the particle-driven mechanism in LCPFs, we compare populations of events associated with and without coronal mass ejections (CMEs). CMEs are known to generate similar EUV shock waves. We employ a visual inspection of flare events that generate LCPFs using Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) coronagraph images to find that coronal waves associated with CMEs propagate noticeably faster. Then we examine GOES soft X-ray (SXR) data of standalone flare events (those that generate coronal waves without CMEs), focusing on soft X-ray (SXR) characteristics related to magnetic energy release rate. This reveals that such standalone or confined flares differ from sunquake flares: they are less impulsive and energetic than sunquake flares. However, they are more impulsive but less energetic than LCPF-associated flares with a CME. In particular, coronal waves accompanied by CMEs exhibit significantly higher volume emission measures, suggesting a different generation mechanism.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20096" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">H$_2^{18}$O in the terrestrial planet-forming regions of protoplanetary disks</a><span class="id">[2601.20096]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Isotopologues play an important role in solar system cosmochemistry studies, revealing details of early planet formation physics and chemistry. Oxygen isotopes, as measured in solar system materials, reveal evidence for both mass-dependent fractionation processes and a mass-independent process commonly attributed to isotope-selective photodissociation of CO in the solar nebula. The sensitivity of JWST's MIRI-MRS enables studies of isotopologues in the terrestrial planet-forming regions around nearby young stars. We report here on a search for H$_2^{18}$O in 22 disks from the JDISC Survey with evidence for substantial water vapor reservoirs, with the goal of measuring H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O ratios, and potentially revealing the predicted enhancement of H$_2^{18}$O caused by isotope-selective photodissociation. We find marginal detections of H$_2^{18}$O in six disks, and a more significant detection of H$_2^{18}$O in the disk around WSB 52. Modeling of the detected H$_2^{18}$O lines assuming an ISM ratio of H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O predicts H$_2^{18}$O features consistent with observations for four of the modeled disks, but stronger H$_2^{18}$O features than are observed in three of the modeled disks, which includes WSB 52. Therefore, these latter three disks require a higher H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O ratio than the ISM in the water-emitting region, in contrast to long-standing theoretical expectations. We suggest that either the H$_2^{18}$O-rich water has been removed from the emitting region and replaced by H$_2^{18}$O-poor water formed by reactions with $^{18}$O-poor CO, or that the gas-phase water is depleted in $^{18}$O via mass-dependent fractionation processes at the water snowline.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion Properties of the Young Brown Dwarf 2MASS J08440915-7833457</a><span class="id">[2601.20101]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present HST-COS FUV and -STIS optical observations towards the young accreting brown dwarf 2MASS-J08440915-7833457 (J0844) from the ULLYSES DDT Program. We analyse hot FUV lines such C IV, Si IV, and N V, as well as fluorescent emission from H2. Despite evidence for accretion, the C IV line profiles are narrower than in typical classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs), resembling weak-lined T Tauri stars more closely. Additionally, the C IV integrated line flux does not follow the level expected of an accreting object in the magnetically saturated regime. However, comparing J0844 to appropriate low mass analogs, J0844 does show excess C IV emission characteristic of accretion, suggesting the magnetic saturation level may need to be redefined for the lowest mass objects. The C IV/Si IV emission line ratio is found to be 20, which is higher than most CTTSs, with a few exceptions (e.g., TW Hya). We fit the STIS optical spectrum to calculate an accretion rate, which we find to be 4.2 x 10-11 Msol/yr. The accretion rate found based on the empirical LCIV-Macc relationship is twoorders of magnitude higher, suggesting this relationship may not hold at the lowest masses. We find the H2 emission appears to originate within the co-rotation radius, pointing to either disc truncation well inside the co-rotation radius or additional sources of H2 emission that we do not consider (e.g., from the accretion flow itself). These data provide an extension of our current understanding of accretion and inner disc conditions to the relatively unexplored lowest mass regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The TDE Population from First-Principles Models of Stellar Disruption and Debris Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2601.20110]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a physically-grounded population model for optical tidal disruption events (TDEs) that combines first-principles hydrodynamic simulations of stellar disruption with statistical inference of the underlying stellar and black hole populations. The model's prediction of peak luminosity is based directly on recent global simulations that follow the disruption self-consistently and contains no tunable parameters related to the emission physics. We construct the predicted joint distribution of peak luminosity and black hole mass, including both full and partial disruptions, and compare it to a sample of observed TDEs using Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We find that the model reproduces the distribution in the ($M_{BH},L_{peak}$) plane for the bulk of the observed TDE population with good statistical consistency. The data strongly favor an old stellar population, with a sharp suppression of stars above $M_* \simeq 1.5 - 2 M_\odot$. They also indicate that, at fixed stellar mass, the volumetric TDE rate is nearly independent of black hole mass. Partial disruptions contribute a substantial fraction ($\sim 30\%$) of detected events in flux-limited samples and are essential for reproducing the observed distribution. The inferred population properties are robust to different approximations to the stellar mass-radius relation, although the event rate at high luminosity is sensitive to the form of this relation for massive stars. We predict a large population of difficult to detect low luminosity TDEs, implying that the true volumetric TDE rate may exceed that inferred from present samples by up to an order of magnitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asymmetrical thermonuclear supernovae triggered by the tidal disruption of white dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2601.20133]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In a dense star cluster core, a tidal disruption event (TDE) of a white dwarf (WD) can occur if the WD passes within the tidal radius of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Very close encounters cause extreme tidal compression in the WD, raising temperatures enough to induce runaway fusion and produce a thermonuclear supernova (SN). Using the hydrodynamics code AREPO augmented with a 55-isotope nuclear reaction network, we performed high-resolution simulations of the TDE of a $0.6$ Msun C/O WD by a $500$ Msun IMBH for different values of the scaled impact parameter $b$ (i.e., the ratio of periapsis distance to tidal radius). Closer encounters produce combined TDE+SN events, with a partial burning of $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O into heavier isotopes – the $^{56}$Ni fractions of the disrupted WD material vary from 1% at $b = 0.19$ to 82% at $b = 0.10$, while wider ones ($b \gtrsim 0.20$) lead to standard TDEs. In all cases, the material away from the denser regions remains unburnt, spanning a wide range of radial velocities. Such WD TDEs also exhibit a central cavity, wherein little material is found below a radial velocity of several $1000 \,\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$. We also performed 1D and 2D radiative-transfer calculations for these WD-TDEs using the codes CMFGEN and LONGPOL, respectively, covering epochs from a few days to one hundred days. We recover the typical rise times and peak luminosities of SNe Ia, but with an extremely strong viewing-angle dependence of both light curves and spectra. At nebular times, isolated strong emission lines like [Ca ii] {\lambda}{\lambda} 7291, 7323 may appear both displaced and skewed by many $1000 \,\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$ – such extreme offsets are harder to identify at earlier times due to optical depth effects and line overlap. WD TDEs may produce a diverse set of transients with extreme asymmetry and peculiar composition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A dynamical systems approach to studying the equivalence principle in dilaton gravity</a><span class="id">[2601.20156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study a string-inspired dilaton cosmology in the Damour–Polyakov (DP) regime using dynamical-systems methods, aiming to make explicit how cosmological relaxation controls deviations from the equivalence principle. Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20210" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamma-ray Emission from the S147 Region: Indication of Escaping Cosmic Rays Interacting with Molecular Clouds</a><span class="id">[2601.20210]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed analysis of $\gamma$-ray emission from the middle-aged supernova remnant (SNR) S147 (G180.0$-$1.7) using approximately 16.5 years of Fermi-LAT data. Spatially, a new extended $\gamma$-ray component distinct from the emission associated with the H$\alpha$ filaments of the SNR shell is identified. This new component exhibits a strong spatial correlation with dense molecular clouds (MCs) identified in CO emission at Local Standard of Rest velocities of $0$-$5\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Spectrally, the cloud-associated emission implies an underlying cosmic-ray (CR) proton population described by a hard power law with an index of $\Gamma \approx 2.1$, compatible with the standard diffusive shock acceleration prediction. We interpret the $\gamma$-ray emission in this region with a hadronic scenario involving two distinct CR populations: trapped CRs reaccelerated within the radiative SNR shell as proposed in previous work, and escaping CRs illuminating the nearby MCs. The derived CR proton intensity in the MC region significantly exceeds the local Galactic background measured by AMS-02, strongly suggesting that the cloud is illuminated by particles accelerated by S147. These findings provide observational evidence for CR escape during the earlier evolutionary phases of this middle-aged SNR and highlight S147 as a promising candidate for detection at TeV energies by LHAASO.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital stability of compact three-planet systems III. The role of three-body resonances</a><span class="id">[2601.20220]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observational surveys show that at least   30% of short-period multiplanetary systems host tightly packed planets, some of which are locked in stable chains of mean-motion resonances. Despite recent progress, the dynamical stability of these systems remains only partially understood. Numerical simulations have established a general exponential increase in system lifetime with orbital separation, with mean-motion resonances playing a key role in regulating stability. Tightly packed three-planet systems exhibit a distinctive behavior not seen in higher-multiplicity systems: a small yet significant region of phase space is anomalously stable. This study investigates the dynamics of extremely compact three-planet systems, focusing on anomalously long-lived configurations and their connection to resonant chains observed in exoplanetary systems. We perform numerical integrations of coplanar, initially circular, equal-mass three-planet systems over stellar-lifetime timescales and at high resolution in orbital separation, and interpret the results in the context of recent analytical work. We identify regions of phase space hosting anomalously stable orbits, including systems surviving multiple orders of magnitude longer than predicted by the exponential trend. We demonstrate a clear link between stability and isolated three-body mean-motion resonances, showing that extremely compact systems can remain stable when captured into a small subset of isolated zeroth-order resonances. Stability further depends on the initial orbital longitudes and on the interplay between the three-body and two-body resonance networks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Model independent test of the FLRW metric and the curvature in light of DESI DR2</a><span class="id">[2601.20293]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform a data-driven test of the FLRW metric and the flatness of the Universe, independently of any Dark Energy model, and in light of the latest DESI DR2 results.

Then, combining the various reconstructions with the recent BAO measurements from DESI DR2, we perform the $\mathcal{O}_k$ diagnostic, a litmus test of the FLRW metric and the flatness of the Universe. We obtain robust results that do not depend on Dark Energy models and test some of the underlying hypotheses of the concordance model. We find that when the reconstructed $\mathcal{O}_k$ diagnostic is consistent with the FLRW metric, then the median value of $\Oko$ over all reconstructions that provide an improved fit relative to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model are: ${\Omega}_{k,0}^\text{med} = 0.035 ^{+0.046}_{-0.079}\pm 0.037$ for the Pantheon+ &amp; DESI DR2 data combination, ${\Omega}_{k,0}^\text{med} = 0.092 ^{+0.055}_{-0.132} \pm 0.064$ for the same data but with the Pantheon+ SNIa cut at redshift $z=1.13$, which is the maximum redshift of the DES Y5 data, and ${\Omega}_{k,0}^\text{med} = -0.119^{+0.113}_{-0.047}\pm 0.043$ for DES Y5 &amp; DESI DR2.

Starting from the exact Laplace-space solution derived from the generalized master equation with memory kernel $K(t) \propto t^{-\nu}e^{-t/\tau_c}$, we develop a systematic perturbation expansion in the turbulence strength parameter $\xi$. The expansion is performed around the high-density matter basis where $\cos 2\theta_m \approx 1$, rather than the vacuum basis, reflecting the physical conditions in supernova cores. We obtain explicit expressions for the first few perturbation terms and derive the general structure of higher-order terms, which involve Mittag-Leffler functions that emerge from the fractional dynamics. Using high-precision numerical methods (multiple-precision arithmetic and asymptotic expansions), we analyze the convergence radius and rate of the perturbation series. We find that for $\xi &lt; \xi_c \approx 0.8$, the series converges with error decreasing geometrically. For $\xi = 0.16$ (typical supernova conditions), third-order perturbation theory achieves $\sim 1\%$ accuracy. We provide practical guidelines for applying perturbation theory to realistic astrophysical scenarios and validate all analytical results with extensive numerical computations. Our work clarifies several subtle aspects of the perturbative approach that were not addressed in the original literature, offering a complete toolkit for researchers studying neutrino-turbulence interactions. In particular, we systematically address the ultraviolet divergence of the correlation function at short time scales for spectral indices $\nu \geq 1$, introducing a physical small-scale cutoff regularization that ensures mathematical rigor for the fractional master equation and perturbative expansion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self-consistent $N$-body simulation of Planetesimal-Driven Migration. II. The effect of PDM on planet formation from a planetesimal disk</a><span class="id">[2601.20348]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>According to the canonical planet formation theory, planets form &quot;in-situ&quot; within a planetesimal disk via runaway and oligarchic growth. This theory, however, cannot naturally account for the formation timescale of ice giants or the existence of diverse exoplanetary systems. Planetary migration is a key to resolving these problems. One well-known mechanism of planetary migration is planetesimal-driven migration (PDM), which can let planets undergo significant migration through gravitational scattering of planetesimals. In our previous paper (Jinno et al. 2024, PASJ, 76, 1309), we investigated the migration of a single planet through PDM, addressing previously unexplored aspects of both the gravitational interactions among planetesimals and the interactions with disk gas. Here we perform the first high-resolution simulations of planet formation from a large-scale planetesimal disk, incorporating planet-gas disk interactions, planet-planetesimal interactions, gravitational interactions among all planetesimals, and physical collisions between planetesimals to investigate the role of PDM in the planet formation process. Our results show that protoplanets undergo dynamic inward/outward migrations during the runaway growth stage via PDM. Moreover, orbital repulsion combined with PDM tends to make two groups of protoplanets, outer ones going outward and inner ones going inward. Such dynamic migration significantly influences the early stages of planetary formation. These findings provide a viable pathway for the formation of Earth-like planets and ice giants' cores. Furthermore, they suggest that a standard protoplanetary disk model can account for the planetary migration necessary to explain diverse exoplanetary systems without the need for additional hypotheses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observations of the temporal evolution of Saturn's stratosphere following the Great Storm of 2010-2011. II. Latitudinal distribution of CO and stratospheric winds</a><span class="id">[2601.20359]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Saturn's Great Storm of 2010-2011 has produced two stratospheric hot spots, the &quot;beacons,&quot; that eventually merged to produce a gigantic one in April and May 2011. This beacon perturbed stratospheric temperatures, hydrocarbon, and water abundances for several years. We aim to assess whether the beacon induced any perturbation in another oxygen species, namely CO. A second goal is to measure how the vortex perturbed the stratospheric wind regime. We conducted interferometric observations of Saturn in the submillimeter range with SMA and ALMA to spatially resolve the CO (J=3-2) and (J=2-1) emissions, respectively. We used a previously determined CO vertical profile as a template, to search for (i) the meridional distribution of CO and (ii) variations of the CO abundance associated with the storm. The high spatial and spectral resolutions of the ALMA observations enabled us to retrieve the winds from the Doppler shifts induced by the winds on the lines. Despite limitations resulting from the removal of baseline ripples, we find a relatively constant meridional distribution of CO. The average CO mole fraction implied by the adopted and rescaled 220-year-old-comet-impact vertical profile is (1.7$\pm$0.7)$\times10^{-7}$ at 0.3 mbar, i.e., where the contribution functions peak. We also find that the CO abundance has not been noticeably altered in the beacon. The winds measured at 1 mbar show striking differences with those measured in 2018, after the demise of the beacon. We find the signature of the vortex as an anticyclonic feature. The equatorial prograde jet is 100 to 200 m.s$^{-1}$ slower, and broader in latitude, than in quiescent conditions. We also detect several prograde jets in the southern hemisphere. Finally, we detect a retrograde jet at 74$^\circ$N which could be a polar jet caused by the interaction of the Saturn magnetosphere with its atmosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast variability and circular polarization of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser in G33.641$-$0.228</a><span class="id">[2601.20371]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 6.7 GHz methanol maser in a high-mass star-forming region G33.641$-$0.228 is known to exhibit burst-like flux variability due to an unknown mechanism. To investigate the burst mechanism, we conducted high-cadence flux and circular polarization monitoring observations, simultaneously using left- and right-hand circular polarizations. We found that the flux density increased and decreased on a short timescale of 0.3 d during a burst. We also found strong circular polarization, reaching up to 20\% in the component exhibiting the bursts. Circular polarization of 0–20\% was continuously observed from 2009 to 2016, even in the quiescent period. The polarization also varied on timescales of less than one day. When a burst occurred and the flux density increased, the circular polarization decreased to zero. To explain the observational properties of the flux variability and circular polarization, we propose a model in which an explosive event similar to a solar radio burst occurs on the line of sight behind the maser cloud, producing circularly polarized continuum emission due to gyro-synchrotron or gyro-resonance radiation, which is then amplified by the maser.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20446" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Diversity of Type Ia Supernova Remnants in 3-D Hydrodynamic Simulations with X-ray Spectral Synthesis</a><span class="id">[2601.20446]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type Ia supernovae (SNe), thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs in binary systems, are widely used as standard candles owing to the empirical width-luminosity relation of their light curves. Recent theoretical and observational studies indicate a diversity of progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms. In the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, the diversity in Fe-K$\alpha$ centroid energies and line luminosities suggests variations in the underlying explosion mechanisms. X-ray spectra of SNRs, which trace shocked ejecta and the surrounding medium, are crucial diagnostics of progenitor systems and explosion physics. Thanks to recent advances in spectroscopy with XRISM, high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy enables 3-D diagnostics, including line-of-sight velocities. In this study, we perform 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs from six Type Ia explosion models: two each of pure deflagration, delayed detonation, and double detonation. Each model is evolved for 1000 years in a uniform medium, consistently accounting for non-equilibrium ionization. Our efficient numerical scheme enables systematic parameter surveys in full 3-D. From these models, we synthesize X-ray spectra with $\sim$1 eV resolution, exceeding XRISM/Resolve's spectral resolution. This work presents the first calculation of X-ray spectra for Type Ia SNRs derived from 3-D hydrodynamic simulations that follow the evolution self-consistently from the SN phase into the SNR phase. Our results show inter-model diversity in the X-ray spectra. Asymmetric, red- and blueshifted line profiles arise from the 3-D ejecta distributions. These findings demonstrate that 3-D SNR modeling can reproduce the observed diversity of Type Ia SNRs and provide qualitative constraints on progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20471" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A multi-technique search for year-scale $γ$-ray quasi-periodic modulation in the high-redshift FSRQ PKS 2052$-$47</a><span class="id">[2601.20471]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate year-scale quasi-periodic oscillations in the $\gamma$-ray emission of the high-redshift flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 2052$-$47 using monthly binned \emph{Fermi}-LAT data spanning MJD 54727.99–58507.99. To assess the statistical significance of periodic features embedded in red-noise-dominated variability, we apply several complementary timing techniques, including the Lomb–Scargle periodogram, weighted wavelet $Z$-transform, date-compensated discrete Fourier transform, REDFIT assuming an AR(1) process, and damped random walk modelling. The analyses reveal a dominant quasi-periodic modulation on a timescale of $\sim600$–630 d, together with a secondary longer-timescale feature near $\sim1050$–1110 d. Monte Carlo simulations show that the shorter-period signal exceeds the highest local confidence levels, while the longer modulation reaches $\gtrsim99$ per cent local significance in several tests; independent DRW-based simulations place both peaks above the $4\sigma$ envelope in the Lomb–Scargle analysis. Spectral-window diagnostics indicate that the detected periodicities are not artefacts of uneven sampling, and a sliding-window analysis shows that the QPO power is episodic across the $\sim11$ yr baseline. We discuss possible physical interpretations in terms of geometric Doppler modulation associated with jet precession or helical motion, accretion-driven instabilities, and SMBBH-induced dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interaction of Black Hole Magnetospheres with Inclined Ambient Fields</a><span class="id">[2601.20472]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic fields play a central role in black hole astrophysics, powering relativistic jets and other energetic phenomena. While near-horizon magnetic field is usually assumed to originate from the accretion flow, additional large-scale magnetic fields - such as those supplied by a companion neutron star in stellar-mass binaries or by galactic fields around supermassive black holes - may also affect the horizon-threading flux. In this work, we study the superposition of a weak arbitrarily inclined external uniform magnetic field with the internal Blandford-Znajek split-monopole field around a Schwarzschild black hole. This setup generically gives rise to magnetic null points, where the total field vanishes. We compute the magnetic flux through an arbitrarily tilted hemisphere of the event horizon and show that the flux can be substantially suppressed by the external field. In the axisymmetric case, the flux can even vanish completely. However, with nonzero inclination, complete cancellation becomes impossible, despite significant reduction. We further explore the ionization and subsequent particle acceleration from a Keplerian accretion disk, finding that efficient collimated outflows persist even under significant field inclination. We show that the acceleration is critically dependent on the external field orientation, with the escape fraction maximized at non-zero inclinations due to the destabilization of trapping zones and minimized in the anti-aligned configuration, where closed magnetic loops effectively suppress the outflow. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these findings, proposing that geometric flux cancellation can serve as a mechanism for jet quenching in compact binaries and offering an explanation for the lack of a prominent large-scale jet in Sgr A*.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20495" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultraviolet Signatures of Jet-Ejecta Interaction in Early Kilonovae: Prediction from Realistic Atomic Opacities</a><span class="id">[2601.20495]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the signature of the jet-ejecta interaction in early kilonova (t &lt; 1day) using detailed atomic opacities developed in Banerjee et al. (2020, 2024), appropriate for early times (t 1hour after merger). We explore jets with different powers and opening angles. We find that the presence of the jet shifts the spectral peak to longer wavelengths, with the strongest effect near the polar viewing angle. This occurs because the jet creates a thin, low-density outer layer ahead of the bulk ejecta. The opacity of this layer can be as high as kappa  200 cm2/g, causing photons to escape from cooler, faster-moving outer layer rather than from the hot inner ejecta. The bolometric light curves likewise exhibit a clear imprint of the jet-ejecta interaction, showing suppressed early-time luminosity near polar viewing angles compared to the equatorial one, as the photosphere resides in this thin layer where radioactive heating is lower than in the bulk ejecta. These signatures are also evident in multi-color light curves, particularly in the ultraviolet and u-bands. In the Swift-UVW2 band at t = 0.15 days for a source at 100 Mpc, the ultraviolet luminosities can reach   19.5 mag if no jet is present, while the presence of the jet can make it fainter by   2.5 mag. The strongest observational signature occurs in the UVEX-NUV, Swift-UVW2, and UVM2 bands, which remains detectable out to viewing angles of   60 deg for t &lt;=1 days. Rapid follow-up with future ultraviolet facilities, such as ULTRASAT and UVEX, will provide powerful probes of jet-ejecta interaction through early-time kilonova observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPT-3G D1: A Measurement of Secondary Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropy Power</a><span class="id">[2601.20551]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report new measurements of millimeter-wave temperature power spectra in the angular multipole range $1700 \le \ell \le 11,000$ (wavelengths $13^\prime \gtrsim \lambda \gtrsim 2^\prime$). We use two years of data in three observing bands centered near 95, 150, and 220 GHz from the SPT-3G receiver on the South Pole Telescope that cover a 1646 deg$^2$ region of the Southern sky. Using the measured power spectra, we present constraints on the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects, radio galaxies, and cosmic infrared background (CIB). We find that inferred SZ powers are dependent on the detailed modeling of the thermal SZ-CIB correlation, and to a lesser extent on the assumed angular dependence of the SZ spectra. We report constraints for simulation-based model templates as well as fits where the angular dependencies of the SZ and CIB power spectra are allowed to vary. In the latter case at $\ell=3000$, we find thermal SZ power at 143 GHz of $D_{3000}^{\rm tSZ} = 4.91\pm0.37\, \mu{\rm K}^2$ and kinematic SZ power of $D_{3000}^{\rm kSZ} =1.75\pm0.86\, \mu{\rm K}^2$.

Building from Earth as the only known inhabited planet, NCCR PlanetS has developed models, tools and observational strategies to assess planetary environments far beyond direct reach. Between 2018 and 2025, PlanetS made major contributions across theory, modelling, instrumentation and mission preparation. On the modelling side, the Generic Planetary Climate Model enabled climate studies across a wide range of planetary regimes, from early Venus to temperate terrestrial exoplanets including Proxima b, incorporating advanced developments such as a dynamical slab ocean. In parallel, the THOR global climate model was developed to avoid Earth-centric assumptions and to stably simulate diverse atmospheric regimes. PlanetS has also advanced atmospheric retrieval techniques combining forward modelling, Bayesian inference and machine learning, applied to targets ranging from Solar System bodies to exoplanet phase curves and directly imaged spectra. These efforts have helped assess the scientific return of future missions, notably the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) and to define instrumental requirements for detecting Earth-like atmospheres and biosignatures. Within the Solar System, PlanetS contributed key technologies for biosignature detection, including ORIGIN and SenseLife, enabling in-situ and remote detection of organics, isotopic ratios and microstructures. Finally, PlanetS has played a major role in preparing the next generation of observatories, from JWST, VLT and ELT instruments to LIFE and the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Together, these contributions form an integrated framework advancing the search for life beyond Earth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20633" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apparent Dark-Energy Evolution from Cosmic Inhomogeneities</a><span class="id">[2601.20633]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A mildly inhomogeneous universe with a cosmological constant may look like it contains evolving dark energy. We show that could be the case by modelling the inhomogeneities and their effects in three different ways: as clumped matter surrounded by voids, as back-reaction of small-scale structure on the overall expansion of the Universe, and, finally, as a large-scale curvature inhomogeneity. In all of these cases, the propagation of light is affected, and differs from that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The net result is that cosmological observables, such as angular diameter and luminosity distances, become distorted. We find, in all three models, that the inclusion of these effects pushes the distance-redshift relation towards closer agreement with recent data from both supernovae Ia from the Dark Energy Survey, and from baryon acoustic oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. The amount of inhomogeneity in these models might not be enough to explain the entirety of the deviation from a cosmological constant, but is found to be of a similar order of magnitude, hinting that these data may be consistent with a universe dominated by a cosmological constant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20648" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the rotational properties of M-type asteroids: recent evidence for higher rotation rates</a><span class="id">[2601.20648]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rotational dynamics of asteroids carry important information about their internal structure, collisional history and material composition.

The results remain robust across different ways of controlling for asteroid size and sampling biases. While limitations remain due to sample size, heterogeneous data sources, and possible selection effects, the convergence of independent methods strengthens the conclusion that metallic composition is associated with higher rotation rates.

By analyzing high-resolution spectroscopy, alongside DR3 Gaia astrometry, and bolometric fluxes, we derive updated fundamental parameters for both components. In particular, we uncover a significant chemical difference: the primary is metal-poor ([Fe/H]$ \simeq - 0.57$), while the secondary shows solar-like metallicity ([Fe/H]$=0.00$). This suggests that the system originated in a mildly metal-poor environment, consistent with the Galactic thick disk population, and that the secondary's surface composition has been altered by a recent accretion event. Using multi-sector TESS photometry, we detected solar-like oscillations in both components, deriving global asteroseismic parameters $\Delta\nu = 43.32 \pm 3.91 \mu$Hz, $\nu_{\rm max} = 708.74^{+3.23}_{-3.74} \mu$Hz for HD81809 A, and $\Delta\nu = 97.75 \pm 4.49~\mu$Hz, $\nu_{\rm max} = 2098.07^{+3.07}_{-2.83} \mu$Hz for HD81809 B.

An alternate approach is based on catalogs of galaxies, supplemented with some scheme for filling in for unseen galaxies. Here, we compare the density field proposed by Biteau (2021) with the quasi-linear density field of CosmicFlows2 (Hoffman et al. 2018) and the mean posterior field of CosmicFlows4 (Valade 2026).

We focus on two one-loop perturbation theory models – the effective field theory (EFT) and velocity difference generator (${\rm VDG_ \infty}$) – which differ in their treatment of the real-to-redshift space mapping on small scales, and a third approach, the BACCO emulator, which adopts a hybrid strategy combining perturbation theory with high-resolution N-body simulations. We assess the ability of these models to recover key cosmological parameters, including the expansion rate $h$, the cold dark matter density parameter $\omega_{\rm c}$, and the scalar amplitude $A_{\rm s}$, across four redshift bins spanning $0.9 \leq z \leq 1.8$. In each bin, we find that ${\rm VDG_ \infty}$ and BACCO outperform the EFT model across all scales up to $k_{max} \lesssim 0.35 h\,Mpc^{-1} $. While BACCO saturates in constraining power at intermediate scales and higher redshift, the ${\rm VDG_ \infty}$ model continues to improve parameter constraints beyond $k_{max} \gtrsim 0.30 h\,Mpc^{-1}$. The EFT model, although robust on large scales, exhibits significant parameter biases for $k_{max} \gtrsim 0.25 h\,Mpc^{-1}$, limiting its applicability to Euclid-like H$\alpha$ samples. Among the full perturbation theory-based models, the enhanced treatment of small-scale RSD effects in ${\rm VDG_ \infty}$ improves cosmological parameter constraints by up to a factor of two.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20849" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme winds on the emerging dayside of an ultrahot Jupiter</a><span class="id">[2601.20849]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-resolution spectroscopy provides a unique opportunity to directly probe atmospheric dynamics by resolving Doppler shifts of planetary signal as a function of orbital phases.

We spectrally and temporally resolve its dayside emission from post-transit to pre-eclipse (orbital phase phi = 0.1 - 0.45). The signal strength and width increase with orbital phases as the dayside rotates into view. The net Doppler shift varies progressively from -13.4 +/- 0.6 to -0.4 +/- 1.0 km/s, the extent of which exceeds its rotation velocity of 6.4 +/- 0.1 km/s, providing unambiguous evidence of atmospheric winds. We devise a retrieval framework to fit the full time-series spectra, accounting for the variation of line profiles due to the rotation and winds. We retrieve a supersonic day-to-night wind speed up to 11.7 +/- 0.6 km/s on the emerging dayside, representing the most extreme atmospheric winds in hot Jupiters to date. Comparison to 3D circulation models reveals a weak atmospheric drag, consistent with relatively efficient heat recirculation as also supported by space-based phase curve measurements.

Specifically, inspired by the fact that the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors, all being plateau potentials, result to the same attractor relation between the spectral index of scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is of the form $n_s(r)=1-\alpha r^{1/2}$, in this work we seek for attractors of the form $n_s(r)=f(r)$ that may lead to ACT-compatible inflation. Specifically, we fix the function $f(r)$ to have a specific desirable form and then solve the differential equation $n_s(r)=f(r)$ to find the potential which results to the relation $n_s(r)=f(r)$. We discovered analytically three classes of potentials which are variants of the general form $n_s(r)=\gamma \pm \beta r \pm r^{1/2}$ and all these models are found to be compatible with the ACT data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Remedy of the Trans-Planckian Censorship Problem with Smooth Slow-roll to Power-law Inflation Transitions in Scalar Field Theory</a><span class="id">[2601.20056]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is known that if the standard slow-roll inflation is followed by a power-law inflationary regime, then the trans-Planckian modes may be safely be contained in the Hubble horizon and never exit it during inflation. In this work we investigate how to realize a smooth transition between a slow-roll and a power-law inflationary regime in the context of single scalar field inflation. As we show it is possible to realize such a smooth transition by generalizing the kinetic energy of single scalar field in the form $\dot{\phi}^2=\beta(\phi)V(\phi)$, where $\beta(\phi)$ is some appropriate function of the scalar field. Using two distinct approaches we show that it is possible to realize a smooth transition from a slow-roll to a power-law inflationary regime, and the two approaches produce identical results regarding the slow-roll regime. Also we show that the slow-roll regime is quite short, about $N\sim 30$ $e$-foldings, with the flatness and horizon problems being solved with the synergistic effect of the two inflationary patches. The slow-roll era is found to be compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20286" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum Cosmology as a Hydrogen atom: Discrete $Λ$ and cyclic Universes from Wheeler-DeWitt quantization</a><span class="id">[2601.20286]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Building upon our recently established correspondence between quantum cosmology and the hydrogen atom [1], we investigate the specific sector of a negative cosmological constant ($\Lambda &lt; 0$) in a flat FLRW universe with dust. While the positive $\Lambda$ sector [1] yields a continuous spectrum and a single bounce, we show here that the negative $\Lambda$ sector leads to a discrete spectrum of energy eigenvalues, effectively quantizing the cosmological constant. Within this dual description, the operator-ordering ambiguity parameter appears as the azimuthal quantum number of the hydrogen atom. A skewed Bohr correspondence emerges for the bound states, matching classical evolution at large volumes but deviating near the bounce. By constructing wave packets from these bound states, we demonstrate that the classical Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities are resolved, and the universe oscillates between quantum bounces and classical turnaround points. The expectation values of the observables indicate a cyclic universe – with vanishing Hubble parameter at turnarounds – undergoing quantum bounces. This exactly solvable model offers a tractable setting to explore quantum gravitational effects in cosmology. We analyze the properties of this cyclic universe, contrasting its bound-state dynamics with the scattering states of the de Sitter case.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20530" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pathology of the Unified Dark Sectors in Modified General Relativity</a><span class="id">[2601.20530]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents a comprehensive stability analysis of the black hole solution within Modified General Relativity (MGR), a theory proposing a unified geometric description of dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). A rigorous gauge-invariant formalism is employed to analyze gravitational perturbations of the extended Schwarzschild metric. The central finding is a critical pathology within the polar perturbation sector, where metric fluctuations couple to the theory's fundamental line element field. This coupling is governed by a factor that, while well-behaved at the horizon, diverges powerfully in the far-field limit as a direct consequence of the theory's non-asymptotically flat nature. This indicates a strong infrared instability that overwhelms perturbations at large distances. In stark contrast, the axial perturbation sector is found to be completely stable. This dichotomy proves that the instability is not inherent to the background metric but is specifically generated by the novel coupling mechanism encoding MGR's unified dark sectors. The results reveal a fundamental strong-coupling problem within the MGR framework, challenging its physical viability as an alternative to Einstein's General Relativity (EGR).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunward Streaming 3He-rich SEP Events Observed by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe during Perihelion Passage</a><span class="id">[2601.20624]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on two 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed by Solar Orbiter (SO) and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during the April 1 - 4, 2024 conjunction when both spacecraft are within 0.3 AU near their respective perihelion passage. The two 3He-rich SEP events, originating from active region (AR) 13615, exhibit two key anomalies: (1) sunward streaming SEPs and (2) SEP travel path lengths exceeding 2 - 8 times the nominal Parker spiral expectations. Remote observations suggest these SEPs have been redirected by a slow coronal mass ejection (CME) that also originated from AR 13615 two days prior on March 30, 2024 at 21:04 UT. Using the near-Sun CME speed and width measurements, we estimate its size and location at the onset time of the first 3He-rich SEP event. Based on our estimates, SEPs propagating around the ICME front have travelled between 0.76 - 0.95 AU when they arrive at SO, increasing to 0.94 - 1.1 AU at PSP, consistent with our observed SEP arrival times. These findings constitute the first multi-spacecraft observation of sunward streaming 3He-rich SEPs. We discuss the implications of this phenomenon on 3He-rich seed material and the rare widespread 3He-rich SEP events (see Section 5.4).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graviton energy spectra arising from the KSVZ axion model</a><span class="id">[2601.20767]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axion, the goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a global $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry, provides a dynamical solution to the strong CP problem and is an excellent dark matter candidate. Various experiments are designed to search for the axion, however no confirmative signal has been observed. On the other hand, there are also hypothetical heavy particles in axion models, such as the heavy scalar $s$, which is the CP-even component of the complex scalar that carries $U(1)_{PQ}$ charge, and the vector-like heavy quark (VLQ) in the Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (KSVZ) axion model. Studying signals induced by them are helpful for axion searches. In this paper, we calculate the graviton bremsstrahlung energy spectrum arising from the decay of the heavy scalar or VLQ in the KSVZ model. The result shows that these heavy particles can emit ultrahigh-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), with the peak frequency depending on the model's parameter inputs. In addition, the graviton spectrum is distinguished from the thermal GW background at high frequencies if there is an early matter-dominated era induced by these heavy particles. Future measurements of ultrahigh-frequency GWs may provide indirect evidence for the KSVZ axion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of trapped vacuum bubbles during inflation, and consequences for PBH scenarios</a><span class="id">[2306.09990]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A class of inflationary scenarios for primordial black hole (PBH) formation include a small barrier in the slope of the potential. There, the inflaton slows down, generating an enhancement of primordial perturbations. Moreover, the background solution overcomes the barrier at a very low speed, and large backward quantum fluctuations can prevent certain regions from overshooting the barrier. This leads to localized bubbles where the field remains trapped behind the barrier. In such models, therefore, we have two distinct channels for PBH production: the standard adiabatic density perturbation channel and the bubble channel. Here, we perform numerical simulations of bubble formation, addressing the issues of initial conditions, critical amplitude and bubble expansion. Further, we explore the scaling behaviour of the co-moving size of bubbles with the initial amplitude of the field fluctuation. We find that for small to moderate non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL}\lesssim 2.6$, the threshold for the formation of vacuum bubbles agrees with previous analytical estimates arXiv:1908.11357 to $5\%$ accuracy or so. We also show that the mass distribution for the two channels is different, leading to a slightly broader range of PBH masses. The bubble channel is subdominant for small $f_{\rm NL}$, and becomes dominant for $f_{\rm NL}\gtrsim 2.6$. We find that the mass of PBHs in the bubble channel is determined by an adiabatic overdensity surrounding the bubble at the end of inflation. Remarkably, the profile of this overdensity turns out to be of type-II. This represents a first clear example showing that overdensities of type-II can be dominant relative to the standard type-I. We also comment on exponential tails and on the fact that in models with local type non-Gaussianity (such as the one considered here), the occurrence of alternative channels can easily be inferred from unitarity considerations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unified reconstruction of the Lyman-alpha power spectrum with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</a><span class="id">[2506.08198]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The complex geometry of the Ly$\alpha$ forest data has motivated the use of various two-point statistics as alternatives to the three-dimensional power spectrum ($P_{\mathrm{3D}}$), which carries cosmological information in Fourier space. On large scales, the three-dimensional correlation function ($\xi_\mathrm{3D}$) has provided robust measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale at 150 Mpc. On smaller scales, the one-dimensional power spectrum, $P_{\mathrm{1D}}(k_\|)$, has been the primary tool for extracting information. At the same time, the cross-spectrum, $P_\times(\theta, k_\|)$, has been introduced to incorporate angular information without the complications caused by survey window functions. We propose an analytical forward-modeling framework to reconstruct $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$ from all these observables, based on the mathematical relation between them and $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$. We demonstrate the performance of our method using a hypothetical mock data vector representative of future Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements. We show that the monopole of $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$ can be reconstructed in 25 $k$ bins between $0.07~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $1.8~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, achieving an average precision of $\sigma_P/P=13\%$ across the bins.

Still, the vast majority of supernova (SN) models assume RSG progenitors in hydrostatic equilibrium. Here, we follow the hydrodynamic evolution of RSGs with different masses and the development of radial envelope pulsations. Pulsations significantly alter the observable pre- and post-SN properties, and their importance increases substantially as a function of initial mass. We demonstrate that inferring core masses, let alone initial masses, from a single pre-SN luminosity and effective temperature of high-mass RSGs is inadvisable, as these can vary by an order of magnitude during the pulsation. We find that pulsations can naturally lead to &quot;early-excess&quot; emission in SN light curves and to variations in early photospheric velocities, which can help break degeneracies in type-II SNe. We compare to SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi, for which pulsating RSG progenitors were reported. We demonstrate that the pre- and post-SN characteristics of SN 2023ixf agree very well with our exploding pulsating RSG model and exhibit meaningful differences from hydrostatic models. The data coverage is insufficient to break all degeneracies. We find insufficient evidence for the claimed pulsation period of the SN 2024ggi progenitor, as it matches Spitzer's orbital period. This study underscores the importance of hydrodynamical pre-SN stellar models, in particular for massive stars from $\gtrsim 15\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$. It implies an important shift in our understanding of the last stages of massive star evolution, the interpretation of pre-SN properties, the connection between SNe and their progenitors, and the missing RSG problem.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semi-analytic studies of accretion disk and magnetic field geometry in M87*</a><span class="id">[2508.11760]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: Magnetic fields play a pivotal role in dynamics of black hole accretion flows and formation of relativistic jets. Observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided unprecedented insights into accretion structures near black holes. Interpreting these observations requires a theoretical framework linking polarized emission to underlying system properties and magnetic field geometries. Aims: We investigate how system properties, particularly magnetic field geometry in the event horizon scale region, influence the structure of the observable synchrotron emission in M87*. Specifically, we aim to quantify the sensitivity of observables used by the EHT to black hole spin, plasma dynamics, accretion disk thickness, and magnetic field geometry. Methods: We adopt a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow model in Kerr spacetime. We vary magnetic field geometry, black hole spin, accretion disk dynamics, and geometric thickness of the disk. We perform general relativistic ray tracing with a full polarized radiative transfer to obtain synthetic images of M87*. We extract EHT observables, such as disk diameter, asymmetry, and polarimetric metrics from synthetic models. We also consider a number of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations and compare them with the semi-analytical models. Results: We see limited impact of the disk thickness on observables. On the other hand, toroidal field dominated and poloidal field dominated magnetic configurations can be distinguished reliably. The flow dynamics, in particular presence of radial inflow, also significantly impacts the EHT observables. Conclusions: The M87* system is most consistent with a poloidal magnetic field dominated flow with partially radial inflow. While the spin remain elusive, moderate or large positive values are preferred.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Noisy Timing Behavior is a Feature of Central Compact Object Pulsars</a><span class="id">[2510.02233]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a timing study of the three known central compact object (CCO) pulsars, isolated cooling neutron stars in supernova remnants, using Chandra, XMM-Newton and NICER observations spanning two decades. Relative to canonical young pulsars, CCOs are spinning down at a very slow rate $|\dot f| &lt;10^{-15}$ s$^{-2}$, implying a surface dipole magnetic field strength $B_s &lt; 10^{11}$ G that is too weak to account for their X-ray-emitting hot spots. Two CCO pulsars with sufficiently long monitoring, 1E 1207.4$-$5209 and PSR J0821$-$4300, are seen to deviate from steady spin-down; their timing residuals can be modeled by one or more glitches in $f$ and $\dot f$, or alternatively by extreme timing noise. For the third CCO pulsar, PSR J1852+0400, the sparse temporal coverage was insufficient to detect such effects. Glitch activity and timing noise in large samples of rotation-powered pulsars correlate best with $\dot f$, while the timing irregularities of the first two CCOs are extreme compared to pulsars of the same $\dot f$. Nevertheless, timing activity in CCOs may arise from properties that they share with other young but more energetic pulsars: high internal temperature, strong buried magnetic field and superfluid behavior. Alternatively, continuing low-level accretion of supernova debris is not ruled out as a source of timing noise in CCOs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next-Generation Improvements in Giant Exoplanet Evolutionary and Structural Models</a><span class="id">[2510.08681]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many evolutionary models of giant exoplanets still rely on simplifying assumptions that are no longer adequate given detailed constraints from Jupiter, Saturn, and modern exoplanet observations.

We quantify the effects of updated equations of state, helium rain, fuzzy cores, non-adiabatic and compositionally inhomogeneous envelopes, and improved atmospheric boundary conditions by first isolating the impact of each physical ingredient and then constructing combined baseline models for planets with masses between 0.3 and 4 $M_{\rm Jup}$ to assess their collective influence on planetary structure and observable properties. We find that the adoption of modern equations of state and realistic heavy-element distributions leads to systematic, but sometimes subtle, differences ($\sim 5$ to 10\%) in radius evolution, while helium rain and the treatment of convection can significantly alter thermal histories and atmospheric compositions (by $\sim$ 5 to 20\%). These updated physical processes must be incorporated into the next-generation exoplanet evolutionary models to achieve physically consistent interpretations of planetary observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11467" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proton-rich production of lanthanides: the $νi$ process</a><span class="id">[2510.11467]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The astrophysical origin of the lanthanides is an open question in nuclear astrophysics.

In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A 200. This scenario, christened the $\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites.

Measurements of the dipole ($\ell=1$) in a given sample crucially depend on having control over other large-scale power ($\ell &gt; 1$) so as to avoid biases, in particular those potentially caused by correlations among multipoles during fitting, and those by local source clustering. Currently, the most powerful catalogue that exhibits the cosmic dipole anomaly is the sample of 1.6 million mid-infrared quasars derived from CatWISE2020. We therefore analyse clustering properties of this catalogue by performing an inference analysis of large-scale multipoles in real space, and by computing its angular power spectrum on small scales to test for convergence with $\Lambda$CDM. After accounting for the known trend of the quasar number counts with ecliptic latitude, we find that any other large-scale power is consistent with noise, find no evidence for the presence of an octupole ($\ell=3$) in the data, and quantify the clustering dipole's proportion to be marginal.

We test the formation of CH lines in the solar spectrum, using for the first time, 3D Non-LTE (NLTE) models. We also aim to derive the solar photospheric abundance of C, using the diagnostic transitions in the optical (4218 - 4356 $Å$) and infrared (33025 - 37944 $Å$). We use the updated NLTE model molecule from Popa et al. 2023 and different solar 3D radiation-hydrodynamics model atmospheres. The models are contrasted against new spatially-resolved optical solar spectra, and the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of CH lines is studied. We find generally small ($\sim$0.01 dex) NLTE effects in the optical and IR diagnostic CH A-X lines in the solar atmosphere. Both 3D NLTE and 3D LTE spectral modelling yield an excellent fit to the solar intensity observations at all viewing angles. The 1D LTE and 1D NLTE models fail to describe the line CLV, and lead to underestimated solar C abundances. The 3D NLTE modelling of diagnostic lines in the optical and IR yields a carbon abundance of A(C)=8.52$\pm$0.07 dex. The estimate is in agreement with recent results based on neutrino fluxes measured by Borexino. 3D NLTE modelling and tests on spatially-resolved solar data are essential to derive robust solar abundances. The analysis presented here focuses on CH, but we expect that similar effects will be present for other molecules of astrophysical interest.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Origins of the Bulk flow</a><span class="id">[2512.03168]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the origin of the large-scale bulk flow using the CosmicFlows-4 (CF4) peculiar-velocity catalog.

A weighted-average technique is developed to test the model's self-consistency while minimizing the impact of non-Gaussian distance errors. The CF4 velocities show excellent agreement with the predicted internal field, yielding beta = 0.31 pm 0.01. We also determine that the value of the Hubble constant that should be used for calculating peculiar velocities from the CF4 to be H0 = 75.0 pm 0.1 km/s/Mpc, consistent with CF4 calibrations. Using the minimum-variance formalism, we further separate the bulk flow into its internal and external contributions and find that the observed large-scale bulk flow is dominated by sources beyond 200 Mpc/h. The amplitude of this externally driven flow increases monotonically with scale, consistent with the influence of a distant, massive overdensity. These findings reinforce the reliability of the CF4 velocity field while calling into question the assumption of a spatially uniform flow generated by external sources. Our results challenge the commonly made hypothesis that the flow in our local volume due to external mass concentrations can be modeled as being spatially uniform.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04986" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau</a><span class="id">[2512.04986]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau with a sharp transition to slow roll.

From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-wavelength Signatures of Supernova Shock Breakout from Red Supergiants in Two Dimensions</a><span class="id">[2512.08212]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of supernova shock breakout from red supergiants using the $\texttt{CASTRO}$ code. Our progenitors are 20 and 25 M$_{\odot}$ solar-metallicity stars evolved from the zero-age main sequence with $\texttt{MESA}$ and exploded in one dimension using $\texttt{FLASH}$. We consider a range of circumstellar media (CSM) produced by stellar winds to investigate how pre-explosion mass-loss affects shock breakout. The multigroup flux-limited diffusion scheme in $\texttt{CASTRO}$ captures the interaction between the explosion shock, its radiation precursor, and the surrounding CSM. We find that strong radiation precursors, generated by radiation leakage behind the shock, can drive fluid instabilities and move the effective photosphere outward before the shock reaches the stellar surface. The resulting breakout emissions reach peak luminosities of ${\sim}10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with full-width half-maximum durations of 1-3 hr, , fainter and longer than previous 1D models. The light-curve colors gradually evolve from blue to red after the peak. The 25 M$_{\odot}$ model with explosion energy $E \sim 1.69\times10^{51}$ erg produces ${\sim}$10-30\% higher maximum luminosity than the 20 M$_{\odot}$ model with $E \sim 1.09\times10^{51}$ erg. The dense CSM further extends the breakout rise time by increasing the photon diffusion. These results provide new constraints on red supergiant atmospheres and mass-loss histories prior to core collapse.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An eclipsing 8.56 minute orbital period mass-transferring binary</a><span class="id">[2601.07925]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of ATLAS J101342.5-451656.8 (hereafter ATLAS J1013-4516), an 8.56 minute orbital period mass transferring AM Canum Venaticorum binary with mean Gaia magnitude G=19.51. The system was identified via periodic variability in Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System light curves of Gaia white dwarf candidates. Follow-up spectroscopy with the Large Lenslet Array Magellan Spectrograph reveals a helium dominated accretion disk, while high speed ULTRACAM photometry shows pronounced primary and secondary eclipses. We construct a decade long orbital timing baseline using ATLAS and Gaia survey photometry together with high speed observations from ULTRACAM on the NTT and proto Lightspeed on the Magellan Clay telescope. From this baseline we measure an orbital period derivative Pdot = -1.60 +/- 0.07 x 10^-12 seconds per second. Interpreted in the context of stable mass transfer, the magnitude and sign of Pdot indicate orbital evolution governed by the interplay between gravitational wave driven angular momentum losses and mass transfer, directly probing the donor star structural response to mass loss. Assuming angular momentum loss dominated by gravitational radiation, we constrain the component masses and infer the characteristic gravitational wave strain. We predict a four year Laser Interferometer Space Antenna signal to noise ratio greater than 10, establishing ATLAS J1013-4516 as a strong prospective space based gravitational wave source that probes long term orbital evolution in the mass transferring regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11272" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suppression of Fast Flavor Conversion by Red Turbulence in Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2601.11272]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast flavor conversions (FFCs) in supernovae, driven by neutrino-neutrino refraction, can catastrophically equilibrate flavors and potentially affect the neutrino-driven explosion. We present a pivotal insight: matter density fluctuations characterized by \textit{extremely red spectra} ($\nu&lt;0$, where $|\nu| \equiv -\nu &gt; 0$) naturally arising in stratified supernova environments, can suppress such instabilities by inducing accelerated decoherence. By deriving exact analytical solutions for two-flavor evolution in red turbulent matter-where correlations grow as $t^{|\nu|}$-we uncover a novel \textit{acceleration of coherence loss}. This dynamical decoherence mechanism raises an effective energy barrier against the collective growth of flavor instabilities. Translating our master-equation results into an effective damping rate for FFC linear analysis, we find that realistic red turbulence ($\nu \sim -1$, fluctuation strength $\xi \sim 0.1$) can elevate the FFC threshold by a factor of $\sim 3-5$, potentially stabilizing regions that would otherwise undergo explosion-killing flavor equilibration {(or vice versa)}. Our work provides the first analytical criterion for FFC suppression in turbulent media and identifies red turbulence as a critical, physics-grounded ingredient missing from current supernova models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12508" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nuclear astrophysics</a><span class="id">[2601.12508]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reactions between atomic nuclei are measured in great detail in terrestrial laboratory experiments; transferring and extrapolating this knowledge to how the same reactions act within cosmic environments presents major challenges. Cross-disciplinary efforts are needed in view of the many nuclear reactions that govern the chemical evolution of the universe, and occur in a broad range of stellar plasma conditions that require astrophysical exploration. Since the early identification of 'processes' of nucleosynthesis, new insights have been obtained on the complexity of nuclear reaction mechanisms. We use 12C induced capture and fusion processes to illustrate the challenge of low-energy measurements and of using theoretical methods to extrapolate measurements towards energy regimes within cosmic sources. Particle beam experiments at accelerator facilities above and deep underground simulate stellar reactions, new experimental facilities and methods complement these, and this is further complemented by improved theoretical tools to calculate the quantum effects of nuclear reactions at the various cosmic conditions. Astronomical signatures of cosmic nuclear reactions are deduced from light curves characterizing cosmic explosions through gamma-ray lines and presolar grains to the detection of rare neutrino particles from our Sun to distant cosmic events. High resolution spectroscopy of stars has been expanded to objects measured in the X-ray and the gamma energy range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Astro-seismology and isotopic analysis of meteoritic inclusions provide new tools. Chemical-evolution models describe the complex dynamics during the evolution of galaxies. This article summarizes the experimental and theoretical work, and the broad range of observational tools that test the experimental data and the theoretical interpretation of nuclear processes in the cosmos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19584" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond solar metallicity: How enhanced solid content in disks re-shape low-mass planet torques</a><span class="id">[2601.19584]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The migration of low-mass planets is tightly controlled by the torques exerted by both gas and solids in their natal disks. While canonical models assume a solar solid-to-gas mass ratio (epsilon=0.01) and neglect the back-reaction of solid component of the disk, recent work suggests that enhanced metallicity can radically alter these torques. We quantify how elevated metallicities (epsilon=0.03 and epsilon=0.1) modify the gas and solid torques, test widely used linear scaling prescriptions, and identify the regimes where solid back-reaction becomes decisive. We performed global, 2D hydrodynamic simulations that treat solid material as a pressureless fluid fully coupled to the gas through drag and include the reciprocal back-reaction force. The planet was maintained on a fixed circular orbit, thus we computed static torques. The Stokes number was varied from 0.01 to 10, three surface-density slopes (p=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5) and three accretion efficiencies (eta=0, 10, and 100%) were explored. Torques, obtained by rescaling canonical epsilon=0.01 results, were compared with direct simulations. Solid torques scale linearly with epsilon, but gas torques deviate by 50-100% and can even reverse sign for St&lt;=1 in epsilon=0.1 disks. These are due to strong, feedback-driven, asymmetric gas perturbations in the co-orbital region, amplified by rapid planetary accretion. Solid back-reaction in high-metallicity environments can dominate the migration torque budget of low-mass planets. Simple metallicity rescalings are therefore unreliable for St&lt;=2, implying that precise migration tracks - particularly in metal-rich disks – require simulations that fully couple solid and gas dynamics. These results highlight metallicity as a key parameter in shaping the early orbital architecture of planetary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confronting Inflation and Reheating with Observations: Improved Predictions</a><span class="id">[2507.20307]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using the latest observational data, we constrain the inflationary dynamics and the subsequent reheating epoch.

Both positive and negative corrections to the minimal coupling of General Relativity are considered, and a robust numerical method is developed that evolves the metric and the inflaton field in this modified theory beyond slow-roll. Through a stability analysis, we find that positive models are inherently unstable during slow-roll, whereas negative ones can accommodate a stable attractor de Sitter solution. Using the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum from the latest data releases, we constrain the scale of the non-minimal coupling to be above $10^{13}$ GeV. In light of the 2018 Planck, BICEP/Keck and the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope data for the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio, strong constraints on the coupling strength force the effects of these modified theories to be, at most, slightly above the perturbative level. Furthermore, we determine that the choice of the perfect fluid matter Lagrangian does not impact the inflationary observables at the pivot scale. Finally, we present the predicted observables for different inflationary potentials and show that even though classical gravity is still preferred by the data, there are areas of the parameter space that are viable for non-minimally coupled inflationary models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consistent Four-derivative Heterotic Truncations and the Kerr-Sen Solution</a><span class="id">[2509.07069]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Four-derivative heterotic supergravity (without gauge fields) reduced on a $p$-dimensional torus leads to half-maximal supergravity coupled to $p$ vector multiplets, and it is known that removing the vector multiplets is a consistent truncation of the theory. We find a new consistent truncation of four-derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus that keeps the vector multiplets and precisely reproduces the bosonic action of heterotic supergravity (with heterotic gauge fields). We show that both truncations have an $O(d+p,d)$ symmetry when reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus and demonstrate how this embeds in the $O(d+p,d+p)$ symmetry that one gets from reducing on a $(d+p)$-dimensional torus without truncation. We then use our new truncation to obtain four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution and compute thermodynamic quantities and multipole moments. Finally, we compare the Kerr-Sen solutions of the actions corresponding to the two different choices of truncation with the Kerr solution, the Kerr-Newman solution, and each other, and show that they have distinct four-derivative multipole structures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13206" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual states and exponential decay in small-scale dynamo</a><span class="id">[2509.13206]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop the Kazantsev theory of small-scale dynamo generation at small Prandtl numbers near the generation threshold and restore the concordance between the theory and numerical simulations: the theory predicted a power-law decay below the threshold, while simulations demonstrate exponential decay.

This effect corresponds to the existence of a long-living virtual level in the corresponding Schrodinger type equation. We also find the critical Reynolds number and the increment of growth/decay above and under the threshold; we express them in terms of the quantitative characteristic properties of the velocity correlator, which makes it possible to compare the results with the data of different simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16310" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral instability of horizonless compact objects within astrophysical environments</a><span class="id">[2509.16310]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent non-modal analyses have uncovered spectral instabilities in the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes; a phenomenon that intriguingly extends to spherically-symmetric exotic compact objects. These results point to a sensitivity of the spectrum with potentially far-reaching implications for black-hole spectroscopy. At the same time, growing attention has turned to astrophysical environments around compact objects and their role in shaping gravitational-wave astrophysics. In this work, we establish a direct link between spectral instabilities and environmental effects by modeling matter as a localized bump outside the light ring of a spectrally-unstable exotic compact object with a purely reflective surface. We find that while such environments can destabilize the fundamental quasinormal modes of loosely-compact exotic objects, the fundamental modes of ultra-compact horizonless objects remain remarkably robust. In contrast, overtones are shown to develop spectral instabilities in the presence of the bump. By tracking both interior modes, trapped between the light ring and the surface of the exotic compact object, and exterior modes, confined between the bump and the light ring, we uncover an overtaking instability in which “unperturbed” exterior overtones metamorphose into “perturbed” fundamental modes as the bump moves outward. Finally, we demonstrate that environmental effects, while capable of further amplifying spectral instabilities, cannot induce next-to-leading-order perturbations strong enough to trigger a modal instability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axion condensates in neutron stars and radial oscillation modes</a><span class="id">[2510.16245]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Light QCD axions, introduced to solve the strong CP problem, may form condensates inside neutron stars, giving rise to a novel ground state of dense matter. We investigate how such axion condensates modify the equilibrium structure and radial oscillation spectrum of neutron stars. Using a realistic neutron star model with the BSk26 equation of state, and solving the coupled Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and Klein-Gordon equations together with a linear perturbation analysis, we find two distinct families of quasinormal modes: weakly damped fluid-dominated oscillations and highly damped axion modes. The coupling between the fluid and the axion field introduces axion-induced damping of radial oscillations, with decay timescales of order seconds for kHz axion masses. Modes with frequencies above the axion mass are strongly damped, while those below remain unaffected. Although neutron star radial oscillations are difficult to observe, our results suggest that extensions of this work can turn neutron star seismology into a novel probe of the axion properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining a de Broglie–Bohm quantum bounce cosmology with Planck data</a><span class="id">[2510.18022]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology.

Although limited in mass and not representative of the final RES-NOVA detector design, this prototype demonstrates effective control of mechanical vibrations and low-energy noise in a cryogenic system, which is a key requirement for rare-event searches. The experiment therefore provides a proof of principle for the RES-NOVA detection concept, validating the use of archaeological Pb-based PbWO$_4$ crystals, low-background operation, and robust data-analysis procedures.
