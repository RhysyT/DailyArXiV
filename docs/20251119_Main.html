Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), with their extreme luminosities and high-redshift detectability, provide a unique window into the history of cosmic formation and chemical evolution. Consequently, the GRB formation rate (FR) has been employed to trace the star formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time. GRBs are conventionally classified into long and short categories (lGRBs and sGRBs) based on their $ T_{90} $ duration. sGRBs are widely employed as tracers of the delayed SFR, owing to their origin linked to the inspiral timescales of compact binary systems. However, some studies suggest that the detection of supernova-associated sGRBs may indicate potential contamination by core-collapse events. In this work, we move beyond the $ T_{90} $ classification and focus exclusively on GRBs with confirmed kilonova signatures, which provide unambiguous evidence of binary compact star mergers, to reassess their connection with the delayed SFR. Through analysis of a kilonova-associated GRB (KN/GRBs) sample, we find that even within this robust subset, the KN/GRB FR displays a trend contrary to that of the delayed SFR at low redshifts ($ z &lt; 1 $). This result challenges the conventional theory by indicating that low-redshift KN/GRBs may not accurately trace the delayed SFR, independent of core-collapse contamination, while further validation with larger KN/GRB samples is essential to determine the reliability of compact binary mergers as probes of delayed SFR.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Mergers Collectively Illuminate the $γ$-Ray Sky</a><span class="id">[2511.13818]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin and acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays (CRs) remain fundamental open questions. Galaxy mergers are proposed as very high-energy CR accelerators, which are expected to produce high-energy (HE) $\gamma$ rays and neutrinos through interactions with the ambient gas and low-energy background radiation fields. For the first time, we systematically study the HE $\gamma$-ray emission from galaxy mergers utilising 16.7 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) data with the sample list compiled from eight survey catalogs. Our analysis finds 8 galaxy mergers that exhibit $\gamma$-ray emission with significance $\gtrsim5\sigma$ in the 1-500 GeV energy range. A stacking analysis of the remaining faint galaxy mergers yields a combined $\gamma$-ray emission detected at $\sim 35\sigma$ significance, a best-fit spectral index of $\Gamma \approx 2.07$, and an energy flux of $\sim \rm 2\times10^{-14}~erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$. We compare the stacked spectral energy distributions of the galaxy mergers with the projected sensitivity of the upcoming $\gamma$-ray telescope Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Furthermore, we find that 18 previously unassociated Fermi-LAT sources are spatially coincident with galaxy mergers. Our findings establish galaxy mergers as a new class of HE $\gamma$-ray sources. Future neutrino and $\gamma$-ray observatories will be crucial to discover the particle acceleration mechanism in these newly identified CR sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13820" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in Nuclear Star Clusters: A Combined Dynamical-Secular Channel for GW231123-like Events</a><span class="id">[2511.13820]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recent binary black hole (BH) merger GW231123, with both components likely in the high-mass gap and with high spins, challenges standard BH binary formation models. It is usually thought that the BHs are of second (or higher) generation (2G), resulting from the mergers of smaller BHs. But the physical processes that produce the merging 2G BH binaries are unclear and highly unconstrained. We show that such 2G mergers can be naturally produced in the nuclear star cluster of Milky Way-like galaxy. The dominant channel combines a sequence of binary-single interactions with secular evolution driven by the central supermassive BH. Our model produces a merger rate consistent with GW231123 and further predicts an abundant population of 2G BH-star (or low-mass BH) binaries; these binaries may observationally manifest as micro tidal disruption events or low-frequency gravitational-wave (GW) sources. Detecting these binaries would provide crucial insights into the dynamical pathways of hierarchical BH assembly.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aletheia: Emulating the non-linear matter power spectrum in the context of evolution mapping</a><span class="id">[2511.13826]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Aletheia, a new emulator of the non-linear matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, built upon the evolution mapping framework. This framework addresses the limitations of traditional emulation by focusing on $h$-independent cosmological parameters, which can be separated into those defining the linear power spectrum shape ($\mathbf{\Theta}_{\mathrm{s}}$) and those affecting only its amplitude evolution ($\mathbf{\Theta}_{\mathrm{e}}$). The combined impact of evolution parameters and redshift is compressed into a single amplitude parameter, $\sigma_{12}$. Aletheia uses a two-stage Gaussian Process emulation: a primary emulator predicts the non-linear boost factor as a function of ($\mathbf{\Theta}_{\mathrm{s}}$) and $\sigma_{12}$ for fixed evolution parameters, while a second one applies a small linear correction based on the integrated growth history. The emulator is trained on shape parameters spanning $\pm$5$\sigma$ of Planck constraints and a wide clustering range $0.2 &lt; \sigma_{12} &lt; 1.0$, providing predictions for $0.006\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 2\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We validate Aletheia against N-body simulations, demonstrating sub-percent accuracy. When tested on a suite of dynamic dark energy models, the full emulator's predictions show a variance of approximately 0.2%, a factor of five smaller than that of the state-of-the-art EuclidEmulator2 (around 1% variance). Furthermore, Aletheia maintains sub-percent accuracy for the best-fit dynamic dark energy cosmology from recent DESI data, a model whose parameters lie outside the training ranges of most conventional emulators. This demonstrates the power of the evolution mapping approach, providing a robust and extensible tool for precision cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13830" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The atmospheric composition of TOI-270 d</a><span class="id">[2511.13830]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The first explorations of temperate sub-Neptune exoplanets have been the hallmark of early JWST observations. The bulk properties of such planets are consistent with a range of possible internal structures, which can be distinguished through their interactions with the observable atmospheres. JWST observations of TOI-270 d, a temperate sub-Neptune, have previously led to contrasting conclusions: either a Hycean world, possessing a liquid water ocean, or a mixed-envelope sub-Neptune, where high temperatures prevent a liquid ocean and lead to a high mean molecular weight atmosphere. In order to resolve this uncertainty, we present a comprehensive retrieval analysis of TOI-270 d using recent NIRISS and NIRSpec transit spectroscopy across $\sim$1-5 $\mu$m. We find that prior inferences of a mixed envelope were affected by specific modelling choices leading to a high terminator temperature and high mean-molecular weight in the atmosphere. We confirm an H$_2$-rich atmosphere in TOI-270 d and present revised constraints on the molecular log-mixing ratios and maximal detection significances of CH$_4$ at $-1.86^{+0.30}_{-0.29}$ (6.4 $\sigma$), CO$_2$ at $-1.71^{+0.38}_{-0.66}$ (3.9 $\sigma$), H$_2$O at $-1.88^{+0.78}_{-4.13}$ (2.1 $\sigma$) and CS$_2$ at $-4.74^{+0.65}_{-1.10}$ (2.0 $\sigma$), with a terminator temperature of $323^{+58}_{-52}$ K at 10 mbar. We also find tentative evidence for more complex methyl-bearing species such as C$_2$H$_6$ and/or DMS at a 2.1-2.5 $\sigma$ level. The present constraints are consistent with TOI-270 d being a Hycean or dark Hycean world, with planet-wide or nightside liquid water oceans. However, more observations are required to verify the present findings and robustly constrain the atmospheric conditions and internal structure of TOI-270 d.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOI-333b: A Neptune Desert planet around a F7V star</a><span class="id">[2511.13832]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations have shown that planets similar to Neptune are rarely found orbiting Sun-like stars with periods up to  4 days, defining the so-called Neptune desert region. Therefore, the detection of each individual planet in this region holds a high value, providing detailed insights into how such a population came to form and evolve. Here we report the detection of TOI-333b, a Neptune desert planet with a mass, radius, and bulk density of 20.1 $\pm$ 2.4 M$_{\oplus}$, 4.26 $\pm$ 0.11 R$_{\oplus}$, and 1.42 $\pm$ 0.21 \gccc, respectively. The planet orbits a F7V star every 3.78 d, whose mass, radius and effective temperature are of 1.2 $\pm$ 0.1 \msun, 1.10 $\pm$ 0.03 \rsun, and 6241$^{+73}_{-62}$ K, respectively. TOI-333b is likely younger than 1 Gyr, which is supported by the presence of the doublet Li line around 6707.856 textup{ Å} and its comparison to Li abundances in open clusters with well constrained ages. The planet is expected to host only 8.5$^{+10.9}_{-8.3}\%$ gas-to-core mass ratio for a H/He envelope. On the other hand, irradiated ocean world models predict 20$^{+11}_{-10}\%$ H$_2$O mass fraction with a core fraction of 35$^{+20}_{-23}\%$. Therefore, we expect that TOI-333b internal composition may be dominated by a pure rocky composition with almost no H/He envelope, or a rocky world with almost equal mass fraction of water. Finally, TOI-333b is more massive and larger than 77$\%$ and 82$\%$ of its Neptune desert counterparts, respectively, while its host ranks among the hottest known for Neptune Desert planets, making this system a unique laboratory to study the evolution of such planets around hot stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13854" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the Model Dependence of MCMC-Based 21 cm Power Spectrum Parameter Constraints</a><span class="id">[2511.13854]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detection and analysis of the cosmic 21 cm signal of neutral hydrogen has long been considered the most promising route towards exploration of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). 21CMMC, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler of the semi-numerical simulation code 21cmFAST, has already been used in conjunction with published upper limits on the 21 cm signal from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) to constrain the astrophysics of the EoR. Here we investigate the extent to which analysis of the EoR performed using 21CMMC is dependent on the underlying semi-numerical model. We used 21cmFAST to simulate two datasets of 21 cm light-cones which differ only in the algorithm used to identify ionized regions (the so-called &quot;bubble-finding&quot; algorithm). We then tested 21CMMC's ability to return key astrophysical parameters when using the different bubble-finding algorithms. We find that the performance of 21CMMC depends sensitively on the agreement between the astrophysical model of our mock data and the model used for sampling. This result has important implications for the analysis of the 21 cm signal performed using 21CMMC and further motivates investigation into model-independent analysis techniques for 21 cm EoR data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Low-energy Radio Bursts from Magnetar XTE J1810$-$197: Implications for Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2511.13856]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetars are the leading candidate sources of fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, the observational probes of the connections between magnetars and FRBs are severely limited by the paucity of detection of highly energetic radio events from magnetars – to date, only one radio burst as energetic as FRBs has been detected from a Galactic magnetar. Here, we present a detailed analysis of a large sample of low-energy bursts detected from the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197, and probe their implications for FRB emission from magnetars. We report detection of over 97000 bright radio pulses from 242 observations of the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197 over 4.5 years and two decades in frequency (300 MHz to 6.15 GHz), using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope, after its recent outburst onset in December 2018. We present detailed analysis of the burst fluence distributions and their trends with time as well as frequency, and the waiting time distribution. We show that XTE J1810$-$197 rapidly switches between pulsar-like and giant-pulse-like emission states, and magnetars like XTE J1810$-$197 remain viable and likely emitters of FRBs, in the form of giant-pulses with energies comparable to FRBs. We also demonstrate that the lack of the detection of an underlying periodicity in the bursts from repeating FRBs might be caused by emission across a wide range of spin phases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13858" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Scoured Spike: Suppression of Indirect Dark Matter Signals by a Hidden Companion</a><span class="id">[2511.13858]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A massive &quot;dark companion&quot;-such as an intermediate-mass black hole or other compact dark object-orbiting the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center can dynamically reshape the surrounding dark-matter spike. Through gravitational heating and angular-momentum exchange, the companion excavates a &quot;scoured&quot; region that lowers the inner density and suppresses the expected annihilation signal. We quantify this effect by computing the suppression of the dark-matter annihilation $J$-factor induced by such a companion, combining an analytic scouring-radius model with full numerical integrations of the modified density profile. We scan the parameter space of companion mass, orbital separation, system age, and spike slope, explicitly including the interplay with the annihilation plateau. For canonical Gondolo-Silk spikes with $\gamma_{\rm sp} \gtrsim 2$, we find that the distribution is remarkably resilient and that the companion produces at most mild reductions of the $J$-factor. In contrast, for pre-heated or otherwise shallow spikes with $\gamma_{\rm sp} \lesssim 1.8$, even a modest $\sim 10^{4}\,M_\odot$ companion on a O(100) AU orbit and O(Gyr) age can suppress the annihilation flux by one to two orders of magnitude. The numerical results are accurately captured (typically at the $\lesssim 10\%$ level) by a simple fitting formula in terms of a dimensionless scouring parameter that measures the ratio between the scoured region and the annihilation core. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting a dark companion can lead to substantial overestimates of the Galactic Center $J$-factor, with direct consequences for interpreting gamma-ray, neutrino, and antimatter searches for annihilating dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13862" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dual Origins of Rapid Flare Ribbon Downflows in an X9-class Solar Flare</a><span class="id">[2511.13862]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We detect rapid downflows of 150-217 km/s in IRIS Si IV 1402.77 nm measurements of an X9-class solar flare on 2024 October 3rd. The fast redshift values persist for over 15 minutes from flare onset, and can be split into two distinct stages of behavior, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are responsible for the downwards acceleration of flare ribbon plasma. The first stage of rapid downflows are synchronized with peaks in emission from the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory Hard X-ray Imager (ASO-S/HXI) and Large Yield Radiometer (LYRA) Lyman-alpha measurements, indicative that the chromospheric downflows (with a maximum redshift of 176 km/s) result from chromospheric condensations associated with impulsive energy release in the solar flare. Later in the event, strong Si IV flare ribbon downflows persist (to a maximum value of 217 km/s), despite the magnetic flux rate falling to zero, and high-energy HXR and Lyman-alpha measurements returning to background levels. This is reflective of downflows in the flare ribbon footpoints of flare-induced coronal rain. Hard X-ray spectral analysis supports this scenario, revealing strong non-thermal emission during the initial downflow stage, falling near background levels by the second stage. Despite these distinct and contrasting stages of ribbon behavior, Si IV Doppler velocities exhibit quasi-periodic pulsations with a constant  50 s period across the 15-minute flare evolution (independently of loop length). We deduce that these pulsations are likely caused by MHD oscillations in the magnetic arcade. Finally, we utilize machine learning K-means clustering methods to quantify line profile variations during the stages of rapid downflows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13866" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large Scale White Noise and Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2511.13866]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The generation of white noise on large scales is a generic property of the dynamics of physical systems described by local non-linear partial differential equations. Non-linearities prevent the small scale dynamics from being erased by smoothing. Unresolved small scale dynamics act as an uncorrelated (white or Poissonian) noise (seemingly stochastic but actually deterministic) contribution to large scale dynamics. This white noise exists even when the dynamics is very nearly linear. In cases where the power spectrum is sub-Poissonian on large scales, this noise will dominate on the largest scale power no matter the amplitude of the inhomogeneities. Such is the case in the standard model of cosmology, where the primordial density power spectrum is expected to have an almost Harrison-Zel'dovich, $P[k]\sim k$, spectrum on a much broader range of scales than can be observed. Even though linear gravitational evolution dominates non-linear corrections by a factor $\sim10^5$, the non-observation of white noise on the Hubble scale precludes the extrapolation of this power law below the comoving $1\,$pc scale. More generally, observation or non-observation of large scale white noise provides a powerful probe of the universe on very small scales in the early early universe. Gravitational radiation, phase transitions, vorticity, and running of the spectral index are all phenomena that can be probed with large scale white noise. Large scale white noise is a non-optional feature of all cosmological models but one which has not heretofore been appreciated.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blazars as a Potential Origin of the KM3-230213A Event</a><span class="id">[2511.13886]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The KM3NeT collaboration has reported the detection of the highest energy neutrino event observed to date.

The publicly available Astro-Multimessenger Modeling software is used to model the blazar gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes. It is concluded that a population of blazars could produce the diffuse flux compatible with the observation of the ultra-high energy event detected by the KM3NeT/ARCA detector. At the same time, the gamma-ray flux produced by such a population of blazars is consistent with the diffuse gamma-ray flux measured by the Fermi Large Area Telescope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accessing the homogeneity scale with 21 cm intensity mapping surveys</a><span class="id">[2511.13931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The homogeneity scale, $R_{\rm H}$, offers a fundamental test of the Cosmological Principle, yet it has not yet been measured with 21cm intensity mapping surveys. A key limitation for such a measurement is the telescope beam, which artificially smooths the observed signal. We quantify this effect using the two-point correlation function and the correlation dimension, $\mathcal{D}_2(r)$, to model how beam convolution suppresses intrinsic clustering. For any given redshift $z$, we identify a maximum beam width, $\sigma_{\rm max}(z)$, beyond which the homogeneity scale cannot be recovered. This limit defines an inaccessible region in the $\sigma \times z$ parameter space, where $R_{\rm H}$ is erased by beam smoothing. Applying this framework to several current and upcoming radio telescopes, we assess their ability to probe $R_{\rm H}$. Our results provide the first quantitative forecast of the instrumental requirements for measuring the cosmic homogeneity scale with 21cm IM, and establish a theoretical basis for future observational applications.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delayed radio emission in tidal disruption events from collisions of outflows driven by disk instabilities</a><span class="id">[2511.14008]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Delayed radio emission has been associated with a growing proportion of tidal disruption events (TDEs). For many events, the radio synchrotron emission is inferred to originate from the interaction of mildly-relativistic outflows, launched with delay times of $\sim 100$–$1000$ d after the TDE optical peak. The mechanism behind these outflows remains uncertain, but may relate to instabilities or state transitions in the accretion disk formed from the TDE. We model the radio emission powered by the collision of mass outflows (&quot;flares&quot;) from TDE accretion disks, considering scenarios in which two successive disk flares collide with each other, as well as collisions between the outflow and the circumnuclear medium (CNM). For flare masses of $\sim 0.01$-$0.1 M_{\odot}$, varied CNM densities, and different time intervals between ejected flares, we demonstrate that the shocks formed by the collisions have velocities $0.05c$-$0.3c$ at $\sim 10^{17}$ cm and power bright radio emission of $L_{\nu} \sim 10^{27}$-$10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, consistent with the properties inferred for observed events. We quantify how the typical peak timescale and flux varies for different properties of our models, and compare our model predictions to a selection of TDEs with delayed radio emission. Our models successfully reproduce the light curves and SEDs for several events, supporting the idea that delayed outflows from disk instabilities and state transitions can power late-time radio emission in TDEs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aspherical Remnants of Triple and Quadruple Detonations in Binary White Dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2511.14039]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>White dwarfs which explode by the double-detonation mechanism may have a binary white dwarf donor which is subsequently ignited by its collision with the ejecta. This results in the destruction of the donor via either the triple- or quadruple-detonation mechanism, adding significant mass to the resulting ejecta as well as modifying its structure and composition. We simulate the evolution of supernova remnants resulting from such detonations in a variety of binary progenitors and compare them against a double detonation with a surviving donor. Because of the time delay between the detonations of the two white dwarfs, high-velocity ejecta from the first explosion governs the first few centuries of remnant evolution, whereas at later times the dense core resulting from the donor detonation drives both the forward and reverse shocks to larger radii. The collision between the highest-velocity ejecta of the primary explosion and the donor carves a conical wake into the ejecta, which persists into the remnant phase regardless of whether or not the donor detonates. Our suite of simulated remnants are found to exhibit multiple distinguishing features of the explosion properties: a distinct X-ray morphology in the thermal emission and iron lines for triple detonations and smaller remnants with centrally-concentrated emission for double detonations. The remnants are also varied in their elemental abundances and distributions, particularly for lighter elements, but these have limited observational utility and are sensitive to the properties of the progenitor binary.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaping the Mantle: The Role of the Superheated Core After Giant Impacts</a><span class="id">[2511.14041]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Moon-forming giant impact significantly influenced the initial thermal state of Earth's mantle by generating a global magma ocean, marking the onset of mantle evolution. Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277–5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large Magnetic Flux Rope Formation in an X2.1 Flare observed on September 6, 2011</a><span class="id">[2511.14060]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar active region 11283 produced an X2.1 flare associated with a solar eruption on September 6, 2011. Observations revealed a preflare sigmoidal structure and a circular flare ribbon surrounding the typical two ribbon structure, along with remote brightenings located at a considerable distance from the main flare site. To interpret these observations in terms of the three dimensional (3D) coronal magnetic field dynamics, we conducted data constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Using a non linear force free field (NLFFF) as the initial condition, we reconstructed a realistic pre flare magnetic environment, capturing a sheared sigmoid above the polarity inversion line (PIL) surmounted by a fan spine structure. Our simulations revealed that reconnection between the sigmoidal field, the adjacent fan dome field lines, and the neighboring large loops facilitated the transfer of magnetic twist and led to the formation of a large magnetic flux rope (MFR). This transfer and propagation of twist are clearly visible throughout the MFR. As reconnection progresses, the entire fan spine structure expands along with the evolving MFR. A notable outcome of the simulation is that the footpoints of the newly formed MFR align closely with the observed circular flare ribbon and the remote brightening region. Our findings suggest that a large MFR formed during the X2.1 flare, providing a coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energy-Containing Electrons in Solar Flares: Improving Hard X-Ray and EUV Diagnostics</a><span class="id">[2511.14077]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar flares effectively accelerate particles to non-thermal energies. These accelerated electrons are responsible for energy transport and subsequent emissions in HXR, radio, and UV/EUV radiation. Due to the steeply decreasing electron spectrum, the electron population and consequently the overall flare energetics, are predominantly influenced by low-energy non-thermal electrons. However, deducing the electron distribution in this energy-containing range remains a significant challenge. In this study, we apply the warm-target HXR emission model with kappa-form injected electrons to two well-observed GOES M-class flares. Moreover, we utilize EUV observations to constrain the flaring plasma properties, which enables us to determine the characteristics of accelerated electrons across a range from a few keV to tens of keV. We demonstrate that the warm-target model reliably constrains the properties of flare-associated electrons, even accounting for the uncertainties that had previously been unaddressed. The application of a kappa distribution for the accelerated electrons allows for meaningful comparisons with electron distributions inferred from EUV observations, specifically for energy ranges below the detection threshold of RHESSI. Our results indicate that the accelerated electrons constitute only a small fraction of the total electron population within the flaring region. Moreover, the physical parameters, such as electron escape time and acceleration time scale, inferred from both the warm-target model and the EUV observations further support the scenario in which electrons undergo thermalization within the corona. This study highlights the effectiveness of integrating the warm-target model with EUV observations to accurately characterize energy-containing electrons and their associated acceleration and transport processes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Origin of the Mg-rich Supernova Remnant J0550-6823 and the Frequency of Similar Events in the Large Magellanic Cloud</a><span class="id">[2511.14126]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Shell burning and internal mixing in massive stars play an important role in setting the initial conditions for core-collapse supernova explosions. In the late stages of stellar evolution, intense shell burning can cause distinct convective regions to merge, fundamentally restructuring the stellar interior. Although such phenomena are difficult to observe directly, the observation of “Mg-rich” supernova remnants (SNRs) has recently emerged as a potential signature of these events. In this study, we reanalyze X-ray observations of J0550–6823, a SNR in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and a new candidate Mg-rich SNR. Our spectral analysis confirms a low Ne/Mg mass ratio of $\approx$1, and its classification as Mg-rich. By comparing the observational results with pre-supernova models, we suggest that the progenitor of J0550-6823 likely had an extended convective shell that reduces the Ne/Mg ratio prior to its explosion. Furthermore, we observe that $\sim$2–3 Mg-rich SNRs exist in the LMC, suggesting that $\lesssim$10–40\% of massive stars in the LMC may have had an extended convective shell, similar to what we observed in J0550-6823. This fraction would be important for understanding the final stages of the evolution of massive stars and galactic chemical evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photon rest mass from localized fast radio bursts with improved distribution of dispersion measure from extragalactic gas</a><span class="id">[2511.14163]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The assumption that photons are massless is a foundational postulate of modern physics, yet it remains subject to experimental verification. Fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their cosmological distances and precisely measured dispersion, offer an excellent laboratory for testing this hypothesis. In this work, we propose an improved distribution function for the dispersion measure arising from extragalactic gas and demonstrate that it provides an excellent fit to mock data. We then apply this distribution to constrain the photon rest mass under the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM cosmological models, the last of which is favored by recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation observations. The corresponding 1$\sigma$ upper limits on the photon mass are found to be $4.83\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, $4.71\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, and $4.86\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, respectively, which are the most stringent constraints derived from FRBs to date. These results indicate that the choice of cosmological model has only a minor impact on photon-mass bounds, demonstrate that FRBs provide robust and reliable constraints, and offer strong empirical support for the massless nature of the photon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The KPF SURFS-UP Survey I: Transmission Spectroscopy of WASP-76 b</a><span class="id">[2511.14175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce the KPF SURFS-UP (Spectroscopy of the Upper-atmospheres and ReFractory Species in Ultra-hot Planets) Survey, a high-resolution survey to investigate the atmospheric composition and dynamics of a sample of ultra-hot Jupiters with the Keck Planet Finder (KPF). Due to the unique design of KPF, we developed a publicly available pipeline for KPF that performs blaze removal, continuum normalization, order stitching, science spectra combination, telluric correction, and atmospheric detection via cross-correlation. As a first demonstration, we applied this pipeline to a transit of WASP-76 b and achieved some of the highest signal-to-noise detections of refractory species in WASP-76 b to date (e.g., Fe I is detected at a SNR of 14.5). We confirm previous observations of an asymmetry in Fe I absorption, but find no measurable ingress-egress asymmetry in Na I and Ca II. Together, these results suggest variations within different layers of the atmosphere of WASP-76 b: neutral metals such as Fe I trace deeper regions with stronger asymmetries, while Na I and Ca II probe regions higher in the atmosphere where the ingress-egress asymmetries are weaker. These findings provide new insights into the complex atmosphere of WASP-76 b and highlight the power of using KPF for atmospheric characterization. More broadly, the KPF SURFS-UP Survey will observe a large sample of UHJs, using transmission, emission, and phase-resolved spectroscopy to characterize their refractory abundances, upper atmospheres, and 3D dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A nearby pulsar J1951+2837 observed by the LPA and FAST</a><span class="id">[2511.14191]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>PSR J1951+2837 is a nearby pulsar with a period of 7.334 s and dispersion measure of DM = 2.9 $\pm$ 0.6 pc cm$^{-3}$, located about 200 or 300 pc from the Sun.

In this paper we simulate monopoles in a radiation background, but without interactions with the radiation, in order to resolve differences between analytical models. We find that during the radiation era, the monopoles find each other and annihilate efficiently enough to keep their density fraction constant, which supports the modelling of Zel'dovich and Khlopov and Preskill in the epoch when plasma interactions can be neglected. In the matter era the density fraction decreases logarithmically. Further work is needed to quantify the effect of the thermal bath, which is expected to reduce the annihilation rate at later times.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking as a Late-Time Trigger for Interacting Dark Energy</a><span class="id">[2511.14235]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Persistent tensions in the Hubble constant (H0) and the matter clustering parameter (S8) motivate late-time new physics that suppresses structure growth without significantly altering the background expansion history of the LambdaCDM model. We study a class of dark-sector dynamics in which a scalar dark energy field, governed by a Z2-symmetric quartic potential, interacts with dark matter through Yukawa and portal couplings. When the matter density drops below a critical threshold, a cosmological spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism generates a time-dependent vacuum expectation value v(a) and activates an effective coupling eta(a). This creates a symmetric phase (a &lt;= ac) identical to LambdaCDM at early times, and a broken phase (a &gt; ac) in which eta(a) &gt; 0 transfers energy from dark matter to dark energy, suppressing linear structure growth. Using RSD, BAO, cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae, and compressed Planck distance priors, we compare a fixed LambdaCDM background with a self-consistent coupled-scalar evolution. The RSD-only analysis shows a strong shift: the dynamical background gives Omega_m   0.31 +/- 0.10 and sigma8,0   0.59 +/- 0.01, while the fixed-background case gives Omega_m   0.20 +/- 0.09 and sigma8,0   0.75 +/- 0.05. In the full joint fit, we obtain Omega_m = 0.29 +/- 0.01, H0 = 69.7 +/- 0.6 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and sigma8,0 = 0.78 +/- 0.01. A late-time interaction triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking can therefore damp structure growth and ease the S8 tension while leaving the expansion history and the inferred H0 essentially unchanged, suggesting distinct physical origins for the two tensions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newborn jet in the symbiotic system R Aquarii</a><span class="id">[2511.14243]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>R Aquarii (R Aqr) is a well-known symbiotic binary that has attracted renewed interest during its recent periastron passage, an event that occurs only once every about 40 years.

We investigate the inner, sub-arcsecond active region of R Aqr during this recent periastron passage, with the goal of gaining insight into the jet-launching mechanisms at work in this system. We analyse Ha speckle interferometric images obtained one month apart using Fourier techniques. These are complemented by high-resolution optical spectra in the same emission line. Our speckle imaging reveals a newborn two-sided jet orientated in the north-south direction. Its proper motion, 66 +- 19 mas per year, confirms that it was launched around 2020 Jan 7, at the onset of the periastron passage. Further analysis of the elongated central structure reveals a knot in the southern counterpart of the jet, moving away from the binary with a 27 +- 17 mas per year at a position angle of 187 degrees, and an ejection time around 2019 Oct 28. This interpretation is further supported by our high-resolution spectroscopic data.

For a uniform plasma of infinite extent the MHD waves can be subdivided in two classes with distinct properties. The first class contains the Alfvén waves. The Alfvén waves are incompressible and propagate parallel vorticity. They do not have a parallel component of displacement, they do not cause variations in pressure and are driven by magnetic tension only. The second class contains the magneto-sonic waves. They are compressible and have a parallel component of displacement. They do not propagate parallel vorticity and are driven by pressure and magnetic tension. In non-uniform plasmas the situation can be very different. The clear division between Alfvén waves and magneto-sonic waves is no longer present. In a given part of the equilibrium an MHD wave can strongly resemble a magneto-sonic wave with little or no resemblance to Alfvén waves; while in another part of the equilibrium the MHD wave is practically an Alfvén wave, which has the amazing property of being accompanied by variations in pressure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14289" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar carbon abundance from 3D non-LTE modelling of the diagnostic lines of the CH molecule</a><span class="id">[2511.14289]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. The spectral lines of the CH molecule are a key carbon (C) abundance diagnostic in FGKM-type stars. These lines are detectable in metal-rich and, in contrast to atomic C lines, also in metal-poor late-type stars. However, only 3D LTE analyses of the CH lines have been performed so far. Aims. We test the formation of CH lines in the solar spectrum, using for the first time, 3D Non-LTE (NLTE) models. We also aim to derive the solar photospheric abundance of C, using the diagnostic transitions in the optical (4218 - 4356 Å) and infrared (33025 - 37944 Å). Methods. We use the updated NLTE model molecule from Popa et al. (2023) and different solar 3D radiation-hydrodynamics model atmospheres. The models are contrasted against new spatially-resolved optical solar spectra, and the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of CH lines is studied. Results. The 1D LTE and 1D NLTE models fail to describe the line CLV, and lead to underestimated solar C abundances. The 3D NLTE modelling of diagnostic lines in the optical and IR yields a carbon abundance of A(C)=$8.52\pm0.07$ dex. The estimate is in agreement with recent results based on neutrino fluxes measured by Borexino. Conclusions. 3D NLTE modelling and tests on spatially-resolved solar data are essential to derive robust solar abundances. The analysis presented here focuses on CH, but we expect that similar effects will be present for other molecules of astrophysical interest.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the center-to-limb variations of the He I 10 830 Å triplet</a><span class="id">[2511.14331]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the quiet-Sun center-to-limb variations (CLV) of the He I triplet at 10 830 Å and the nearby Si I 10 827 Å line, observed with GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) and the improved High-resolution Fast Imager (HiFI+).

We study how differences in colour ($c$), stretch ($x_{1}$), and host galaxy properties-stellar mass ($M$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR)-between calibration and Hubble Flow (HF) Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) samples used by SH0ES affect SN luminosity standardization and $H_{0}$ estimates. We generate subsamples from both, estimating $H_{0}$, $M_{B}$, $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\Delta_{host}$, and $\sigma_{int}$. We use Kolmogorov-Smirnov to assess the consistency between subsamples and reveal how parameter estimates change as sample matching improves. The calibration sample is not fully representative of the HF sample, especially in $M$ and sSFR. Improving sample consistency leads to changes in $H_{0}$, $M_{B}$, $\alpha$, and $\sigma_{int}$, though overall values remain broadly stable. Better-matched subsamples tend to yield a mass step consistent with zero within 1$\sigma$. By disentangling SN subpopulations, we find persistent differences in $H_{0}$ ($\sim$2-3$\sigma$) and $M_{B}$ ($\sim2\sigma$) between low- and high-stretch SNe: $H_{0} = 75.27 \pm 1.18$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for low-stretch and $H_{0} = 71.25 \pm 1.59$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for high-stretch, resulting in Hubble tensions of 6.07$\sigma$ and 2.52$\sigma$. These differences suggest SNe Ia subpopulations with varying dust and intrinsic colour not captured by a single $\beta$, impacting cosmology. Estimating a single $H_{0}$ for both subpopulations yields $H_{0} = 73.78 \pm 2.17$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, with a much larger uncertainty that lowers the Hubble tension from $5.87\sigma$ to $\sim2.86\sigma$. Our results suggest that the mass step may arise from an over-correction of more than one SN subpopulation associated to different environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-Resolved Spectroscopy of the Polar V379 Vir with a Brown Dwarf</a><span class="id">[2511.14338]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The polar V379 Vir is a well-known magnetic cataclysmic variable with a brown dwarf donor.

The synergy between close binary stars and asteroseismology enables constraints on mass-transfer episodes and their consequences for internal structure, rotation profiles, and oscillation modes. Aims. We investigate how mass accretion and donation in close binaries affects the internal structure and oscillation modes of main-sequence stars. Methods. Building on the established relation between the BruntVaisala (buoyancy) glitch and the Fourier spectra of g-mode period spacings presented in Wu et al. and Guo, we quantitatively explain the origins of the g-mode period-spacing differences between single-star and mass-accretion/donation models of intermediate-mass stars (M = 2.0, 3.0, and 4.5 Msun). In particular, the hydrogen mass fraction profiles X of the donor model show two chemical gradient regions, which results in a double-peaked BruntVaisala profile. The presence of additional buoyancy glitches gives rise to further periodic modulations in the g-mode period spacings. Results. Mass-accretion induced changes in the chemical profile create sharp features in the buoyancy frequency, which modify both the amplitudes and frequencies of the g-mode period-spacing variations. This behavior resembles that produced by multiple chemical transition zones in compact pulsators such as white dwarfs and sub-dwarf B (sdB) stars. Similarly, for acoustic modes in the M = 1 Msun solar-like models, we attribute the differences in frequency-separation ratios between single-star and mass-donor models to the variations in the internal sound-speed gradient (acoustic glitches). We discuss future prospects for using asteroseismology to discover the mass-transfer products and constrain the mass-transfer processes in binary star evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14374" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Formation of Solar Prominences: Plasma Origin and Mechanisms</a><span class="id">[2511.14374]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar prominences, or solar filaments, are cool and dense plasma structures in the hot solar corona, whose formation mechanisms have remained a fundamental challenge in solar physics.

We begin by summarizing the magnetic field configurations that enable prominence support, followed by a classification of four representative plasma formation mechanisms: injection, levitation, evaporation–condensation, and in-situ condensation. Each mechanism is analyzed in terms of its physical basis, numerical realizations, and observational diagnostics. A central focus is placed on the evaporation–condensation scenario, which has seen significant development over the past decade through numerical simulations. We also discuss recent progress in modeling in-situ condensation triggered by magnetic reconnection and levitation dynamics. Throughout, we emphasize the complementary nature of different mechanisms and their potential coexistence in forming and maintaining prominence mass. Observational constraints and recent high-resolution data are reviewed to assess the physical plausibility of each mechanism. We conclude by highlighting open questions and future directions in connecting multi-scale physical processes to the observed diversity of prominence behaviors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing accretion dynamics and spin evolution in the X-ray pulsar RX J0520.5-6932 during its 2024 Outburst</a><span class="id">[2511.14429]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>After nearly a decade of quiescence, the transient Be/X-ray binary pulsar RX J0520.5-6932 underwent an outburst in 2024. We performed X-ray monitoring of the source with NICER and AstroSat near the peak of the event. Our primary objective is to investigate the energy and luminosity dependence of the pulsed emission, characterize the spin evolution, and study the broadband X-ray spectral properties of RX J0520.5-6932 during the outburst. The AstroSat/LAXPC and NICER light curves reveal pronounced short-duration flaring activity lasting  400-700 s, with enhancements by a factor of  2. The pulse profile exhibits a strong dependence on both energy and intensity, evolving from a simple single-peaked structure at low energies to complex multi-peaked shapes at intermediate energies, and reverting to simpler morphologies at higher energies. Pulse profiles during the flares differ significantly from those in the persistent state, indicating changes in the pulsed beam pattern with a change in the intensity on a short timescale. Broadband spectral analysis reveals a soft excess and an emission feature at  1 keV, likely arising from reprocessed emission in the accretion disc and fluorescence from Ne K and Fe L ions. Continuous NICER monitoring over nearly one orbital cycle enabled us to track spin evolution with accretion-driven spin-up and spectral variability in the soft X-ray band. Additionally, a declining spin-up rate is observed during the outburst, likely due to a gradual reduction in mass accretion rate. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the complex accretion dynamics in RX J0520.5-6932 during its 2024 outburst. The strong variability in pulse shape and spin behaviour highlights rapid changes in the accretion geometry and torque as a function of accretion rate.

In addition to the suppression of small-scale power from ULDM itself, the coupling induces a variation of fundamental constants that is modulated by the ULDM oscillatory field value. In this work, we consider the ULDM-induced, time-dependent variation of the fine structure constant and the mass of the electron. These variations modify the predicted abundance of light elements during Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the process of recombination, thereby affecting the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We use CMB anisotropy data and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements to obtain constraints on the variation of couplings over a wide range of ULDM masses. We self-consistently account for the modification of the primordial helium abundance during BBN in computing the CMB power spectra. We find that the allowed ULDM fraction of total dark matter abundance is more constrained for ULDM masses $\lesssim 10^{-26}~\mathrm{eV}$ in the presence of the variations. Moreover, our constraints on the variational couplings for ULDM masses $\lesssim 10^{-27}~\mathrm{eV}$ are stronger than the ones derived from the primordial helium abundance at BBN. Under our ULDM model, the variation of fundamental constants has no appreciable impact on the Hubble constant inferred from CMB data and thus does not present a viable solution to the Hubble tension.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14538" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A comparison of time-dependent Cloudy astrophysical code simulations with experimental X-ray spectra from keV laser-generated argon plasmas</a><span class="id">[2511.14538]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have generated strongly photoionized Ar plasmas in experiments designed to use primarily X-ray L-shell line emission generated from Ag foils irradiated by the VULCAN high-power laser at the UK Central Laser Facility.

Our aim is to reproduce in the laboratory the extreme photoionization conditions found in accretion-powered astrophysical sources. In this paper, we compare the experimental results on K-$\beta$ X-ray Ar spectra with modelling using the time-dependent version of the Cloudy astrophysical code. The results indicate that photoionized laboratory plasmas can be successfully modelled with codes such as Cloudy that have been developed for application to astrophysical sources. Our comparison of simulation and experiment shows that the flux of sub-keV photons that photoionize the outer-shell electrons can have a significant effect, and that detailed measurements of the X-ray drive spectrum across all photon energy ranges are crucial for accurate modelling of experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forecasting Synchrotron Spectral Parameters with QUIJOTE-MFI2 in combination with Planck and WMAP</a><span class="id">[2511.14572]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a parametric component separation forecast for the QUIJOTE-MFI2 instrument (10-20 GHz), assessing its impact on constraining polarised synchrotron emission at $1^\circ$ FWHM and $N_{\rm side}=64$. Using simulated sky maps based on power-law and curved synchrotron spectra, we show that adding QUIJOTE-MFI2 to existing WMAP+$Planck$+MFI data yields statistically unbiased parameter estimates with substantial uncertainty reductions: improvement factors reach $\sim$10 for the synchrotron spectral index ($\beta_s$), $\sim$5 for the curvature parameter ($C_s$), and $\sim$43 for polarisation amplitudes in bright regions. Deep QUIJOTE cosmological fields enable $\beta_s$ constraints even in intrinsically low SNR regions where WMAP+$Planck$ alone remain prior-dominated. Current combined sensitivities are insufficient to detect a synchrotron curvature of $C_s=-0.052$ on a pixel-by-pixel basis, but a $2\sigma$ detection is achievable for $|C_s|\gtrsim 0.14$ in the brightest regions of the Galactic plane. In those deep cosmological fields, combining QUIJOTE-MFI2 with WMAP and $Planck$ reduces the median synchrotron residual at 100 GHz by a factor 2.2 (to 0.022 $\mu$K$_{\rm CMB}$) and the total residual by a factor 1.8 (to 0.030 $\mu$K$_{\rm CMB}$). These results demonstrate that QUIJOTE-MFI2 will provide critical low-frequency information for modelling Galactic synchrotron emission, offering valuable complementary constraints for future CMB surveys such as LiteBIRD and the Simons Observatory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Point-symmetric morphology in supernova remnant G11.2-0.3: the jittering jets explosion mechanism</a><span class="id">[2511.14578]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I identify a point-symmetric morphology in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant SNR G11.2-0.3 composed of three pairs of opposite morphological features, and attribute their shaping to three energetic pairs of jets during the explosion process in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The pairs of morphological features are two opposite rings, a strip of dense ejecta extending on both sides of the central pulsar PSR J1811-1925, and an ear-nozzle opposite structure. According to the JJEM, additional weaker pairs of jets may also have participated in the explosion. The jets' axis from the ear to the nozzle coincides with the axis of the presently active pulsar jets, which is the pulsar spin axis. The jets of this pair were the last that the newly born neutron star launched during the explosion, and the accretion disk that launched these jets spun up the neutron star in the same direction as the jets. The identification of a point-symmetric morphology in SNR G11.2-0.3 strengthens the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Role of Binary Configuration in Shaping Nova Evolution via Wind Accretion in Symbiotic Systems</a><span class="id">[2511.14596]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of the Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton (BHL) accretion mechanism on the evolution of nova eruptions in symbiotic systems by systematically varying three key input parameters: the initial donor (asymptotic giant branch; AGB) mass, the initial white dwarf (WD) mass, and the initial binary separation ($a$). We explore models with AGB masses in the range $1.5$–$3.5\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, WD masses in the range $0.7$–$1.25\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, and separations in the range $1$–$8\,{\rm kR_{\odot}}$. We find that all models exhibit a significant long-term orbital increase. This trend is primarily driven by the fact that approximately $99\%$ of the AGB mass is lost from the system, either directly via a wind that is not accreted by the WD, or accreted onto the WD and subsequently ejected during nova eruptions. As a result, the secular orbital response to mass loss or mass transfer dominates over angular-momentum-loss sinks that could otherwise shrink the orbit, producing a consistent orbital widening. Consequently, all WD masses gradually decrease with time. More massive WDs achieve higher mass-transfer efficiencies and accretion rates, leading to slightly higher mass-retention efficiencies per nova. However, because higher accretion rates also produce more frequent eruptions, the total WD mass lost over the AGB lifetime is larger in these systems. We conclude that symbiotic systems transferring mass via the BHL mechanism are unlikely to be viable progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14634" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A search for transit timing variations in the transiting hot Jupiter systems HIP 65, NGTS-6, NGTS-10 and WASP-173</a><span class="id">[2511.14634]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hot Jupiters are Jupiter-mass planets with orbital periods of less than ten days. Their short orbital separations make tidal dissipation within the stellar host especially efficient, potentially leading to a measurable evolution of the orbit. One possible manifestation of this is orbital decay, which presents itself observationally through variations in the orbital period and thus times of transit. Here we select four promising exoplanetary systems for detecting this effect: HIP 65, NGTS-6, NGTS-10 and WASP-173. We present 33 new transit light curves taken with the 1.54 m Danish Telescope, and analyse these alongside photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and transit timing data from the literature. We construct two ephemeris models for each target: a linear ephemeris and a shrinking orbital period due to tidal decay. The linear ephemeris is preferred for all four models - the highest significance for the quadratic ephemeris is 2 sigma for WASP-173. We compare these results to theoretical predictions for tidal dissipation of gravity waves in radiation zones, and find that wave breaking is predicted only in WASP-173, making rapid decay plausible in this system but unclear in the other three. The sensitivity of transit timings to orbital decay depends on the square of the time interval covered by available observations, so our results establish a useful baseline against which future measurements can be compared. NGTS-6 and NGTS-10 are important objects for future study as they are in the first field to be observed by the upcoming PLATO mission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Closing in on $α$-attractors</a><span class="id">[2511.14673]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies combined with large-scale structure may point towards higher values of the scalar spectral index, $n_s$. This puts previously preferred inflationary models, such as $\alpha$-attractors, in tension with the new measurements. Pending a resolution of the tension between BAO parameters as determined by CMB datasets and those determined by DESI, we explore in this work the large-$n_s$ regime of $\alpha$-attractor T-models. We show that some T-models can self-consistently produce an extended reheating stage with a stiff equation of state $(\bar w&gt;1/3)$, which allows values for $n_s$ closer to unity. We employ constraints from P-ACT-LB-BK18 data to illustrate what large-$n_s$ observations might imply for T-models. We show that the $n_s$ measurement yields an upper limit on $\alpha$ that is stronger than the one from the tensor-to-scalar ratio only. We find that $n_s$ is maximised for $\alpha\sim1$, therefore the seven Poincaré models are well placed to deliver large $n_s$. However, the ability of a stiff reheating stage to increase the compatibility of T-models with large-$n_s$ measurements saturates as $\bar{w}\to1$. Thanks to this effect, we establish that the largest $n_s$ that T-models can produce is $n_s=0.9682$. T-models are therefore highly predictive in the large-$n_s$ regime and our result provides, under the assumption of perturbative reheating, a benchmark which could be used in the future to rule out T-models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14677" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equilateral non-Gaussian Bias at the Field Level</a><span class="id">[2511.14677]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) is a common prediction of a wide class of inflationary models. Equilateral-type PNG, generically predicted by single-field inflationary models with higher-derivative interactions, imprints subtle but measurable signatures on the large-scale distribution of matter. An important parameter of these imprints is the PNG-induced bias coefficient $b_\psi$, which quantifies how the abundance and clustering of dark matter halos and galaxies respond to mode coupling in the initial conditions. Measuring $b_\psi$ is important for constraining equilateral PNG, yet it is notoriously challenging due to its degeneracy with Gaussian scale-dependent bias contributions. In this work, we present the first precision measurements of equilateral $b_\psi$ for dark matter halos using effective field theory at the field level. We show that this approach disentangles PNG effects from those of the Gaussian bias by virtue of noise variance cancellation. We compare our results with the phenomenological predictions based on the Peak-Background Split model, finding some agreement at the qualitative level on the redshift and mass dependence, but poor agreement at the quantitative level. We present a fitting formula for $b_\psi$ as a function of the linear bias, which can be used to set priors in PNG searches with ongoing and future galaxy surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The first data-driven bounds on the quantum decoherence of inflationary gravitational waves</a><span class="id">[2511.14727]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The (large-scale) structures we observe in the Universe are classical, but within the inflationary scenario they do originate from quantum fluctuations. This leads to the question: ”How did this quantum-to-classical transition occur?”. A potential explanation is quantum decoherence due to interactions between different fields present during inflation. The tensor modes (i.e. primordial gravitational waves) can interact with a scalar sector, causing their quantum decoherence to occur and inducing a change in the gravitational wave (GW) background. The power spectrum of these GWs can be constrained using the upper bounds found by Planck, BICEP/Keck Array, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and the Pulsar Timing Array detections. These impose constraints on the interaction between the fields. We find that the observational upper bounds mainly constrain scenarios with a strong interaction, especially if the interaction is also strongly time dependent. Furthermore, we find which observationally allowed scenarios have not completed decoherence by the end of inflation, thus possibly leaving quantum signatures in the GW background. Lastly, we show that, interestingly enough, there are decoherence scenarios corresponding to the signal observed by PTA experiments. This highlights the importance of the quantum decoherence effect on GWs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starlight-driven flared-staircase geometry in radiation hydrodynamic models of protoplanetary disks</a><span class="id">[2511.14733]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Protoplanetary disks observed in millimeter continuum and scattered light show a variety of substructures. Various physical processes in the disk could trigger such features – one of which that has been previously theorized for passive disks is the thermal wave instability – the flared disk may become unstable as directly illuminated regions puff up and cast shadows behind them. This would manifest as bright and dark rings, and a staircase-like structure in the disk optical surface. We provide a realistic radiation hydrodynamic model to test the limits of the thermal wave instability in irradiated disks. We carry out global axisymmetric 2D hydrostatic and dynamic simulations including radiation transport with frequency-dependent ray-traced irradiation and flux-limited diffusion (FLD). We found that starlight-driven shadows are most prominent in optically thick, slow cooling disks, shown by our models with high surface densities and dust-to-gas ratios of sub-micron grains of 0.01. We recover that thermal waves form and propagate inwards in the hydrostatic limit. In contrast, our hydrodynamic models show bumps and shadows within 30 au that converge to a quasi-steady state on several radiative diffusion timescales – indicating a long-lived staircase structure. We find that existing thermal pressure bumps could produce and enhance this effect, forming secondary shadowing downstream. Hydrostatic models with self-consistent dust settling instead show a superheated dust irradiation absorption surface with a radially smooth temperature profile without staircases. We conclude that one can recover thermally induced flared-staircase structures in radiation hydrodynamic simulations of irradiated protoplanetary disks using flux-limited diffusion. We highlight the importance of modeling dust dynamics consistently to explain starlight-driven shadows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14739" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forecasting properties of detectable massive binary black hole mergers in the era of space based gravitational-wave detectors</a><span class="id">[2511.14739]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves (GWs) from massive black hole (MBH) mergers will provide a novel way to probe the high-redshift universe and are key to understanding galactic dynamics and evolution. In this work, we analyze MBH mergers, their GW signals and detectability, as well as their population properties, using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation - NINJA Simulation Suite. We discuss the effect of resolution and finite volume on the black hole mass function (BHMF), which in turn limits the mergers associated with low mass black holes, $M_{BH} \lesssim 10^{6.5} M_\odot$. We find the upper limit on the total mass of the MBH binaries detectable by LISA to be $\sim 10^{8.4} M_\odot$. We also find that adding time delays pertaining to dissipative processes like dynamical friction and stellar hardening during the final stages of the inspiral for which the simulation lacks sufficient resolution to model, considerably shifts the peak of redshift distribution of detectable binaries from $z\sim0.5$ to $z\sim0.1$. Time delays reduce the number of detectable GW events but on the other hand their signal-to-noise is increased. From the observational point of view, we find a strong correlation between the SFR and $L_{\rm bol}$ at high redshifts for the detectable LISA binaries. This may prove to be a future application in the coincident observation of MBH binaries by GW and electromagnetic observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The tidal response of a relativistic star</a><span class="id">[2511.05139]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a fully relativistic approach for determining the frequency-dependent tidal response of a compact star.

Notably, this identification is exact in Newtonian gravity and we provide strong evidence that it remains robust also in the relativistic case. The argument does not involve a sum over the star's quasinormal modes and hence circumvents one of the obstacles that have held up the development of models for relativistic tides. Numerical results are provided, at the proof-of-principle level, for a realistic matter equation of state from the BSk family, including composition stratification leading to the presence of low-frequency gravity modes. We also sketch the connection with the field-theory inspired approach to the problem, in which the tidal response is expressed in terms of asymptotic scattering amplitudes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effects of Lighter-than-QCD Axions on Neutron Star Tidal Deformability</a><span class="id">[2511.13812]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Finite density corrections to the lighter-than-QCD axion can invert the effective axion potential, sourcing a non-trivial axion field inside dense objects.

Within this framework, the relevant infrared structure is encoded in a functional Berry phase associated with the space of gauge connections, and the corresponding Berry corrections modify the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. The infrared scaling symmetry of the Rayleigh-Jeans law leads to a simple renormalization-group equation whose solution determines the frequency dependence of an effective factor $F_{\rm eff}(\omega)$ controlling the strength of the electron-photon cloud dressing. As a result, the energy density of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) receives a Berry-induced correction that scales as a power law and produces a frequency-dependent temperature excess in the radio domain. Although the exponent $\gamma$ governing this scaling behaviour is not fixed internally by the present formulation of IR-QED and must instead be determined phenomenologically, the existence and structure of the excess are genuine predictions of the theory. Remarkably, the resulting expression is extremely simple and naturally aligns with the deviations suggested by the ARCADE 2 data. Taken together, these results indicate that Berry phases in IR-QED may lead to observable consequences in the low-frequency tail of the CMB spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A non-local origin for massive gravity and late-time acceleration</a><span class="id">[2511.14055]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The accelerated expansion of the universe poses a significant challenge to General Relativity.

Recent advances have demonstrated that SGS models trained via “online” end-to-end learning – where the dynamical solver operating on the filtered equations participates in the training – can outperform traditional physics-based approaches. Most studies, however, have focused on idealised periodic domains, neglecting the mechanical boundaries present e.g. in planetary interiors. To address this issue, we consider two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulent flow in an axisymmetric bounded domain that we model using a pseudo-spectral differentiable solver, thereby enabling online learning. We examine three configurations, varying the geometry (between an exponential container and a spherical shell) and the rotation rate. Flow is driven by a prescribed analytical forcing, allowing for precise control over the energy injection scale and an exact estimate of the power input. We evaluate the accuracy of the online-trained SGS model against the reference direct numerical simulation using integral quantities and spectral diagnostics. In all configurations, we show that an SGS model trained on data spanning only one turnover time remains stable and accurate over integrations at least a hundred times longer than the training period. Moreover, we demonstrate the model's remarkable ability to reproduce slow processes occurring on time scales far exceeding the training duration, such as the inward drift of jets in the spherical shell. These results suggest a promising path towards developing SGS models for planetary and stellar interior dynamics, including dynamo processes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling dark fifth forces with linear cosmology</a><span class="id">[2204.08484]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We initiate the exploration of the cosmology of dark fifth forces: new forces acting solely on Dark Matter. We focus on long range interactions which lead to an effective violation of the Equivalence Principle on cosmological scales today. At the microscopic level, the dark fifth force can be realized by a light scalar with mass smaller than the Hubble constant today ($\lesssim 10^{-33}\,\text{eV}$) coupled to Dark Matter. We study the behavior of the background cosmology and linear perturbations in such a Universe. At the background level, the new force modifies the evolution of the Dark Matter energy density and thus the Hubble flow. At linear order, it modifies the growth of matter perturbations and generates relative density and velocity perturbations between Dark Matter and baryons that grow over time. We derive constraints from current CMB and BAO data, bounding the strength of the dark fifth force to be less than a percent of gravity. These are the strongest constraints to date. We present potential implications of this scenario for the Hubble tension and discuss how our results are modified if the light scalar mediator accounts for the observed density of the Dark Energy. Finally, we comment on the interplay between our constraints and searches for violations of the Equivalence Principle in the visible sector.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03350" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Simplified Model for the Forced Libration of Icy Moons with Subsurface Oceans: Application to Enceladus and Mimas</a><span class="id">[2405.03350]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a simple two-layered viscoelastic rheological model capable of replicating the forced librations of an icy moon with a subsurface ocean.

Evaluating these model predictions requires considering both slow-roll inflationary dynamics and the subsequent reheating epoch. This involves the quantitative analysis that takes into account the effective equation of state (EoS) and duration of reheating, connecting these with the perturbations generated deep during the inflationary era. Given the complexities involved, many approximations are often used for simplification. However, as future observations are expected to improve the accuracy of these observables significantly, this work takes a different approach. Instead of relying on approximations, and instead of looking into the complex effects of (pre-)reheating, we focus on the corrections arising purely from more accurate analytical evaluations of the perturbations generated during the inflationary era itself. This is because the reheating dynamics is model-dependent and lack a single concrete analytical description, and thus introduce large uncertainties, making robust predictions difficult. In this article, we mainly incorporate two improvements: the first is the accurate dynamics of the slow-roll evolution and, thus, the end of inflation, and the second is the higher-order slow-roll corrections to the perturbed observables. Our findings indicate that, by implementing these corrections, the theoretical predictions improve significantly. It also indicates that seemingly minor corrections can have significant effects on the perturbed observables, and these refined predictions can be compared with future observations to potentially rule out models and help resolve the degeneracy problem of the inflationary paradigm.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08099" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of binaries containing a hot subdwarf and a white dwarf to double white dwarfs, and double detonation supernovae with hypervelocity runaway stars</a><span class="id">[2411.08099]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Compact binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs have the potential to evolve into a variety of explosive transients. These systems could also explain hypervelocity runaway stars such as US 708. We use the detailed binary evolution code MESA to evolve hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars interacting in binaries. We explore their evolution towards double detonation supernovae, helium novae, or double white dwarfs. Our grid of 3120 models maps from initial conditions such as orbital period and masses of hot subdwarf and white dwarf to these outcomes. The minimum amount of helium required to ignite the helium shell that leads to a double detonation supernova in our grid is $\approx 0.05 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, likely too large to produce spectra similar to normal type Ia supernovae, but compatible with inferred helium shell masses from some observed peculiar type I supernovae. We also provide the helium shell masses for our double white dwarf systems, with a maximum He shell mass of $\approx 0.18\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. In our double detonation systems, the orbital velocity of the surviving donor star ranges from $\approx 450 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ to $\approx 1000 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Among the surviving donors, we also estimate the runaway velocities of proto-white dwarfs, which have higher runaway velocities than hot subdwarf stars of the same mass. Our grid will provide a first-order estimate of the potential outcomes for the observation of binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs from future missions like Gaia, LSST, and LISA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on the dark matter-baryon interaction cross section from galaxy cluster thermodynamics</a><span class="id">[2411.18706]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter (DM) models with a non-zero DM-baryon interaction cross section imply energy transfer between DM and baryons. We present a new method of constraining the DM-baryon interaction cross section and DM particle mass for velocity-independent interactions using the thermodynamics of galaxy clusters. If the baryonic gas in these clusters is in thermodynamic equilibrium and DM cools baryons, this cooling rate is limited by the net heating rate of other mechanisms in the cluster. We use the REFLEX clusters from the Meta-Catalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of Galaxies (MCXC) with mass estimates from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) catalog of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) selected galaxy clusters. This yields 95% upper bounds on the DM-proton interaction cross section for velocity-independent interactions of $\sigma_0\leq9.3\times10^{-28} \mathrm{~cm^2}$ for DM masses, $m_\chi = 10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ GeV. These constraints are within an order of magnitude of the best constraints derived in this mass range, and serve as a complementary, independent constraint. We also apply this model to the fractional interacting DM scenario, where only 10% and 1% of the DM is interacting. Unlike other methods, this constraint scales linearly with this fraction. This yields 95% upper bounds of $\sigma_0\leq1.1\times10^{-26} \mathrm{~cm^2}$ and $\sigma_0\leq8.2\times10^{-26} \mathrm{~cm^2}$, which are the strongest existing constraints for this scenario. This paper serves as a proof of concept. Upcoming SZ measurements will provide temperature profiles for galaxy clusters. Combining these measurements with more complex thermodynamic models could lead to more robust constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Threshold for PBH formation in the type-II region and its analytical estimation</a><span class="id">[2504.05814]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry, driven by the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations, for different curvature profiles $\zeta$. Our results show that the threshold for PBH formation, defined as the peak value of the critical compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ (where $r_m$ is the scale at which the peak occurs), does not necessarily asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in the type-II region with $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ being a minimum. We find, for the cases tested, that this is a general trend associated with profiles that exhibit extremely large curvatures in the linear component of the compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{l}(r) \equiv -4r \zeta'(r)/3$ shape around its peak $r_m$ (spiky shapes). To measure this curvature at $r_m$, we define a dimensionless parameter, $\kappa \equiv -r^{2}_m \mathcal{C}_l''(r_m)$, and we find that the thresholds observed in the type-II region occur for sufficiently large $\kappa$ for the profiles we have used, contrary to expectations. By defining the threshold in terms of $\mathcal{C}_{l,c}(r_m)$, we extend previous analytical estimations to the type-II region, which is shown to be accurate within a few percent when compared to the numerical simulations for the tested profiles. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the type-II region may have been overestimated due to the general assumption that it should saturate at the boundary between the type-I and type-II regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A possible periodic RM evolution in the repeating FRB 20220529</a><span class="id">[2505.10463]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin.

Although multiwavelength observations have been widely conducted, only Galactic FRB 20200428D is associated with an X-ray burst from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154. Here, we present multiwavelength follow-up observations of the nearby bright FRB 20250316A, including the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), Einstein Probe (EP) X-ray mission, Chandra X-ray Observatory, Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) and Space Variable Object Monitor/Visible Telescope (SVOM/VT). The 13.08-hour FAST follow-up campaign without pulse detection requires an energy distribution flatter than those of well-known repeating FRBs, suggesting that this burst is likely a one-off event. A prompt EP follow-up and multi-epoch observational campaign totaling $&gt;$ 100 ks led to the detection of an X-ray source within the angular resolution of its Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT, $10^{\prime\prime}$). A subsequent Chandra observation revealed this source to be offset by $7^{\prime\prime}$ from the FRB position, and established a 0.5-10 keV flux upper limit of $7.6\times 10^{-15}$ $\rm erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ at the FRB position, corresponding to $\sim 10^{39}$ $\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ at the 40 Mpc distance of the host galaxy NGC 4141. These results set one of the most stringent limits on X-ray emission from a non-repeating FRB, disfavoring ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) as counterparts of apparently one-off FRBs and offering critical insights into afterglow models. Our study suggests that an arcsecond localization of both the FRB and its potential X-ray counterpart is essential for exploring the X-ray counterpart of an FRB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impacts of axion cooling on the direct detection of supernova axions</a><span class="id">[2508.18491]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Core-collapse supernovae provide a unique opportunity to probe axions because they can be a copious source of the particles. It has recently been proposed that axion helioscopes can be used for the direct search for supernova axions if a supernova event appears within a few hundred parsecs. However, the event number of supernova axions has been estimated only within the post-process framework. In this study, we perform long-term supernova simulations for a 9.6M_sun star coupled with the axion emission to reevaluate the event number of axions detected by the helioscopes. We find that the additional cooling induced by the axion emission can significantly decrease the temperature in the proto-neutron star. As a result, the axion luminosity and hence the axion event number are reduced, compared with the result obtained through post-processing. Our result indicates that the nonlinear feedback of the axion emission is an essential factor to predict the axion detectability, and underscores the need for systematic simulation studies across various progenitor models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15487" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DiskMINT: Self-Consistent Thermochemical Disk Models with Radially Varying Gas and Dust – Application to the Massive, CO-Rich Disk of IM Lup</a><span class="id">[2509.15487]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Disks around young stars are the birthplaces of planets, and the spatial distribution of their gas and dust masses is critical for understanding where and what types of planets can form. We present self-consistent thermochemical disk models built with DiskMINT, which extends its initial framework to allow for spatially decoupled gas and dust distributions. DiskMINT calculates the gas temperature based on thermal equilibrium with dust grains, solves vertical gas hydrostatic equilibrium, and includes key processes for the CO chemistry, specifically selective photodissociation, and freeze-out with conversion CO/CO$_2$ ice. We apply DiskMINT to study the IM Lup disk, a large massive disk, yet with an inferred CO depletion of up to 100 based on earlier thermochemical models. By fitting the multi-wavelength SED along with the millimeter continuum, ${\rm C^{18}O}$ radial emission profiles, we find $0.02-0.08\,{\rm M_\odot}$ for the gas disk mass, which are consistent with the dynamical-based mass within the uncertainties. We further compare the derived surface densities for dust and gas and find that the outer disk is drift-dominated, with a dust-to-gas mass ratio of approximately 0.01-0.02, which is likely insufficient to meet the conditions for the streaming instability to occur. Our results suggest that when interpreted with self-consistent thermochemical models, ${\rm C^{18}O}$ alone can serve as a reliable tracer of both the total gas mass and its radial distribution. This approach enables gas mass estimates in lower-mass disks, where dynamical constraints are not available, and in fainter systems where rare species like ${\rm N_2H^+}$ are too weak to detect.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High energy gamma rays and neutrinos from the Sun, Jupiter and Earth</a><span class="id">[2509.20970]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic rays reaching the atmosphere of an astrophysical object produce showers of secondary particles that may then escape into space.

Given their scarcity, it is important to maximise the discovery possibility of new kilonova events. To this end, we present our follow-up observations of the gravitational-wave signal, S250818k, a plausible binary neutron star merger at a distance of $237 \pm 62$ Mpc. Pan-STARRS tiled 286 and 318 square degrees (32% and 34% of the 90% sky localisation region) within 3 and 7 days of the GW signal, respectively. ATLAS covered 65% of the skymap within 3 days, but with lower sensitivity. These observations uncovered 47 new transients; however, none were deemed to be linked to S250818k. We undertook an expansive follow-up campaign of AT 2025ulz, the purported counterpart to S250818k. The griz-band lightcurve, combined with our redshift measurement ($z = 0.0849 \pm 0.0003$) all indicate that SN 2025ulz is a SN IIb, and thus not the counterpart to S250818k. We rule out the presence of a AT 2017gfo-like kilonova within $\approx 27$% of the distance posterior sampled by our Pan-STARRS pointings ($\approx 9.1$% across the total 90% three-dimensional sky localisation). We demonstrate that early observations are optimal for probing the distance posterior of the three-dimensional gravitational-wave skymap, and that SN 2025ulz was a plausible kilonova candidate for $\lesssim 5$ days, before ultimately being ruled out.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11819" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hubble reveals complex multi-scale structure in the edge-on protoplanetary disk IRAS 23077+6707</a><span class="id">[2510.11819]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-resolution ($\lesssim 0.1''$) Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) imaging of the near edge-on ($i{\sim}80^\circ$) protoplanetary disk IRAS 23077+6707 (&quot;Dracula's Chivito&quot;) obtained across six broadband filters spanning $0.4-1.6\,\mu$m.

Cygnus OB2, in the Cygnus X complex – one of the most active star-forming regions of the Galaxy – hosts hundreds of O- and B-type stars at different evolutionary stages. This association provides a unique laboratory to study massive star evolution and dynamics. However, despite extensive studies, the absence of a fast-rotating group ($v\sin{i}&gt;200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) among the O-type population of Cygnus OB2 challenges current models of massive star evolution. Aims. Stellar rotation strongly impacts spectral line shapes of O-type stars, and high rotation can potentially lead to misclassifications. We investigate whether some stars in Cygnus OB2, classified at low spectral resolution as B0, are actually rapidly rotating late-O types. Such cases could explain the observed lack of fast rotators in Cygnus OB2. Methods. Accounting for rotation, we reclassified the known B0 population in Cygnus OB2, using the MGB tool and both the new and pre-existing optical spectroscopy. Finally, we computed the projected rotational velocities using iacob-broad. Results. About $19\,\%$ of the initial B0 population in Cygnus OB2 are, in fact, late-O types. Only six stars in the entire dataset show $v\sin{i}&gt;200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, with just one new O-type star exceeding this threshold. Conclusions. In our study of Cygnus OB2, we continue to find a notable lack of fast rotators among its O-type population. We propose a combination of three factors as the most likely explanation: (i) the young age of Cygnus OB2 may imply that fast rotators have not been produced yet due to binary interactions; (ii) fast rotators may have been dynamically ejected from the core as runaway stars; and (iii) local star formation conditions may hinder binary formation (reducing spin-up interactions) or result in slower rotational velocities at birth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Chandra X-ray Observations of Abell 2029: the Merger History of a Relaxed, Strong Cool Core Cluster</a><span class="id">[2511.00250]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from very deep (485 ks) Chandra X-ray observations of the relaxed, cool core cluster Abell 2029 (z = 0.0767).

In addition to providing detailed views of the sloshing spiral, imaging and spectroscopic analysis reveals ICM substructure related to the merger history including a broad “splash” of cooler gas and a potential merger shock. The radio lobes of the central WAT source show evidence of alignment with the sloshing motions, consistent with ICM bulk flow, rather than host-galaxy motion, being the primary driver of lobe bending. Comparison to a 1:10 mass-ratio off-axis merger simulation indicates that the observed ICM structures are relics of a second core passage of a subcluster  4 Gyr after the start of the merger, where the “splash” feature is revealed to be a wake of cool gas trailing behind the subcluster.

The observed high-energy neutrino emission indicates the presence of a hadronic component, along with strong gamma-ray absorption, likely via pair production, and efficient particle acceleration. In this work, we investigate turbulence-driven magnetic reconnection as a mechanism for particle acceleration in the coronal accretion flow surrounding the central black hole. We develop a one-zone model for both acceleration and emission, following the framework of de Gouveia Dal Pino and Lazarian (2005) and Kadowaki et al. (2015) to explore how fast magnetic reconnection in the inner coronal disk region accelerates protons and electrons, shaping the spectral energy distribution (SED). Our model incorporates strong pair production attenuation and interactions with optical, ultraviolet (OUV), and X-ray photon fields in the corona, which serve as effective targets for proton interactions. Unlike recent studies, we find that particle acceleration to the extreme energies required to explain observations is primarily driven by first-order Fermi acceleration within the turbulent reconnection layers in a large scale current sheet, rather than by drift acceleration. Additionally, we demonstrate that accelerated protons primarily lose energy through photopion interactions with the OUV background, subject to important constraints from the coronal X-ray emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addressing the DESI DR2 Phantom-Crossing Anomaly and Enhanced $H_0$ Tension with Reconstructed Scalar-Tensor Gravity</a><span class="id">[2511.04610]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent cosmological data, including DESI DR2, highlight significant tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. When analyzed in the context of General Relativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE) equation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$. However, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck 2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom crossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar fields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of freedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in the context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line within a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be achieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular, Scalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable feature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI DR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple parametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\mu_G(z) \equiv G_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$. This MG framework significantly alleviates the tension, leading to a higher inferred value of $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.7 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also present a systematic, data-driven reconstruction of the required underlying ST Lagrangian and provide simple, generic analytical expressions for both the non-minimal coupling $F(\Phi) = 1+\xi\Phi^{2}e^{n\Phi}$ and the scalar potential $U(\Phi) = U_{0}+ae^{b\Phi^{2}}$, which well-describe the reconstructed functions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Les Trente Glorieuses: 29 years of helioseismic observations with the Luminosity Oscillations Imager</a><span class="id">[2511.10491]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Luminosity Oscillations Imager (LOI) of the Variability of Solar Irradiance and Gravity Oscillations (VIRGO) instrument aboard the SoHO mission has been operating for almost the past 30 years. I report on the effect of solar activity upon mode frequencies, linewidths, height and energy rate. I report on the variation as a function of frequency for frequency, $a_2$ coefficient and linewidth changes, as well as the average over the degree and the frequency of these changes. Using the 29-year time series, I report on the frequencies, linewidths and mode height fitted with \texttt{progFIT}. Using the collapsogram technique, I also report on the detection of modes below 1600 $\mu$Hz, making the lowest frequencies detected with an instrument observing the Sun in intensity. I also report on the detection of p mode in the high voltage and guiding pixel signals with a mode height about 5 to 10 times larger than what is observed in the Sun-as-a-star signal for $l=1$. The ratios of the observed mode visibilities for the different signals are provided following a calibration of the size of the guiding pixels. While the visibility ratios for the signals excluding the limb are in good agreement with theory, those covering the solar limb are in strong disagreement.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doppler imaging combined with high-cadence photometry.

We aim to obtain an accurate reconstruction of the surface spot distribution on the young, rapidly rotating K2 star PW And by combining spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics. In particular, we seek to assess how the inclusion of continuous high-precision TESS photometry in parallel with high-resolution spectroscopy improves latitude recovery of starspots, especially at low latitudes and in the southern hemisphere, which are poorly constrained by Doppler imaging (DI) alone. We explore the spatial origins of the observed white-light flares. We performed simultaneous Doppler imaging and light curve inversion (DI+LCI) using contemporaneous high-resolution GAOES-RV spectra from the 3.8 m Seimei telescope (R 65000) and high-precision TESS light curves. Surface reconstructions employ the SpotDIPy code to model both line profiles and continuum brightness variations. We compare DI+LCI maps with DI-only solutions, conduct artificial-spot simulations to evaluate the effects of latitude, phase coverage, and S/N on reconstruction reliability. We also investigate the spatial correlation between the DI+LCI reconstructed map and flares detected in the TESS data. The DI+LCI reconstruction reveals significant spot features at mid-to-low latitudes, equatorial regions, and even in the southern hemisphere. Simulations show that DI+LCI provides more accurate reconstructions than DI-only, especially under conditions of incomplete phase coverage and low S/N, by better recovering both spot latitudes and filling factors. A comparison between the DI+LCI map and the TESS flare timings also suggests potential association between flare occurrence and reconstructed spot longitudes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaping the Mantle: The Role of Superheated Cores After Giant Impacts</a><span class="id">[2511.13436]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Moon-forming giant impact significantly influenced the initial thermal state of Earth's mantle by generating a global magma ocean, marking the onset of mantle evolution. Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277–5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermodynamics of magnetized BPS baryonic layers</a><span class="id">[2505.18007]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Through the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics, BPS magnetized Baryonic layers (possessing both baryonic charge and magnetic flux) have been constructed in the gauged non-linear sigma model (G-NLSM), which is one of the most relevant effective theories for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the strongly interacting low-energy limit. Since the topological charge that naturally appears on the right hand side of the BPS bound is a non-linear function of the baryonic charge, the thermodynamics of these magnetized Baryonic layers is highly non-trivial. In this work, using tools from the theory of Casimir effect, we derive analytical relationship between baryonic charge, topological charge, magnetic flux and relevant thermodynamical quantities (such as pressure, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility) of these layers. The critical Baryonic chemical potential is identified. Quite interestingly, the grand canonical partition function can be related with the Riemann zeta function. On the technical side, it is quite a remarkable result to derive explicit expressions for all these thermodynamics quantities of a strongly interacting magnetized system at finite Baryon density. On the physical side, such expressions allow a direct physical interpretation which we discuss.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The periastron regression of 2M1510 AB, the jet precession of M87* and Telisto/Planet Nine: three different scenarios for a possible common cause</a><span class="id">[2508.18881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of a two-body system acted upon by a remote massive pointlike object are analytically worked out, to the Newtonian quadrupolar level, without any restriction either on the orbital eccentricity and inclination of the disturbed pair or the position of the distant perturber. The latter is considered fixed during the average over one orbital revolution of the inner binary by means of which its orbital perturbations are calculated. The results are presented in a compact form that facilitates a straightforward application, for example, to the cases of the eclipsing binary 2M1510 AB made of two brown dwarfs, the supermassive black hole-or megapyknon-M87$^\ast$ and our solar system, although they are not limited to such interesting astronomical scenarios alone. The aforementioned systems may all have in common the presence of a distant point mass perturbing in some ways their inner dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to that originally expected. For each of the considered cases, exclusion plots in their parameter spaces are provided.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04566" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring the properties of homogeneous turbulence in curved spacetimes</a><span class="id">[2509.04566]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Turbulence in curved spacetimes in general, and in the vicinity of black holes (BHs) in particular, represents a poorly understood phenomenon that is often analysed employing techniques developed for flat spacetimes. We here propose a novel approach to study turbulence in strong gravitational fields that is based on the computation of structure functions on generic manifolds and is thus applicable to arbitrary curved spacetimes. In particular, we introduce, for the first time, a formalism to compute the characteristic properties of turbulence, such as the second-order structure function or the power spectral density, in terms of proper lengths and volumes and not in terms of coordinate lengths and volumes, as customarily done. By applying the new approach to the turbulent rest-mass density field from simulations of magnetised disc accretion onto a Kerr BH, we inspect in a rigorous way turbulence in regions close to the event horizon, but also in the disc, the wind, and in the jet. We demonstrate that the new approach can capture the typical behavior of an inertial-range cascade and that differences up to $40-80\%$ emerge in the vicinity of the event horizon with respect to the standard flat-spacetime approach. While these differences become smaller at larger distances, our study highlights that special care needs to be paid when analysing turbulence in strongly curved spacetimes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complete Classification of Domain Wall Solutions in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric 2HDM</a><span class="id">[2509.23332]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a complete classification of domain wall solutions in the two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) with a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, categorised as superconducting, CP-violating, or neither, depending on the scalar particle masses and the ratio of the two Higgs doublets' vacuum expectation values. We demonstrate that any domain wall solution can be reduced to depend on only six of the eight general field components, with further field reductions possible within different regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we show that the superconducting solutions can be used to construct stable, current-carrying domain walls in two spatial dimensions. Similarly, the CP-violating solutions allow for two-dimensional configurations where CP symmetry is locally broken on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric wall, which could provide an out-of-equilibrium environment for CP-violating processes to occur.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05950" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symmetry of Bounce Solutions at Finite Temperature</a><span class="id">[2511.05950]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The seminal work of Coleman, Glaser, and Martin established that, at zero temperature, any non-trivial solution to the equations of motion with the least Euclidean action is $O(D)$-symmetric.

Moreover, we give order-of-magnitude arguments showing that GEM quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs) can become relevant in a range of charged and magnetized astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we show through a brief dilaton-theory example that the GEM QQNM spectrum is sensitive to how gravity couples to electromagnetism, thereby providing a model-based way to test minimal coupling and to constrain hidden $U(1)$ sectors with gravitational-wave observations.</p></div></details></article></body>
