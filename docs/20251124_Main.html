However, such indications may instead arise from the intrinsic likelihood geometry of individual datasets, residual inter-probe tension, or restrictive priors. These factors can mimic evidence for dynamical dark energy. To clarify these issues, we perform a controlled null test. We use realistic mock BAO, CMB, and Type Ia supernova datasets generated from a common fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology. These mocks include the DESI DR2 BAO covariance, the Planck 2018 distance-prior covariance, and the full Pantheon+ SH0ES supernova covariance. This setup isolates physical information from geometric or statistical effects in the CPL parametrization. We find that individual probes and most two-probe combinations show apparent deviations in the (w0,wa) plane. These could be mistaken for phantom crossing or evolving dark energy. Two-probe combinations including supernovae (BAO+SNe, CMB+SNe) recover values near (w0,wa)=(-1,0) but fail to reconstruct (Omegam0,H0), because SNe do not determine the absolute distance scale. Combinations without SNe (BAO+CMB), as well as any single dataset, retain strong degeneracy directions. These produce significant shifts driven purely by likelihood geometry. These behaviors arise because BAO, CMB, and SNe each constrain only one principal direction in (w0,wa) space. Their degeneracy ridges are misaligned due to distinct redshift sensitivities. In contrast, the full BAO+CMB+SNe likelihood with proper covariance breaks all degeneracies simultaneously. It cleanly recovers the fiducial cosmology, including (w0,wa)=(-1,0) and (Omegam0,H0). Our results provide a transparent benchmark for assessing future claims of omega(z) neq -1. They emphasize the need for complete multi-probe analyses with flexible H0 and rd priors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Pulsar Detected in Reprocessed Archival Parkes Observations of SNR 1987A</a><span class="id">[2511.16706]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have reprocessed the available archival radio pulsar search observations of SNR 1987A taken with the Parkes 64-m telescope, some of which have not been previously published. We conducted a standard periodicity search on these data as well as a single pulse search at a range of dispersion measures. We found no convincing candidate signals, and we calculate flux density, luminosity, and single pulse fluence limits from these observations. The derived luminosity limits are comparable to the luminosities of three young, energetic pulsars (the Crab pulsar, PSR B0540$-$69, and PSR J0537$-$6910), and so we cannot rule out the existence of a pulsar in SNR 1987A with a similar radio luminosity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Surface and Interior Conditions of Temperate Sub-Neptune TOI-270 d</a><span class="id">[2511.16722]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sub-Neptune planets, with no analogue in our solar system, provide a wealth of information about exoplanet diversity, formation &amp; evolution, and habitability. Their robust characterisation requires the coupling of physically informed atmosphere and interior models with precise atmospheric data to break compositional degeneracies. Recent JWST observations of the temperate sub-Neptune TOI-270 d revealed detections of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in its H$_2$-rich atmosphere, with tentative inferences of H$_2$O and CS$_2$ and a non-detection of NH$_3$. We conduct a theoretical exploration of the range of possible interiors for TOI-270 d based on the current observational constraints. We carry out internal structure modelling using a coupled atmosphere-interior model, including self-consistent atmospheric temperature structures informed by JWST observations. The bulk properties permit solutions spanning mini-Neptune, gas dwarf and hycean scenarios, with a wide range of possible surface conditions, which are strongly dependent on the atmospheric properties, including the presence of clouds/hazes. We explore the solutions allowing for surface water oceans on TOI-270 d, including under potentially habitable conditions. The atmospheric mass fractions permitting habitable surface conditions are found to be $\lesssim$$3.5\times10^{-5}$ and pressures $\lesssim$100 bar for the envelope temperature structures considered. We consider mini-Neptune interiors that are sufficiently warm for H$_2$O to be mixed with the H$_2$-rich envelope. Finally, we consider possible gas dwarf interiors, finding H$_2$-rich envelope mass fractions of $\sim$$1-5$ % are required to satisfy the bulk properties, with surface pressures $\sim10^4-10^5$ bar. Further theoretical and experimental studies in addition to future atmospheric observations will aid the characterisation of the possible interior and surface conditions on TOI-270 d.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution mapping III: A new recipe for the halo mass function</a><span class="id">[2511.16730]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new prescription for the halo mass function (HMF) built upon the Evolution Mapping framework. This approach provides a physical motivation to parametrise the non-universality of the HMF in terms of the recent history of structure formation and the local shape of the linear matter power spectrum. Our model was calibrated against measurements from N-body simulations, with halo samples defined by ten overdensity thresholds, $\Delta$, ranging from 150 to 1600 times the mean background matter density. For our reference mass definition, $\Delta=200$, the calibrated fitting function achieves per cent-level accuracy across a wide range of masses, redshifts, and structure formation histories, and maintains this performance when tested on cosmologies with different linear power spectrum shapes. This high level of accuracy is maintained across other mass definitions, degrading only slightly to the 5 per cent level at the highest values of $\Delta$. We also provide fitting formulae to interpolate the parameters as a function of $\Delta$, which allows for accurate modelling of HMFs defined by intermediate overdensities, with accuracy still well within 5 per cent when tested on halo catalogues defined by the virial overdensity threshold. Compared to other commonly used recipes, our prescription yields competitive or superior accuracy across all redshifts and cosmologies, successfully capturing the non-universal features of the HMF where other models exhibit systematic deviations. This work provides a high-precision modelling tool for cluster abundance analyses, and demonstrates the power of the evolution mapping framework for building accurate models of observables in the non-linear regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 12CO Gas Structures of Protoplanetary Disks in the Upper Scorpius Region</a><span class="id">[2511.16734]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present measurements of key protoplanetary disk properties inferred from parametric models of ALMA 12CO spectral line visibilities. We derive gas-disk radii, integrated fluxes, optically thick emission layers, and brightness temperature profiles for the disk population of the old (4 - 14 Myr) Upper Scorpius star-forming region. We measure CO emission sizes for 37 disks with bright CO J=3-2 emission (S/N &gt; 10 on the integrated flux; out of the 83 disks with CO detections), finding that the median radius containing 90% of the flux is  84 au, with radii spanning from 23 up to 243 au. We report a correlation between the 12CO brightness temperatures and stellar luminosities, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.6, and we use it to prove that the 12CO optically thick emission layer primarily emanates from a region below the super-heated dust, which is optically thin to the stellar irradiation. Moreover, we derive 33 CO emission surface height profiles, finding a median aspect ratio &lt;z/r&gt;   0.16 in a range from  0.01 up to  0.45 over the sample. Finally, we comment on the multiple systems in our sample, of which only some were already known. These results re-affirm how it is possible to derive bulk disk properties by modeling moderate angular resolution ALMA visibilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16737" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zooming into the water snowline: high resolution water observations of the HL Tau disk</a><span class="id">[2511.16737]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Water is one of the central molecules for the formation and habitability of planets. In particular, the region where water freezes-out, the water snowline, could be a favorable location to form planets in protoplanetary disks. We use high resolution ALMA observations to spatially resolve H$_2$O, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and SO emission in the HL Tau disk. A rotational diagram analysis is used to characterize the water reservoir seen with ALMA and compare this to the reservoir visible at mid- and far-IR wavelengths. We find that the H$_2$O 183 GHz line has a compact central component and a diffuse component that is seen out to  75 au. A radially resolved rotational diagram shows that the excitation temperature of the water is  350 K independent of radius. The steep drop in the water brightness temperature outside the central beam of the observations where the emission is optically thick is consistent with the water snowline being located inside the central beam ($\lesssim 6$ au) at the height probed by the observations. Comparing the ALMA lines to those seen at shorter wavelengths shows that only 0.02%-2% of the water reservoir is visible at mid- and far-IR wavelengths, respectively, due to optically thick dust hiding the emission whereas 35-70% is visible with ALMA. An anti-correlation between the H$_2$O and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission is found but this is likely caused by optically thick dust hiding the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission in the disk center. Finally, we see SO emission tracing the disk and for the first time in SO a molecular outflow and the infalling streamer out to  2&quot;. The velocity structure hints at a possible connection between the SO and the H$_2$O emission. Spatially resolved observations of H$_2$O lines at (sub-)mm wavelengths provide valuable constraints on the location of the water snowline, while probing the bulk of the gas-phase reservoirs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16755" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbulence in Core-Collapse Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2511.16755]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is understood in a general sense that turbulent fluid motion below the shock front in a core-collapse supernova stiffens the effective equation of state of the fluid and aids in the revival of the explosion. However, when one wishes to be precise and quantify the amount of turbulence in a supernova simulation, one immediately encounters the problem that turbulence is difficult to define and measure. Using the 3D magnetohydrodynamic code ELEPHANT, we study how different definitions of turbulence change one's conclusions about the amount of turbulence in a supernova and the extent to which it helps the explosion. We find that, while all the definitions of turbulence we use lead to a qualitatively similar growth pattern over time of the turbulent kinetic energy in the gain region, the total amount of turbulent kinetic energy, and especially the ratios of turbulent to total kinetic energy, distinguish them. Some of the definitions appear to indicate turbulence is a necessary contributor to the explosion, and others indicate it is not. The different definitions also produce turbulence maps with different correlations with maps of the enstrophy, a quantity widely regarded as also indicating the presence of turbulence. We also compute the turbulent adiabatic index and observe that in regions of low enstrophy, this quantity is sensitive to the definition used. As a consequence, the effective adiabatic index depends upon the method used to measure the turbulence and thus alter one's conclusions regarding the impact of turbulence within the supernova.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ionizing radiation of [WR] stars: atmospheres and photoionization models</a><span class="id">[2511.16761]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The radiation field of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) is crucial for determining the physical conditions of planetary nebulae (PNe). Many studies in the literature model PNe using the blackbody approximation (bb) or plane-parallel (p-p) atmospheres as the ionizing source. However, these approaches become inconsistent when the central star is a Wolf-Rayet ([WR]) type. These objects are hydrogen-deficient and exhibit intense stellar winds, similar to classical massive WR stars. Their accurate description therefore requires sophisticated NLTE expanding atmosphere models. In this work, we selected [WR] NLTE expanding-atmosphere models spanning a range of temperatures and mass-loss rates and compared them with bb and p-p models. We examined differences in the spectral energy distribution and ionizing photon fluxes for H I, He I, and He II to assess the impact of stellar winds on the nebula-star interaction. Using CLOUDY, we also evaluated how each ionizing source affects predicted line ratios (I$_{\lambda}$/I$_{\beta}$) for a sample of PNe with [WR] nuclei. Model performance was measured through the rms deviation between observed and predicted ratios. For temperatures below 100,000 K, the EUV spectrum differs strongly among the three model types. Stellar winds introduce substantial opacity, reducing log Q(He II) significantly relative to no-wind models. For hotter [WR] stars, wind effects on ionizing fluxes are much smaller. For nebulae hosting late-type [WR] stars, models including winds provide much better agreement with observed line ratios than bb or p-p models, whereas for early-type stars the choice of ionizing source has only a minor influence. Our results indicate that bb and p-p approximations should be avoided when modelling PNe with [WR] central stars, especially those of the [WCL] subtype, because they fail to reproduce the strong wind-modified ionizing spectra.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The nature of UHE source 1LHAASO J1740+0948u and its connection to PSR J1740+1000</a><span class="id">[2511.16764]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present multi-wavelength analysis of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u and its surroundings including the pulsar wind nebula of middle-aged pulsar PSR J1740+1000. Although a dozen X-ray sources are found within the UHE emission site, careful analysis shows that they are unlikely to produce the observed UHE emission. The most likely particle accelerator is pulsar J1740+1000 which if offset by 13' north of the UHE source but appears to be connected to it by an extended feature seen in X-rays. For a plausible pulsar distance of 1.2 kpc, 1LHAASO J1740+0948u must be located about 5 pc away which requires rapid transport of electrons along the feature to avoid radiative losses. This poses several challenges for standard pulsar theory. Firstly, being produced $\lesssim$ 10 kyrs ago, particles must have been accelerated to the energy corresponding to a large fraction of the pulsar's full potential drop across the polar cap. Secondly, due to the lack of TeV emission extension toward the pulsar, particles must be accumulating in the UHE region. In this context, we discuss two possible scenarios: a tail filled with pulsar wind and confined by the bow-shock due to the fast pulsar's motion and an ISM filament filled by the most energetic pulsar wind particles escaping from the apex of the bow-shock.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical fractalization of ring systems</a><span class="id">[2511.16768]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop an effective model to describe the dynamics of a system of particle moving in circular configurations around a central mass, by considering the continuum limit of the angular distribution, to obtain the stable configurations for different initial parameters.

Initial analysis of this data revealed an enhanced Rayleigh scattering slope at the blue end of the transmission spectrum, suggesting the presence of hazes at high altitudes. In this work, we report non-detection of this slope, confirming an atmosphere clear of high-altitude aerosols consistent with the pre-JWST results. Also contrary to the initial result, our results indicate the presence of gray cloud deck, although at relatively low altitudes/high pressures. We further combined the NIRISS/SOSS spectrum with VLT, HST, and Spitzer to produce a transmission spectrum from 0.35 $\mu$m to 5 $\mu$m. We constrain the mass fraction of multiple chemical species, including: H$_2$O$=-2.62^{+0.43}_{-0.42}$, K$=-5.76^{+1.05}_{-1.13}$, and Na$=-3.40^{+0.90}_{-0.92}$. C/O ratio and metallicity are tentatively constrained at substellar values (C/O$_{planet}=0.57^{+0.07}_{-0.12}$ and [Fe/H]$_{planet}=0.01^{+0.46}_{-0.52}$ compared to C/O$_{star}=0.92\pm0.25$ and [Fe/H]$_{star}=0.24\pm0.05$). Inputing these composition constraints to interior models, we constrain a core mass of $43^{+8}_{-15}$ M$_\oplus$. This, in addition to our inferred super-stellar refractory-to-oxygen ratio ($\Delta\log_{10}(R/O)=1.48^{+0.57}_{-0.62}$) and substellar C/O ratio, suggests that the core of WASP-96 b likely formed outside of water iceline, underwent disk-driven migration, and accreted its atmosphere inside the carbon soot line. We find evidence of atmospheric leading-trailing terminator asymmetries in the broadened sodium absorption feature with a transit time offset of 50 seconds, while the water features appear symmetric. CH$_4$, CO, and CO$_2$ remain unconstrained due to spectral coverage limits. Upcoming JWST NIRSpec/G395H observations (ID 4082, PI: M. Radica) will be crucial for constraining these carbon-bearing species.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A study of transients from ground-based surveys reveals new AM CVn stars</a><span class="id">[2511.16774]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>AM CVn stars are ultra-compact semi-detached binaries consisting of a white dwarf primary and a hydrogen-depleted secondary. In this paper we present spectroscopic and photometric results of 15 transient sources pre-classified as AM CVn candidates. Our analysis confirms 9 systems of the type AM CVn, 3 hydrogen-rich cataclysmic variables (accreting white dwarfs with near-main-sequence stars for donors) and 3 systems that could be evolved cataclysmic variables. Eight of the AM CVn stars are analysed spectroscopically for the first time, which increases the number of spectroscopically confirmed AM CVns by about $10\%$. TESS data revealed the orbital period of the AM CVn star ASASSN-20pv to be $P_\mathrm{orb}=27.282\,\mathrm{min}$, which helps to constrain the possible values of its mass ratio. TESS also helped to determine the superhump periods of one AM CVn star (ASASSN-19ct, $P_\mathrm{sh}=30.94\,\mathrm{min}$) and two cataclysmic variables we classify as WZ Sge stars ($P_\mathrm{sh}=90.77\,\mathrm{min}$ for ZTF18aaaasnn and $P_\mathrm{sh}=91.6\,\mathrm{min}$ for ASASSN-15na). We identified very different abundances in the spectra of the AM CVns binaries ASASSN-15kf and ASASSN-20pv (both $P_\mathrm{orb}\sim 27.5$ min), suggesting different type of donors. Six of the studied AM CVns are X-ray sources, which helped to determine their mass accretion rates. Photometry shows that the duration of all the superoutbursts detected in the AM CVns is consistent with expectations from the disc instability model. Finally, we provide refined criteria for the identification of new systems using all-sky surveys such as LSST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16788" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar Cycle 25 Dynamics from Observational and Statistical Parameters: Characterization of the Maximum Phase and Rotational Behaviour</a><span class="id">[2511.16788]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of Solar Cycle 25 aimed at precisely constraining the interval of its activity maximum using multiple observational parameters: sunspot number (SSN), Wolf number, the 10.7 cm solar radio flux (F10.7), the occurrence rate and speed of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), the statistics of X-ray flares, and the reversal of the global magnetic field. A percentile-based classification of the adjusted F10.7 flux (EPH scale) is introduced, which allows us to identify the maximum-activity interval as August 2024 to January 2025. This period coincides with the reversal of the solar polar fields and is characterized by enhanced eruptive activity, including more than 190 M-class and 19 X-class flares (including an X6.3 flare on 10 December 2024) and multiple CMEs with speeds exceeding 2000 km/s. In the second part of the study we investigate solar rotation during this cycle using an independent observing campaign conducted in April 2025 in San Jose, Costa Rica, with privately owned telescopes in white light and in the H alpha line. Photometric techniques and active-region tracking yield mean synodic angular velocities of 12.8 +/- 2.8 deg/day in the northern hemisphere and 13.38 +/- 0.54 deg/day in the southern hemisphere, corresponding to sidereal periods of 22.78 and 21.77 days, respectively. Complementary SWPC-NOAA sunspot-region data provide synodic periods between 21.19 and 25.74 days, consistent with classical differential-rotation measurements. Linear velocities derived from SDO images span from about 872 km/h to more than 7400 km/h, depending on latitude and date.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In-depth analysis of the clustering of dark matter particles around primordial black holes. Part II. Analytical prescriptions for spikes</a><span class="id">[2511.16800]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) are very appealing dark matter (DM) candidates. It is highly plausible though, should they exist, that they would not make up all of the DM. Several studies showed that if the rest of DM is made of thermal particles, then these should accumulate around such PBHs, leading to the formation of very dense spikes in the radiation era. We contributed a detailed analytical study about this phenomenon, providing clear explanations as for the origin of scaling relations in the form of power-law density profiles with up to 3 different spectral indices, i.e. $3/4$, $3/2$, and $9/4$, and 4 asymptotic regimes. Here, we further derive an approximate analytical solution that enables fast numerical predictions for the density profiles of these spikes. We also address the specific case of self-annihilating DM species and derive new approximate analytical formulae. Our approximate density yields the correct annihilation rate within $\pm 15\%$ precision. We then focus on indirect detection in the cosmic microwave background and in extragalactic gamma-rays. We shed new and subtle light on how mutually exclusive PBHs and self-annihilating DM species can really be. In particular, the discovery of a population of sub-solar PBHs would set stringent constraints on the $s$-wave annihilation cross-section of these particles, a point so far missed in the literature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16813" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gray Spectral Variability in Three Brown Dwarfs Observed by HST/WFC3 Time-Series Observations</a><span class="id">[2511.16813]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The L/T transition is a critical evolutionary stage for brown dwarfs and self-luminous giant planets. L/T transition brown dwarfs are more likely to be spectroscopically variable, and their high-amplitude variability probes distributions in their clouds and chemical makeup. This paper presents Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectral time series data for three variable L/T transition brown dwarfs and compares the findings to the highly variable benchmark object 2MASS J2139. All four targets reveal significant brightness variability between 1.1 to 1.65 micron but show a difference in wavelength dependence of the variability amplitude. Three of our targets do not show significant decrease in variability amplitude in the 1.4 $\mu$m water absorption band commonly found in previous studies of L/T transition brown dwarfs. Additionally, at least two brown dwarfs have irregular-shaped, non-sinusoidal light curves. We create heterogeneous atmospheric models by linearly combining SONORA Diamondback model spectra, comparing them with the observations, and identifying the optimal effective temperature, cloud opacity, and cloud coverage for each object. Comparisons between the observed and model color-magnitude variations that trace both spectral windows and molecular features reveal that the early- T dwarfs likely possess heterogeneous clouds. The three T dwarfs show different trends in the same color-magnitude space which suggests secondary mechanisms driving their spectral variability. This work broadens the sample of L/T transition brown dwarfs that have detailed spectral time series analysis and offers new insights that can guide future atmospheric modeling efforts for both brown dwarfs and exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantifying the impact of selection effects on FRB DM-$z$ relation cosmological inference</a><span class="id">[2511.16850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as powerful probes of baryonic matter in the Universe, offering constraints on cosmological and feedback parameters through their extragalactic dispersion measure-redshift (DM$_\mathrm{exgal}$-$z$) relation. However, the observed FRB population is shaped by complex selection effects arising from instrument sensitivity, DM-dependent search efficiency, and FRB source population redshift-evolution. In this work, we quantify the impact of such observational and population selection effects on cosmological inference derived from the conditional distribution $p(\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{exgal}}|z)$. Using forward-modeled FRB population simulations, we explore progressively realistic survey scenarios incorporating redshift evolution, luminosity function, and instrument DM selection function. To enable rapid likelihood evaluations, we build a neural-network emulator for the variance in cosmic DM, $\sigma^2[\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{cosmic}}(z)]$, trained on $5\times10^4$ baryonification halo-model simulations, achieving $\leq4\%$ accuracy up to $z=4$. We demonstrate that while redshift and DM-dependent selection effects substantially alter the joint distribution $p(\mathrm{DM},z)$, they have a negligible impact on the conditional distribution $p(\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{exgal}}|z)$ for current sample sizes. The parameter biases are $\lesssim0.8\sigma$ for $10^2$ FRBs, indicating that conditional analyses are robust for present surveys. However, depending on the survey DM-dependent search efficiency, these biases may exceed $3\sigma$ for $10^4$ FRBs, thus implying that explicit modeling of selection effects will be essential for next-generation samples.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constructing Earth Formation History Using Deep Mantle Noble Gas Reservoirs</a><span class="id">[2511.16859]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Noble gases are powerful probes of the Earth's early history, as they are chemically inert. Neon isotopic ratios in deep mantle plumes suggest that nebular gases were incorporated into the Earth's interior. This evidence implies the Earth's formation began when there was still gas around, with Earth embryos accreting primordial gas and a fraction of that gas dissolved into molten magma. In this work, we examine these implications, simulating the growth of primordial envelopes using modern gas accretion schemes, and computing the dissolution of nebular Ne into magma oceans following chemical equilibrium. We find that the embryo mass that reproduces the deep mantle concentration of primordial Ne is tightly constrained to $\sim 0.3 M_\oplus$, within a solar nebula depleted by $\geq 100 \times$ in gas density. Embryos of smaller masses cannot accrete enough gas to allow the mantle to reach the melting temperature of basalt. Embryos of larger masses accrete way too much gas, producing excessive Ne concentrations in the deep mantle. Based on our calculations, we suggest that the Earth's formation began with the assembly of $\sim 0.3 M_\oplus$ embryos during the dispersal of the solar nebula. Light noble gases (He, Ne) in the deep mantle reflect the primordial gas accretion history of the Earth, while heavy noble gases (Ar, Kr, Xe) probe early solid accretion processes. Our results are consistent with the final assembly of the Earth through at least two giant impacts after the dispersal of the nebula.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Which active galaxies might be neutrino emitters?</a><span class="id">[2511.16869]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has identified several individual neutrino emitters associated with supermassive black hole accretion phenomena, including blazars, tidal disruption events, and, unexpectedly, Seyfert galaxies. A key open question is which types of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are most likely to be neutrino emitters. Here we show that high-confidence extragalactic neutrino emitters tend not only to have higher hard X-ray fluxes but also to be more variable in mid-infrared (MIR) than other AGNs in the \textit{Swift} BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey. MIR variations effectively trace long-term fluctuations in AGN accretion disks and/or jets. In addition to the role of X-ray flux emphasized in previous studies, we speculate that long-term central engine fluctuations may also be critical for neutrino production. This hypothesis may inform IceCube neutrino-electromagnetic counterpart association studies and provide new insights into cosmic ray acceleration sites. First, the observed neutrinos are unlikely to originate from AGN host galaxies or from interactions between large-scale (dozens of parsecs) winds/outflows and the surrounding interstellar medium. Second, if neutrinos are produced in the X-ray corona, the corona should exhibit strong magnetic turbulence dissipation or magnetic reconnection whose rate changes substantially on timescales of years. Third, the relativistic jets of blazar neutrino emitters may be intrinsically unstable over years. Finally, if neutrinos are related to interactions between small-scale winds/outflows and torus clouds, such winds/outflows must be highly episodic.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16874" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self-bound quark stars with a first-order two-to-three flavor phase transition</a><span class="id">[2511.16874]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate self-bound quark stars in a flavor-dependent quark-mass density-dependent (QMDD) model with an excluded-volume correction.

The excluded-volume parameter $\kappa$ controls the stiffness of the equation of state and thus masses, radii, tidal deformabilities, and moments of inertia. Intermediate repulsion typically reconciles $M_{\max} \gtrsim 2\,M_\odot$ with current radius/tidal constraints, with hybrid self-bound objects more compatible than pure strange-quark stars. We identify three EOS-insensitive trends $-$ dimensionless moment of inertia vs. compactness, tidal deformability vs. compactness, and gravitational vs. baryonic compactness $-$ whose explicit $\kappa$-dependence largely disappears in dimensionless form (the first two being notably tighter than the third).

In this study, we investigate the multiwavelength variability of the blazar TON 599, a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ), with a particular emphasis on its emission line behavior. We focus on the Mg II $\lambda$2798 Å emission line, a key tracer of the ionized gas in the broad-line region (BLR), and its role in jet-induced variability. In addition to optical emission lines, we analyze gamma-rays (0.1-300 GeV), X-rays (0.2-10 keV), optical continuum ($\lambda$3000 Å), optical polarization, and millimeter-wavelength light curves. Three cross-correlation methods are employed to investigate temporal relationships between the emission line and continuum across various wavelengths. Using the Non-Thermal Dominance (NTD) parameter, our analysis confirms that synchrotron emission dominates the continuum during active states, highlighting the jet's primary role in the observed variability. The Mg II emission line exhibits quasi-simultaneous variability with the optical continuum, suggesting photoionization driven by the jet's non-thermal radiation. Additionally, the minimal time lag between gamma-ray and optical/near-ultraviolet emissions supports a synchrotron self-Compton origin for the most variable component of the gamma-ray emission. These findings highlight the importance of emission line variability and multiwavelength observations in constraining the interaction between jets and the BLR in blazars. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of AGN emission mechanisms and the complex interplay between jets and their surrounding environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the Cosmological Model Degeneracy with a new evaluate factor G</a><span class="id">[2511.16944]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the context of fitting cosmological models, parameter degeneracy remains a central issue. This paper critically examines traditional methods for constraining parameters and focuses on the G factor as a tool for evaluating the quality of observational data. To ensure analytical independence, two datasets–Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)–were utilized as samples for parameter fitting, supplemented by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. The Figure of Merit (FoM) matrix served as the final criterion for assessing fitting performance. The results show that the G factor of the CC dataset increases linearly with redshift z, whereas the G factor of the BAO dataset follows a cubic relationship. Further analysis indicates that the FoM value for datasets with high G factors is significantly higher than that for datasets with low G factors, thereby validating the G factor's effectiveness as a tool for assessing observational data quality and reducing parameter degeneracy. This suggests that the G factor may serve as a diagnostic tool and selection criterion for optimizing observational datasets in future research.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16946" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fully self-consistent nova explosion models reproducing light curves of KT Eri, V339 Del, V597 Pup, and SMC NOVA 2016-10a</a><span class="id">[2511.16946]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rising phase toward the optical maximum of a classical nova is one of the last frontiers of nova study.

Our 1.25 $M_\odot$ white dwarf (WD) models show excellent agreements with the light curves of KT Eri, V339 Del, and V597 Pup while our 1.35 $M_\odot$ WD models are consistent with the light curves of SMC NOVA 2016-10a.

Notably, we employ a single-fluid approximation for the first time in this context, wherein the baryonic and DM contributions to the total energy density and pressure are treated within a unified framework, assuming non-interacting fermionic DM in hydrostatic equilibrium with baryons. We examine how variations in $m_{\mathrm{DM}}$ and $f_\mathrm{DM}$ modify the equation of state (EoS), the mass-radius relationship, and the internal mass and pressure distributions of WDs. Our results show that the presence of DM softens the EoS, with lighter DM particles providing stronger pressure support and leading to more extended stellar structures. Increasing the DM mass fraction leads to a more compact configuration, reducing both the radius and maximum mass of the WD. We further demonstrate that heavier DM particles enhance stellar compactness and can eventually drive the star toward gravitational instability. Moreover, the analysis of mass-radius relationships reveals that while small fractions of DM are consistent with observed WD masses, the radii predicted by our models are smaller than observations, suggesting additional influences such as rotation or magnetic fields. Our stability analysis confirms that the inclusion of dark matter does not lead to instability within the expected parameter space, indicating that white dwarfs admixed with dark matter can remain dynamically stable under certain conditions. These findings show that even a small admixture of DM can modify the structural properties and stability limits of WDs, providing a potential indirect astrophysical probe of DM particle properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetized particle motion and accretion process with shock cone morphology around a decoupled hairy black holes</a><span class="id">[2511.17137]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Relativistic accretion onto compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars is one of the most efficient known mechanisms for converting gravitational potential energy into radiation. In the case of rapidly spinning black holes, up to $40\%$ of the rest-mass energy of accreting matter can be released, far exceeding the efficiency of nuclear fusion. In this work, we investigate magnetized particle motion and relativistic accretion processes around a decoupled hairy black hole via extended geometric deformation. The developed geometry involves two hairy parameters that preserve the horizon structure with the additional feature of the fulfillment of weak energy conditions outside the event horizon. We provide the foundation with necessary formalism for magnetized particle motion around a decoupled black hole. The effective potential and innermost stable circular orbits are then derived, which demonstrate a significant reduction of the radius of the latter quantity under the hairy parameters for the magnetized particle. Afterwards, we obtain exact analytical expressions for radial velocity profiles, mass accretion rates, and a few others which reveal improved energy efficiency and emissivity as compared to the standard black hole. Furthermore, the decoupling parameter shows strong influence on oscillations, accretion presenting fantastic agreement between analytical predictions and numerical simulations, and thus offering noticeable observational signatures for future gravitational wave and X-ray astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17206" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital parameters of the bright binary alpha Draconis based on amateur spectra from the STAROS database</a><span class="id">[2511.17206]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the results of a STAROS monitoring campaign on the bright eclipsing binary star alpha Draconis.

In this study in order to explain the new data, We consider the squared-Quartic Hilltop inflation potential \( V(\phi) = V_0 [1 - \lambda (\phi/M_p)^4]^2 \) within the Einstein and Jordan frames. In the Jordan frame we introduce the coupling term \( \xi \phi^2 R \) and we calculate analytic expressions for the slow-roll parameters, scalar spectral index, and tensor-to-scalar ratio on the weak and strong coupling regimes. In the weak limit (\( \xi \ll 1 \)), perturbative corrections slightly increase \( n_s \) and suppress \( r \), leading to \( n_s \simeq 0.9743 \) and \( r \sim 7.8 \times 10^{-5} \) for representative parameters \( \lambda = 10^{-3}, \xi = 10^{-3}, {\cal N} = 117 \), values which are in agreement with the joint Planck–ACT–DESI (P-ACT-LB) constraints. On the other hand, for a strong coupled (\( \xi \gg 1 \)), the conformal rescaling provides an exponentially flat potential plateau, which allows us to calculate \( n_s \approx 0.9743 \) with \( r \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4} \) for \( {\cal N} = 65{-}70 \), consistent with ACT and BK18 bounds.

Our observations did not achieve significant detections, providing limiting magnitudes of J=23.7 and H=22.2, which are both 2.4 magnitudes deeper than the expected J and H magnitudes for a modeled stripped helium star with a mass of 1 $\rm M_{\odot}$ after extinction. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of more significant extinction and the exact evolutionary status of the supposed helium star is uncertain, by comparing J1928$+$1815 with other pulsar binaries, we propose a natural alternative solution: that J1928$+$1815 is a heavyweight black widow system with a massive ablated white dwarf. Due to the pulsar's relatively high spin-down power and short orbital separation, the irradiation heating timescale is uniquely shorter than the cooling timescale for the WD companion. As a result, the WD effectively boils, with its outer layers expanding, overfilling the Roche lobe and producing low-density binary-scale haze opaque in the radio band. If this interpretation is correct, J1928$+$1815 would represent a new category distinct from canonical lightweight black widow systems. Radio eclipses can occur in pulsar binaries across a wider range of WD companion masses than previously thought. Therefore, they do not serve as a definitive indicator of a helium star without its direct detection. We contend that a spectroscopic identification remains the smoking gun for its existence. Given the crowding in this field, an \textit{HST} imaging in the near-infrared band would provide even better constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17285" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Covariance spectrum of MAXI J1820+070: On the nature of the Comptonizing flow</a><span class="id">[2511.17285]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an analysis of the covariance spectrum of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during its hard state. For the first time, we extend coherence and covariance studies into the hard X-ray band up to 150 keV. We detect a clear drop in coherence above 30 keV on both short- and long-timescales relative to the 2-10 keV reference band. To investigate the origin of the coherent variability, we simultaneously fit the short- and long-timescale covariances and the time-averaged spectra with a Comptonization model. Surprisingly, the electron temperature associated with long-timescale variability is significantly higher than that on short timescales. Moreover, the temperature on long timescales remains relatively constant throughout the hard state, whereas the short-timescale temperature evolves with X-ray luminosity. We attribute the drop in coherence to multiple sources of seed photons, i.e., the blackbody and synchrotron photons. The independence between these two photon fields leads to the drop in coherence. To explain the lower electron temperature on short timescales, we propose a two-Comptonization framework in which short-timescale variability arises from a vertically extended central region, while long-timescale variability originates at larger radii. The elevated geometry of the inner region leads to illumination primarily by cooler outer-disk photons, yielding a lower electron temperature. In this case, the evolution of the height of the elevated region could explain the evolution of the electron temperature associated with the coherent variability throughout the hard state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effect of the Memory Burden on Primordial Black Hole Hot Spots</a><span class="id">[2511.17329]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When primordial black holes (PBHs) evaporate, they deposit energy in the surrounding plasma, leading to temperature gradients, or hot spots, that evolve during the evaporation process.

We include such a suppression in the form of transfer functions and derive general formulas for the hot-spot core temperature and radius. Applying our results to illustrative scenarios, we find that in the vanilla memory burden scenario in which the evaporation rate and Hawking temperature are exactly constant, the hot-spot temperature is substantially lowered.

The data clearly separate the relativistic broad line from the underlying continuum and from narrow emission and absorption features in the Fe band. The unprecedented spectral resolution in the Fe K band clearly demonstrates that the flux excess can be attributed to a single, broad feature, as opposed to a superposition of previously unresolved narrow features. This broad feature can be best interpreted as emission consistent with an origin near the innermost stable circular orbit around a rapidly rotating black hole. By modeling the shape of the broad line, we find a black hole spin of $a\simeq0.98$ and an inclination of the inner accretion disk of $\theta\simeq63^\circ$. The spin is consistent with prior reflection studies, reaffirming the robustness of past spin measurements using the relativistic reflection method. The measured inclination provides reinforcing evidence of a disk-orbit misalignment in Cygnus X-1. These results highlight the unique abilities of XRISM in separating overlapping spectral features and providing constraints on the geometry of accretion in X-ray binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moving superfluids in the rotating universe</a><span class="id">[2511.17472]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study homogeneous cosmological models featuring shift-symmetric scalar fields (or, superfluids) in relative motion.

From a theory perspective, a whole new family of bispectrum shapes arise in the cosmological collider program, with distinct signatures of heavy particles during inflation. In this work, we provide a class of simplified collider templates for these particles that encompasses a broader range of masses, sound speeds, and interactions. We propose that, given the current state of observations, the most effective strategy to search for PNG signals is through orthogonalizing the collider templates, such that they are uncorrelated with the tightly constrained single field predictions. Using the Modal pipeline and Planck CMB data, we perform a systematic parameter scan of the collider templates with the most significant result reaching $2.4\sigma$ for spin-0, after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect; indicative results for spin-1 and spin-2 peak near 2$\sigma$. These results indicate that, with refined collider templates and improved data analysis strategies, there are credible prospects with forthcoming observations to detect PNG and also rule out single field inflation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Growth of Cosmic Strings with Field-Dependent Tension</a><span class="id">[2511.16725]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A novel mechanism to produce a cosmic network of fundamental superstrings based on a time-varying string tension has been recently proposed.

Although the coupling is too feeble to thermalize the ALP, coherent forward scattering between the two sectors induces temperature-dependent mass shifts that substantially modify both WIMP freeze-out and ALP misalignment dynamics, giving rise to a novel coherent freeze-out mechanism. At high temperatures, the WIMP thermal bath spontaneously breaks the symmetry of the ALP potential, displacing the field to a new vacuum. The resulting back-reaction reduces the WIMP effective mass and delays its freeze-out. Depending on the strength of the coupling, symmetry restoration occurs via either a first-order phase transition (FOPT) or a crossover. In the FOPT regime, dark matter consists solely of WIMPs, whose delayed freeze-out permits annihilation cross sections up to two (five) orders of magnitude above the standard value for $s$-wave ($p$-wave) annihilation, while still yielding the correct relic density. In the crossover regime, both WIMP and ALP can contribute to dark matter. Remarkably, we find an &quot;ALP miracle&quot;: a Planck-suppressed quadratic coupling yields an ALP abundance comparable to the observed dark matter density, largely independent of its initial displacement and mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical tiling-based simulations of decoherence in multifield models of inflation</a><span class="id">[2511.16801]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components.

The enlarged parameter space makes inference computationally costly, which has so far limited systematic, large-scale studies that are essential to quantify degeneracies, check effect of waveform systematics, and assess robustness across non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise effects. The need is even sharper for next-generation (XG) observatories where signals are longer, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are higher, and likelihood evaluations increase substantially. We address this by applying relative binning to the TIGER framework for parameterized tests of GR. Relative binning replaces dense frequency evaluations with evaluations on adaptively chosen frequency bins, reducing the cost per likelihood call while preserving posterior accuracy. Using simulated binary black hole signals, we demonstrate unbiased recovery for GR-consistent cases and targeted non-GR deviations, and we map how bin resolution controls accuracy, with fine binning primarily required for the $-1$ post-Newtonian term. A high-SNR simulated signal at next-generation sensitivity further shows accurate recovery with tight posteriors. Applied to GW150914 and GW250114, both single and multi-parameter TIGER analyses finish within a day, yielding deviation bounds consistent with GR at 90\% credibility and in agreement with previous results.

Among the important consequences for precision cosmology is the potential impact on the linear growth of large-scale structures. We address this impact by combining covariant spatial averaging with covariant and gauge-invariant perturbation theory. We focus on irrotational dust model spacetimes. The effects of backreaction and nontrivial dynamical curvature on the average cosmological dynamics are formulated as the addition of an effective perfect fluid with pressure. We then introduce an effective background driven by both the averaged dust density and the emergent effective fluid, and derive the general evolution equations for linear perturbations of this system. The residual freedom in this framework amounts to specifying the properties of the effective-fluid perturbations as a closure condition. We analyse two physically motivated choices for this condition. In addition, we clarify the conditions under which the coupling between linear structure growth and perturbations of the effective fluid can be neglected. Finally, we apply this formalism to four examples of averaged cosmological models from the literature, three of which – intended as effective full descriptions of the largest scales – have been shown to provide a good fit to observational data. Our results highlight the importance of backreaction effects in shaping linear structure growth in such models. Neglecting these effects may thus lead to biased predictions for the development of large structures, even when the models provide a good description of the general background observables.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A battle of designs: triangular vs. L-shaped detectors and parity violation in the gravitational-wave background</a><span class="id">[2511.17422]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the prospects for detecting a parity-violating gravitational-wave background (GWB) with third-generation ground-based detector networks.

Direct estimates of peculiar velocities of galaxies have attracted interest as a means of estimating $f\sigma_8$. In particular, field-level methods can be used to fit the field nuisance parameter along with cosmological parameters simultaneously. This article aims to provide the community with a unified framework for the theoretical modeling of the likelihood-based field-level inference by performing fast field covariance calculations for velocity and density fields. Our purpose is to lay the foundations for a nonlinear extension of the likelihood-based method at the field level. We have developed a generalized framework, implemented in the dedicated software flip to perform a likelihood-based inference of $f\sigma_8$. We derived a new field covariance model, which includes wide-angle corrections. We also included the models previously described in the literature inside our framework. We compared their performance against ours, and we validated our model by comparing it with the two-point statistics of a recent N-body simulation. The tests we performed have allowed us to validate our software and determine the appropriate wavenumber range to integrate our covariance model and its validity in terms of separation. Our framework allows for a wider wavenumber coverage to be used in our calculations than in previous works. Finally, our generalized framework allows us to efficiently perform a survey geometry-dependent Fisher forecast of the $f\sigma_8$ parameter. We show that the Fisher forecast method we developed gives an error bar that is 30 % closer to a full likelihood-based estimation than a standard volume Fisher forecast.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proto-neutron star oscillations including accretion flows</a><span class="id">[2503.16317]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The gravitational wave signature from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is dominated by quadrupolar oscillation modes of the newly born proto-neutron star (PNS), and could be detectable at galactic distances.

These new ingredients are key to understand PNS oscillation modes, in particular those related to the standing-accretion-shock instability (SASI). Their incorporation is an important step towards accurate PNS asteroseismology. For this purpose, we perform linear and adiabatic perturbations of a spherically symmetric background, in the relativistic Cowling approximation, and cast the resulting equations as an eigenvalue problem. We discretize the eigenvalue problem using collocation Chebyshev spectral methods, which is then solved by means of standard and efficient linear algebra methods. We impose boundary conditions at the accretion shock compatible with the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. We present several numerical examples to assess the accuracy and convergence of the numerical code, as well as to understand the effect of an accretion flow on the oscillation modes, as a stepping stone towards a complete analysis of the CCSNe case.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The contribution of turbulent AGN coronae to the diffuse neutrino flux</a><span class="id">[2504.06336]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Active galactic nuclei (AGN) can accelerate protons to energies of $\sim$10-100 TeV, with secondary production of high-energy neutrinos. If the acceleration is driven by magnetized turbulence, the main properties of the resulting proton and neutrino spectra can be deduced based on insights from particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized turbulence. We have previously shown that these properties are consistent with the TeV neutrino signal observed from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068. In this work, we extend this result to a population study. We show that the produced neutrino flux depends mainly on the energetics of the corona - the relative fraction of X-ray, magnetic, and non-thermal proton energy - and on the spectral energy distribution of the AGN. We find that coronae with similar properties can explain neutrinos from the candidate AGN for which IceCube has reported an excess, albeit less significant than NGC 1068. Building on this framework, we show how the neutrino signal evolves with the AGN luminosity, and use this AGN sequence to predict the diffuse neutrino flux from the extragalactic population, showing that it can account for the diffuse neutrino signal observed by IceCube in the $\sim$1-100 TeV energy range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09493" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESI DR1 Lyα 1D power spectrum: The Fast Fourier Transform estimator measurement</a><span class="id">[2505.09493]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum measurement derived from the data release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).

Having a configuration similar to a giant binary system interconnected by a huge filament, it is likely one if not the unique case to date observed in the Local Universe. So a question arise: how and when did it form? Here, the CrB and A2142 system has been hypothesized to be a descendent of a primordial binary system composed of two close galaxy proto-clusters, the CrB and A2142, originated from two independent collapsing process within a dense cloud of galaxies. Then, assuming that at a certain point the decoupling occurred due to the interplay of gravity-antigravity of DE, they began to move away in radial motion from each other following the accelerate expansion of the Universe. In the context of the LCDM model a Newtonian approximation of the two body motion in presence of DE has been applied using current physical parameters of the CrB and A2142 system with the aim to calculate the look-back time at decoupling. Its compatibility with the era of formation of the primordial galaxy proto-clusters has been tested. The event of the binary decoupling happened in a time larger than the age of the Universe! Of course, after such a result the advanced hypothesis on the origins of the CrB-A2142 system can be rejected, but not the test of compatibility since the look-back time at the error lower limit is 12.5 Gys ( z = 4.5) largely consistent with observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$w_{dm}$-$w_{de}$ cosmological model with new data samples of cosmological observations</a><span class="id">[2506.09281]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit a cosmological model where dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) follow barotropic equations of state, allowing deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework (i.e. $w_{dm} \neq 0$, $w_{de} \neq -1$), considering both flat and non-flat curvature. Using a dynamical system approach, we identify equilibrium states that govern stability, expansion, and contraction. Expansion occurs when $H&gt;0$, while contraction is linked to $H &lt; 0$. Accelerated expansion arises from DE dominance, whereas radiation- and matter-dominated phases lead to deceleration. Some solutions are unphysical due to density constraints, but viable cases offer insights into cosmic transitions, including the Einstein static universe, which allows for shifts between accelerating and decelerating phases. We perform a Bayesian analysis with updated datasets, including observational Hubble data, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae, strong lensing systems, baryon acoustic oscillations and cosmic microwave background, to constrain the parameters $w_{dm}$ and $w_{de}$. Our results from the data joint analysis show consistency with $\Lambda$CDM within $3\sigma$, but none of the cases reproduce $w_{dm} = 0$ and $w_{de} = -1$. Nevertheless, the comparison with the standard model using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria indicates that only the non-flat scenario has the potential to be competitive. This suggests that a non-dust-like DM may impact structure formation, while DE could shift toward quintessence fluid. While $\Lambda$CDM remains a strong model, our findings indicate that alternative dark sector models with non-standard EoS could be viable and offer new insights into cosmic evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing Limitation in the Standard Cosmological Model: A Redshift-Dependent Hubble Constant from Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2506.14947]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A major issue in contemporary cosmology is the persistent discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates from local measurements and those inferred from early-Universe observations under the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. Recent advances have identified fast radio bursts (FRBs), a class of extragalactic phenomena observable at considerable redshifts, as a promising observational tool for probing late-time cosmology. In this study, we incorporate two complementary methodologies, machine learning algorithms and Bayesian analysis, on a set of localized FRBs to rigorously test the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model at late cosmic epochs. Our results reveal a statistically significant redshift-dependent variation of $H_0$ when using separate priors on baryon density parameters $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$ or $\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2$, indicating contradiction to the core postulate of $\Lambda$CDM. However, when the priors are combined, this redshift dependence disappears, yielding a consistent estimate of $H_0$. We further validate that the redshift dependency of $H_0$ can be removed within the more flexible framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model even without combining the priors. These findings highlight that the redshift evolution of $H_0$ is not merely an artifact of the standard model but an indication of a deeper inadequacy in the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the need for a more flexible cosmological framework.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast and &quot;lossless&quot; propagation of relativistic electrons along magnetized non-thermal filaments in galaxy clusters and the Galactic Center region</a><span class="id">[2507.20780]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Relativistic leptons in galaxy clusters lose their energy via radiation (synchrotron and inverse Compton losses) and interactions with the ambient plasma. At z 0, pure radiative losses limit the lifetime of electrons emitting at  GHz frequencies to t&lt;100 Myr. Adiabatic losses can further lower Lorentz factors of electrons trapped in an expanding medium. If the propagation speed of electrons relative to the ambient weakly magnetized (plasma $\beta\sim10^2$) Intracluster Medium (ICM) is limited by the Alfvén speed, $v_{a,ICM}=c_{s,ICM}/\beta^{1/2}\sim 10^7\,{\rm cm\,s^{-1}}$, GHz-emitting electrons can travel only $l \sim v_{a,ICM}t_r\sim 10\,kpc$ relative to the underlying plasma. Yet, elongated structures spanning hundreds of kpc or even a few Mpc are observed, requiring either a re-acceleration mechanism or another form of synchronization, e.g., by a large-scale shock. We argue that filaments with ordered magnetic fields supported by non-thermal pressure have $v_{a}\gg v_{a,{\rm ICM}}$ and so can provide such a synchronization even without re-acceleration or shocks. In particular, along quasi-stationary filaments, electrons can propagate without experiencing adiabatic losses, and their velocity is not limited by the Alfvén or sound speeds of the ambient thermal plasma. This model predicts that along filaments that span significant pressure gradients, e.g., in the cores of galaxy clusters, the synchrotron break frequency $\nu_b\propto B$ should scale with the ambient gas pressure as $P^{1/2}$, and the emission from such filaments should be strongly polarized. While some of these structures can be observed as &quot;filaments&quot;, i.e., long and narrow bright structures, others can be unresolved and have a collective appearance of a diffuse structure, or be too faint to be detected, while still providing channels for electrons' propagation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stable Collisionless Tori Around Kerr Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2508.09077]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In low-luminosity active galactic nuclei like M87$^\ast$ and Sgr A$^\ast$, the accretion flow in the vicinity of the black hole is in the collisionless regime, meaning that the collisional mean free path of charged particles is much larger than the dynamical length scales.

The main challenge in this endeavour is that baryonic feedback significantly redistributes matter on large scales, but to an unknown degree. Here, we present an improved version of the &quot;resummation&quot; model, which maps observed halo baryon fractions of massive haloes ($M_{\mathrm{500c}}\gtrsim 10^{12.5}\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) to a flexible suppression signal - i.e. the ratio of baryonic to dark-matter-only (DMO) matter power spectra - using zero free parameters. We calibrate this model to the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations, obtaining a typical accuracy of $\lesssim 1\%$ for $k\,\leq\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ given mean halo baryon fractions within the spherical overdensity radii $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{200m}}$. When only those within $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ are available, we still obtain $\lesssim 2\%$ accuracy. We show that given small-scale stellar mass fractions, the model can be extended to yield $\lesssim 3\%$ accurate suppression signals for all scales measured ($k\,\leq\,25\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$). We also extend the model to redshifts $z&gt;0$. Central to the model is a seemingly mass-independent and feedback-independent relation that allows observed halo masses to be mapped to equivalent DMO halo masses using only observed mean halo baryon fractions, to $\lesssim 1\%$ accuracy. This relation can also be used to retrieve the DMO halo mass function from observed halo masses and baryon fractions with percent-level accuracy, without any assumptions on the strength of feedback. A Python package implementing the resummation model is made publicly available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can GRB 250702B be explained as the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole?

These features are difficult to reconcile with most models of high energy transients but we show that they are compatible with a white dwarf bound to an intermediate mass black hole that is tidally stripped over multiple pericentre passages before being fully disrupted. Accretion onto the black hole powers a mildly relativistic jet that produces the X-rays through internal processes and the infrared and radio counterparts through thermal emission and external shocks respectively but is unable to produce the gamma-ray emission on its own. We propose that chaotic debris streams from the multiple stripping episodes can collide with a period roughly the same as the orbital period of the star. These shocks produce hard X-ray photons that are upscattered by the jet to produce the observed MeV gamma-ray emission. Future analysis of the jet properties will allow us to place firmer constraints on our model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple shells in supernova 2023ixf support the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM)</a><span class="id">[2510.18782]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Examining the photospheric time evolution of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 2023ixf from the literature, we identify two (possibly three) evolutionary time periods with constant expansion velocities, which we attribute to two (or three) ejecta shells.

Although the explosion mechanism is not yet fully understood, theoretical models can reproduce optical observations and observed elemental abundances. However, many nuclear reaction rates involved in explosive nucleosynthesis have large uncertainties, impacting the reliability of abundance predictions. To address this, we have previously developed a Monte Carlo-based nucleosynthesis code that accounts for reaction rate uncertainties and has been applied to nucleosynthesis processes beyond iron. Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the &quot;PUSH method&quot;, focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few &quot;key reactions&quot; that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02059" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Holes from Kinetic Preheating</a><span class="id">[2511.02059]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We demonstrate that violent kinetic preheating following inflation can lead to the formation of black holes in the early Universe.

Deep-learning approaches have recently been proposed to mitigate these effects by learning mappings between contaminated and true cosmological signals. Building upon our previous work \citep{2024PhRvD.109f3509S} on the frequency-differencing (FD) method, this study extends the framework to systematically compare FD-based and PCA-based UNet reconstructions using realistic simulations that include foregrounds and beam convolution. We find that both approaches perform comparably without beam or with a Gaussian beam, but under a realistic cosine beam they systematically underestimate the large-scale cross-correlation power spectrum, particularly for $k&lt;0.1 h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. To address this limitation, we explore a hybrid approach in which the UNet is trained with two input channels, one constructed from FD and the other from PCA cleaning, allowing the network to simultaneously exploit the strengths of both inputs. This two-channel strategy achieves superior performance, maintaining the cross-correlation power spectrum close to unity on large scales under a cosine beam, improving by 5-8% relative to either FD-based or PCA-based UNet alone. These results demonstrate that providing complementary FD and PCA information to a single deep network is an effective route to robust HI reconstruction, laying the groundwork for precision BAO measurements with future low-redshift 21 cm IM surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron Nuclei in Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays Near the Earth</a><span class="id">[2511.15776]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The propagation of cosmic iron nuclei with energies above 10^19 eV from their sources to the Galaxy is discussed by assuming that cosmic rays at ultra-high energies are of extragalactic origin. In extragalactic space, cosmic nuclei interact with background emissions and inevitably fragment. An analysis is performed of the fraction of iron nuclei reaching the Earth and how its energy depends on the distance from cosmic ray sources. It is found that energies of iron nuclei can be used to determine restriction on the distances from their sources</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16824" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ion-Scale Solitary Structures in the Solar Wind Observed by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe</a><span class="id">[2412.16824]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a class of ion-scale magnetic solitary structures in the solar wind, characterized by distinct magnetic field enhancements and bipolar rotations over spatial scales of several proton inertial lengths. These structures are revisited using high-resolution data from the Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe missions. Using a machine learning-based method, we identified nearly a thousand such structures, providing new insights into their evolution and physical properties. Statistical analysis shows that these structures are more abundant closer to the Sun, with occurrence rates peaking around (30 - 40, R_sun) and decreasing farther out. High-cadence measurements reveal that these structures are predominantly found in low-beta (beta &lt;= 1) environments, with consistent fluctuations in density, velocity, and magnetic field. Magnetic field enhancements are often accompanied by plasma density drops, which, under near pressure balance, limit field increases. This leads to small fractional field enhancements near the Sun (approximately 0.01 at 20 R_sun), making detection challenging. Magnetic field variance analysis indicates that these structures are primarily oblique to the local magnetic field. Alfvénic velocity-magnetic field correlations suggest that most of these structures, unlike most near-Sun solar wind fluctuations, exhibit sunward-directed Alfvénic polarization in the plasma frame. We compare these findings with previous studies, discussing possible generation mechanisms and their implications for the turbulent cascade in the near-Sun Alfvénic solar wind. While these structures might be Alfvénic solitons, vortices, or flux ropes, we refrain from a definitive classification pending further evidence. Further high-resolution observations and simulations are needed to fully understand their origins and impacts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The early universe is $\textit{ACT}$-ing $\textit{warm}$</a><span class="id">[2504.02655]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recently released data from the $\textit{Atacama Cosmology Telescope}$ (ACT) confirms that the primordial scalar spectrum is extremely flat. This, together with current upper bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, implies that the simplest models of inflation coming from particle physics (for instance, a minimally-coupled scalar with monomial potentials) need additional ingredients in order to make them compatible with observations. Instead of invoking arbitrary new couplings or new interactions that are not protected symmetries, we argue that dissipation of the inflaton field with the radiation bath should be added as a new physical principle. Accordingly, we show that warm inflation provides the correct paradigm to explain the current observations, given very natural choices of dissipative terms. The model analyzed here has mirror and $Z_4$ symmetries, which explicitly protect the inflaton potential from large quantum and thermal corrections. We use a recent precision numerical code designed for warm inflationary perturbations, improving on the determination of the cosmological observables previously obtained for such models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical dark energy parameterizations in VCDM</a><span class="id">[2508.03784]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the context of a theory of minimally modified gravity called VCDM, one can realize any cosmological behavior at the level of the homogeneous and isotropic background without introducing fatal instabilities for perturbations. Therefore, VCDM provides a theoretically-consistent and observationally-testable framework of dynamical dark energy parameterizations with or without phantom behaviors. In this paper, we propose the VCDM realizations of various phenomenological parameterizations present in the literature: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Exponential (EXP), and Logarithmic (LOG) models. Using the VCDM equations for cosmological perturbations, we test them against the recent cosmological datasets, Planck 2018 and DESI BAO DR2, and then discuss their implications.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Divergence in tracing the flavors of astrophysical neutrinos: can JUNO help IceCube?</a><span class="id">[2511.15127]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive the flavor fractions $(\eta^{}_e , \eta^{}_\mu , \eta^{}_\tau)$ for ultrahigh-energy neutrinos originating from a remote astrophysical source by using their flavor ratios $(f^{}_e , f^{}_\mu , f^{}_\tau)$ observed at a neutrino telescope, and find that a potential divergence may appear in inferring the values of $\eta^{}_\mu$ and $\eta^{}_\tau$ as an unavoidable consequence of the approximate $\mu$-$\tau$ interchange symmetry of lepton flavor mixing. We illustrate such an effect by applying our formula to the IceCube all-sky neutrino flux data ranging from 5 TeV to 10 PeV in the naive assumption that the relevant sources have a common flavor composition. We show that only $\eta^{}_e$ and $\eta^{}_\mu + \eta^{}_\tau$ can be extracted from the measurements of $f^{}_e$, $f^{}_\mu$ and $f^{}_\tau$ if the $\mu$-$\tau$ flavor symmetry is exact, and the JUNO and Daya Bay precision antineutrino oscillation data will help a lot in this connection.</p></div></details></article></body>
