By analyzing various applications across domains such as astronomical research, space exploration, space resource utilizations, national defense, and space communication, this study identifies key areas where Lagrange points offer significant advantages. The research employs a qualitative analysis of existing literature combined with theoretical modeling to demonstrate how these points can be optimally utilized in future space missions. The finding suggests that a Systems Theory approach not only clarifies the roles and benefits of Lagrange points in space mission design but also reveals new pathways for enhancing mission efficiency and effectiveness. This thesis underscores the importance of a holistic view in the strategic planning of space missions and provides a foundational approach for integrating Lagrange points into future exploratory and operational frameworks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMB component-separated power spectrum estimation by Spectral Internal Linear Combination (SpILC)</a><span class="id">[2509.10604]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Component separation methods mitigate the cross-contamination between different extragalactic and galactic contributions to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. This is often done by linearly combining CMB maps from different frequency channels using internal linear combination (ILC) methods. We demonstrate that deriving power spectrum estimators directly by linearly combining auto- and cross-spectra instead of maps allows us to obtain a different constrained-optimization problem that allows fewer (deprojection) constraint equations than combining at map level using the constrained ILC method. Through simulations, we show that our Spectral internal linear combination (SpILC) produces CMB power spectrum estimators with more than 7 times smaller errorbars than constrained ILC (with thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and cosmic infrared background deprojections) at $\ell\gtrsim 4000$ for Simons Observatory-like observations. Spectral ILC outperforms constrained ILC methods when some modeled components are spatially uncorrelated, e.g. the primary CMB is uncorrelated with foregrounds, and the difference in performance is most significant at noise-dominated scales. More generally, our work shows that component-separated maps with foreground deprojections do not necessarily produce minimum-variance two-or-higher-point estimators.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bias in the tensor-to-scalar ratio from self-interacting dark radiation</a><span class="id">[2509.10607]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the cosmological imprint of self-interacting dark radiation (DR) on the primordial $B$-mode angular power spectrum and its impact on the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We consider a minimal model in which DR is described as an effectively massless axion-like particle with quartic self-interactions. These interactions are incorporated into the Einstein-Boltzmann equations using the relaxation time approximation and implemented in the $\texttt{CLASS}$ code. We show that increasing the strength of DR self-interactions suppresses anisotropic stress, thereby reducing the damping of gravitational waves and leading to an enhancement of the primordial $B$-mode signal relative to the free-streaming case. Using mock CMB data and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, we show that neglecting DR self-interactions may bias the inferred value of $r$ by an amount comparable to the uncertainty expected in forthcoming CMB polarization experiments, such as the ground-based $\textit{Simons Observatory}$ and the satellite missions $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ and PICO. Our results emphasize the importance of properly modeling DR interactions in future precision searches for primordial $B$-modes in order to obtain unbiased constraints on inflationary gravitational waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10608" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The HST Ultraviolet Spectrum of V723 Mon: Additional Evidence of a Stellar Companion</a><span class="id">[2509.10608]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>V723 Mon is a high mass function (f=1.7Msun) single lined spectroscopic binary with a red giant primary that Jayasinghe et al.

Consequently, interpretation of JWST small exoplanet spectra follows a Bayesian approach, with less theoretically plausible interpretations facing a higher burden of proof. Here, we use photochemical modeling to evaluate the plausibility of warm exo-Titans, exoplanets with N$_2$-CH$_4$ atmospheres analogous to Titan but orbiting closer to their host stars. Consideration of warm exo-Titans is motivated by arguments from planet formation, as well as tentative evidence from observations. Using TRAPPIST-1e as a case study, we show that the higher instellation experienced by warm exo-Titans reduces their CH$_4$ lifetime $\tau_{\text{CH}_{4}}$ relative to true Titan by orders of magnitude, reducing the probability of observing them. We constrain the $\tau_{\text{CH}_{4}}$ on a warm exo-Titan to be $\leq0.1\times$ (and most likely $\leq0.02\times$) true Titan, implying the absolute probability of detecting a warm exo-Titan is $&lt;0.1$ and likely $&lt;0.01$. This finding is consistent with recent JWST nondetections of CH$_4$-dominated atmospheres on warm terrestrial exoplanets. The low prior probability means that the standard of proof required to claim a warm exo-Titan detection is high, and we offer specific suggestions towards such a standard of proof. Observation of oxidized carbon species would corroborate a putative warm exo-Titan detection. Confirmed detection of warm exo-Titans would signal the need to fundamentally rethink our understanding of the structure, dynamics, and photochemistry of Titan-like worlds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Introduction to Dust Evolution and Vertical Transport in Protoplanetary Disks</a><span class="id">[2509.10614]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This tutorial is an introduction to observational studies of dust transport and evolution in protoplanetary disks. Spatially resolved observations of disks at multiple wavelengths can allow to infer the distribution of various dust grains and gas species. Combining these observations offers a more complete understanding of dust structure and properties across different disk locations. For example, by better characterizing the disk vertical structure, observations help to constrain the level of vertical settling and identify regions of high dust density, which are favorable for grain growth and planet formation. This tutorial describes various methodologies for inferring dust properties and vertical height of different tracers, as an introduction for beginners.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation GRMHD Models of Accretion onto Stellar-Mass Black Holes: II. Super-Eddington Accretion</a><span class="id">[2509.10638]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of super-Eddington black hole accretion simulations that solve the GRMHD equations coupled with angle-discretized radiation transport. The simulations span a range of accretion rates, two black hole spins, and two magnetic field topologies, and include resolution studies as well as comparisons with non-radiative models. Super-Eddington accretion flows consistently develop geometrically thick disks supported by radiation pressure, regardless of magnetic field configuration. Radiation generated in the inner disk drives substantial outflows, forming conical funnel regions that limit photon escape and result in very low radiation efficiency. The accretion flows are highly turbulent with thermal energy transport dominated by radiation advection rather than diffusion. Angular momentum is primarily carried outward by Maxwell stress, with turbulent Reynolds stress playing a subdominant role. Both strong and weak jets are produced. Strong jets arise from sufficient net vertical magnetic flux and rapid black hole spin and can effectively evacuate the funnel, enabling radiation to escape through strong geometric beaming. In contrast, weak jets fail to clear the funnel, which becomes obscured by radiation-driven outflows and leads to distinct observational signatures. Spiral structures are observed in the plunging region, behaving like density waves. These super-Eddington models are applicable to a variety of astronomical systems, including ultraluminous X-ray sources, little red dots, and black hole transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A candidate to the long sought optical counterpart to the Rapid Burster in the bulge fossil fragment Liller 1</a><span class="id">[2509.10640]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on the possible identification of the optical counterpart of the Rapid Burster MXB 1730-335 in the stellar system Liller 1. The identification was performed by taking advantage of a set of images acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys in the optical band, and with the Gemini South Telescope in the near-infrared. The analysis of these images revealed the presence of a star with a position possibly compatible with the X-ray and radio band coordinates of the Rapid Burster, and showing significant optical variability. According to its location in the color-magnitude diagram, the candidate companion appears to belong to the young (  1-2 Gyr old) super-solar metallicity ([M/H]= +0.3) sub-population recently discovered in Liller 1. We discuss the main characteristics of the candidate counterpart and the Rapid Burster binary system as derived from the available data, also highlighting the need for further coordinated observations to solidly confirm their association and better clarify their physical properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistical Analysis of Magnetic Patches in Solar Active Regions Using the Complex Network Method</a><span class="id">[2509.10681]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Identifying solar active regions (ARs), which consist of one or more pairs of magnetic patches with opposite polarities, is essential due to their significant role in dynamic solar atmospheric phenomena. In this study, we analyze ARs during their emergence and evolution on the solar surface using a complex network-based method known as Identifying Solar Magnetic Patches (ISMP). To examine the magnetic characteristics, we selected a subregion of 125 $\times$ 125 pixels centered on AR NOAA No., 1158, observed in 2011. Line-of-sight magnetogram data were obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our statistical analysis reveals that the distributions of patch area, lifetime, and magnetic flux follow power-law behavior, with exponents approximately equal to $\alpha$ = 2.14, 2.5, and 1.42, respectively. Furthermore, a Hurst exponent of 0.57 indicates the presence of long-range temporal correlations in the emergence of new magnetic patches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10836" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring neutrino masses with joint JWST and DESI DR2 data</a><span class="id">[2509.10836]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 7$, and recent DESI measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together present a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. We consider three dark energy models ($\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of $\sum m_{\nu}$ by about $5.8\%-10.2\%$, and we obtain $\sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.167~\mathrm{eV}$ ($2\sigma$) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of $f_{*,10} \gtrsim 0.146-0.161$. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the $w_0w_a$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model relative to the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and The Signatures of Cosmic Non-Gaussianity</a><span class="id">[2509.10851]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the small-scale primordial Uni- verse and may constitute a fraction of the dark matter. Their formation is highly sensitive to non-Gaussian features in the primordial curvature perturbation {\zeta}. In this work we inves- tigate PBH production in the curvaton scenario, where the decay of a late-time light scalar field imprints large, inherently non-Gaussian fluctuations on small scales. Using the exact non-linear mapping between the Gaussian curvaton field perturbations and {\zeta}, we compute the full non-perturbative probability distribution functions of {\zeta} and derive the PBH for- mation fraction \b{eta} without relying on a truncated non-Gaussian expansion. We show that the enhanced tail of the distribution dramatically amplifies PBH production, leading to an exponential sensitivity of \b{eta} to the curvaton decay fraction {\Omega}\c{hi},dec. By modeling the scale dependence of curvaton fluctuations with a lognormal profile, we obtain realistic, extended PBH mass spectra rather than monochromatic peaks. We further highlight the associated stochastic gravitational-wave background induced at second order, whose peak frequency correlates directly with the PBH mass scale. Our results demonstrate that the curvaton scenario naturally produces a rich phenomenology of PBHs and gravitational waves, sharply distinct from Gaussian single-field inflation models, and provide a framework for connecting small-scale non-Gaussian physics to upcoming gravitational-wave and PBH observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10903" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New constraint on Europa's ice shell: magnetic signature from the ocean</a><span class="id">[2509.10903]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Jupiter's icy moons are believed to host subsurface liquid oceans, and among them, Europa stands out as one of the most promising candidates for extraterrestrial life. Yet, the processes driving oceanic flows beneath its ice shell, as well as the factors controlling the thickness of this ice, remain incompletely understood. One especially distinctive feature of Europa is that its salty ocean is electrically conducting and thus influenced by Jupiter's time-varying magnetic field, which is believed to drive a large-scale zonal flow. Here, we examine hos this magnetically-induced jet affects both the heat flux and the dynamics of the convective flow within Europa's ocean. We first show that the magnetically-driven jet efficiently transports heat in stably stratified regions near the top of the ocean, and may alter the expected convective scaling laws in deeper layers. Second, by analysing the latitudinal distribution of heat flux and relating it to ice-thickness variations, we make predictions that can be compared with current observations. In anticipation of the upcoming JUICE and Europa Clipper missions, we discuss how improved measurement precision could help further constrain the ocean's properties and refine our model-based forecasts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydrocarbon Hazes on Temperate sub-Neptune K2-18b supported by data from the James Webb Space Telescope</a><span class="id">[2509.10947]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>K2-18b, a sub-Neptune orbiting in the habitable zone of an M dwarf, has attracted significant interest following observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and, more recently, with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveal detectable atmospheric features. Previous studies have examined a wide range of possible compositions, focusing primarily in the near-infrared (0.8-5.2 $\mu$m) or mid-infrared (5-12 $\mu$m) wavelengths. We present a new interpretation of K2-18b's JWST transit spectra, combining an independent reduction of MIRI LRS data with previously published NIRISS/NIRSpec observations. We assess the impact of stellar parameter uncertainties on the inferred planetary properties and, using revised stellar parameters, derive a planetary density of $\rho_P = 3.34 \pm 1.44$ g cm$^{-3}$. We consider scattering and absorption from laboratory-produced haze analogues and perform free-chemistry Bayesian retrievals informed by equilibrium chemistry. Our results are consistent with an H$_2$-dominated mini-Neptune atmosphere with a mean molecular weight of $\mu \sim$2.4 Daltons, and support the presence of hydrocarbon hazes across 0.85-12 $\mu$m without requiring instrumental offsets. Our retrieved CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ abundances are broadly consistent between models but systematically lower than in haze-free studies, suggesting that haze reduces the need for high-$\mu$ solutions. While our retrievals tend to favour atmospheric temperatures $\sim$100-200 K warmer than previously reported, cooler solutions ($\sim$250 K) remain viable if the planetary mass is reduced towards the lower end of its uncertainty. We emphasise the need for follow-up self-consistent photochemical and microphysical modelling, alongside further mid-infrared observations to constrain key hydrocarbon species.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11029" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The M- and X-class White-light Flares in Super Active Region NOAA 13664/13697 Observed by ASO-S/LST/WST</a><span class="id">[2509.11029]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar white-light flares (WLFs) have been observed since 1859, but their occurrence rate is not yet fully understood. The physical properties of WLFs in super active regions (SARs) are also well worth investigating. With full-disk images at 3600 Å (in the Balmer continuum) from the White-light Solar Telescope (WST) on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory, we here study the M- and X-class WLFs occurring in SAR NOAA 13664/13697 (a same region in two solar Carrington rotations) during May/June 2024. 48 WLFs at 3600 Å are identified from 89 available samples with an occurrence rate of 53.9%, which is much higher than that (23.9%) of a longterm-continuous data set from October 2022 to May 2023 in our previous work (Jing et al. 2024). In particular, with an additional sample of over 730 M- and X-class flares from October 2022 to June 2024, we find that the occurrence rate of WLFs shows a good correlation with the solar cycle represented by sunspot counts. As regards the properties of the emission at 3600 Å, the WLFs in SAR NOAA 13664/13697 have some different characteristics, say, a longer duration but a weaker relative enhancement and a smaller brightening area compared with the previous long-term-continuous sample. We also find that for WLFs in NOAA 13664/13697 the relation between the duration and energy at 3600 Å is described by a power-law with index of 0.35, which is similar to the results found for superflares in Sun-like stars (Kowalski 2024). All these help us understand the solar WLFs in SARs and also provide important insights into the superflares on Sun-like stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11036" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consistent Modeling of Non-equilibrium Dust Sublimation and the Interactions with Dust Evolution in the Inner Regions of Protoplanetary Disks</a><span class="id">[2509.11036]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The inner regions of protoplanetary disks are host to the sublimation of dust grains, a process traditionally modeled using equilibrium thermodynamics. We demonstrate through ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations that silicate dust sublimation is inherently a non-equilibrium kinetic process. The binding energies and vibrational frequencies governing desorption, calculated for MgSiO3 and other compositions, reveal that sublimation timescales far exceed local dynamical times, allowing grains to persist in a superheated state. This kinetic inhibition results in a broad, dynamic sublimation front whose location and morphology are strongly regulated by radial advection and dust coagulation. Our coupled simulations, integrating sublimation with advection and grain evolution, show that the front varies radially by a factor of four with accretion rate and exhibits a vertically stratified, bowl-shaped structure. These findings imply that the inner disk dust distribution, thermal structure, and subsequent planet formation are profoundly influenced by the kinematics and kinetics of dust grains, necessitating a departure from equilibrium prescriptions in disk models and interpretations of inner rim observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Signature of Sub-galactic Dark Matter Clumping in the Global 21-cm Signal of Hydrogen</a><span class="id">[2509.11055]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is thought that the Universe went through an early period known as the Dark Ages, during which primeval density fluctuations grew to form the first luminous objects, marking the beginning of Cosmic Dawn around 100 million years after the Big Bang. The 21-cm line of hydrogen atoms is the most promising probe of these epochs, with extensive observational efforts underway. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to precisely calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the global (sky-averaged) 21-cm radio intensity. We show that it presents a potential opportunity to probe the properties of dark matter in a new regime, corresponding to a length-scale of only 150,000 light years and a mass-scale of 20 million Solar masses. This effect can in principle be detected unambiguously during the Dark Ages, where the weak signal requires an array of global signal antennae. During Cosmic Dawn, when stellar radiation boosts the signal, a single global antenna suffices, but the clumping effect must then be separated from the effect of the stars. Our findings open new avenues for testing the nature of dark matter as well as non-standard cosmological models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing small-scale dark matter clumping with the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2509.11175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 21-cm line of hydrogen is the most promising probe of the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum, focusing on redshifts $z=20-40$. As the clumping effect arises from small-scale density fluctuations, it offers a unique opportunity to probe the standard cold dark matter model in a new regime and thus potentially investigate the properties of dark matter. To this end, we also study a warm dark matter $-$ like model with a Gaussian cutoff on a scale of 50 kpc. We find that clumping has a significant impact on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum. For example, for the Dark Ages case at $z=30$ and wavenumber $k=0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$, small-scale clustering enhances the 21-cm power spectrum by $13\%$. Once Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling kicks in due to the first stars, the 21-cm signal strengthens, and the effect of clumping grows; it suppresses the observable power spectrum at $z=20$ by a factor of two, while the cutoff model has less than half the clumping impact. The clumping effect is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the planned Square Kilometre Array (SKA) AA$^\star$ configuration, by up to a factor of 20 for standard cold dark matter, though detection will require separation from foregrounds and from astrophysical contributions to the 21-cm power spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11179" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decomposing wave activity in the solar atmosphere: Shocks, jets and swirls in the quiet Sun</a><span class="id">[2509.11179]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. There remains much mystery about how or if wave-energy in the photosphere can be transferred sufficiently upwards through the solar atmosphere to contribute to coronal heating. In light of a plethora of theoretical and idealised studies, we must complement our understanding with realistic and self-driven simulations in order to confidently quantify such contributions. Aims. In this study we aim to connect the various environments from the photosphere to low corona and identify wave drivers, transitions and dissipation mechanisms. We will analyse the effects of the presence of twisted magnetic features and vortical flows on the transport of such wave modes as the structures evolve. Methods. We adopt the most significant frequency (MSF) decomposition method to trace wave activity through a 3D realistic quiet Sun simulation. We focus on vertical and temporal evolution, identifying wave sources and shifts in the dominant modes. Results. We identify two frequencies, at 3.5 and 5 mHz, that connect oscillations in the upper convection zone to the dynamics in the solar atmosphere. We see distinct differences in the absence and presence of swirling structures on the upwards propagation of these oscillations. Furthermore, we validate the use of the highest frequency MSFs as a proxy for the location of shocks in the chromosphere, and use the results to understand the connection between shocks and the propagation of oscillations in the upper atmosphere. We discuss the relation of energy transfer via shocks, mode conversion, and jets. Finally, we find the contribution of 3.5 and 5 mHz signals to the overall wave power in the domain to be significant, up to 50%.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11199" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin of the lunar farside highlands from Earthshine-induced global circulation in lunar magma ocean</a><span class="id">[2509.11199]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The lunar farside highlands, referred to as the lunar farside thicker crust compared with the nearside crust, presents a challenge to the theory of formation and evolution of the Moon. Here, we show that, after the Moon reached synchronous rotation, Earthshine could induce global circulation in lunar magma ocean due to the imposed surface temperature gradient generated by the hot, post-giant impact Earth. The global circulation, generating downwellings on the farside and a deeper return flow on the nearside, results that magmas flow from the nearside to the farside in the shallow magma ocean while the the direction of flow is opposite in the deep magma ocean. Such flow in the shallow magma ocean would transport anorthositic crystals formed in the nearside to the farside. Furthermore, since the lunar farside is cooler than the nearside, crystallization is much more efficient at the farside, resulting that farside magmas transported from the nearside produce anorthositic crystals rapidly. The theory proposed here may provide a natural way of explaining the origin of the lunar farside highlands.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytic Model for Scattered Ly$\boldsymbolα$ Emission in the Post-reionization Intergalactic Medium</a><span class="id">[2509.11268]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping is emerging as a new probe of faint galaxies consisting the cosmic web that elude traditional surveys. However, the resonant nature of Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer complicates the interpretation of observed data. In this study, we develop a fast and accurate analytic prescription for computing the Ly$\alpha$ intensity field on Mpc scales in the post-reionization Universe. Motivated by insights from Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) experiments, we exploit the fact that in a highly ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) with negligible damping-wing opacity, cosmological redshifting quickly drives Ly$\alpha$ photons out of resonance, terminating the scattering process and simplifying their large-scale behavior. Photons emitted blueward of the Ly$\alpha$ line center tend to scatter on a thin, nearly spherical surface of last scattering, with a radius determined by the redshifting distance to resonance. Based on this behavior, we derive closed-form expressions for the scattered emissivity and projected surface brightness that depend only on the source spectrum, the HI density, and the peculiar velocity field. When applied to a source in a realistically simulated IGM at $z = 3$, our model shows mild discrepancies with MCRT results within a physical Mpc of the host halo, where strong gravitational infall redistributes the scattered photons, but achieves better than 5% accuracy beyond that distance in both raw and cumulative surface brightness. Our prescription offers a computationally efficient alternative to MCRT for forward-modeling Ly$\alpha$ intensity maps from cosmological simulations, enabling the inference of underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters from future observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing correlations between galaxy properties across the Cosmic Web: An IllustrisTNG-based study</a><span class="id">[2509.11288]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the impact of cosmic web environments on galaxy properties such as $(u-r)\,$colour, stellar mass, star formation rate, and stellar metallicity, using a stellar mass-matched sample of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation.

We include J-band data of four additional targets obtained with the three-channel camera at the 2m Fraunhofer telescope at the Wendelstein Observatory. We complement the new J-band photometric catalogue with forced photometry in the i- and z-bands of the tenth data release of the Legacy Survey (LSDR10) to derive the radial colour distribution around the eRASS1 clusters. Without assuming a priori to find a cluster red sequence at a specific colour, we try to find a radially weighted colour over-density to confirm the presence of high-redshift optical counterparts for the X-ray emission. We compare our confirmation with optical properties derived in earlier works based on LSDR10 data to refine the existing high-redshift cluster confirmation of eROSITA-selected clusters. We attempt to calibrate the colour-redshift-relation including the new J-band data by comparing our obtained photometric redshift estimate with the spectroscopic redshift of a confirmed, optically selected, high-redshift galaxy cluster. We confirm 9 out of 18 of the selected galaxy cluster candidates with a radial over-density of similar coloured galaxies for which we provide a photometric redshift estimate. We can report an increase in the relative colour measurement precision from 8% to 4% when including J-band data. In conclusion, our findings indicate a not insignificant spurious contaminant fraction at the high-redshift end (BEST_Z &gt; 0.9) of the eROSITA/eRASS1 galaxy cluster catalogue, as well as it underlines the necessity for wide and deep near infrared imaging data for confirmation and characterisation of high-$z$ galaxy clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar Eruption Onset and Particle Acceleration in Nested-Null Topologies</a><span class="id">[2509.11326]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The magnetic breakout model explains a variety of solar eruptions, ranging from small-scale jets to large-scale coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Most of our previous studies are focused on jets and CMEs in single null-point topologies. Here, we investigate the initiation of CMEs and associated particle acceleration in a double null-point (or nested fan-spine) topology during multiple homologous M- and X-class flares from an active region. The initiation of the flare and associated eruption begins with inflow structures moving towards the inner null of the closed fan-spine topology. The first explosive breakout reconnection of the flux rope at the inner null produced a circular and remote ribbons along with successful eruption of the flux rope and associated fast EUV (shock) wave. Simultaneous flare reconnection beneath the erupting flux rope produced a typical two-ribbon flare along with two hard X-ray footpoint sources. When the flux rope (with shock) reaches the outer null, the second explosive breakout reconnection produces another large-scale remote ribbon. The radio observations reveal quasiperiodic Type III bursts (period=100-s) and a Type II burst during the breakout reconnection near the inner and outer nulls, along with gradual solar energetic particles (SEPs) observed at 1 AU for magnetically connected events. This study highlight the importance of two successive breakout reconnection in the initiation of CMEs in nested-null topologies and associated particle acceleration/release into the interplanetary medium. The particles are accelerated by the shock ahead of the flux rope, which formed during the inner breakout reconnection. These findings have significant implications for particle acceleration and escape processes in multi-scale null-point topologies that produce jets and CMEs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Role of magnetic shear distribution on the formation of eruptive flux ropes</a><span class="id">[2509.11416]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Erupting flux ropes play crucial role in powering a wide range of solar transients, including flares, jets, and coronal mass ejections. These events are driven by the release of stored magnetic energy, facilitated by the shear in the complex magnetic topologies. However, the mechanisms governing the formation and eruption of flux ropes, particularly the role of magnetic shear distribution in coronal arcades are not fully understood. We employ magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating nonadiabatic effects of optically thin radiative losses, magnetic field-aligned thermal conduction, and spatially varying (steady) background heating, to realistically model the coronal environment. A stratified solar atmosphere under gravity is initialized with a non-force-free field comprising sheared arcades. We study two different cases by varying the initial shear to analyze their resulting dynamics, and the possibility of flux rope formation and eruptions. Our results show that strong initial magnetic shear leads to spontaneous flux rope formation and eruption via magnetic reconnection, driven by Lorentz force. The shear distribution infers the non-potentiality distributed along arcades and demonstrates its relevance in identifying sites prone to eruptive activity. The evolution of mean shear and the relative strength between guide to reconnection fields during the pre- and post-eruption phases are explored, with implications of bulk heating for the “hot onset” phenomena in flares, and particle acceleration. On the other hand, the weaker shear case does not lead to formation of any flux ropes. Our findings highlight the limitations of relying solely on foot point shear and underscore the need for coronal scale diagnostics. These results are relevant for understanding eruptive onset conditions and can promote a better interpretation of coronal observations from current and future missions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11495" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three binary-source binary-lens microlensing events from the 2024 microlensing campaign</a><span class="id">[2509.11495]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigated microlensing events detected by the OGLE and KMTNet surveys during the 2024 observing season, focusing on those that exhibit very complex anomaly features. Through this analysis, we found that the light curves of three events including OGLE-2024-BLG-0657, KMT-2024-BLG-2017, and KMT-2024-BLG-2480 cannot be readily interpreted using standard three-body lensing models such as a binary lens with a single source (2L1S) or a single lens with a binary source (1L2S). In this work we present detailed analyses of these events to uncover the nature of their anomalous features. An initial analysis using 2L1S modeling of the light curves showed that while it was difficult to simultaneously explain all of the multiple anomaly features, the main anomaly feature could be accounted for. Based on this model, we conducted four-body modeling that includes an additional lens or source. Through this approach, we found that the complex anomalies observed in the three events could be explained by a 2L2S model, in which both the lens and the source are binaries. Analysis of the color and magnitude revealed that the source is a binary system consisting of G- and K-type main sequence stars for OGLE-2024-BLG-0657, two K-type main sequence stars for KMT-2024-BLG-2017, and a K-type star with an early G-type main sequence companion for KMT-2024-BLG-2480. A Bayesian analysis incorporating constraints from the lensing observables indicates that the lenses in KMT-2024-BLG-2017 and KMT-2024-BLG-2480 are likely binary systems of low-mass stars located in the Galactic bulge, whereas the lens system OGLE-2024-BLG-0657L is likely a binary composed of two stellar remnants situated in the Galactic disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11565" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Polar Orbit of TOI-2374 b, a Planet in the Neptunian Ridge</a><span class="id">[2509.11565]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The “Neptunian ridge” is a recently identified peak in the frequency of planets with sizes between that of Neptune and Saturn orbiting their host stars with periods between 3 and 6 days (A. Castro-González et al. 2024). These planets may have formed similarly to their larger, hot Jupiter counterparts in the “three-day pile-up”, through a dynamically excited migration pathway. The distribution of stellar obliquities in hot Neptune systems may therefore provide a vital clue as to their origin. We report a new stellar obliquity measurement for TOI-2374 b, a planet in the Neptunian ridge ($P = 4.31$ days, $R_p = 7.5 R_\oplus$). We observed a spectroscopic transit of TOI-2374 b with the Keck Planet Finder, detecting the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) anomaly with an amplitude of 3 m/s, and measured a sky-projected obliquity of $\lambda = {81^\circ}^{+23^\circ}_{-22^\circ}$, indicating an orbit significantly misaligned with the spin axis of its host star. A reloaded RM analysis of the cross-correlation functions confirms this misalignment, measuring $\lambda = {65^\circ}^{+32^\circ}_{-24^\circ}$. Additionally, we measured a stellar rotation period of $P_\mathrm{rot} = 26.4^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ days with photometry from the Tierras observatory, allowing us to deduce the three-dimensional stellar obliquity of $\psi = {85.9^\circ}^{+8.6^\circ}_{-9.2^\circ}$. TOI-2374 b joins a growing number of hot Neptunes on polar orbits. The high frequency of misaligned orbits for Neptunian ridge and desert planets, compared with their longer period counterparts, is reminiscent of patterns seen for the giant planets and may suggest a similar formation mechanism.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equilibrium Points and Surface Dynamics About Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</a><span class="id">[2509.11613]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Small bodies in our Solar System are considered remnants of their early formation.

ESA's Rosetta mission successfully landed and studied comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) for approximately two years. In this work, the aim is to analyze the surface and orbital dynamics of comet 67P in detail, using a suitable 3-D polyhedral shape model. We applied the polyhedron method to calculate dynamic surface characteristics, including geometric height, surface tilt, surface slopes, geopotential surface, acceleration surface, escape speed, equilibrium points, and zero-velocity curves. The results show that the gravitational potential is predominant on the comet's surface due to its slow rotation. The escape speed has the maximum value in the Hapi region (the comet's neck). The surface slopes were analyzed to predict possible regions of particle motion and accumulation. The results show that most regions of the comet's surface have low slopes. Furthermore, we analyzed the slopes under the effects of Third-Body gravitational and Solar Radiation Pressure perturbations. Our results showed that the effects of Third-Body perturbations do not significantly affect the global behavior of slopes. Meanwhile, the Solar Radiation Pressure does not significantly affect particles across the surface of comet 67P with sizes $&gt;\sim10^{-3}$ cm at apocenter and $&gt;\sim10^{-1}$ cm at pericenter. We also identified four equilibrium points around comet 67P and one equilibrium point inside the body, where points E$_2$ and E$_5$ are linearly stable. In addition, we approximated the shape of comet 67P using the simplified Dipole Segment Model to study its dynamics, employing parameters derived from its 3-D polyhedral shape model. We found 12 families of planar symmetric periodic orbits around the body.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compression, Impact and Hot Rebound Flows from Coronal Rain Downflows</a><span class="id">[2509.11627]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the processes associated with coronal rain due to the thermal non-equilibrium (TNE) and thermal instability (TI) scenario can help us understand coronal heating.

During the coronal rain shower, the coronal loop exhibits large EUV variability and drastic changes in sub-structure. Coronal rain clumps with total velocities between 72 km s$^{-1}$ and 87 km s$^{-1}$ and cool EUV absorbing core sizes of $\approx$600 km and densities of $\approx5\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ are seen to fall with a strong compression ahead. During the compression we measure a low polytropic index with $\gamma=1.085$, suggesting the presence of molecules. The rain shower carries a total of $3.09\times10^{26}$ erg, and the clumps produce impacts seen in all EUV channels and in SJI 1400 Å. The impacts generate hot rebound flows with temperatures of $10^{6.2}-10^{6.3}~$K and velocities of $85-87$ km s$^{-1}$, which refill and reheat the loop but carry less than $20\%$ of the clumps' kinetic energies. We find signatures of a steady footpoint heating, in agreement with the TNE-TI scenario, with an estimated amplitude of $2.56\times10^{-2}~$erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ in agreement with active region estimates. Coronal rain may therefore be a good proxy for the total integrated heating that gives birth to TNE-TI.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hurst Index of Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curves and Its Statistical Study</a><span class="id">[2509.11631]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) rank among the most powerful astrophysical phenomena, characterized by complex and highly variable prompt emission light curves that reflect the dynamics of their central engines.

One theory proposed to explain this behaviour is the existence of a bow shock driven by a spherically symmetric time-varying dusty wind from the star, which is assumed to vary due to radial pulsations. To test this hypothesis, this study uses a new framework developed in \textsc{ZEUS3D}, a multiphysics magnetohydrodynamics code. The results of this work show that when a time-varying stellar wind is at its maximum brightness, the polarization signal is at a minimum due to the wind structure and a dense, symmetric shell that forms around the star. Conversely, when the brightness is at a minimum, the symmetric shell around the star is much less dense, and the polarization is instead dominated by the asymmetric bow shock structure, causing the polarization signal to attain a maximum value. Numerically reproducing the observed inverse relationship between the polarization and light curve provides a strong theoretical argument that a variable stellar wind bow shock is the solution to the curious case of V CVn.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angle-dependent hardening of the reprocessed spectra in ULXs powered by accretion onto neutron stars</a><span class="id">[2509.11682]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is anticipated that mass accretion rates exceeding approximately $10^{19}\,{\rm g\,s^{-1}}$ in X-ray pulsars lead to radiation-driven outflows from super-critical accretion discs. The outflows launched from the disc influence the angular distribution of X-ray radiation, resulting in geometrical beaming. The beaming, in turn, impacts the apparent luminosity of the X-ray pulsar, detectability of pulsations, and the spectral composition of the X-ray flux. We employ a straightforward geometrical model of the outflows, perform Monte Carlo simulations, and model the spectra of radiation, reprocessed by the walls of the accretion cavity formed by the outflows. We consider the reprocessed emission only; direct pulsar emission is not included in our modelling. Our results demonstrate that the spectra of reprocessed radiation depend on the actual luminosity of the central engine, the geometry of the outflows, and the viewing angle - most notably on the latter, through changing visibility of the hotter wall regions near the disc plane. The high-energy part of the reprocessed spectrum depends strongly on viewing angle (harder at lower inclinations), while the soft flux varies comparatively little with inclination. In our model, this contrast is a prediction: variable ultra-luminous X-ray sources are expected to exhibit strong high-energy angle sensitivity together with comparatively modest soft-band variation, naturally arising if precession modulates the effective inclination.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11692" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic reconnection sustains the mass budget of the solar wind</a><span class="id">[2509.11692]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The solar wind originates from regions of open magnetic fields on the Sun, but the relevant processes remain unsolved.

Our work again highlights the importance of re-examining our understanding on the very early Universe within the broader context of cosmological tensions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frequency evolution of pulsar emission: Further evidence for fan beam model</a><span class="id">[2509.11945]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aims. We explore frequency-dependent changes in pulsar radio emission by analyzing their profile widths and emission heights, assessing whether the simple radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) or the fan beam model can describe the data. Methods. Using wideband (704-4032 MHz) Murriyang (Parkes) observations of over 100 pulsars, we measured profile widths at multiple intensity levels, fit Gaussian components, and used aberration-retardation effects to estimate emission altitudes. We compared trends in width evolution and emission height with a fan beam model. Results. Similar to other recent studies, we find that while many pulsars show profiles narrowing with increasing frequency, a substan- tial fraction show the reverse. The Gaussian decomposition of the profiles reveals that the peak locations of the components vary little with frequency. However, the component widths do, in general, narrow with increasing frequency. This argues that propagation effects are responsible for the width evolution of the profiles rather than emission height. Overall, the evolution of the emission height with frequency is unclear, and clouded by the assumptions in the model. Spin-down luminosity correlates weakly with profile narrowing but not with emission height. Conclusions. The classic picture where pulsars emit at a single emission height which decreases with increasing observing frequency cannot explain the diversity in behavior observed here. Instead, pulsar beams likely originate from extended regions at multiple altitudes, with fan-beam or patchy structures dominating their frequency evolution. Future models must incorporate realistic plasma physics and multi-altitude emission to capture the range of pulsar behaviors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11993" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">STRAWBERRY: Finding haloes in the gravitational potential</a><span class="id">[2509.11993]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Here, we present a novel algorithm that discriminates between bound and unbound particles by consideration of the gravitational potential from an accelerated reference frame – also referred to as `the boosted potential'. Particles are considered bound if their energy does not exceed the escape energy of a potential well – given by the closest saddle-point that connects to a deeper potential minimum. This approach has core benefits over previous approaches, since it does not require any ad-hoc thresholds (such as over-density criteria), it includes the gravitational effect of all particles in the binding criterion (improving over widely used self-potential binding checks) and it only operates with instantaneous information (making it simpler than approaches based on dynamical histories). We show that particles typically become bound between their first peri- and apo-centeric passage and that bound and unbound populations show very distinct characteristics through their distribution in phase space, their density profiles, their virial ratios, and their redshift evolution. Our findings suggest that it is possible to understand haloes as two-component systems, with one component being bound, virialized, of finite extent and evolving slowly in quasi-equilibrium and the other component being unbound, unvirialized and evolving rapidly.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of femto Gauss intergalactic magnetic fields towards Mkn 501</a><span class="id">[2509.11996]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The existence of intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF) has so far not been established through observations. The IGMF is expected to be generated either via processes mainly connected to astrophysical processes or it could be a relic of phase transitions in the early universe. Upper bounds to the average field present are set via observations of Faraday rotation measure. Lower bounds have been derived from the non-detection of secondary gamma-rays possibly produced in electromagnetic cascades. We investigate the presence of IGMFs by studying the GeV gamma-ray emission from the nearby blazar Mkn 501 ($z=0.034$), searching for evidence of the extended halo expected to be observed around the point source. We analyse 14 years of data from Fermi-LAT and Swift-XRT/BAT to construct a time-average synchrotron-self Compton model for the TeV spectrum of Mkn 501. This injection spectrum is used to simulate the resulting cascade emission with the ELMAG code for different magnetic field and coherence length configurations. These templates are fit to the Fermi-LAT data to find a best-fitting model for the cascade emission. We find significant ($\ge 5 \sigma$ trial-corrected) evidence for extended secondary emission around Mkn 501, which is consistent with an IGMF with $B_\mathrm{rms}=1.5_{-0.6}^{+1.6}\times 10^{-15}~\mathrm{G}$ and a coherence length of $\ell_C=(10\pm 3)~\mathrm{kpc}$. The source needs to actively inject TeV gamma-rays for at least 45000 years to match the level of secondary emission. Our results indicate that the secondary gamma-rays are significantly present in the $\it{Fermi}$-LAT data. The effect of plasma-heating by pairs in the cascade appears to be negligible for Mkn 501. This is consistent with the observation that Mkn 501 is one of the objects with the lowest injection power among the blazars studied in the context of cascade emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing Event Rate of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2509.12016]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>How the event rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) evolves with redshift is a hot topic to explore their cosmological origin and the circum-burst environment. Particularly, it is urgent to know what the difference of event rates between repeating and non-repeating FRBs is. For the first time, we calculate the event rates of repeating FRBs detected by diverse telescopes at frequencies higher/lower than 1 GHz in this work. Luminosity and redshift are found to be positively correlated with a power law form for both high- and low-frequency FRBs, showing an obvious evolution of luminosity with redshift. Furthermore, we compare the differential luminosity and local event rate distributions of high- and low-luminosity FRBs at different frequencies. It is found that the event rates of these sub-samples of repeating FRBs similarly exceed the star formation rate at lower redshift than 1. Interestingly, we confirm with bootstrap method that the event rates of low-frequency FRBs exhibit different evolution patterns and are higher than that of high-frequency ones.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Signatures of Axion Dark Matter via Parity-Violating Interactions</a><span class="id">[2509.12038]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate axion-like particles coupled to gravity through a parity-violating Chern-Simons (CS) interaction.

The resulting bounds on the axion-graviton coupling $\alpha$ improve upon the cosmological stability requirement for axion masses $m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, excluding values up to four orders of magnitude below the stability limit.

Our analysis shows that flares are present in some observations, whereas they are absent in others. Flaring state exhibits two-component spectra at a lower average flux level, whereas the non-flaring state displays single-component spectra at a higher average flux level. The M74 X-1 spectra are best described by the combination of accretion disk and Comptonization components, a dual thermal disk blackbody model, and a modified multi-temperature disk blackbody model. Using the dual thermal disk blackbody model, we obtain cool and hot temperatures of $T_{in}$ (cool) = $0.38^{+0.08}_{-0.06}$ keV and $T_{in}$ (hot) = $1.67^{+0.18}_{-0.13}$ keV, respectively, suggesting two temperature emitting regions and indicating possible presence of outflowing wind along with the accretion disk. We found a Gaussian feature at $E_{line}$ = $0.96^{+0.05}_{-0.11}$ keV with $\sigma$ = $0.11^{+0.13}_{-0.06}$ keV in the spectra of the flaring state which can be interpreted as the unresolved wind feature in the system when compared to similar feature seen in other ULXs. Plotting the hardness luminosity diagram, we get a trend of increasing hardness with luminosity, suggesting the presence of geometrical beaming in a low-inclination system. Additionally, using the hot disk blackbody component from the dual thermal disk blackbody model, we estimate the mass of the compact object to be M = $7.1^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$ M$_\odot$, classifying it as a stellar-mass black hole and confirming super-Eddington accretion in the system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12114" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral Energy Distribution Analysis of the Supersoft X-ray Source CAL 87: Multiwavelength Constraints</a><span class="id">[2509.12114]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyse the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the eclipsing supersoft X-ray source CAL 87 covering wavelengths from X-rays to the near-infrared.

Using data from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), we characterized 30 white dwarfs exhibiting infrared excess, including 29 DA and 1 DB stars. While an infrared excess can arise from dusty disks or cool (sub-)stellar companions, our sample is limited to stellar companions due to our selection based on SDSS photometry, which is sensitive to excess emission at wavelengths $\lambda &lt; 1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. Our sample contains 22 newly identified excess sources not previously reported in the literature. Spectroscopic observations are available for 10 sources via SDSS, of which only 8 have prior spectroscopic classifications in the literature. In this paper, we present the determination of the effective temperature and surface gravity of these white dwarfs. We used the Balmer line profiles to compare with current atmospheric models to determine the photospheric parameters of the white dwarfs, minimizing contamination introduced by the infrared source. We used photometric data from the SDSS and the \textit{Gaia} mission to resolve the degeneracies between hot and cold solutions from spectroscopy, constraining the photospheric parameters. These results help refine our understanding of white dwarf evolution in binary systems, focusing on stellar companions that cause the infrared excess. This study contributes to identifying systems with potential substellar companions or unresolved stellar partners, adding to the growing effort to map out the fate of planetary systems after their host stars evolve beyond the main sequence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for a gap in the envelope mass fraction of sub-Saturns</a><span class="id">[2509.12120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Under the core-accretion model, gas giants form via runaway accretion. This process starts when the mass of the accreted envelope becomes equal to the mass of the core. Here, we model a population of warm sub-Saturns to search for imprints of their formation history in their internal structure. Using the GAS gianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI), we calculate a grid of interior structure models on which we perform retrievals for our sample of 28 sub-Saturns to derive their envelope mass fractions ($f_{env}$). For each planet, we run three different retrievals assuming low (-2.0 &lt; log(Fe/H) &lt; 0.5), medium ( 0.5 &lt; log(Fe/H) &lt; 1.4), and high (1.4 &lt; log(Fe/H) &lt; 1.7) atmospheric metallicity. The distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample is then compared to predictions of planet formation models. When compared to the outcomes of a planetesimal accretion model, we find that we require medium to high atmospheric metallicities to reproduce the simulated planet population. Additionally, we find a bimodal distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample with a gap that is located at different values of $f_{env}$ for different atmospheric metallicities. For the high atmospheric metallicity case, the gap in the $f_{env}$ distribution is located between 0.5 and 0.7, which is consistent with assumptions by the core-accretion model where runaway accretion starts when $M_{env} \approx M_{core}$ ($f_{env} \sim 0.5$). We also find a bimodal distribution of the hydrogen and helium mass fraction ($f_{H/He}$) with a gap at $f_{H/He} = 0.3$. The location of this gap is independent of the assumed atmospheric metallicity. Lastly, we compare the distributions of our sub-Saturns in the Neptunian savanna to a population of sub-Saturns in the Neptune desert and ridge. We find that the observed $f_{env}$ distribution of savanna and ridge sub-Saturns is consistent with the planets coming from the same underlying population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Short Introduction to Cosmology and its Current Status</a><span class="id">[2509.12121]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The current cosmological model, known as the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model (or $\Lambda$CDM for short) is one of the most astonishing accomplishments of contemporary theoretical physics.

We modified the analytical Shakura-Sunyaev models for a general opacity prescription, and derived radial profiles of various this http URL profiles were computed for the fixed accretion rate, $\dot M = 2\times 10^{-5}\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, inferred from the observed rate of change of the binary period. More general models were computed numerically, using 1-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics, accounting for viscous, radiative as well as irradiation terms. The initial conditions were taken from the analytical models. To achieve the accretion rate, the surface density $\Sigma$ must be much higher (of the order of $10^4\,{\rm kg}\,{\rm m}^{-2}$ for the viscosity parameter $\alpha = 0.1$) than in the kinematic model. Viscous dissipation and radiative cooling in the optically thick regime lead to a high midplane temperature $T$ (up to $10^5\,{\rm K}$). The accretion disc is still gas pressure dominated with the opacity close to Kramers one.} To reconcile temperature profiles with observations, we had to distinguish three different temperatures: midplane, atmospheric and irradiation. The latter two are comparable to observations (30000 to 12000 K).

One of these processes is the acceleration of non-thermal ions, which will, eventually, reach relativistic speeds and become cosmic rays. This process is difficult to simulate in a computer model because it requires both macro-physics (the overall shape of the shock) and micro-physics (the interaction between individual particles and the magnetic field). The combined PIC-MHD method is one of several options to get around this problem. It is based on the assumption that a plasma can be described as a combination of a thermal gas, which can be accurately described as a fluid using grid-based magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and a small non-thermal component which has to be described as individual particles using particle-in-cell (PIC). By combining aspects of both methods, we reduce the computational costs while maintaining the ability to trace the acceleration of individual particles. We apply this method to a variety of astrophysical shock configurations to investigate if, and how, they can contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12157" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chandra Large Project Observations of the Supernova Remnant N132D: Measuring the Expansion of the Forward Shock</a><span class="id">[2509.12157]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from the Chandra X-ray Observatory Large Project (878 ks in 28 observations) of the Large Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant N132D.

We measure an expansion of $0.\!^{\prime\prime}23 \pm 0.\!^{\prime\prime}02$ and a shock velocity of $3840\pm260~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ for two features in an apparent blowout region in the northeast. The emission-measure-weighted average temperature inferred from X-ray spectral fits to regions in the southern rim is $0.95\pm0.17$ keV, consistent with the electron temperature implied by the shock velocity after accounting for Coulomb equilibration and adiabatic expansion. In contrast, the emission-measure-weighted average temperature for the northeast region is $0.77\pm0.04$ keV, which is significantly lower than the value inferred from the shock velocity. We fit 1-D evolutionary models for the shock in the southern rim and northeast region, using the measured radius and propagation velocity into a constant density and power-law profile circumstellar medium. We find good agreement with the age of $\sim2500$ years derived from optical expansion measurements for explosion energies of $1.5-3.0 \times 10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$, ejecta masses of $2-6 \,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and ambient medium densities of $\sim0.33-0.66$ $\mathrm{amu~cm}^{-3}$ in the south and $\sim0.01-0.02$ $\mathrm{amu~cm}^{-3}$ in the northeast assuming a constant density medium.

We employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate galaxy cluster masses from radially sampled profiles of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) inferred from X-ray observations. GNNs naturally handle inputs of variable length and resolution by representing each ICM profile as a graph, enabling accurate and flexible modeling across diverse observational conditions. We trained and tested GNN model using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred Project. The mass estimates using our method exhibit no systematic bias compared to the true cluster masses in the simulations. Additionally, we achieve a scatter in recovered mass versus true mass of about 6\%, which is a factor of six smaller than obtained from a standard hydrostatic equilibrium approach. Our algorithm is robust to both data quality and cluster morphology and it is capable of incorporating model uncertainties alongside observational uncertainties. Finally, we apply our technique to XMM-Newton observed galaxy cluster samples and compare the GNN derived mass estimates with those obtained with $Y_{\rm SZ}$-M$_{500}$ scaling relations. Our results provide strong evidence, at 5$\sigma$ level, for a mass-dependent bias in SZ derived masses, with higher mass clusters exhibiting a greater degree of deviation. Furthermore, we find the median bias to be $(1-b)=0.85_{-14}^{+34}$, albeit with significant dispersion due to its mass dependence. This work takes a significant step towards establishing unbiased observable mass scaling relations by integrating X-ray, SZ and optical datasets using deep learning techniques, thereby enhancing the role of galaxy clusters in precision cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breaking Dark: Hunting Heavy Decaying Dark Matter with Tibet AS$_γ$ and LHAASO-KM2A</a><span class="id">[2509.08039]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent measurements of diffuse sub-PeV gamma-rays by the Tibet AS$_\gamma$ and LHAASO collaborations have reshaped our understanding of the gamma-ray sky.

Generic BBHs are spinning, and their spins are misaligned with the orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$. These misaligned spins cause $\vec{L}$ to precess in a cone with dimensionless precession amplitude $\tilde{\theta}$ and frequency $\tilde{\Omega}$ about the nearly constant direction of the total angular momentum. This precession modulates the observed GWs. We propose a model of regularly precessing (RP) waveforms that incorporates $\tilde{\theta}$ and $\tilde{\Omega}$ directly as parameters. We investigate how these waveforms vary as functions of these precessional parameters, as well as binary orientation and sky location. We use the Lindblom criterion to estimate that precession can be detected in a RP source with signal-to-noise ratio $\rho$ when the mismatch $\epsilon$ with a non-precessing (NP) source with otherwise identical parameters exceeds $1/2\rho^2$. Precession is most detectable when $\vec{L}$ precesses through configurations we call + nulls during the inspiral. At + nulls, a NP source only emits +-polarization to which the GW detector is insensitive. The large mismatch between a RP source and this vanishing NP signal enhances the detectability of precession. We also explore the detectability of precession as a function of redshift $z$ for different BBH populations. We find that for BBHs with isotropically oriented maximal spins, precession is detectable in a majority of systems out to $z \approx 0.3$ for chirp masses $10 \lesssim M_c/M_\odot \lesssim 40$ and mass ratios $q \gtrsim 0.5$. Reduced spin magnitudes or greater alignment between the spins and $\vec{L}$ make it difficult to observe beyond $z \approx 0.1$.

We demonstrate that the split seesaw framework, which explains the smallness of neutrino masses, naturally motivates a small scalar self-coupling $\lambda$. This intrinsically links the neutrino mass generation mechanism to the formation of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings, where the gauge coupling dominates over the scalar self-coupling ($\beta\equiv\lambda/2g^2&lt;1$). We explore the cosmological implications of these strings, including their gravitational wave signatures that are testable in current and future experiments.

Focusing on the connected four-point autocorrelation function of gauge fields, we derive exact analytical expressions for the full trispectrum of both electric and magnetic fields using the in-in formalism and cosmological diagrammatic rules, and explore their respective contributions in specific momentum configurations. For the scalar exchange, we find that the trispectrum signal in the equisided configuration grows with the exchange momentum and reaches its maximum in the flattened limit. However, in the counter collinear limit, we show that the non-linearity parameter associated with the trispectrum scales quadratically with the corresponding parameter of the cross-correlation bispectrum of magnetic fields and curvature perturbations, thereby establishing a hierarchical relation between the higher- and lower-order correlation functions. For the tensor exchange, the trispectrum displays a richer angular dependence, reflecting the sensitivity to the orientation of the momentum quadrilateral with respect to the tensor polarisation, producing characteristic angular modulations in the trispectrum. Detecting such angular signatures in future high-precision cosmological observations would provide a novel window into tensor-mediated interactions in the early universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytical Perturbative Construction of Initial Data for Binary Black Holes up to Third Order in Spin and Momentum</a><span class="id">[2509.11144]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analytically solve the constraints in General Relativity for two black holes with arbitrary momenta and spin up to third order in these parameters.

We use a quantitative approach by studying in detail the phase space of a combined $F(R,\phi)$ cosmological system, focusing on the de Sitter and power-law subspaces of the total phase space. As we show, the de Sitter subspace of the $F(R,\phi)$ system shares the same fixed points as the vacuum $F(R)$ gravity system and the trajectories in the phase space tend to these fixed points. However, the power-law subspace is not stable and cannot be realized by the combined $F(R,\phi)$ system. To this end, we propose a well-motivated phenomenological $F(R)$ gravity model for which the $R^2$ term is switched off below a critical curvature near the end of the $R^2$ slow-roll inflationary era, and below that critical curvature, only the Einstein-Hilbert gravity term and the scalar field remain in the effective inflationary Lagrangian. The remaining system can successfully realize a power-law tail of the $R^2$ slow-roll era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11518" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charged particle dynamics in magnetosphere generated by current loop around Schwarzschild black hole</a><span class="id">[2509.11518]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a theoretical study of the magnetic field generated by a toroidal current loop situated in the equatorial plane of a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole, based on the dynamics of charged particles.

In particular, we classify charged particle dynamics into attractive and repulsive Lorentz force configurations and show that in the attractive case, charged particles can accumulate near the current loop, forming collective currents that oppose the original current loop magnetic field. We demonstrate that charged particle accumulation can lead to the formation of toroidal structures analogous to radiation belts in the BH magnetosphere. We compare the curved spacetime solution to flat spacetime analogs and highlight general relativistic effects such as the existence of the innermost stable circular orbit for charged particles, which sets a lower bound for radiation belt formation. The divergence of the vector potential at the loop location in the idealized infinitesimal loop model is addressed, and we argue that a physically realistic model must consider a finite-width current distribution to avoid unphysical divergences in the effective potential.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11665" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A study of the pulsar EXO 1745-248 in $f(Q)$ gravity with pseudo-spheroidal geometry</a><span class="id">[2509.11665]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a singularity-free relativistic interior solution for constructing stable quark stellar models in the framework of a linear $f(Q)$ gravity ($f(Q) = \alpha Q + \phi$) satisfying the pseudo-spheroidal geometry. The physical features and the stability of the stellar model is explored with strange star (SS) candidate EXO 1745-248 ($M = 1.7\, M_{\odot}$ and $R = 9\, km$). The Durgapal-Banerjee transformation is employed to obtain the relativistic interior solution using the MIT Bag model equation of state (EoS): $P = \frac{1}{3}(\rho - 4 B_{g})$. For a linear form of $f(Q)$ gravity, we obtain the exterior vacuum solution, which reduces to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) solution with the cosmological constant term, $\Lambda = \frac{\phi}{2\alpha}$. The stellar model is analyzed for the different values of the spheroidicity parameter ($\mu$). The value of $\alpha$ is constrained using a viable physical limit on the Bag parameter ($B_{g} \in [57.55,95.11]\,MeV\,fm^{-3}$). The constraints on Mass-Radius relation indicates that physically acceptable SS models are permitted for $\mu \geq 7$. The contribution of $\mu$ to the energy density, pressure profiles, and other physical features is studied for the SS candidate EXO 1745-248. The stability of the stellar model obtained here is also analyzed through causality condition, adiabatic index and other stability criteria. We also investigate the stellar model for other SS candidates to test its viability. The relativistic interior solution obtained here can be used to construct viable and physically acceptable strange star models with very high compactness ratio in the framework of linear $f(Q)$ gravity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12164" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anomalous electron heating in laboratory magnetized quasi-perpendicular collisionless shocks</a><span class="id">[2509.12164]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present laboratory results from supercritical, magnetized collisionless shock experiments ($M_A \lesssim 10$, $\beta\sim 1$).

We address two viable scenarios for the transition to quark matter: a quark-hadron crossover (QHC) or a strong first-order phase transition (1PT). To distinguish between different models, we define neutron-quark stars (NQS) as configurations where quark effects emerge at masses below the lowest observed neutron-star mass. While traditional &quot;hybrid stars&quot; may be distinguished by purely hadronic configurations through mass-radius measurements, the mass-radius relations of NQSs resemble those of purely hadronic models, with no sharp boundary between hadrons and quarks. The name NQS effectively captures the absence of a phase boundary between hadrons and quarks in QHC scenarios. Our results indicate that QHC models can be distinguished from hadronic ones if both the inspiral and postmerger gravitational waves (GWs) are observed. In particular, the dominant postmerger frequency ($f_2$) tends to be lower than in hadronic models with the same tidal deformability ($\Lambda$). We also present the first general-relativistic simulations of BNS mergers where the stars already contain quark matter before merging. These involve a strong first-order phase transition (1PT) at 1.8 times nuclear saturation density, followed by a stiff quark EOS. Finally, we identify a robust linear correlation between the total GW energy emitted after the merger and the $f_2$ frequency. Remarkably, this relation holds regardless of the quark presence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discover high-z BL Lacs by Swift and SARA observations with the dropout technique</a><span class="id">[2409.16236]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The spectroscopic redshift measurement of BL Lac, a class of blazar, is challenging because its spectrum has no or weak emission lines ($\leqslant5$Å).

One of the mechanisms to reorient the stellar spin involves a secular resonance crossing due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk when the system also has an inclined, distant ($\sim 300\;\mathrm{AU}$) binary companion. This mechanism is likely to operate broadly due to the $\sim 50\%$ binary fraction of FGK dwarfs and can play an important role in setting the initial stellar obliquities prior to any dynamical evolution. In this work, we revisit this mechanism analytically for idealized, homologously evolving disk models and show that the resulting stellar obliquities are broadly distributed between $60^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ for most warm and cold planets. We further show that non-homologus disk dissipation, such as the development of a photoevaporatively-opened gap at $\sim 2\;\mathrm{AU}$, can help maintain orbital alignment of warm planets, in agreement with observations. Our results represent the proper primordial obliquities for planetary systems with distant binary companions. They also represent the obliquities of stars with no present-day binary companions if these companions are dynamically unbound during the birth cluster phase of evolution, a process that occurs on a comparable timescale as the disk-driven obliquity excitation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Globally Stable Dark Energy in $F(R)$ Gravity</a><span class="id">[2411.08617]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>$F(R)$ models for dark energy generally exhibit a weak curvature singularity, which can be cured by adding an $R^2$ term. This correction allows for a unified description of primordial and late-time accelerated expansions. However, most existing models struggle to achieve this, as they become unstable over certain negative ranges of the Ricci scalar, where either the first or second derivative of $F(R)$ turns negative. These instabilities may disrupt the post-inflationary evolution when the Ricci scalar oscillates about the vacuum state after the $R^2$ inflation. In this work, we introduce a new model-building to guarantee global stability, i.e., the first and second derivatives are positive for all real Ricci scalars. By extending the idea from Appleby and Battye, we demonstrate that viable models can be constructed by imposing a positive, bounded first derivative of $F(R)$ with a sigmoid shape. As examples, we first reformulate and generalize the original Appleby-Battye model. Then, we propose a new dark energy model, which successfully explains the acceleration of cosmic expansion and passes local gravity tests.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interpreting the LHAASO Galactic diffuse emission data</a><span class="id">[2411.11439]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, the Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) collaboration has obtained a measurement of the gamma-ray diffuse emission in the ultra-high energy range, $10-10^3$ TeV after masking the contribution of known sources. The measurement is provided in two Galactic regions and appears to be 2-3 times higher than the gamma-ray signal expected from the hadronic interactions of diffuse cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, potentially implying that either additional emission sources exist or cosmic ray intensities have spatial variations. In this work, we calculate the hadronic gamma-ray diffuse emission outside the masks, considering a realistic gas distribution. We present a comprehensive calculation of the emission, which includes systematic uncertainties in the gas content of the Galactic disk, in the energy and spatial distribution of cosmic rays, as well as in the hadronic interaction cross-sections. Our results show that these factors mitigate the tension between data and predictions. The LHAASO data appear compatible with our baseline model in the outer Galactic region. In the inner region, the data show an excess with respect to the predictions below $\sim 50$ TeV, while at higher energies they are well described by our model. We argue that two plausible explanations for enhanced gamma-ray emission-unresolved sources and CR spectral hardening in the inner Galaxy-are likely suppressed by the LHAASO masking strategy, which excludes regions where both effects are expected to be most prominent.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Effect of Massive Trans-Neptunian Objects in the Long-term Evolution and Leaking Rates of Neptune's 3:2 and 2:1 Mean Motion Resonances</a><span class="id">[2503.03900]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The current populations trapped in Neptune's main mean motion resonances in the Kuiper belt, Plutinos in the 3:2 and Twotinos in the 2:1, contain some of the best-characterized minor objects in the Solar System, given their dynamical importance.

In this work, we use numerical simulations to study the long-term evolution of the Plutino and Twotino populations. We use two data sources: the most up-to-date observations and the theoretical debiased model of the Kuiper belt known as L7. In addition to studying the giant planets' effect on these populations over 4 Gyr, we analyze the additional impact produced by the ten most massive trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) trapped in these resonances, as well as the effect of Pluto on the 2:1 population. We find that the decay rate in each resonance can be modeled as a stochastic process well described by an exponential decay with an offset determined by an underlying long-term stable population. The most massive TNOs, particularly Pluto, influence this decay rate significantly, as expected for the 3:2 resonance.

In the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart identification, gravitational waves carry valuable information through the dark siren approach, where the source redshift is estimated using galaxy catalogs of potential hosts within the localisation volume. However, the DS analysis can be affected by galaxy catalog incompleteness at the limits of gravitational-wave detectability, potentially introducing biases in the constraints on cosmological parameters. Focusing on GWs from binary black holes detected by the LVK collaboration, we explore the possible systematic biases in the measurement of the $H_0$. These biases may arise from (1) the incompleteness of catalogs due to the apparent magnitude thresholds of optical telescope sensitivity, and (2) the use of incorrect weighting schemes for each potential host. We found that an unbiased estimate of $H_0$ can be obtained when the corrected weighting scheme is applied to a complete or volume-limited catalog. We use a complete galaxy catalog covering 90% of the localisation probability for each GW detection, employing stellar mass as a tracer. Our results show that a sample of 100 binary black hole events with $A_{90\%}$&lt;10 deg$^2$ and measured luminosity distances below 1600(2500) Mpc, detected by the LVK at O4(O5) sensitivity, can provide a percent-level measurement of $H_0$, with a precision of 3%(1%). This number of detections is expected to be accumulated after approximately 8 and 3 years of observations with the LVK at O4 and O5 sensitivity, respectively. The O5 run provides a reduction in the $H_0$ uncertainty by 1.34 km/s/Mpc compared to the O4-like configuration. The $H_0$ precision increases to approximately 6% when it is assumed that every galaxy has an equal probability of being the host.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05381" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spatiotemporal Low FIP Abundance: A Catalyst for Coronal Condensation</a><span class="id">[2504.05381]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radiative losses play a critical role in the cooling of plasmas. When chromospheric plasma is sufficiently heated, it can flow into coronal loops which subsequently cool down due to radiation. From observations, we infer that this cooling does not occur uniformly, often resulting in coronal condensations such as coronal rain. To date, coronal condensations have only been found in simulations of steadily-heated loops, and never in impulsively-heated ones. We implement spatiotemporally variable elemental abundances in a radiative hydrodynamic code. Flows, including chromospheric evaporation, directly cause a shift in the local elemental abundances, which then affects the local radiative loss rate. As a consequence, we find that incorporating spatiotemporal low FIP elemental abundances into coronal loop simulations directly causes coronal condensations, which are otherwise absent in impulsively heated loop or flare models. We conclude that spatiotemporal variations in elemental abundances are a fundamental feature of the solar corona and are therefore necessary to accurately model radiation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addressing the too-big-to-fail problem and the void phenomenon through a modified initial power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2505.02475]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of early-time initial conditions on nonlinear structure formation and evolution within the framework of the semi-analytical Excursion Set Theory (EST). Our analysis reveals that adding a Gaussian bump to the initial curvature power spectrum at small scales enhances the abundance of massive halos while sharply reducing the number of small-mass halos, and consequently, satellite galaxies. Moreover, this modification increases the frequency of major mergers while suppressing high-mass-ratio minor mergers. These features may offer resolutions to the missing satellite and Too Big to Fail (TBTF) problems. In underdense regions -voids- the same modifications increase the likelihood of finding massive halos embedded in voids while similarly decreasing the small-halo population, and consequently, faint galaxies. This behavior suggests a potential solution to the void phenomenon, in which embedded halos, despite being too massive, were too rare to be noticed. More precisely, our results indicate that an excess of massive structures emerges at mass scales near the center of the Gaussian bump: $k_* = 1.85 \,\rm{h/Mpc}$ and $k_* = 3.95 \,\rm{h/Mpc}$. These scales correspond to mass scales of $M_* = 10^{11}$ and $M_* = 10^{10}$, respectively. This modification extends up to two orders of magnitude in higher mass scales, while reducing the abundance of halos below $M_*$ by two to three orders of magnitude. Additionally, we find that evolutionary conditions, halo-in-halo, and particularly halo-in-void statistics serve as more sensitive and complementary probes for differentiating among cosmological models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet</a><span class="id">[2505.12449]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we use particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations to study interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet. We vary width of the Harris current sheet to investigate how this affects the quasi-linear relaxation, i.e. plateau formation of the bump-on-tail unstable electron beam. We find that when width of the Harris current sheet approaches and becomes smaller than the electron gyro-radius, quasi-linear relaxation becomes hampered and a positive slope in the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) persists. We explain this by the effects of non-conservation of electron magnetic moment, which, as recent works suggest, can maintain the positive slope of the VDF. In part, this can explain why some electron beams (the ones that interact with narrow magnetic holes with sharp boundaries, represented in our study by a Harris current sheet) in the solar wind travel much longer distances than predicted by the quasi-linear theory, at least in those cases when the electron beams slide along the current sheets that are abundant when the different-speed solar wind streams interact with each other.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02289" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation GRMHD Models of Accretion onto Stellar-Mass Black Holes: I.

These models apply an algorithm targeting direct solutions to the radiation transport equation in full general relativity and have been enabled by access to modern exascale computing systems. Super-Eddington accretion flows form geometrically thick radiation pressure supported disks that drive powerful equatorial outflows. A narrow funnel-shaped photosphere in the inner region results in very low radiative efficiencies in this regime. The structure of near- and sub-Eddington accretion depends on whether there is net vertical magnetic flux at the midplane of the disk. With net flux, the disk forms a thin, dense layer at the midplane surrounded by a magnetically-dominated corona, whereas without net flux the disk remains magnetically dominated everywhere. Although none of our models achieve the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) regime, those with net vertical flux and a rapidly spinning black hole still produce powerful relativistic jets. Our calculations adopt simple opacity models (with scalings appropriate to stellar-mass black hole accretion). We discuss the application of our results to observations of X-ray binaries and ultraluminous X-ray sources such as Cyg X-3 and SS433. We also speculate on the application of our super-Eddington models to the interpretation of little red dots (LRDs) recently discovered by JWST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-band Emission from Star-Disk Collision and Implications for Quasi-Periodic Eruptions</a><span class="id">[2506.11231]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform two-dimensional, multi-group radiation hydrodynamic simulations to explore the observational properties of a solar-like star colliding with an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole at separation of $\sim 100$ gravitational radii. We find that the star-disk collision produces ejecta on both sides of the disk. As the ejecta expand and cool, transient flares arise, reaching peak bolometric luminosity of up to $L\gtrsim10^{43}\rm erg~s^{-1}$. We estimate that the typical light curve rises and decays on an hour timescale. The spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks in $20-50$eV. The optical depth in soft X-rays is lower than the frequency-integrated optical depth, yielding $100$eV-$1$KeV luminosity $\nu L_{\nu}\gtrsim10^{42}\rm erg~s^{-1}$. The ejecta aligned with the star's incident direction shows breakout emission, leading to asymmetric SED evolution of the two ejecta. The SED evolution is roughly consistent with those seen in short-period quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), which have eruption duration ranging from sub-hour to hours, but the ejecta cooling emission alone may not be sufficient to explain the longer duration flares. Increasing incident velocity generally produces a brighter and harder flare. A larger disk scale height prolongs the breakout emission but leads to a somewhat softer SED. A higher disk surface density can lead to higher ejecta temperature, reducing bound-free opacity and increasing luminosity. When lowering the disk surface density, we find that the ejecta becomes optically thin when the scattering optical depth across disk is at the order of $\tau_{\rm disk}\sim200$, and the ejecta disappear when $\tau_{\rm disk}\sim10$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calibrating baryonic effects in cosmic shear with external data in the LSST era</a><span class="id">[2506.11943]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmological constraints derived from weak lensing (WL) surveys are limited by baryonic effects, which suppress the non-linear matter power spectrum on small scales. By combining WL measurements with data from external tracers of the gas around massive structures, it is possible to calibrate baryonic effects and, therefore, obtain more precise cosmological constraints. In this study, we generate mock data for a Stage-IV weak lensing survey such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), X-ray gas fractions, and stacked kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements, to jointly constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters describing baryonic effects (using the Baryon Correction Model - BCM). First, using WL data alone, we quantify the level to which the BCM parameters will need to be constrained to recover the cosmological constraints obtained under the assumption of perfect knowledge of baryonic feedback. We identify the most relevant baryonic parameters and determine that they must be calibrated to a precision of $\sim 10$-$20\%$ to avoid significant degradation of the fiducial WL constraints. We forecast that long-term X-ray data from $\sim 5000$ clusters should be able to reach this threshold for the parameters that characterise the abundance of hot virialised gas. Constraining the distribution of ejected gas presents a greater challenge, however, but we forecast that long-term kSZ data from a CMB-S4-like experiment should achieve the level of precision required for full self-calibration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00793" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timing and spectral studies of SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 with NICER, Einstein Probe, IXPE, NuSTAR, Insight-HXMT and INTEGRAL during its 2024 outburst</a><span class="id">[2507.00793]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 is a newly confirmed accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar and type I X-ray burster. We present the broadband X-ray timing and spectral behaviors of SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 during its 2024 outburst. The data were collected from NICER, Einstein Probe, IXPE, Insight-HXMT, NuSTAR and INTEGRAL observations. X-ray pulsations have been detected for the 1.5–90 keV energy range throughout the `ON' phase of the outburst from MJD $\sim 60355-60385$. We refined the orbital and spin ephemerides assuming a circular orbit, and found that the pulsar was in a spin-up state during MJD $\sim$ 60361–60377 showing a significant spin-up rate $\dot{\nu}$ of $(3.15\pm 0.36)\times10^{-13}~{\rm Hz~s^{-1}}$. Around MJD $\sim 60377$ a swing was detected in the spin evolution accompanied by significantly enhanced pulsed emission. We studied the pulse profile morphology during the X-ray bursts as observed by Insight-HXMT, IXPE and NuSTAR. During the bursts, pulsations were detected across the 2–60 keV with shapes broadly consistent with those observed for the persistent emission. We found, however, that the `burst' pulse profiles exhibit significant phase offsets relative to the pre- and post-burst profiles. These offsets systematically decrease with increasing energy, $\Delta \phi\approx0.15$, 0.11 and 0.02 for IXPE, Insight-HXMT ME and HE in 2–8, 5–30 and 20–60 keV, respectively, and $\Delta \phi \approx 0.21$, 0.10 and 0.07 for NuSTAR in 3–10, 20–35 and 35–60 keV, respectively, compared to the pre- and post-burst profiles. We performed a joint spectral analysis of quasi-simultaneous NICER, NuSTAR, and Insight-HXMT data for two epochs. The resulting spectra from both observations were consistent and well-described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model, nthcomp, plus relativistic reflection, relxillCp.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The star HIP 41378 potentially misaligned with its cohort of long-period planets</a><span class="id">[2507.01807]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The obliquity between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbit, detected via the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, is a tracer of the formation history of planetary systems.

We report the detection of the RM effect for the 19-hour-long transit of HIP 41378 f, a temperate giant planet on a 542-day orbit, observed through a worldwide spectroscopic campaign. We measure a slight projected obliquity of 21 $\pm$ 8 degrees and a significant 3D spin-orbit angle of 52 $\pm$ 6 degrees, based on the measurement of the stellar rotation period. HIP 41378 f is part of a 5-transiting planetary system with planets close to mean motion resonances. The observed misalignment likely reflects a primordial tilt of the stellar spin axis relative to the protoplanetary disk, rather than dynamical interactions. HIP 41378 f is the first non-eccentric long-period (P&gt;100 days) planet observed with the RM effect, opening new constraints on planetary formation theories.

Turbulent photospheric convection slowly displaces the footpoints of coronal field lines, causing them to become twisted and tangled. Magnetic stresses gradually build until reaching a breaking point when the field reconnects and releases a sudden burst of energy. We simulate this basic picture of nanoflares using a high-fidelity, three-dimensional, multi-stranded magnetohydrodynamic simulation that starts with a fully stratified atmosphere. This simulation includes the effects of field-aligned thermal conduction and optically thin radiation and uses the state-of-the-art Transition Region Adaptive Conduction (TRAC) method to capture the response of the plasma to the nanoflare heating. We find that our physical model supports a unified explanation for both the diffuse emission observed in active regions and the bright coronal loops. Specifically, our results suggest that the diffuse emission originates from spatially and temporally uncorrelated nanoflares, whereas coherent clusters of nanoflares - nanoflare storms - are responsible for the formation of bright coronal loops. Quantitative comparisons between the simulated emission and observed characteristics of coronal loops show that key observed properties - such as loop widths, lifetimes and cross sections - are reasonably well reproduced by the model. The idea that avalanche spread naturally leads to circular cross sections in coronal loops is strongly supported. Our results also suggest that phase differences in heating and cooling events across neighboring magnetic flux strands are a plausible explanation for the anomalous cross-field motions of coronal loops that were recently reported in high-resolution observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00471" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Encounter Rate of Open Star Clusters</a><span class="id">[2509.00471]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Probable past and future close encounters of open clusters with known characteristics over 64 million years have been calculated by integrating the orbits of cluster centers in the Galactic potential using the _galpy_ package.

Close encounters between open clusters with a significant age difference occur at a rate of 15 events per Myr.

It has been argued that pair beam instabilities disrupt the cascade, thus accounting for the observed lack of reprocessed GeV emission from TeV blazars. If true this would remove the need for a moderate strength intergalactic magnetic field to explain the observations. We find that the pair beam instability is suppressed if the beam is not perfectly collimated or monochromatic, hence the lower limit to the intergalactic magnetic field inferred from $\gamma$-ray observations of blazars is robust.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Which is which?

Identifying the two components of a binary system is a delicate operation that is often taken for granted. The labeling procedure (i.e., which is object &quot;1&quot; and which is object &quot;2&quot;) effectively acts as systematics, or, equivalently an unspecified prior, in gravitational-wave data inference. The common approach is to label the objects solely by their masses, on a sample-by-sample basis. We show that object identification can instead be tackled using the posterior distribution as a whole. We frame the problem in terms of constrained clustering – a flavor of semi-supervised machine learning – and find that unfolding the labeling systematics can significantly impact, and arguably improve, our interpretation of the data. In particular, the precision of black-hole spin measurements improves by up to 50%, multimodalities and tails tend to disappear, posteriors become closer to Gaussian distributions, and the identification of the nature of the object (i.e. black hole vs. neutron star) is facilitated. We estimate that about 10% of the LIGO/Virgo posterior samples are affected by this relabeling, i.e. they might have been attributed to the other compact object in the observed binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comparing strange and non-strange quark stars within resummed QCD at NLO</a><span class="id">[2501.14935]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We employ the renormalization group optimized perturbation theory (RGOPT) resummation method to evaluate the equation of state (EoS) for strange ($N_f=2+1$) and non-strange ($N_f=2$) cold quark matter at NLO.

Concretely, we consider a classically conformal dark sector with a hidden $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry that couples to the Standard Model via kinetic mixing. Since the PTA signal requires a phase transition in the MeV temperature range, spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to a sub-GeV dark matter candidate that couples to the Standard Model via a dark photon mediator and obtains its relic abundance via annihilations into electrons and dark Higgs bosons. Such a scenario is tightly constrained by laboratory searches for dark photons and cosmological constraints on the decays of dark Higgs bosons after the phase transition. We show that viable parameter regions can be found both for the case that the dark Higgs bosons remain in equilibrium with the Standard Model and that they decouple and only decay much later. In the latter case, the parameter regions preferred by the PTA signal and the dark matter relic abundance can be fully explored by future beam-dump experiments searching for missing energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">90.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02708" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signatures of Einstein-Maxwell dilaton-axion gravity from the observed quasi-periodic oscillations in black holes</a><span class="id">[2503.02708]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>String-inspired models are often believed to provide an interesting framework for quantum gravity and force unification with promising prospects to resolve issues like dark matter and dark energy which cannot be satisfactorily incorporated within the framework of general relativity (GR). The goal of the present work is to investigate the role of the Einstein-Maxwell dilaton-axion (EMDA) gravity arising in the low energy effective action of the heterotic string theory in explaining astrophysical observations, in particular, the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in the power spectrum of black holes. EMDA gravity has interesting cosmological implications and hence it is worthwhile to explore the footprints of such a theory in available astrophysical observations. This requires one to study the stationary, axi-symmetric black hole solution in EMDA gravity, which corresponds to the Kerr-Sen spacetime. Such black holes are endowed with a dilatonic charge while the rotation is sourced from the axionic field. We investigate the orbital and epicyclic frequencies of matter rotating in the Kerr-Sen spacetime and consider eleven well-studied QPO models in this work. We compare the model dependent QPO frequencies with the available observations of five BH sources, namely, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1915+105, H 143+322, GRO J1655-40 and Sgr A*. Our analysis provides constrains on the spins of the aforesaid black holes which when compared with previous estimates enables us to understand the observationally favored QPO models for each of these sources. Further, from the current data the EMDA scenario cannot be ruled out in favor of general relativity. We comment on the implications and limitations of our finding and how the present constrains compare with the existing literature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generalized relativistic second-order dissipative hydrodynamics: coupling different rank tensors</a><span class="id">[2503.18839]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we extend the formalism of second-order relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics, developed previously using Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator formalism.

We characterize particle-turbulence interactions via the gyro radii of particles and their experienced field-line curvatures, which reveals two distinct transport modes: magnetized motion, where particles are tightly bound to strong coherent flux tubes and undergo large-scale mirroring; and unmagnetized motion characterized by chaotic scattering through weak and highly tangled regions of the magnetic field. We formulate an effective stochastic process for each mode: compound subdiffusion with long mean free paths for magnetized motion, and a Langevin process with short mean free paths for unmagnetized motion. A combined stochastic walker that alternates between these two modes accurately reproduces the mean squared displacements observed in the test-particle data.

We use LIGO data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run. The searches target two distinct types of BHs and use two new semicoherent methods: hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking for the remnant BHs of the mergers GW230814_230901 and GW231123_135430 (referred to as GW230814 and GW231123 in this study), and a dedicated method using the Band Sampled Data (BSD) framework for the galactic BH in the Cygnus X-1 binary system. Without finding evidence of a signal from vector bosons in the data, we estimate the mass range that can be constrained. For the HMM searches targeting the remnants from GW231123 and GW230814, we disfavor vector boson masses in the ranges $[0.94, 1.08]$ and $[2.75, 3.28] \times 10^{-13}$ eV, respectively, at 30% confidence, assuming a 1% false alarm probability. Although these searches are only marginally sensitive to signals from merger remnants at relatively large distances, future observations are expected to yield more stringent constraints with high confidence. For the BSD search targeting the BH in Cygnus X-1, we exclude vector boson masses in the range $[0.85, 1.59] \times 10^{-13}$ eV at 95% confidence, assuming an initial BH spin larger than 0.5.</p></div></details></article></body>
