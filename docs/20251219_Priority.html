In the contrast of our previous studies, where we first assumed some specific spatial distribution of DM component and looked at how it agrees with data, here we solve, in some sense, the inverse problem: we search for distribution, in a mathematical way, which satisfies observational data. A unique algorithm has been implemented which, using linear algebra and adaptive grid methods, adjusts distribution to the data. It allows telling in principle whether or not is possible to solve PA problem by variation of spatial distribution of DM sources. A positive result has been formally obtained. A class of solutions can be identified. Though the distributions obtained at the chosen injection spectra may seem slightly realistic, nonetheless it demonstrates a quite powerful possibility in explaining PA that could be realized in more realistic models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milky Way disc &amp; Bulge in situ populations: ESO white paper - Expanding horizons call</a><span class="id">[2512.15812]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formation and evolution of the Milky Way's disc, bar, and bulge remain fundamentally limited by the lack of a contiguous, Galaxy-wide, high-precision chemo-dynamical map. Key open questions - including the survival or destruction of the primitive discs, the origin of the bulge's multi-component structure, the role of mergers and secular processes, and the coupling between stellar chemistry, dynamics, and the Galactic potential - cannot be fully resolved with current or planned facilities. Existing spectroscopic surveys provide either high resolution for small samples or wide coverage at insufficient resolution and depth, and none can obtain homogeneous abundances, precise 3D kinematics, and reliable ages for the millions of stars required, particularly in the obscured midplane, the far side of the bar, or the outer, low-density disc. A new wide-field, massively multiplexed, large-aperture spectroscopic facility, capable of both high- and low-resolution spectroscopy over tens of thousands of square degrees, is therefore essential. Such a facility would deliver the statistical power, sensitivity, and completeness needed to reconstruct the Galaxy's assembly history, constrain its gravitational potential, and establish the Milky Way as the definitive benchmark for galaxy evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15817" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sailing to the next safe harbour in our trip to the early Universe: The massive star population of metal-poor galaxies</a><span class="id">[2512.15817]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Very metal-poor massive stars in the Local Group are our best proxies for the Universe's first stars, making them essential for modeling reionization and early galactic chemical evolution. Studying such stars in our Local Universe is key to extrapolating our knowledge to more distant regions, where individual massive stars cannot be resolved but are dynamically and chemically shaping their environments. The MUSE integral field spectrograph has transformed massive star studies in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds, but resolving star-forming galaxies containing very metal-poor stars is at the limit of the current field of view and sensitivity. Therefore, only small dedicated efforts of selected regions are studied, providing us with snapshots of low-metallicity massive stars rather than a comprehensive picture. This scarcity is a major bottleneck for understanding and sufficiently modelling the evolution and feedback of massive stars across cosmic time. We therefore envision a new generation of panoramic integral-field spectrographs and high multiplex multi-object spectrographs mounted on dedicated large optical telescopes. Such facilities will not only allow to resolve very-metal-pool galaxies, but further enable the systematic exploration of the massive stellar content across the entire Local Group, thereby reaching a new era in massive star studies and understanding.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15836" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Builds and Quenches the Most Massive Galaxies in the Early Universe?</a><span class="id">[2512.15836]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The first few billion years of cosmic history witnessed the rapid emergence of the most massive galaxies, yet their true space density, baryon assembly pathways, and early quenching mechanisms remain poorly constrained. Current surveys lack the wide-field, rest-frame FIR sensitivity needed to obtain a complete census of massive systems and to trace their cold gas, dust, and diffuse emission on galactic and circumgalactic scales. A next-generation facility with a very large aperture, wide field of view, and high mapping speed is essential to carry out deep, degree-scale rest-frame FIR surveys. Such capabilities are required to determine how common massive galaxies are, how they assemble their baryons, and what physical processes drive their early transformation and quenching.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15841" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxies as stochastic systems: why the next breakthrough in galaxy evolution requires one hundred million spectra</a><span class="id">[2512.15841]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Each galaxy is observed only once along its life, making galaxy evolution fundamentally an inverse statistical problem: time-dependent physics must be inferred from ensembles of single-epoch snapshots. To move beyond descriptive scaling relations toward physical regulation mechanisms of star formation, quenching, chemical enrichment and black hole growth, galaxies must be treated as realizations of a stochastic process whose hyper-parameters (e.g., correlation timescales, burstiness, duty cycles) are inferred hierarchically. This demands both depth and scale: continuum S/N sufficient for absorption-line ages and chemistry, and samples far larger than those in SDSS, DESI, 4MOST or MOONS, which provide either depth or size but not both across $0&lt;z&lt;3$. Once the relevant axes of mass, redshift, environment, structure and evolutionary phase are populated, the requirement naturally rises from $10^7$ to $\sim10^8$ galaxies. This is the regime where stochastic hyper-parameters can be well constrained and where comparisons to simulations and cosmological forward models become limited by theory rather than observations. We outline the science enabled by such a programme and the corresponding requirements for a future ESO wide-field spectroscopic facility capable of delivering tens to hundreds of millions of rest-UV-optical spectra over $0\lesssim z\lesssim3$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From &quot;The Cliff&quot; to &quot;Virgil&quot;: Mapping the Spectral Diversity of Little Red Dots with JWST/NIRSpec</a><span class="id">[2512.15853]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of JWST's most unexpected discoveries is the emergence of &quot;Little Red Dots” (LRDs): compact sources at $z \gtrsim 3$ with blue rest-frame UV continua, red optical slopes, and broad Balmer emission lines that challenge standard models and suggest a population of early, unusual active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Using a comprehensive photometric selection and public NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy across six JWST deep fields, we identify a large sample of 118 LRDs with high-S/N spectra, enabling a population-wide analysis of their UV–optical continuum and emission lines. We find clear correlations between rest-frame color ([0.3-0.9 $\mu$m]) and slopes: bluer LRDs have blue UV slopes ($\beta_{\nu,\mathrm{UV}} \sim 0.3$) and red optical slopes, while redder LRDs exhibit redder UV slopes ($\beta_{\nu,\mathrm{UV}} \sim 1.1$). The continuum shape shows a similar trend: redder LRDs display prominent Balmer breaks and curvature, while bluer LRDs follow power-law-like optical SEDs. From literature compilations, $\sim$60% of known broad-line AGNs satisfy our LRD criteria, and up to 90% of LRDs show broad Balmer lines. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a shift from high H$_{\alpha}$/H$_{\beta}$ and low [OIII]$\lambda5007$/H$_{\beta}$ in redder LRDs to the opposite in bluer ones, along with stronger narrow-line equivalent widths, suggesting a transition from AGN- to host-dominated emission. We fit the spectra with a two-component model combining a gas-enshrouded black hole (BH) and a galaxy host. Redder LRDs require higher-luminosity, unreddened BHs and modestly reddened hosts; bluer LRDs require lower-luminosity, reddened BHs and dust-free galaxies. This framework reproduces the diversity in colors and spectral shape by varying BH luminosity, obscuration, and host-to-BH luminosity ratio.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The AIDA-TNG project: dark matter profiles and concentrations in alternative dark matter models</a><span class="id">[2512.15869]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) scenario, the density profiles of dark matter haloes are well described by analytical models linking their concentration to halo mass. Alternative scenarios, such as warm dark matter (WDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), modify the inner structure of haloes and predict different profile shapes and central slopes. We employ the AIDA-TNG simulations to investigate how alternative dark matter physics and baryonic processes jointly shape the internal structure of haloes. Using dark-matter-only and full-physics runs, we measure the dark matter density profiles of haloes spanning six orders of magnitude in mass, from 10^9.5 Msun to 10^14.5 Msub, and characterise them with multiple analytical models. We provide the distribution of the best-fitting parameters, as well as the concentration-mass relation in WDM and SIDM. The Einasto profile well reproduces the inner flattening produced in WDM models, both in the collisionless and in the full-physics runs. In SIDM dark-matter-only runs, haloes are better described by explicitly cored profiles, with core sizes that depend on mass and on the self-interaction model. When baryons are included, the differences between CDM and SIDM decrease, and such large dark-matter cores no longer form because adiabatic contraction in the baryon-dominated region counteracts self-interactions. Nevertheless, the coupling between baryons and self-interactions induces a broader range of inner slopes, including cases that are steeper than CDM at Milky Way masses. Alternative dark matter physics thus leaves clear signatures in the inner halo structure, even if baryons significantly reshape these differences. Our results are useful for future studies that need to predict the properties of haloes in multiple dark matter models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shedding the envelope: JWST reveals a kiloparsec-scale [OIII]-weak Balmer shell around a z=7.64 quasar</a><span class="id">[2512.15881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Luminous quasars at the redshift frontier z&gt;7 serve as stringent probes of super-massive black hole formation and they are thought to undergo much of their growth obscured by dense gas and dust in their host galaxies. Fully characterizing the symbiotic evolution of SMBHs and hosts requires rest-frame optical observations that span spatial scales from the broad-line region to the ISM and CGM. JWST now provides the necessary spatially resolved spectroscopy to do so. But the physical conditions that regulate the interplay between SMBHs and their hosts at the highest redshifts, especially the nature of early feedback phases, remain unclear. We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of J0313$-$1806 at z=7.64, the most distant luminous quasar known. From the restframe optical spectrum of the unresolved quasar, we derive a black hole mass of $M_\mathrm{BH}=(1.63 \pm 0.10)\times10^9 M_\odot$ based on H$\beta$ and an Eddington rate of $\lambda=L/L_\mathrm{Edd}=0.80\pm 0.05$, consistent with previous MgII-based estimates. J0313-1806 exhibits no detectable [O III] emission on nuclear scales. Most remarkably, we detect an ionized gas shell extending out to $\sim 1.8$ kpc traced by H$\beta$ emission that also lacks any significant [O III], with a $3\sigma$ upper limit on the [O III]$ \lambda$5007 to H$\beta$ flux ratio of $\log_{10} \left( F(\mathrm{[OIII]})/F(\mathrm{H}\beta)\right)=-1.15$. Through photoionization modelling, we demonstrate that the extended emission is consistent with a thin, clumpy outflowing shell where [OIII] is collisionally de-excited by dense gas. We interpret this structure as a fossil remnant of a recent blowout phase, providing evidence for episodic feedback cycles in one of the earliest quasars. These findings suggest that dense ISM phases may play a crucial role in shaping the spectral properties of quasars accross cosmic time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15883" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The AIDA-TNG project: abundance, radial distribution, and clustering properties of halos in alternative dark matter models</a><span class="id">[2512.15883]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Warm and self-interactive dark matter cosmologies have been proposed as non-baryonic solutions to the tensions between the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model and observations at the kpc scale. In this paper, we use the dark matter-only runs of the \textsc{aida-tng} project, a set of cosmological simulations of different sizes and resolutions, to analyze the macroscopic impact of alternative dark matter models on the abundance, the radial distribution and the clustering properties of halos. We adopt the halo occupation distribution formalism to characterize the evolution of its parameters $M_1$ and $\alpha$ with the mass and redshift selection of our sample. By dividing the halo population into central and satellites, we are able to study their spatial density profile, finding that a Navarro-Frenk-White model is not accurate enough to describe the radial distribution of subhalos, and that a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White model is required instead. Warm dark matter models, in particular, present a cuspier distribution of satellites, whereas self-interacting dark matter exhibits a shallower density profile. Moreover, we find that the small-scale clustering of dark matter halos provides a powerful tool to discriminate between alternative dark matter scenarios, in preparation for a more detailed study that fully incorporates baryonic effects, and for a comparison with observational data from galaxy clustering.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cored galaxies in cuspy dark matter halos</a><span class="id">[2512.15886]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate constraints on the inner stellar density profile from photometric data of dwarf spheroidal and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Our aim is to clarify under what conditions cored stellar profiles require dark matter halos that are also cored, deviating from the cuspy profiles expected for cold dark matter halos. We consider a variety of spherically symmetric stellar profiles, which we classify as &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;weak&quot; cores and cusps according to the behavior of the slope ($b_0$) and logarithmic slope ($\gamma_0$) at their centers. We explore which profiles lead to unphysical negative distribution functions when embedded in a cuspy halo, treating isotropic and anisotropic kinematics separately. We find that weakly-cored stellar profiles in 3D (i.e., $b_0 \neq 0$, $\gamma_0=0$) can be consistent with cuspy dark matter profiles, but strong 3D cores ($b_0=\gamma_0=0$) are not. However, both weak and strong 3D cores yield nearly indistinguishable inner profiles in projection, which implies that ruling out a dark matter cusp from photometric data alone is highly challenging. As an example, we study the profiles of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and find that they are consistent with both weak and strong 3D cores. This is not just a result of the limited numbers of stars in these systems, since we reach the same conclusion even for Fornax, one of the most luminous and best-studied dwarf spheroidal companions of the Milky Way. We conclude that, based on current data and analysis techniques, cored surface density profiles in nearby dwarf galaxies cannot be taken as strong evidence against the presence of cuspy dark matter halos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15888" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational constraints on the origin of the elements.

This network will be part of the Stellar Abundances and atmospheric Parameters Pipeline (SAPP), which will analyse 4 million stars during the five year long 4MOST consortium 4: MIlky way Disc And BuLgE High-Resolution (4MIDABLE-HR) survey. A fitting algorithm using this ANN is also presented that is able to fully-automatically and self-consistently derive both stellar parameters and elemental abundances. The ANN is validated by fitting 121 observed spectra of low-mass FGKM type stars, including main-sequence dwarf, subgiant and giant stars down to [Fe/H] $\approx -3.4$ degraded to 4MOST-HR resolution, and comparing the derived abundances with the output of the classical radiative transfer code TSFitPy. We are able to recover all 18 elemental abundances with a bias &lt;0.13 and spread &lt;0.16 dex, although the typical values are &lt;0.09 dex for most elements. These abundances are compared to the OMEGA+ Galactic Chemical Evolution model, showcasing for the first time, the expected performance and results obtained from high-resolution spectra of the quality expected to be obtained with 4MOST. The expected Galactic trends are recovered, and we highlight the potential of using many chemical elements to constrain the formation history of the Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Next Generation Fornax Survey (NGFS).VIII. A Support Vector Machine Approach for Disentangling Globular Clusters from other Sources</a><span class="id">[2512.15895]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Wide-field, multi-band surveys now detect millions of unresolved sources in nearby galaxy clusters, yet separating globular clusters (GCs) from foreground stars and background galaxies remains challenging. Scalable, automated classification is therefore essential to convert the forthcoming data from facilities such as the Vera C. Rubin/LSST, the Roman and Euclid into robust constraints on galaxy assembly. We introduce a supervised classification method to separate GCs, stars, and galaxies based on their locations in color-color diagrams. The main objective is to recover a clean GC sample for future scientific analysis. The method exploits broad spectral energy distribution coverage, deep photometry, and is optimized for next-generation survey volumes. We use the central 3deg2 of the Next Generation Fornax Survey (NGFS), which images the Fornax cluster in u'g'i'JKs. We build a Support Vector Machine (SVM; this http URL , scikit-learn) using 15 features: all color combinations and basic morphological parameters. Spectroscopically confirmed sources define the training classes. Color pairs connecting near-UV/optical/near-IR. The full 15 feature model achieves 97.3% accuracy and a pruned 7 feature model built from the most informative, least correlated features achieves 96.6% accuracy. Misclassifications amount 8.4% and 10.4%, respectively. Omitting the u' or/and near-IR bands degrades performance. Emulating LSST filters with NGFS u'g'i' and DES r'z'Y shows that u' and Y bands are crucial, but models lacking NIR remain suboptimal. Combining broad SED coverage with simple morphological parameters enables precise, scalable separation of unresolved sources. Including NIR bands significantly improves GC classification, and joining LSST with forthcoming Euclid and Roman data will further enhance machine-learning frameworks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dust evolution across cosmic times as seen through DUSTY-GAEA</a><span class="id">[2512.15902]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For many decades, dust has been recognised as an important ingredient in galaxy formation and evolution. This paper presents a novel self-consistent implementation of dust formation by stars, destruction by supernova shocks and hot gas, and growth within the dense interstellar medium (ISM) in the GAEA state-of-the-art galaxy formation model. Our new model, DUSTY-GAEA, reproduces well the dust buildup as a function of stellar mass out to z $\sim$ 6, the scaling relations between the dust-to-gas/dust-to-metal ratios and stellar mass/metallicty in the local Universe, and the dust mass function in the local Universe and out to z $\sim$ 1. In the framework of our model, dust growth dominates the cosmic dust budget out to z $\sim$ 8, and we find that observational constraints beyond the local Universe can be reproduced only assuming such efficient dust growth in the dense ISM. Yet, reproducing the estimated number densities of dust-rich galaxies at higher redshifts remains challenging, as found also in independent theoretical work. We discuss our model predictions in comparison with both observational data and independent theoretical efforts, and highlight how further observational constraints at high redshifts would help constrain dust models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Binarity Beyond Gaia: The case for a dedicated spectroscopic survey of binary stars</a><span class="id">[2512.15904]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar multiplicity is a fundamental ingredient of stellar astrophysics, yet binary statistics across the Galaxy remain poorly constrained. The \emph{Gaia} mission has revolutionised binary star astrophysics by delivering high-precision astrometry, photometry and global radial velocities, and by providing hundreds of thousands of non-single-star solutions in DR3. However, the RVS magnitude limit, mission time span and scanning law impose strong selection effects in period, mass ratio, inclination and semi-amplitude, leaving large regions of the binary parameter space either sparsely sampled or effectively inaccessible. In this white paper we outline the case for a dedicated, wide-field, multi-epoch spectroscopic survey explicitly optimised for binary science: deeper than the \emph{Gaia} RVS limit, with flexible cadence from hours to years, and with moderate to high spectral resolution. Using a simplified forward model of \emph{Gaia} DR5-like performance, we highlight the populations for which robust orbital solutions will be rare (ultra short period, very long period, low-amplitude and compact-object binaries), and show how a “Binarity Beyond \emph{Gaia}” survey would fill these gaps. Such a programme would deliver a bias correctable census of stellar multiplicity across the Milky Way and provide the spectroscopic backbone needed to exploit binary samples from \emph{Rubin}/LSST, \emph{Roman} and \emph{LISA}.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Era of Binary Supermassive Black Holes: Coordination of Nanohertz-Frequency Gravitational-Wave Follow-up</a><span class="id">[2512.15911]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Here we summarize discussions and conclusions from the conference “The Era of Binary Supermassive Black Holes: Coordination of Nanohertz-Frequency Gravitational-Wave Follow-up,” held at the Aspen Center for Physics from February 2-7, 2025.

We present the results of a hot core survey toward 30 massive protostellar objects in the LMC using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 350 GHz. Continuum imaging reveals 36 compact sources in total, among which line analyses identify 9 hot cores and 1 hot-core candidate, including two newly identified sources. We detect CO, HCO+, H13CO+, HC15N, HC3N, SiO, SO, SO+, NS, SO2, 34SO2, 33SO2, CH3OH, 13CH3OH, HCOOH, HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, H2CCO (tentative), and hydrogen recombination lines from hot cores. CH3OCH3, a complex organic molecule larger than CH3OH, is detected for the first time in a hot core outside the LMC bar region. All hot cores show stronger emission in the high-excitation SO line compared to non-hot-core sources, suggesting that its strong detection will be useful for identifying hot-core candidates in the LMC. Chemical analysis reveals a spread of more than two orders of magnitude in CH3OH abundances, with some sources deficient in COMs. In contrast, SO2 is detected in all hot cores, and its abundance shows a good correlation with rotational temperature. The hot cores without CH3OH detections are all located outside the LMC bar region and are characterized by either high luminosity or active star formation in their surroundings. A combination of locally low metallicity, active star formation in the vicinity, and high protostellar luminosity may jointly trigger the COM-poor hot core chemistry observed in the LMC.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15991" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASKAP discovery of a 30 kpc bipolar outflow from the edge-on disk of the nearby spiral galaxy ESO 130-G012</a><span class="id">[2512.15991]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the discovery of a large-scale, limb-brightened outflow, extending at least 30 kpc above and below the star-forming disk of the edge-on galaxy ESO 130-G012 (D = 16.9 Mpc). Partially obscured by Galactic foreground stars and dust, this optically unremarkable, low-mass galaxy reveals one of the largest known hourglass-shaped outflows from the full extent of its bright stellar disk. The outflow was discovered in 944 MHz radio continuum images from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) obtained as part of the &quot;Evolutionary Map of the Universe&quot; (EMU) project. Its height is at least 3x that of the stellar disk diameter ( 10 kpc), while its shape and size most resemble the large biconical, edge-brightened FUV and X-ray outflows in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 3079. The large-scale, hourglass-shaped outflow of ESO 130-G012 appears to be hollow and originates from the star-forming disk, expanding into the halo with speeds close to the escape velocity before likely returning to the disk. Given ESO 130-G012's modest star formation rate, the height of the outflow is surprising and unusual, likely made possible by the galaxy's relatively low gravitational potential.

Accretion rate of a low-mass Class 0 protostar, measured via mid-infrared fluorescent OH emission</a><span class="id">[2512.15999]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The earliest stages of star formation are highlighted by complex interactions between accretion, outflow, and radiative processes, which shape the chemical and physical environment of the emerging protostar. James Webb Space Telescope observations of the low-mass, low-luminosity Class 0 protostar IRAS 16253-2429 reveal a central compact source. This object exhibits a rich mid-infrared emission spectrum of OH pure rotational lines and $\rm CO_2$ ro-vibrational lines. Unusually for a young stellar object, it has no mid-infrared line emission from $\rm H_2O$ to match the other molecules. We demonstrate that the emitting OH molecules arise from UV photodissociation of $\rm H_2O$ in its second absorption band at $\lambda = 114-145$ nm, and that the OH emission is a fluorescent cascade starting with highest-excitation rotational states. This situation offers the opportunity of using the infrared OH spectrum to measure the UV flux from the central protostar. Thereby we determine the disk-star accretion rate to be $3 \times 10^{-10} \ M_\sun \ {\rm year^{-1}}$, and demonstrate that the system luminosity arises mostly from the protostar's photosphere rather than from accretion luminosity. The result is in accord with the measured outflow rate of IRAS 16253-2429 and lies within the outflow/accretion-flow rate trend often inferred for protostars; and with episodic accretion as the dominant mechanism by which this protostar has grown.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LSTM-MDNz: Estimating Quasar Photometric Redshifts with an LSTM-Augmented Mixture Density Network</a><span class="id">[2512.16010]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quasar photometric redshifts are essential for studying cosmology and large-scale structures. However, their complex spectral energy distributions cause significant redshift-color degeneracy, limiting the accuracy of traditional methods. To overcome this, we introduce LSTM-MDNz, a novel end-to-end deep learning model combining long short-term memory networks (LSTM) with mixture density networks (MDN). The model directly uses multi-band photometric fluxes and associated errors as wavelength-ordered sequential inputs, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering while enabling simultaneous point estimation and probability distribution function (PDF) prediction of quasar redshifts. We integrate data from four major sky surveys-SDSS, DESI-LS, WISE, and GALEX-to assemble a sample of over 550,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars ($0 \leq z_{\mathrm{spec}} \leq 5$) across 14 ultraviolet to infrared bands for model training and testing. Experimental results show that using all 14 bands yields optimal performance, with a normalized median absolute deviation ($\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$) of 0.037 and an outlier rate ($f_{\mathrm{out}}$) of 3.5\% on the test set. These values represent reductions of 29\% and 56\%, respectively, compared to the commonly adopted SDSS+WISE band set. Probability integral transform ($\mathrm{PIT}$) and continuous ranked probability score ($\mathrm{CRPS}$) analyses confirm that the predicted PDFs align closely with the true redshift distribution. Band-ablation experiments further highlight the essential role of ultraviolet and infrared data in alleviating color degeneracy and reducing systematic bias. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-band fusion in improving quasar photo-z accuracy and offers a ready-to-use estimation framework for future surveys like LSST, CSST, and Euclid.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astrometric and Spectroscopic Analysis of IC 2714: An Open Cluster Hosting a Lithium-Rich Giant</a><span class="id">[2512.16042]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Open clusters serve as laboratories to study and evaluate stellar evolution and Galactic chemical evolution models. Chemical peculiarities, such as lithium-rich giants, are rarely observed in these stellar systems. This work focuses on eight red giants (#005, #028, #034, #053, #087, #121, #126, and #190) previously reported as members of the Galactic cluster IC 2714. We conducted a detailed investigation using high-resolution spectroscopy, supplemented with data from the Gaia DR3 catalog. Besides deriving the cluster's fundamental parameters, we provide the most thorough chemical characterization of IC 2714 to date, reporting the abundance of 23 species, including light elements (Li, C, N, O), odd-Z elements (Na, Al), $\alpha$-elements (Si, Ca, Ti, Mg), iron-peak elements (Sc, Cr, Ni), $\textit{s}$-process-dominated elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd) and $\textit{r}$-process elements (Sm, Eu). We also present the carbon isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C for the first time for seven stars. One particular star (#087) exhibits a high lithium abundance ($\log \varepsilon$(Li)$_{\rm NLTE}$ = $+$1.54 dex) and a slightly higher projected rotational velocity ($v \sin i$ = 6.7 km s$^{-1}$). Our results suggest that the analyzed stars are in the core-helium-burning phase of evolution, where the most lithium-rich giants are found. Combining astrometric probabilities and chemical abundances, we conclude that two giants (#028 and #034) might not be cluster members.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16049" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gas Accretion from a Neighbouring Galaxy Fuels the Low-luminosity AGN in NGC 4278</a><span class="id">[2512.16049]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>How a seemingly `dead' host galaxy provides fuel for its active galactic nuclei (AGN) remains an unresolved problem.

From the observation, we found that external gas accretion from a neighbouring galaxy fuels the low-luminosity AGN in NGC 4278 through tidal interactions. The accreted gas entering NGC 4278 exhibits a rotating gas disk. And the accreted galaxy has been gas-poor and has an HI to stellar mass ratio of about 0.02.

But before we can time them, or VLBI them, we must first find them. Here, we describe the considerations and strategies one needs to account for when planning an all-sky blind pulsar survey using the SKA. Based on our understanding of the pulsar population, the performance of the now-under-construction SKA elements, and practical constraints such as evading radio frequency interference, we project pulsar survey yields using two complementary methods for a number of illustrative survey designs, combining SKA1-Low and SKA1-Mid Bands 1 and 2 in a variety of ways. A composite survey using both Mid and Low is optimal, with Mid Band 2 focused in the plane. We find that, given its much higher effective area and survey speed, the best strategy is to use SKA1-Low to cover as much sky as possible, ideally also overlapping with the areas covered by Mid. In our most realistic scenario, we find that an all-sky blind survey with Phase 1 of the SKA with the AA* array assembly will detect $\sim10,000$ slow pulsars and $\sim 800$ millisecond pulsars (MSPs) if SKA1-Mid covers the region within $5°$ of the plane, while higher latitudes will be covered with SKA1-Low. The yield with AA4 is $\sim 20\%$ higher. One could increase these numbers by increasing the range covered by SKA1-Mid Bands 1 and 2, at the cost of a considerably longer survey. The pulsar census will enable us to set new constraints on the uncertain physical properties of the entire neutron star population. This will be crucial for addressing major SKA science questions including the dense-matter equation of state, strong-field gravity tests, and gravitational wave astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16154" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsars in Globular Clusters With the SKAO</a><span class="id">[2512.16154]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Because of their extreme stellar densities, globular clusters are highly efficient factories of X-ray binaries and radio pulsars: per unit of stellar mass, they contain about 1000 times more of these exotic objects. Thus far, 345 radio pulsars have been found in globular clusters. These can be used as precision probes of the structure, gas content, magnetic field, and dynamic history of their host clusters; some of them are also highly interesting in their own right because they probe exotic stellar evolution scenarios as well as the physics of dense matter, accretion, and gravity; one of them (PSR J0514$-$4002E) might even be the first pulsar - black hole system known. Deep searches with SKA-MID and SKA-LOW will only require one to a few tied-array beams, and can be done during early commissioning of the telescope, before an all-sky pulsar survey using hundreds to thousands of tied-array beams is feasible. Even a conservative approach predicts new discoveries only with the core of SKA-MID AA*, and the full AA* and eventually AA4 is expected to increase the number of discoveries even more, leading to more than doubling the current known population. This offers a great opportunity for early SKAO pulsar science, even before all the collecting area is in place. On the other hand, a more optimistic prediction calls for a 4-5 times growth of the population, leading to a total of about 1700 pulsars to be detectable with SKA-MID AA4 configuration in all Galactic GCs visible by SKA telescopes. Thus, a dedicated search for pulsars in globular clusters will fully exploit the best possible natural laboratories to study many branches of physics and astrophysics, including properties of dense matter, stellar evolution, and the dynamical history of the Galactic globular cluster systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the magnetic field structure of the Milky Way with pulsars in the SKA era</a><span class="id">[2512.16159]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The magnetic field structure of the Milky Way can offer critical insights into the origin of galactic magnetic fields. Measurements of magnetic structures of the Milky Way are still sparse in far regions of the Galactic disk and halo. Pulsars are the best probes for the three-dimensional structure of the Galactic magnetic field, primarily owing to their highly polarized short-duration radio pulses, negligible intrinsic Faraday rotation compared to the contribution from the medium in front, and their widespread distribution throughout the Galaxy across the thin disk, spiral arms, and extended halo. In this article, we give an overview of Galactic magnetic field investigation using pulsars. The sensitive SKA1 design baseline (AA4) will increase the number of known pulsars by a factor of around three, and the initial staged delivery array (AA*) will probably double the total number of the current pulsar population. Polarization observations of pulsars with the AA* telescopes will give rotation measures along several thousand lines of sight, enabling detailed exploration of the magnetic structure of both the Galactic disk and the Galactic halo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling the properties and origin of massive quenched galaxies at $z\ge2$ in the COLIBRE hydrodynamical simulations</a><span class="id">[2512.16208]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST has uncovered a substantial population of Massive ($M_{\star} \gtrsim 10^{10 }\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$), Quenched Galaxies (MQGs) in the early Universe ($z \gtrsim 2$), whose properties challenge current galaxy formation models. In this paper, we examine this population of MQGs within the new COLIBRE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We report number densities and stellar mass functions in broad agreement with the latest observations. The predicted quenching and formation timescales are qualitatively consistent with observational inferences. Leveraging the state-of-the-art physics in COLIBRE, the model predicts that MQGs have dust and $\rm H_{2}$ fractions more than $1$ dex lower than their massive star-forming counterparts; while their sizes and kinematics remain broadly similar. We further explore the processes driving galaxies to become massive and quenched in COLIBRE, identifying active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback as the primary quenching mechanism. Compared to star-forming galaxies of similar mass, MQGs host more massive black holes (BHs) and exhibit higher star formation efficiencies. These differences arise from their environments, particularly at local ($\rm 0.3\,cMpc$) to intermediate scales ($\rm 1.0\,cMpc$) before quenching, where overdense regions are associated with enhanced gas inflows, higher BH accretion and, hence, feedback power. We find that about $55\%$ of MQGs survive as the main progenitors of $z=0$ galaxies when they are selected at $z=3$, although up to $55\%$ experience rejuvenation episodes. Our results provide robust predictions for MQGs, show that tensions with observations are reduced when an effective observational uncertainty is forward-modelled, and clarify the mechanisms behind their origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infrared SED Modeling of Velocity-Excess Maser Sources: Identifying Incipient Water-Fountain Candidates</a><span class="id">[2512.16209]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigated whether &quot;velocity excess&quot; in circumstellar maser lines can diagnose the earliest evolutionary phases of Water Fountains (WFs). Here we define &quot;velocity excess&quot; as maser emission (e.g., H$_2$O 22.235 GHz or OH 1665/1667 MHz) detected at velocities outside the velocity range of the OH 1612 MHz line, which traces the terminal expansion velocity of a spherical circumstellar envelope (CSE). Such excess velocities serve as an indicator of gas motions deviating from spherical expansion and may signify the onset of asymmetric outflows. Based on recent studies (Fan et al.2024; Xie et al.2025), we analyzed 17 sources showing velocity excess and fitted their infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with the one-dimensional radiative transfer code DUSTY. Seven sources are well reproduced, implying outer CSEs that remain nearly spherical despite inner asymmetries. Among these, five exhibit single-peaked, AGB-like SEDs and two show double-peaked, post-AGB-like profiles. IRAS variability indices and NEOWISE-R light curves reveal pulsations ( 600-1000 days) in three sources, supporting their AGB classification. Considering the magnitude of the velocity excess, two objects-IRAS 19229+1708 and IRAS 19052+0922-may represent the earliest or incipient WF phase, in which asymmetric outflows are beginning to emerge within otherwise spherical envelopes. These results support a morphological sequence in which bipolar jets and tori arise first in the central regions while the outer CSE remains spherical, and they show that selecting WF candidates via velocity excess effectively identifies objects at the onset of jet formation and early morphological transformation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMA and JWST Identification of Faint Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies up to z 8</a><span class="id">[2512.16215]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We exploit a new sample of around 400 bright dusty galaxies from the ALMA CHAMPS Large Program, together with the rich JWST multi-band data products in the COSMOS field, to explore and validate new selection methods for identifying dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs).

Two decades ago, the concept of halo quenching was introduced as a dominant mechanism, positing that massive central galaxy quenching is governed by the thermodynamics of gas predominantly influenced by dark matter halos. However, a vastly increasing body of observational evidence consistently indicates that quenching correlates predominantly with central properties like velocity dispersion, bulge mass, and black hole mass. When these properties are controlled, halo mass appears to show weak influence, supporting AGN feedback as the primary mechanism. A recurring key issue, however, is that these studies rely on halo masses derived via abundance matching (AM). Direct observational measurements from weak lensing, satellite kinematics, and galactic dynamics reveal that AM systematically overestimates halo masses of star-forming centrals while underestimating those of passive ones. To accurately assess the true role of halo mass. we re-estimated halo masses for SDSS groups; the resulting halo mass function and stellar-to-halo mass relations (SHMRs) for both populations match theoretical predictions and weak lensing measurements. Using these improved masses, we find direct observational evidence that halo mass is the dominant factor in quenching central galaxies, with a clear threshold at $M_{h}\sim 10^{12.1}M_\odot; $. By applying a simple correction to AM data using weak lensing-derived SHMRs, we demonstrate that previous claims regarding the dominance of central properties stem primarily from systematic biases in AM halo masses. Our results suggest that the significance of AGN feedback is primarily manifested in halos above this mass threshold, in galaxies already primed for quenching. In other words, AGN feedback appears to become effective in halos above this mass threshold.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydrodynamic Evolution and Detectability of Nova Remnants in the Galactic Center</a><span class="id">[2512.16316]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thousands of X-ray sources have been detected in the Galactic center (GC), most believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs). As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot ($T\sim{10^{6}~\rm K}$) and dense ($n_e\sim{10~\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-$\alpha$ maximum, respectively, for existing {\it Chandra}, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are $\sim10^{32}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, $\sim10^{31}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, and $\sim10^{36}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20\%, 8\%, and 18\% in X-rays, radio, and Pa$\alpha$. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The AGN nature of strong CIII emitters in the Early Universe with JWST</a><span class="id">[2512.16365]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The semi-forbidden CIII] $\lambda\lambda$1907,1909 doublet is a key tracer of high-ionization emission in the early universe.

We built a sample of 61 CIII]-emitting galaxies, and we classified them as star-forming or active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using (1) rest-frame UV and optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, and (2) the presence/absence of broad Balmer emission lines. The UV diagnostics are based on the combination of the rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of CIII] versus CIII]/HeII $\lambda$1640, and the EW of CIV versus CIV/HeII $\lambda$1640. For optical diagnostics, we employ the OHNO diagram, which combines [OIII] $\lambda$5007, H$\beta$, [NeIII] $\lambda$3869, and [OII] $\lambda\lambda$3727,3729- and we find it has a low efficiency on separating AGN from SFG.

Selecting SBLAs as spectral regions with transmitted flux $-0.05&lt;F&lt;0.25$ over $\approx138\text{ km s}^{-1}$ bins, we find a strong correlation with LAEs within a projected distance of $R\le300\rm\,kpc$ and line-of-sight velocity separation of $|\Delta v|\le300 \text{ km s}^{-1}$. The association rate increases significantly with decreasing flux, a trend that persists also at smaller separations ($R&lt;100$ kpc). A two-dimensional cross-correlation analysis confirms significant clustering of LAEs around SBLAs, while no such clustering is seen for spectral regions with $F&gt;0.25$. The correlation appears to also depend on the width of the spectral window used to identify SBLAs, with a larger window yielding a stronger signal. Our analysis confirms that SBLAs serve as probes of the CGM at the interface between the Ly$\alpha$ forest and the optically-thick Lyman limit systems. The significant dependence of the LAE-SBLA cross-correlation on the spectral binning used to select these absorbers motivates future tests of the current SBLA framework as a tracer of halos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16542" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy evolution in compact groups - III.

A subset - non-isolated CGs - are embedded within major structures. Using multi-band S-PLUS data, we analyse galaxies in 122 non-isolated CGs within more massive systems such as larger groups and clusters. We compare them to galaxies in the host structures, hereafter surrounding group galaxies. Structural parameters were obtained with MorphoPLUS, a pipeline for multi-wavelength Sérsic profile fitting. Dividing galaxies into early (ETG), transition, or late types (LTG), we find: (1) Non-isolated CGs host higher quenched fractions and more ETGs, especially for stellar masses $\log(M/M_\odot) &gt; 10.2$, than surrounding groups. (2) Sérsic indices increase with wavelength for all morphological types in both environments, whereas effective radii show a stronger morphology-dependent behaviour - ETGs become more compact towards redder bands, while LTGs exhibit flatter $Re(\lambda)$ trends. Environmental differences remain weak, with only a modest enhancement of the gradients for ETGs in non-isolated CGs. (3) Transition galaxies in CGs show a concentrated $R_e$-$n$ distribution and faint-end bimodality, consistent with ongoing morphological transformation absent in surrounding groups. (4) Phase-space analysis indicates that some CGs in clusters are projection artefacts, while others are genuine dense systems at various infall stages, from recent arrivals to ancient remnants. These results show that galaxies in non-isolated CGs follow distinct evolutionary paths compared to their surrounding groups galaxies, suggesting that the compact configuration plays a unique role beyond the influence of the larger-scale environment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16549" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">N-emitters as possible sign-posts of GC formation</a><span class="id">[2512.16549]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Based on the finding of unusual chemical abundance ratios of N-emitters, which resemble those of globular cluster (GC) stars, their compactness, high ISM densities and other properties, it has been suggested that N-emitters could indicate the formation sites of globulars. A recent statistical study of the N-emitter population has quantified the frequency $f_N$ of these rare objects and their redshift evolution (Morel et al. 2025). Using these results we here test if N-emitters trace the formation of GCs and use the observed cosmic star-formation rate density evolution to predict the cosmological evolution of the GC population with time, their age distribution, and the total present-day stellar mass density formed in globulars. The predicted age distribution of GCs strongly resembles the typical asymmetric observed distributions in the Galaxy and ellipiticals, with a peak at $\sim 11.5-12$ Gyr and a longer tail extending to younger ages. We derive a total stellar mass density formed in N-emitters down to redshift zero of $(2-7) \times 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, which matches within a factor $\sim 2$ the observed fraction of stellar mass found in the GC population at $z=0$.

Along with its reported prolonged rise lasting at least 550 days, these unique characteristics are consistent with the scenario of a TDE caused by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of approximately $(1-6) \times 10^5$ solar masses. Furthermore, scaling relations derived from the host-galaxy properties indicated a similar BH mass in concert. This discovery highlights the invaluable role of TDEs in the search for elusive IMBHs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST MIRI color classification of mid-infrared selected galaxies: MIRI color classification toward cosmic noon</a><span class="id">[2512.16589]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigated the James Webb Space Telescope photometric color classification of mid-infrared (MIR) selected galaxies at high redshifts, toward cosmic noon.

Using International Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) data at 144 MHz and Chandra data at 0.3-6 keV, we find that the co-spatial diffuse radio and X-ray emission is well described by synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes by the same electron population. Through modelling of this rare low-energy plasma, we find that the most defining property of the electrons up-scattering CMB photons at this redshift is very low electron Lorentz factors ($\gamma_{\text{max}}\ll 10^{4}$ and $\gamma_{\text{break}}\lesssim 10^{3}$) in the lobe: deep low frequency (&lt;150 MHz) observations are critical to the detection of radio lobes at high redshift. The physical conditions imply a total energy in the diffuse emission significantly greater than that implied by the temperature of the protocluster gas: 3C 294 is one of the most powerful known radio-loud systems in a dense protocluster environment. Through resolved spectral analysis of archival radio data up to 15 GHz, we find evidence that the inner hotspots are due to restarted activity, while the outer hotspots remain energetic, suggesting a rapid duty cycle while the jet precesses. This allowed the low-energy aged plasma driving the X-rays to remain spatially distinct from the high-energy plasma. Together, our results promise a revelation of AGN-related radio emission at high redshift using future low-frequency arrays such as SKA-LOW.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16708" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Origin of Kinematic Structure in the Young Association Serpens OB2</a><span class="id">[2512.16708]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Serpens OB2 association (l   18.5 deg, b   1.9 deg, d = 1950 +/- 30 pc) is a large star-forming complex  65 pc above the Galactic midplane, with a clumpy, elongated structure extending  50 pc parallel to the plane. We analyse a sample of probable association members, including OB stars and low-to-intermediate-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) from the SPICY catalogue. While both populations are found throughout the association, the OB stars lie preferentially on the side nearest the Galactic plane, while the YSOs are generally younger and more strongly clustered around molecular-cloud clumps detected in 13CO MWISP data. Using Gaia DR3 proper motions to probe the association's internal kinematics, we find aligned stellar velocities on length scales &lt;2 pc, two-point velocity statistics that show increasing velocity differences and predominantly divergent motions at larger separations, and distinct velocities for star clusters within the association. Finally, the association exhibits gradual, but statistically significant global expansion perpendicular to the Galactic plane, with a spatial gradient of 0.10 +/- 0.02 km/s/pc. The expansion of the H II region Sh 2-54, powered by the association's OB stars, may be accelerating the star-forming cloud away from the plane given the system's geometry, plausibly inducing the vertical stellar velocity gradient. The clumpy stellar distribution, correlated velocities on small scales, and increasingly divergent motions on larger scales are consistent with an initial velocity field inherited from a turbulent molecular cloud modified by stellar feedback. Ser OB2 demonstrates that the multi-scale expansion of an OB association can begin even while star formation is still ongoing throughout the complex.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A faint M$_{\rm UV} = -14.5$ Lyman continuum leaker in the reionization epoch: unprecedented Ly$α$ properties at z=5.725</a><span class="id">[2512.16728]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the unprecedented Ly$\alpha$ properties of AMORE6, an extremely metal-poor ($12+\log({\rm O/H}) &lt; 6$), low-mass ($M_\star = 4.4\times10^{5}\,M_\odot$), and ultra-compact (effective radius $\lesssim30$ pc) dwarf galaxy at $z=5.7253$, gravitationally lensed by the cluster A2744.

It is generally argued that this excess could be due to the presence of warm amorphous carbon dust in the equatorial ring (ER) around the supernova, but the proposed models all have problems. This prompted us to present an alternative view on the interpretation of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of SNR 1987A from the near-IR wavelengths to the radio frequencies (from 3 micron up to 1.4 GHz), between 6000 and 8000 days after outburst. We argue that the origin of that excess could be attributed instead to a free-free emission. We show that under very specific conditions (the free-free is self-absorbed at a cut-off frequency imposed by the mass of the emitting region), it could be produced by collisional heating of the gas. We then discuss the time evolution of the various components of the SED. We establish a linear relationship between the growth of the warm carbon dust mass and that of the silicates dust during the analyzed period. Finally, we build the Spitzer light curves and we show that our models reproduce the observations pretty well, although our study clearly favors the free-free case. In conclusion, we argue that the free-free model provides a formally very good description of the data, however the model does require some very specific parameter choices, and results in an unusually low temperature for the ionized gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecting current and future dual AGN searches to LISA and PTA gravitational wave detections</a><span class="id">[2512.16844]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dual active galactic nuclei (DAGN) mark an observable stage of massive black hole (MBH) pairing in galaxy mergers and are precursors to the MBH binaries that generate low-frequency gravitational waves. Using the large-volume ASTRID cosmological simulation, we construct DAGN catalogs matched to current (COSMOS-Web, DESI) and forthcoming (AXIS, Roman) searches. With realistic selection functions applied, ASTRID reproduces observed dual fractions, separations, and host-galaxy properties across redshifts. We predict a substantial population of small-separation (&lt;5 kpc) duals that current surveys fail to capture, indicating that the apparent paucity of sub-kpc systems in COSMOS-Web is driven primarily by selection effects rather than a physical deficit. By following each simulated dual forward in time, we show that dual AGN are robust tracers of MBH mergers:  30-70% coalesce within $\lesssim 1$ Gyr, and 20-60% of these mergers produce gravitational-wave signals detectable by LISA. Duals accessible to AXIS and Roman are the progenitors of  10% of low-redshift LISA events and  30% of the PTA-band stochastic background. Massive green-valley galaxies with moderate-luminosity AGN, together with massive star-forming hosts containing bright quasars at $z&gt;1$, emerge as the most likely environments for imminent MBH binaries.

Among the proposed interpretations, such excess has been explained by negligible dust attenuation conditions following radiation-driven outflows launched by young stars when a galaxy goes through a super-Eddington phase. Dust opacity decreases the classical Eddington luminosity by a (boost) factor $A$, thus favoring the driving of outflows by stellar radiation in compact, initially dusty galaxies. Here, we compute $A$ as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, gas fraction, galaxy size, and metallicity (a total of 8 parameters). We find that the main dependence is on metallicity and, for the fiducial model, $A \sim 1800(Z/Z_\odot)/(1+N_{\rm H}/10^{23.5}\, {\rm cm^2})$. We apply such results to 20 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$ and evaluate their modified Eddington ratio. We predict that three galaxies are in the outflow phase. Their outflows have relatively low velocities ($60 -100 \,{\rm km\ s^{-1}}$), implying that they are unlikely to escape from the system. For the remaining 17 galaxies that are not currently in the outflow phase, we calculate the past evolution of the modified Eddington ratio from their star formation history. We find that 15 of them experienced an outflow phase prior to observation during which they effectively displaced their dust to larger radii. Thus, dusty outflows driven by stellar radiation appear to contribute to the observed bright UV galaxies at $z &gt; 10$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LITMUS: Bayesian Lag Recovery in Reverberation Mapping with Fast Differentiable Models</a><span class="id">[2505.09832]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reverberation mapping is a technique in which the mass of a Seyfert I galaxy's central supermassive black hole is estimated, along with the system's physical scale, from the timescale at which variations in brightness propagate through the galactic nucleus. This mapping allows for a long baseline of time measurements to extract spatial information beyond the angular resolution of our telescopes, and is the main means of constraining supermassive black hole masses at high redshift. The most recent generation of multi-year reverberation mapping campaigns for large numbers of active galactic nuclei (e.g. OzDES) have had to deal with persistent complications of identifying false positives, such as those arising from aliasing due to seasonal gaps in time-series data. We introduce LITMUS (Lag Inference Through the Mixed Use of Samplers), a modern lag recovery tool built on the &quot;damped random walk&quot; model of quasar variability, built in the autodiff framework JAX. LITMUS is purpose built to handle the multimodal aliasing of seasonal observation windows and provides evidence integrals for model comparison, a more quantified alternative to existing methods of lag validation. LITMUS also offers a flexible modular framework for extending modelling of AGN variability, and includes JAX-enabled implementations of other popular lag recovery methods like nested sampling and the interpolated cross correlation function. We test LITMUS on a number of mock light curves modelled after the OzDES sample and find that it recovers their lags with high precision and a successfully identifies spurious lag recoveries, reducing its false positive rate to drastically outperform the state of the art program JAVELIN. LITMUS's high performance is accomplished by an algorithm for mapping the Bayesian posterior density which both constrains the lag and offers a Bayesian framework for model null hypothesis testing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling the Ionized and Neutral ISM at z &gt; 10 : The Origin of [O III] /[C II] Ratios from a Sub-parsec Resolution Radiative Transfer Simulation</a><span class="id">[2505.12397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent multi-wavelength observations by JWST and ALMA are unveiling both ionized and neutral ISM components in high-redshift ($z&gt;6$) galaxies. In this work, we investigate the origin of rest-frame far-infrared [OIII]88 $\mu$m and [CII]158 $\mu$m emission by performing zoom-in cosmological simulations of dwarf-galaxy progenitors at $z=9-13$. Our simulations incorporate on-the-fly radiative transfer at sub-pc ($\sim$ 0.1 pc) resolution, allowing us to resolve the multi-phase ISM. We compute emission lines on a cell-by-cell basis, taking into account local temperature, density, metallicity, radiation field strength, column density, and spectral hardness of radiation bins. We find that [OIII] predominantly arises from centrally located ionizing bubbles with temperatures of $\sim (1-5)\times 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$ and high ionization parameters of $\log U_{\mathrm{ion}} \simeq -1.5$. In contrast, [CII] is produced in the surrounding dense neutral regions at $\sim 5\times 10^3\,\mathrm{K}$, which are heated by strong FUV radiation ($G/G_0 \sim 10^{3-5}$) from the central stellar clusters. This spatial arrangement leads to large local variations in [OIII]/[CII], ranging from $\sim$ 100 to 0.01. Our galaxy reproduces the global ratio [OIII]/[CII]$\sim5-30$, consistent with recent ALMA detections at $z&gt;6$ without invoking enhanced O/C abundance ratios. We further derive that [OIII]/[CII] linearly scales with the mass and density ratios of ionized to neutral gas, $M_{\rm HII}/M_{\rm HI}$ and $n_{\rm HII}/n_{\rm HI}$ and show that the [OIII]/[CII] ratio typically changes from 5.7 to 0.3 from high-z to low-z. For future synergies of JWST and ALMA, we derived $M_{\rm HII}/M_{\rm HI}$ for observed $z &gt;6$ galaxies using ${\rm H}\beta$ and [CII] and show the validity of our scaling relations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spatial and velocity anisotropies of stellar halos across cosmic web environments: Insights from IllustrisTNG simulation</a><span class="id">[2505.15127]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The role of large-scale environment in shaping the structural and kinematic properties of stellar halos remains an open question. We investigate whether the cosmic web environments affect the spatial and velocity anisotropies of stellar halos in Milky Way-mass galaxies. Using high-resolution data from the TNG50 simulation, we analyze 29 stellar halos from each environment and quantify their spatial and kinematic anisotropies as a function of halo-centric radius. We find that stellar halos across all environments generally exhibit increasing spatial anisotropy with radius, with fluctuations corresponding to bound substructures. The velocity anisotropy profiles show radially dominated orbits on average, but also display significant local variation, including tangentially dominated regions. However, no statistically significant differences are observed in the mean spatial or velocity anisotropy profiles across environments, for either the total stellar halo population or for the in situ and ex situ components individually. The large scatter within each environment suggests that the formation of stellar halos is primarily driven by stochastic, small-scale processes such as satellite merger histories, rather than the large-scale geometry of the cosmic web. Our results imply that, at fixed halo mass, the influence of cosmic web environment on the structure of stellar halo is weak or highly non-deterministic. Possible environmental effects may be more prominent at higher masses where accretion is more anisotropic. Exploring this regime will require simulations with both larger volume and higher resolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22793" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spiral Structure Properties, Dynamics, and Evolution in MW-mass Galaxy Simulations</a><span class="id">[2507.22793]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The structure of spiral galaxies is essential to understanding the dynamics and evolution of disk galaxies; however, the precise nature of spiral arms remains uncertain. Two challenges in understanding the mechanisms driving spirals are how galactic environment impacts spiral morphology and how they evolve over time. We present a catalog characterizing the properties, dynamics, and evolution of $m=2$ spiral structure in 10 Milky Way-mass galaxies from the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations. Consistent with previous literature, we find that FIRE-2 spirals are transient, recurring features simultaneously present in the disk at varying pattern speeds ($\Omega_p$) that broadly decrease with radius. These spirals persist on Gyr timescales (mean duration 1.90 Gyr), but fluctuate in amplitude on timescales of hundreds of Myr. Tidal interactions and bar episodes impact the resulting $m=2$ spiral structure; strong satellite interactions generally produce shorter-lived, stronger spirals with larger radial extent, and bars can increase $\Omega_p$. Galactic environment influences spiral structure; kinematically colder disks can support longer-lived, stronger spirals. The properties of identified spirals in FIRE-2 vary widely in radial extent (0.3-10.8 kpc), duration (1.00-6.00 Gyr), and amplitudes ($a_{2,\text{max}}$=0.018-0.192). We find the presence of spirals in all age populations, suggesting these are density wave-driven features. This work represents the first time that spiral structure has been cataloged in this manner in cosmological simulations; the catalog can be leveraged with current and forthcoming observational surveys, enabling systematic comparisons to further our understanding of galaxy evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J-VAR: Analysis of RR Lyrae light curves in seven optical bands</a><span class="id">[2509.03120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context:RR Lyrae stars, with their accurate period and amplitude measurements, constrain stellar evolution and map Galactic structure. The Javalambre VARiability (J-VAR) survey is the time-domain extension of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe survey, which provides time-series data across seven optical bands, including $gri$ and four medium and narrow bands. Aims: Our goal is to construct and analyze light curves for RR Lyrae stars identified in the J-VAR's first data release using the \textit{Gaia} third data release (DR3) Variable Stars catalog as a reference. Methods: The light curves of $315$ RR Lyrae were analyzed by fitting templates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Multiband Template Library. The periods and amplitudes for the seven bands in J-VAR were independently obtained from the best-fitted templates. Results: The J-VAR periods show strong agreement with \textit{Gaia} DR3 values. The Bailey diagram for each J-VAR filter shows larger pulsation amplitudes at bluer wavelengths. Amplitudes, after normalizing by the $r$-band amplitude, show an exponential trend, with the bluer J-VAR filter centered at $395~\text{nm}$ having twice the amplitude of the reddest J-VAR passband at $861~\text{nm}$. The normalized amplitudes of the RR Lyrae stars from {\it Gaia} and the Zwicky Transient Facility are consistent with the J-VAR trend. Finally, the SDSS templates derived from broadbands also provide a proper description for the medium and narrow band light curves. Conclusions: The J-VAR RR Lyrae catalog offers reliable pulsation parameters and light curves in seven optical filters, allowing the systematic study of amplitude trends from $395~\text{nm}$ to $860~\text{nm}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is the contribution of gravitational infall on the mass assembly of star-forming clouds?

The formation of these structures and the subsequent collapse of the gas within them to form new stars remain unresolved scientific questions. In particular, the role and importance of gravity at between the disk scale height and prestellar cores (100 to 0.01 pc) are still topics of debate. In this work, we conduct a case study examining the mass assembly and evolution of a giant molecular cloud complex in a numerical stratified-box simulation of the interstellar medium with photo-ionizing and supernova driving and resolving down to scales $\gtrsim 1$ pc and densities up to $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. By introducing tracer particles to precisely track the forces acting on the gas during its evolution towards and within the clouds, we are able to quantify how much of the mass inflow is driven by the self-gravity of the gas and the gravity from the stellar disk. We find that up to 20% of the gas is gravity-driven at a scale of 100 pc, contributing 10% of the inflow from the warm to the cold phase and 20% from the cold phase to the individual molecular clouds, reaching up to 45% inside the molecular gas, at densities $\gtrsim 400$ cm$^{-3}$. However, at the 100 pc scale, the contribution of gravity-driven gas on the linewidth is negligible. We conclude that the bulk of the gas motions assembling the clouds in our simulation are caused by the supernova-driven supersonic turbulence, which results in locally convergent flows, with a small contribution from the stellar gravitational potential.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variance of dust temperature and spectral index in Planck polarization data using spin-moment expansion</a><span class="id">[2510.18305]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thermal dust is the major polarized foreground hindering the detection of primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-modes.

In this work, we present a new framework for analyzing the thermal dust signal using polarized microwave data. We introduce residual maps, represented as complex quantities, which capture deviations of the local polarized spectral energy distribution (SED) from the mean complex SED averaged over the sky mask. We present simple predictions that relate the values of the statistical correlation and covariances between the residual maps to the physical properties of the emitting aligned grains. Testing these predictions provides valuable information about the nature of the dust signal. We evaluated our predictions using Planck data over a 97% mask excluding the inner Galactic plane. Despite its simplicity, our model captures a significant part of the statistical properties of the data. For the SRoll2 version of the data, the spectral dependence of the covariances between residual maps is compatible with a dust model that includes only temperature variations rather than spectral index variations. In contrast, for the PR4 Planck official release, it is incompatible with both models. Our methodology can be used to analyze future high-precision polarization data and to build more accurate dust models for use by the CMB community.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An accurate measure of the size of dark matter halos using the size of galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.19926]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The physically motivated definition of galaxy size proposed recently, linked to the farther location of the in situ star formation, considerably reduces the scatter of the galaxy mass-size relation and provides a viable method to infer the galaxy stellar mass from its size. We provide a similar relation correlating the size of galaxies with the size of their dark matter haloes by leveraging the small scatter of the aforementioned relation. We analysed the simulated galaxies of the two main cosmological volumes of the EAGLE simulations and computed the size of the galaxies and their mass when mimicking the observational analysis. For central galaxies, we computed the relation between galaxy size and halo size. We show that the simulated galaxies reproduce the observed stellar mass-size relation's normalisation and slope. The scatter of this relation, 0.06 dex, matches the intrinsic scatter measured in observation. We then computed the correlation between galaxy size and halo size and found that the relation is steeper than when using the half-mass radius as a measure of size, with the scatter (0.1 dex) being a factor of two smaller than the observed relation. As well, the galaxy-to-halo mass relation derived from the simulations provides a factor of two better scatter than the observed scatter. This opens the possibility of measuring the size of dark matter haloes with greater accuracy (less than 50%, i.e. around six times better than using the effective radius) by using only deep imaging data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25035" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapid Brightening of 3I/ATLAS Ahead of Perihelion</a><span class="id">[2510.25035]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been approaching its 2025 October 29 perihelion while opposite the Sun from Earth, hindering ground-based optical observations over the preceding month.

Ignoring the internal dynamics of particles in the dark matter halo and the Keplerian rotation of matter in the galaxy, we focus on the possible relative oscillations of the matter component as a whole within the dark matter halo. We estimate the amplitude and frequency of these oscillations assuming that the offset of the centres of mass is small as compared with the size of the galaxy. Such oscillations, if exist, should manifest themselves in anomalies of velocities of stars in the galaxy, such as the density waves and runaway stars which have orbit periods in resonance with oscillations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10037" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar properties and chemical features of the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars observed by GALAH DR4</a><span class="id">[2512.10037]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars (GCNS) comprises approximately 330 000 stars within 100 pc of the Sun, as observed by Gaia data release 3 (Gaia DR3). Meanwhile, the GALAH DR4 survey has spectroscopically characterised nearly one million stars, delivering detailed chemical abundances (up to 30 elements). We present a joint analysis of the $\sim$ 6 000 stars common to both catalogues, offering initial insights into the stellar and chemical properties of the solar neighborhood. Our preliminary results indicate that the majority of these stars are FGK main-sequence objects, with some A-type interlopers (with effective temperatures ranging between 3 000 and 8 000 K), with median ages of $\sim$ 1.6 Gyr (ranging from 0.10 to 14.79 Gyr), and metal-poorer when compared to the Sun: [Fe/H] $\approx$ -0.19 dex. Additionally, most of the stars are disc members, with some local halo (high-velocity) stars identified. Building on this foundation, future work will deeper exploit the full spectroscopic information and orbital parameters from value-added catalogues to refine Galactic component classifications (thin-thick disc versus halo membership), perform detailed chemical profiling, and deliver a comprehensive chemo-dynamical characterisation of the solar neighborhood. This will provide new insights into the formation and evolution of nearby stellar populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super-resolving Herschel - a deep learning based deconvolution and denoising technique</a><span class="id">[2512.13353]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) dominate the far-infrared and sub-millimetre number counts, but single-dish surveys suffer from poor angular resolution, complicating mult-wavelength counterpart identification. Prior-driven deblending techniques require extensive fine-tuning and struggle to process large fields. This work aims to develop a fast, reliable deep-learning based deconvolution and denoising super-resolution (SR) technique. We employ a transformer neural network to improve the resolution of Herschel/SPIRE 500 $\mu$m observations by a factor 4.5, using Spitzer/MIPS 24$\mu$m and Herschel/SPIRE 250, 350, 500$\mu$m images. Trained on SIDES and SHARK simulations, we injected instrumental noise into the input simulated images, while keeping the target images noise-free to enhance de-noising capabilities of our method. We evaluated the performance on simulated test sets and real JCMT/SCUBA-2 450 $\mu$m observations in the COSMOS field which have superior resolution compared to Herschel. Our SR method achieves an inference time of $1s/deg^2$ on consumer GPUs, much faster than traditional deblending techniques. Using the simulation test sets, we show that fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved image are accurate to within 5% for sources with an intrinsic flux $\gtrsim$ 8 mJy, which is a substantial improvement compared to blind extraction on the native images. Astrometric error is low ($\lesssim$ 1&quot; vs 12&quot; pixel scale). Reliability is $\gtrsim$ 90% for sources $&gt;$3 mJy and $&gt;$90% of sources with intrinsic fluxes $\gtrsim5$ mJy are recovered. Applied to real 500 $\mu$m observations, fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved map agree well with SCUBA-2 measured fluxes for sources $\geq$10 mJy. Our technique enables SR over hundreds of $deg^2$ without the need for fine-tuning, facilitating statistical analysis of DSFGs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From ASTRID to BRAHMA – The role of overmassive black holes in little red dots in cosmological simulations</a><span class="id">[2512.13957]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We leverage the overmassive black holes ($\rm M_{BH}/M_{\ast} \approx0.1$) present in a realization of the BRAHMA cosmological hydrodynamic simulation suite to investigate their role in the emission of the unique “little red dot” (LRD) objects identified by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these black holes can produce LRD-like observables when their emission is modeled with a dense gas cloud shrouding the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Between redshifts 5 and 8, we find the number density of LRDs in this simulation to be $\rm 2.04 \pm 0.32 \times 10^{-4} \space Mpc^{-3}$, which is broadly consistent with current estimates for the total LRD population from JWST. Their emission in the rest-frame visible spectrum is dominated by their AGN, which induces the red color indicative of LRDs via a very strong Balmer break. Additionally, the elevated mass of the black holes reduces the temperature of their accretion discs. This shifts the peak of the AGN emission towards longer wavelengths, and increases their brightness in the rest-frame visible spectrum relative to lower mass black holes accreting at the same rate. These simulated LRDs have very minimal dust attenuation ($\rm A_V = 0.21 \pm 0.12$), limiting the amount of dust re-emission that would occur in the infrared, making them very likely to fall below the observed detection limits from observatories like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In contrast to the BRAHMA box, the ASTRID simulation produces systematically smaller black holes and predicts LRD number densities that are more than two orders of magnitude lower than current measurements. We therefore conclude that the presence of black holes that are overmassive relative to their host galaxy, and enshrouded in dense gas, is necessary for AGN-dominated LRD models to reproduce both the observed properties and abundances of JWST LRD populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Morphology of Optically Dark or Faint Galaxies at $z&gt;3$ with JWST</a><span class="id">[2512.15127]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST offers an unprecedented view of optically dark or faint galaxies (OFGs), previously missed by HST. They are likely massive, heavily dust-obscured star-forming galaxies (SFGs) that substantially contribute to the cosmic SFR density at $z&gt;$3. To identify drivers of their high dust attenuation and their role in early universe galaxy evolution, we analyse the stellar morphology of 65 OFGs (from 1892 SFGs at 3$&lt;z&lt;$4) using NIRCam/F444W imaging from the PRIMER and CEERS fields. We study correlations between dust attenuation ($A_v$) and galaxy properties, like stellar mass, size, and orientation, and compare scaling relations between OFGs and typical SFGs. We find that OFGs are  8-9 times more massive and  4 times more dust attenuated than the parent sample. Structurally, OFGs resemble parent SFGs in median $R_e$ and median $\Sigma_{R_e}$ but may be slightly rounder on average. While $A_v$ strongly correlates with stellar mass, it does not show significant dependence on stellar mass-normalised effective radius and stellar mass surface density, Sérsic index, axis ratio, or SFR surface density. The mass-size and mass-surface density relations place OFGs as a higher-mass extension of SFGs, with no concrete proof of evolutionary differences between them. This suggests that OFGs are heavily dust-obscured primarily due to their high stellar masses, which facilitates dust production and retention, with older stellar populations likely contributing as well. Although some OFGs exhibit high $\Sigma_\mathrm{R_e}$ and occupy regions of the mass-size plane similar to quiescent galaxies, the overall sample is not representative of this. Their current structures resemble typical SFGs, with no concrete signs of rapid compaction. Diversity in their physical properties shows that OFGs span a range of evolutionary states with few showing reduced star formation, while most remain actively star-forming.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15129" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dual-coding contrastive learning based on ConvNeXt and ViT models for morphological classification of galaxies in COSMOS-Web</a><span class="id">[2512.15129]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In our previous works, we proposed a machine learning framework named \texttt{USmorph} for efficiently classifying galaxy morphology. In this study, we propose a self-supervised method called contrastive learning to upgrade the unsupervised machine learning (UML) part of the \texttt{USmorph} framework, aiming to improve the efficiency of feature extraction in this step. The upgraded UML method primarily consists of the following three aspects. (1) We employ a Convolutional Autoencoder to denoise galaxy images and the Adaptive Polar Coordinate Transformation to enhance the model's rotational invariance. (2) A pre-trained dual-encoder convolutional neural network based on ConvNeXt and ViT is used to encode the image data, while contrastive learning is then applied to reduce the dimension of the features. (3) We adopt a Bagging-based clustering model to cluster galaxies with similar features into distinct groups. By carefully dividing the redshift bins, we apply this model to the rest-frame optical images of galaxies in the COSMOS-Web field within the redshift range of $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 6.0$. Compared to the previous algorithm, the improved UML method successfully classifies 73\% galaxies. Using the GoogleNet algorithm, we classify the morphology of the remaining 27\% galaxies. To validate the reliability of our updated algorithm, we compared our classification results with other galaxy morphological parameters and found a good consistency with galaxy evolution. Benefiting from its higher efficiency, this updated algorithm is well-suited for application in future China Space Station Telescope missions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An updated efficient galaxy morphology classification model based on ConvNeXt encoding with UMAP dimensionality reduction</a><span class="id">[2512.15137]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an enhanced unsupervised machine learning (UML) module within our previous \texttt{USmorph} classification framework featuring two components: (1) hierarchical feature extraction via a pre-trained ConvNeXt convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning, and (2) nonlinear manifold learning using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for topology-aware dimensionality reduction. This dual-stage design enables efficient knowledge transfer from large-scale visual datasets while preserving morphological pattern geometry through UMAP's neighborhood preservation.

To assess classification effectiveness, we tested morphological parameters for massive galaxies with $M_{*}&gt;10^{9}~M_{\odot}$. Our classification results align well with galaxy evolution theory.

Although \texttt{USmorph} has already been applied to nearly 100,000 $I$-band galaxy images in the COSMOS field ($0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2$, $I_{\mathrm{mag}} &lt; 25$), the stability of its core modules has not been quantitatively assessed. Our tests show that the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) achieves the best performance in preserving structural information when adopting an intermediate network depth, $5\times5$ convolutional kernels, and a 40-dimensional latent representation. The adaptive polar coordinate transform (APCT) effectively enhances rotational invariance and improves the robustness of downstream tasks. In the unsupervised stage, a bagging clustering number of $K=50$ provides the optimal trade-off between classification granularity and labeling efficiency. For supervised learning, we employ GoogLeNet, which exhibits stable performance without overfitting. We validate the reliability of the final classifications through two independent tests: (1) the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization reveals clear clustering boundaries in the low-dimensional space; and (2) the morphological classifications are consistent with theoretical expectations of galaxy evolution, with both true and false positives showing unbiased distributions in the parameter space. These results demonstrate the strong robustness of the \texttt{USmorph} algorithm, providing guidance for its future application to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) mission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lensing by black holes within astrophysical environments</a><span class="id">[2508.19333]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Astrophysical black holes are likely to be surrounded by various forms of matter in the form of disks or halos.

By using an exact solution in general relativity describing a black hole embedded within a realistic halo of Hernquist matter distribution, we study deflection angles and image amplification in a fully relativistic setup. It is shown that large “bumps”, that also arise at the Newtonian and post-Newtonian levels, track the transition scale set by the halo parameters that control the strong-lensing upturn and can significantly adjust the inferences made for either the source or lens in various contexts. As an application, we consider “echoes” of gravitational waves, sourced by astrophysical lenses rather than being intrinsic to the compact object that produces the signal.</p></div></details></article>

A major challenge in SETI is the effective mitigation of radio frequency interference (RFI), a critical step that is particularly vital for the highly sensitive Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). While initial RFI mitigation (e.g., removal of persistent and drifting narrowband RFI) are essential, residual RFI often persists, posing significant challenges due to its complex and various nature. In this paper, we propose and apply an improved machine learning approach, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, to identify and mitigate residual RFI in FAST-SETI commensal survey archival data from July 2019. After initial RFI mitigation, we successfully identify and remove 36977 residual RFIs (accounting for $\sim$ 77.87\%) within approximately 1.678 seconds using the DBSCAN algorithm. This result shows that we have achieved a 7.44\% higher removal rate than previous machine learning methods, along with a 24.85\% reduction in execution time. We finally find interesting candidate signals consistent with previous studies, and retain one candidate signal following further analysis. Therefore, DBSCAN algorithm can mitigate more residual RFI with higher computational efficiency while preserving the candidate signals that we are interested in.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15814" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asteroseismology of white dwarfs in the 2040s</a><span class="id">[2512.15814]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>White dwarfs, the final evolutionary stage of the vast majority of stars, serve as critical tools for cosmochronology, studies of planetary system evolution, and laboratories for non-standard physics, including exotic cooling channels and weakly interacting particles, as well as crystallization processes. Beyond surface properties accessible via spectroscopy and model atmospheres, global pulsations exhibited by white dwarfs during various evolutionary phases provide a direct window into their deep interiors. Asteroseismology, the comparison of observed pulsation periods with theoretical models, enables us to infer internal chemical stratification, total mass, rotation profiles, and magnetic field strengths. Despite major advances from space missions providing uninterrupted, high-precision photometry, key challenges remain: many predicted pulsators remain quiet, while others oscillate outside theoretical instability strips, highlighting gaps in our understanding of mode excitation, diffusion, and convective mixing. Determining the masses of white dwarfs, particularly for massive and hydrogen-deficient stars, remains uncertain, with discrepancies between spectroscopic, asteroseismic, astrometric, and photometric methods. In the coming decades, large-scale surveys combining high-precision space-based photometry with coordinated ground-based spectroscopic follow-up will dramatically increase both the number and quality of pulsating white dwarf observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nova Explosions in 2040</a><span class="id">[2512.15821]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Novae are thermonuclear explosions on the surface of accreting white dwarfs and are key laboratories for studying explosive nucleosynthesis, particle acceleration, shock physics, and binary evolution.

These discoveries will not only add to the current understanding of neutron star physics by increasing the sample of sources that can be studied, but will undoubtedly also uncover previously unknown types of sources that will challenge our theories of a wide range of physical phenomena. A broad variety of scientific studies will be made possible by a significantly increased known population of neutron stars, unravelling questions such as: How do isolated pulsars evolve with time; What is the connection between magnetars, high B-field pulsars, and the newly discovered long-period pulsars; How is a pulsar's spin-down related to its radio emission; What is the nuclear equation of state? Increasing the known numbers of pulsars in binary or triple systems may enable both larger numbers and higher precision tests of gravitational theories and general relativity, as well as probing the neutron star mass distribution. The excellent sensitivity of the SKAO telescopes combined with the wide field of view, large numbers of simultaneous tied-array beams that will be searched in real time, wide range of observing frequencies, and the ability to form multiple sub-arrays will make the SKAO an excellent facility to undertake a wide range of neutron star research.

The primary goal of PTAs is to study gravitational-wave astronomy at nanohertz frequencies, with secondary goals of undertaking other fundamental tests of physics and astronomy. Recently, compelling evidence has emerged in established PTA experiments for the presence of a gravitational-wave background. To accelerate a confident detection of such a signal and then study gravitational-wave emitting sources, it is necessary to observe a larger number of millisecond pulsars to greater timing precision. The SKAO telescopes, which will be a factor of three to four greater in sensitivity compared to any other southern hemisphere facility, are poised to make such an impact. In this chapter, we motivate an SKAO pulsar timing array (SKAO PTA) experiment. We discuss the classes of gravitational waves present in PTA observations and how an SKAO PTA can detect and study them. We then describe the sources that can produce these signals. We discuss the astrophysical noise sources that must be mitigated to undertake the most sensitive searches. We then describe a realistic PTA experiment implemented with the SKA and place it in context alongside other PTA experiments likely ongoing in the 2030s. We describe the techniques necessary to search for gravitational waves in the SKAO PTA and motivate how very long baseline interferometry can improve the sensitivity of an SKAO PTA.

However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi–component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved. We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expanding Horizons - Transforming Astronomy in the 2040s Time-Domain Multi-Messenger Astronomy in the 2040s: EM Follow-up of LGWA Sources</a><span class="id">[2512.16264]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The coming decades will see gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy expand decisively into the mHz-Hz frequency range, opening access to a population of compact binaries that are currently invisible or only detectable moments before merger.

Rather than reacting to mergers after the fact, LGWA enables predictive, scheduled electromagnetic (EM) follow-up, transforming how compact-object mergers, their environments, and their astrophysical channels are studied. However, fully exploiting LGWA discoveries requires EM capabilities that do not exist today and are unlikely to be available by the 2030s, particularly for wide-area, rapid, spectroscopically rich follow-up at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. This White Paper identifies the key science cases enabled by LGWA that motivate new ground-based capabilities in the 2040s.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio frequency interference identification using eigenvalue decomposition for multi-beam observations</a><span class="id">[2512.16278]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the installation of next-generation phased array feed (PAF) receivers on radio telescopes, there is an urgent need to develop effective and computationally efficient radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation methods for large-scale surveys. Here we present a new RFI mitigation package, called mRAID (multi-beam RAdio frequency Interference Detector), which uses the eigenvalue decomposition algorithm to identify RFI in cross-correlation matrix (CCM) of data recorded by multiple beams. When applied to high time-resolution pulsar search data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), mRAID demonstrates excellent performance in identifying RFI over short timescales, thereby enhancing the efficiency of pulsar and fast radio burst (FRB) searches. Since the computation of the CCM and the eigenvalue decomposition for each time sub-integration and frequency channel are independent, the process is fully parallelisable. As a result, mRAID offers a significant computational advantage over commonly used RFI detection methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New methods to improve the decontamination of slitless spectra</a><span class="id">[2512.16324]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper proposes four new methods to decontaminate spectra of stars and galaxies resulting from slitless spectroscopy used in many space missions such as Euclid. These methods are based on two distinct approaches and simultaneously take into account multiple dispersion directions of light. The first approach, called the local instantaneous approach, is based on an approximate linear instantaneous model. The second approach, called the local convolutive approach, is based on a more realistic convolutive model that allows simultaneous decontamination and deconvolution of spectra. For each approach, a mixing model was developed that links the observed data to the source spectra. This was done either in the spatial domain for the local instantaneous approach or in the Fourier domain for the local convolutive approach. Four methods were then developed to decontaminate these spectra from the mixtures, exploiting the direct images provided by photometers. Test results obtained using realistic, noisy, Euclid-like data confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximizing the sensitivity of ELT to habitable worlds with a space-based starshade</a><span class="id">[2512.16361]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ELT will provide groundbreaking science across a wide range of areas, including small habitable-zone exoplanets; however, true Earth analogs in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars are generally beyond the reach even of the ELT, due to the extreme contrast ratio and small angular separation between the planet and star. Here, we note that the combination of ELT and a space-based starshade would provide the contrast needed to observe potentially tens of Earth analogs, as well as other planets. This would yield the scientific basis needed for addressing central scientific questions regarding the frequency and distribution of habitability and life in the Universe. The huge aperture of ELT, combined with a contrast otherwise only reachable in space, opens up scientific avenues that are unmatched by any other existing or foreseen facility. ESO could conceivably collaborate with ESA (and others) to facilitate a starshade mission suitable for synergy with the ELT, as well as to prepare the ELT instrumentation in order to maximize its potential for synergy with a starshade.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16440" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A direction-dependent framework for visibility plane mosaicing and primary beam correction</a><span class="id">[2512.16440]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the increasing sensitivity of modern radio interferometers, it has become important to image objects larger than the field of view while optimising sensitivity and image fidelity. We present a coherent visibility plane direction-dependent imaging, calibration and mosaicing framework. Our simulations and application to real MeerKAT data show that this joint deconvolution and primary beam correction approach, coupled with direction-dependent calibration, allows for deeper mosaics with greater fidelity and increased accuracy of recovered flux densities and spectral indices, especially beyond the half-power beam width. Our best-case mosaic produces precise flux values within a 6% uncertainty and spectral indices within 20\% throughout the imaged area, and is fully complete out to twice the radii and half the flux density than the image plane equivalent. The application to archival wideband MeerKAT 1283 MHz data produces the deepest high-resolution image of the Shapley Supercluster Core, with a sensitivity of 3.6 $\mu$Jy/beam within the primary beam at a 7$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution, constituting a $\sim$ 50% increase in dynamic range over the image plane counterpart, and a fluxscale that is consistent within 10% across the entire field of view. The compute time for the direction-dependent visibility plane mosaic was comparable to the sum of the times needed to perform direction-dependent calibration on the individual pointings. Our results suggest that visibility plane mosaicing with its capability for deeper deconvolution could improve the efficiency of deep and wide surveys, particularly for on-the-fly mapping and studies of low surface brightness sources, and could form the basis of future calibration pipelines for SKA-scale instruments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniform Rolling: An LSST Observing Cadence Offering Sufficient Survey Uniformity for Comprehensive Cosmological Analysis</a><span class="id">[2512.16478]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) that will be carried out by the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory promises to be the defining survey of the next decade, supplying unprecedented access to the night sky to static science- and time-domain science-focused researchers alike. Maximizing the output of the broad remit of Rubin Observatory science requires a non-trivial survey strategy. For time-domain science, the most promising strategy designed so far is a rolling survey strategy, whereby a subset of the full LSST survey area is observed at higher rate compared with the nominal rate dictated by weather conditions and the observatory's technical constraints. This strategy is now the baseline approach for the LSST as a whole. Focusing on static science (galaxy clustering and weak lensing), we study how these time-domain-optimized rolling strategies affect the depth uniformity at intermediate years of the survey. We characterize the amount of survey area at high risk of being lost in static-science analyses of a baseline rolling LSST dataset due to an insufficient combination of survey contiguity and uniformity. At intermediate data releases, nearly half of the survey could be lost for static science, decreasing the Dark Energy figure of merit by approximately 40\%. We describe additional metrics focused on key analysis tasks, such as photometric redshifts and galaxy clustering. We propose a new strategy that returns the survey to uniformity at key release years, enabling use of the full survey area and restoring our metrics to the values they would have in a non-rolling cadence without loss of time domain data relative to a rolling survey with the same number of rolling cycles. This work has informed the third round of optimization of the survey strategy, and the new uniform rolling strategies have been incorporated into the baseline strategy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16675" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Preliminary Mauve Science Programme: Science themes identified for the first year of operations</a><span class="id">[2512.16675]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mauve is a low-cost small satellite developed and operated by Blue Skies Space Ltd.

We investigate auto-encoders for compressing high-resolution X-ray spectra, motivated by newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU), and use likelihood-based importance sampling to refine NPE outputs. Our auto-encoder maps spectra to a low-dimensional latent space and is trained with a custom loss equal to the Cash statistic (C-stat) between simulated and reconstructed spectra. A neural density estimator is then trained on the latent representations. Both models are trained in multiple rounds: at each round, new simulations are drawn from a truncated proposal concentrated around the observation, improving efficiency as the proposal contracts. After NPE convergence, we apply likelihood-based importance sampling to correct the learned posterior. To assess information retention, we train a diagnostic network that predicts the original spectral parameters from the latent space, and we also train a network to learn the likelihood directly to accelerate importance sampling. On X-IFU-like simulations, the auto-encoder and multi-round NPE outperforms PCA and hand-crafted spectral summaries in accuracy and robustness. After importance sampling, the resulting posteriors are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained with nested sampling. On a standard laptop, the full pipeline (simulation, compression, inference, correction) delivers 10x speedups. We further demonstrate the approach on XRISM/Resolve and on lower-resolution NICER and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data, confirming applicability across instruments and resolutions. Overall, NPE on compressed spectra paired with likelihood-based importance sampling offers an exact yet efficient alternative for Bayesian X-ray spectral fitting.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strategies for Accurate Effective Point Spread Function (ePSF) Modelling on Undersampled Images</a><span class="id">[2512.16764]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurate modelling of the effective point spread function (ePSF) is essential for high-precision photometry and astrometry, particularly in undersampled imaging regimes. In this work, we build on a well-established ePSF modelling framework and its commonly used open-source Python implementation and demonstrate that several simple but effective modifications to existing ePSF modelling routines can significantly improve model accuracy. We use synthetic ePSFs to generate simulated datasets of stellar images, allowing us to evaluate the accuracy of ePSF models and determine the scale of the pixel-phase errors in resulting flux and position measurements. We systematically investigate how specific modelling choices affect ePSF accuracy, and evaluate the influence of oversampling, interpolation, gridpoint estimation, smoothing, star-sample distribution, and dithering on photometric precision. We apply our refined ePSF modelling routine to images from the Global Jet Watch observatories, demonstrating its improved ability to recover an accurate ePSF for real astronomical images. Our findings highlight the importance of tailoring the modelling approach to the specific characteristics of the instrument and detector, as well as to the nature of the available imaging data used to construct the ePSF model. These results provide practical guidance for optimising ePSF construction, thereby improving the reliability of photometric and astrometric measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robust CMB B-mode analysis with Needlet-ILC and simulation-based inference</a><span class="id">[2512.16869]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore a novel analysis framework for parameter inference with large-scale CMB polarization data. Our method uses simulation-based inference combined with the needlet internal linear combination (NILC) algorithm and cross-correlation-based statistics to compress the data into a vector that is robust to model misspecification and small enough to be amenable to neural posterior estimation with normalizing flows. By leveraging this compressed data representation, our method enables the robust use of the anisotropic and non-Gaussian information in the foreground fields to more accurately separate the CMB polarization signal from these contaminants. Using an idealized ground-based experimental setup inspired by the Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes, we demonstrate improved statistical constraining power for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ compared to the (constrained) NILC algorithm and improved robustness to complex foregrounds compared to other techniques in the literature. Trained on a relatively simple semi-analytical foreground model, the method yields unbiased $r$ results across a range of PySM Galactic foreground simulations, including the high-complexity d12 model, for which we obtain $r=(1.09 \pm 0.27)\cdot 10^{-2}$ for input $r=0.01$ and sky fraction $f_{\mathrm{sky}} = 0.21$. We thus demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of a complete, maps-to-parameters, simulation-based analysis of large-scale CMB polarization for current ground-based observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introduction to Symbolic Regression in the Physical Sciences</a><span class="id">[2512.15920]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful method for uncovering interpretable mathematical relationships from data, offering a novel route to both scientific discovery and efficient empirical modelling.

The contributions collected here span applications from automated equation discovery and emergent-phenomena modelling to the construction of compact emulators for computationally expensive simulations. The introductory review outlines the conceptual foundations of SR, contrasts it with conventional regression approaches, and surveys its main use cases in the physical sciences, including the derivation of effective theories, empirical functional forms and surrogate models. We summarise methodological considerations such as search-space design, operator selection, complexity control, feature selection, and integration with modern AI approaches. We also highlight ongoing challenges, including scalability, robustness to noise, overfitting and computational complexity. Finally we emphasise emerging directions, particularly the incorporation of symmetry constraints, asymptotic behaviour and other theoretical information. Taken together, the papers in this Special Issue illustrate the accelerating progress of SR and its growing relevance across the physical sciences.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Science Requirement Document (SRD) for the European Solar Telescope (EST) (3rd Edition, December 2025)</a><span class="id">[1912.08650]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) included the European Solar Telescope (EST) as an ESFRI Project in its 2016 Roadmap and confirmed this status in 2021. During the Preparatory Phase (2017 to 2022), the EST Science Advisory Group (SAG) was established in 2017. Its first task was to revise the Science Requirements Document (SRD), originally formulated in 2011. This second edition of the SRD was published in December 2019 (Schlichenmaier et al. 2019, 2019arXiv191208650S). Since 2019, the EST Project Office has advanced the telescope design and developed the Science Instrumentation Suite (SIS). All telescope subsystems and the SIS have now passed their Design Reviews. Aligned with the discussions and resolutions of the SAG, the SIS comprises three categories of first-generation instruments: (1) Tunable Imaging Spectropolarimeters coupled with Fixed Band Imagers (TIS/FBIs), employing large-aperture Fabry-Pérot etalons; (2) Integral Field Spectropolarimeters based on microlens arrays (IFS-M); (3) The near-infrared spectropolarimeter EMBER (spectropolariMeter Based on slicEr-mirrors for the near-infraRed), using image-slicing technology. This configuration enables simultaneous observations of the same two-dimensional solar region across a broad wavelength range (380-2200 nm), giving EST a uniquely powerful multi-wavelength observing capability. This has made it necessary to revise the Observing Programmes so that they accurately reflect the capabilities of the SIS and ensure that all science objectives can be met. This third edition of the EST SRD integrates the outcomes of numerous SAG meetings held between 2020 and 2025 and incorporates all design developments up to 2025. It updates the Observing Programmes accordingly and assesses their alignment with the scientific objectives defined by the SAG.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benchmarking field-level cosmological inference from galaxy redshift surveys</a><span class="id">[2504.20130]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Field-level inference has emerged as a promising framework to fully harness the cosmological information encoded in next-generation galaxy surveys. It involves performing Bayesian inference to jointly estimate the cosmological parameters and the initial conditions of the cosmic field, directly from the observed galaxy density field. Yet, the scalability and efficiency of sampling algorithms for field-level inference of large-scale surveys remain unclear. To address this, we introduce a standardized benchmark using a fast and differentiable simulator for the galaxy density field based on $\texttt{JaxPM}$. We evaluate a range of sampling methods, including standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) without and within a Gibbs scheme, and both adjusted and unadjusted microcanonical samplers (MAMS and MCLMC). These methods are compared based on their efficiency, in particular the number of model evaluations required per effective posterior sample. Our findings emphasize the importance of carefully preconditioning latent variables and demonstrate the significant advantage of (unadjusted) MCLMC for scaling to $\geq 10^6$-dimensional problems. We find that MCLMC outperforms adjusted samplers by over an order-of-magnitude, with a mild scaling with the dimension of our inference problem. This benchmark, along with the associated publicly available code, is intended to serve as a basis for the evaluation of future field-level sampling strategies.

CMEs are large eruptions of magnetized plasma from the Sun's outer atmosphere or corona, that propagate outward into the interplanetary space. Over the last several decades a large amount of remote solar eruption observational data has become available from ground-based and space-borne instruments. This has recently required the development of software approaches for automated characterisation of eruptive features. Most solar feature detection and tracking algorithms currently in use have restricted applicability and complicated processing chains, while complexity in engineering machine learning (ML) training sets limit the use of data-driven approaches for tracking or solar eruptive related phenomena. Recently, we introduced Wavetrack - a general algorithmic method for smart characterization and tracking of solar eruptive features. The method, based on a-trous wavelet decomposition, intensity rankings and a set of filtering techniques, allows to simplify and automate image processing and feature tracking. Previously, we applied the method successfully to several types of remote solar observations. Here we present the natural evolution of this approach. We discuss various aspects of applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques towards segmentation of high-dynamic range heliophysics observations. We trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image segmentation models using feature masks obtained from the Wavetrack code. We present results from pre-trained models for segmentation of solar eruptive features and demonstrate their performance on a set of CME events based on SDO/AIA instrument data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">89.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17157" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backtracking Bipolar Magnetic Regions to their emergence: Two groups and their implication in the tilt measurements</a><span class="id">[2509.17157]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bipolar Magnetic Regions (BMRs) that appear on the solar photosphere are surface manifestations of the Suns internal magnetic field. With modern observations and continuous data streams, the study of BMRs has moved from manual sunspot catalogs to automated detection and tracking methods. In this work, we present an additional module to the existing BMR tracking algorithm, AutoTAB, that focuses on identifying emerging signatures of BMRs. Specifically, for regions newly detected on the solar disk, this module backtracks the BMRs to their point of emergence. From a total of about 12,000 BMRs identified by AutoTAB, we successfully backtracked 3,080 cases. Within this backtracked sample, we find two distinct populations. One group shows the expected behavior of emerging regions, in which the magnetic flux increases significantly during the emerging phase. The other group consists of BMRs whose flux, however, does not exhibit substantial growth during their evolution, the instances where our algorithm fails to capture the initial emergence of the BMRs. We classify these as discarded BMRs and examine their statistical properties separately. Our analysis shows that these discarded BMRs do not display any preferred tilt angle distribution and do not show systematic latitudinal tilt dependence, in contrast to the trends typically associated with emerging BMRs. This indicates that including such regions in statistical studies of BMR properties can distort or mask the underlying physical characteristics. We therefore emphasise the importance of excluding the discarded population from the whole dataset when analysing the statistical behavior of BMRs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">90.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14815" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterisation of the Bedretto Underground Site for Fundamental Physics Experiments</a><span class="id">[2512.14815]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Underground laboratories provide the ultra-low background and low-vibration environments essential for rare-event searches, gravitational-wave detection, and quantum-sensing technologies.

Conventional Wave Front Sensing technique (WFS), which relies on the beat between the carrier and phase-modulated (PM) sidebands, is dominated by arm-axis signals when the carrier resonates in the full interferometer. This dominance limits the detection of other optical axes, such as the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) and incident beam axes. To address this problem, we propose a novel sensing technique, &quot;Phase-Modulated-sideband $\times$ Phase-Modulated-sideband Wave Front Sensing&quot; (PMPMWFS), which demodulates the beat signal at the difference frequency between two anti-resonant PM sidebands. We derived the theoretical response of PMPMWFS and experimentally demonstrated it using the Power-Recycled X-arm (PRXARM) configuration of KAGRA. The results show that PMPMWFS effectively decouples angular fluctuation signals of the PRC and incident beam from those of the arm cavity and provides orthogonal signal components for the end mirror of the arm cavity. Furthermore, feedback control using PMPMWFS achieved stable interferometer locking for over one hour. These results demonstrate that PMPMWFS offers an effective sensing method for decoupling multiple alignment degrees of freedom in future gravitational-wave detectors.</p></div></details></article></body>
