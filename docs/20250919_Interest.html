<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14720" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gauge symmetry and the arrow of time: How to count what counts</a><span class="id">[2509.14720]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This thesis addresses two major problems in the philosophy of physics. The first is how to identify the minimal physical content of a theory; that is, what features of a theory are truly needed to make predictions, and what can be removed without changing its empirical consequences. The second is the problem of time's arrow: why time seems to have a direction, even though the fundamental laws of physics treat the past and future symmetrically. I show that answering the first question leads to insights about the second. In particular, I argue that the overall size of the Universe is not used to make predictions in cosmology, and so should not count as part of the theory's minimal physical content. Describing the Universe without this feature leads to a striking result: the arrow of time becomes a local phenomenon. Observers like us who see a Universe full of matter clumped together to form structures like stars and planets are statistically much more likely to see increasing clumpiness into the future than into the past. This tendency helps explain our experience of time's direction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards a European Quantum Act: A Two-Pillar Framework for Regulation and Innovation</a><span class="id">[2509.14262]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quantum technologies promise transformative advancements but pose significant dual-use risks. Realizing their potential while mitigating risks necessitates a robust, anticipatory, and harmonized EU regulatory framework, grounded in the precautionary principle. Such a framework must be sui generis, as foundational quantum mechanical phenomena -incl. superposition, entanglement, and tunneling -defy the intuitive classical assumptions of factual certainty, causality, and locality that underpin existing legal paradigms, demanding a bespoke regulatory architecture that contributes to the emerging lex specialis for quantum information technologies. Responding to the Quantum Europe Strategy, this contribution outlines the rationale for a dedicated European Quantum Act. Drawing lessons from legislative strategies in the semiconductor (EU/US Chips Acts) and AI (EU AI Act) domains, and analyzing US and Chinese technology policy, we argue the EU needs a 'full-stack' industrial policy. We propose the EU Quantum Act should be a two-pillar instrument, combining New Legislative Framework-style regulation with an ambitious Chips Act-style industrial and security policy. This dual approach fosters innovation through strategic investment (e.g. via a DARPA-style agency) while managing risk through clear, risk-based tiers and regulatory sandboxes. This strategy is presented as essential for EU technological sovereignty and for building a strong transatlantic tech alliance. On the international stage, we advocate for a global non-proliferation framework for quantum and AI wmd's inspired by the IAEA/NPT model and overseen by an 'International Quantum Agency'. This vision culminates in the 'Qubits for Peace' initiative, a global governance structure to ensure quantum technologies are developed safely and ethically. The article concludes by consolidating the analysis into a detailed legislative blueprint.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Burkett Hartle: a Biographical Memoir</a><span class="id">[2509.14288]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>James Burkett Hartle was a theoretical physicist who made major contributions to our understanding of relativistic stars, black holes, and cosmology. Most of his career, however, was devoted to studying the universe as a quantum system. As a result, he was known as the father of quantum cosmology. He is best known for two seminal papers with Stephen Hawking that introduced two quantum states of fundamental importance: the &quot;Hartle-Hawking vacuum&quot; for matter fields outside a black hole, and the &quot;no-boundary wave function of the universe&quot; for cosmology. Jim (as everyone called him) was a warm and caring person who was genuinely concerned with the success of his students, postdocs, and colleagues. He was generous with his time and helped to foster a culture of a welcoming family among gravitational physicists.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to be an orthodox quantum mechanic</a><span class="id">[2504.20597]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work sets out to answer a single question: what is the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics? However, we adopt a different approach to that normally used. Rather than surveying physicists, or poring over the precise details of the thoughts of Bohr and Heisenberg, we review a collection of 42 textbooks on quantum mechanics, encompassing the most popular and prominent works of this nature. We then gauge their response to 12 propositions to build up a picture of exactly what is believed by an orthodox quantum mechanic. We demonstrate that this orthodoxy has many aspects of Copenhagen-like viewpoints, but also shows some interesting emerging deviations. Moreover, it is more nuanced than some reductive characterisations that condense the orthodoxy down to the ontological primacy of the quantum state. The revealed orthodoxy has two consistent pillars: measurement inherently disturbs quantum states and these states refer to individual instances, not ensembles. More fully, it entails that individual particles exist in wave-like super-positions and present particle behaviours only when forced to by outside influences. The act of measuring such a system inherently induces random changes in its state, manifesting as a form of measurement error that corresponds to the uncertainty principle. This implies that measurement does not reveal underlying values of quantum properties.</p></div></details></article>

We report on early progress in the design of an ML-based tool to analyze students' mechanistic sensemaking, working from a coding scheme that is aligned with previous work in physics education research (PER) and amenable to recently developed ML classification strategies using language encoders. We describe pilot tests of the tool, in three versions with different language encoders, to analyze sensemaking evident in college students' written responses to brief conceptual questions. The results show, first, that the tool's measurements of sensemaking can achieve useful agreement with a human coder, and, second, that encoder design choices entail a tradeoff between accuracy and computational expense. We discuss the promise and limitations of this approach, providing examples as to how this measurement scheme may serve PER in the future. We conclude with reflections on the use of ML to support PER research, with cautious optimism for strategies of co-design between PER and ML.</p></div></details></article>

The answer can clearly be seen in the trends in global electricity generation data.
