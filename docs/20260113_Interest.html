<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06618" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wave Function Realism and the Mathematization of Nature. A Phenomenological Perspective</a><span class="id">[2601.06618]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This chapter reexamines wave function realism (WFR) through the lens of phenomenology. We begin by situating WFR within the broader debate about the ontology of the quantum state and the temptation to &quot;read off&quot; metaphysics from mathematical formalism. Against this background, we turn to the London-Bauer interpretation (LBI), the most explicit attempt to interpret quantum mechanics through phenomenological categories. On this view, the measurement transition is not a physical discontinuity but a reflective articulation of objectivity, and the wave function formally encodes the horizonal structure of world-givenness. We develop this idea by reconfiguring the notion of realism itself: not as objectivist, but as correlational and transcendental. The resulting picture suggests that quantum mechanics, rather than depicting a world &quot;minus observers,&quot; mathematically articulates the very correlation through which a world becomes manifest at all.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Looking for Work in Quantum Thermodynamics</a><span class="id">[2601.06312]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper diagnoses a much-discussed problem in quantum thermodynamics, that of generalizing classical work into the quantum domain. I begin with the no-go theorem of Perarnau-Llobet et al (2017): no universal measurement scheme for quantum work satisfies two intuitive, classically consilient desiderata. I assess this incompatibility as stemming from the measurement problem. Decoherence restores compatibility for all practical purposes, but raises questions about what 'universality' should mean and whether any measurement scheme can be 'universal'. I consider a different standard of universality – in terms of ontology – by defining a trajectory-based notion of quantum work using the quantum potential. While this preserves the classical role of work as the integral of forces over distances, and evades the tension of the no-go theorem, consilience fails elsewhere; no single quantum work concept seems capable of preserving all classical features, raising questions for what it takes for successful generalization of the work concept to quantum thermodynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Causality and Predictivity</a><span class="id">[2601.06346]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Certain approaches to quantum gravity, such as the one based on the concept of purely virtual particles (fakeons), sacrifice the cause-effect relation at very small scales to reconcile renormalizability with unitarity. Other developments have also urged caution regarding the idea of causality as a fundamental principle. In this paper, we examine the problem from multiple perspectives, including locality and predictivity, and extend the existing skepticism in several directions. Emphasizing the impact of unruly &quot;disruptors&quot;, we point out that the illusory arrow of time associated with causality and predictivity is inherently statistical. This renders the cause-effect relation strained at the microscopic level. We also show that causation is a borderline concept that demands belief in entities which can act on nature without being part of it. Ultimately, not only is renouncing microcausality a reasonable price to pay for a consistent and predictive theory of quantum gravity (as is the one based on the fakeon idea), but the very notion of causality is misleading. Resting as it does on metaphysical assumptions, it should therefore be abandoned in fundamental physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06592" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matière noire et (ou) gravitation modifiée : une approche historique et épistémologique</a><span class="id">[2601.06592]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The current standard model of cosmology assumes that the majority of matter in the Universe is made of dark matter, and that the latter is fundamentally different from ordinary matter. Dark matter can in principle explain the rotation of galaxies, the gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters or the appearance of the cosmic microwave background, the oldest light in the Universe. But does dark matter really exist? Here, we review the history of this concept and its implications for the formation and evolution of galaxies. We also consider the questions that remain, the limitations of the model, and present alternative theories, in particular modifications to the gravitional law that would – perhaps – make it possible to do without it.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07437" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum model for black holes and clocks</a><span class="id">[2601.07437]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider a stationary quantum system consisting of two non-interacting yet entangled subsystems, $\Xi$ and $\Gamma$. We identify a quantum theory characterizing $\Xi$ such that, in the quantum-to-classical crossover of the composite system, $\Gamma$ behaves as a test particle within the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild Black Hole (SBH) near its event horizon. We then show that this same quantum theory naturally provides a representation of $\Xi$ in terms of bosonic modes, whose features match those of the Hawking radiation; this facilitates the establishment of precise relations between the phenomenological parameters of the SBH and the microscopic details of the quantum model for $\Xi$. Finally, we recognize that the conditions used to characterize $\Gamma$ and $\Xi$ coincide with those required by the Page and Wootters mechanism for identifying an evolving system and an associated clock. This leads us to discuss how the quantum model for $\Xi$ endows the SBH with all the characteristics of a &quot;perfect&quot; clock.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Determinism and Indeterminism as Model Artefacts: Toward a Model-Invariant Ontology of Physics</a><span class="id">[2512.22540]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper argues that the traditional opposition between determinism and indeterminism in physics is representational rather than ontological. Deterministic-stochastic dualities are available in principle, and arise in a non-contrived way in many scientifically important models. When dynamical systems admit mathematically equivalent deterministic and stochastic formulations, their observable predictions depend only on the induced structure of correlations between preparations and measurement outcomes. I use this model-equivalence to motivate a model-invariance criterion for ontological commitment, according to which only structural features that remain stable across empirically equivalent representations, and whose physical effects are invariant under such reformulations, are candidates for realism. This yields a fallibilist form of structural realism grounded in modal robustness rather than in the specifics of any given mathematical representation. Features such as conservation laws, symmetries, and causal or metric structure satisfy this criterion and can be encoded in observable relations in mathematically intelligible ways. By contrast, the localisation of modal selection – whether in initial conditions, stochastic outcomes, or informational collapse mechanisms – is not invariant under empirically equivalent reformulations and is therefore best understood as a gauge choice rather than an ontological feature. The resulting framework explains how certain long-standing problems in the foundations of physics, including the measurement problem and the perceived conflict between physical determinism and free agency, arise from the reification of representational artefacts. By distinguishing model-invariant structure from modelling conventions, I offer a realist ontology for modern physics that combines empirical openness with resistance to metaphysical overreach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08753" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heat as a gauge connection</a><span class="id">[2503.08753]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that heat defines a gauge connection on a line bundle over work configurations. Vanishing curvature is equivalent to the local existence of entropy and temperature functions such that heat can be expressed as $TdS$. A conjecture of Jauch, that entropy and temperature arise from a conservation law, is shown to follow as a special case. Global equilibrium may nevertheless fail in the presence of a thermal analogue of geometric phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</a><span class="id">[2601.03567]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (deBroglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schrödinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introducing the Physics of Complex Systems through Videogames</a><span class="id">[2601.06230]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The purpose of this work is to explore a teaching methodology aimed at communicating topics and subjects not typically studied and analyzed in the (Italian) secondary school. We focused specifically on the use of videogames as a recreational and educational tool, grounding our approach in a broadened conceptual view in which engagement and attentional allocation interact with motivational and affective components of play. Within this perspective, the playful format is considered not only to enhance motivation and enjoyment, but also to attenuate learners' counter-arguing tendencies when confronted with unfamiliar or abstract material. Building on this framework, we developed or adapted several videogames whose central scientific topics are phase transitions, sensitivity to initial conditions, and synchronization. We had a certain number of high school students playing the games, and we asked them several questions to guide them and determine whether the communication was successful. At the end of the activity, we administered a questionnaire about the enjoyment and the difficulties encountered in each game, and the relevant critics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07089" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SMARTHEP: training PhD students in real-time analysis at the LHC and in industry</a><span class="id">[2601.07089]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this invited Editorial for Software and Computing for Big Science, we describe the SMARTHEP Innovative Training Network funded via the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions between 2021 and 2025.

All the women highlighted the performative nature of gender in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), citing (1) stereotypes that women are not analytical thinkers, or femininity being associated with &quot;being stupid&quot;; (2) the pressure to conform to the masculine norms of STEM, and (3) a pressure to perform to prove that they belong in STEM. Some of these women aligned their own perceptions of their gender with these norms, while others expressed frustration with the tension between their gender and how that is perceived by peers in STEM. This work suggests that conceptualizing gender as performance is a useful lens for understanding the oppression and underrepresentation of women and gender minorities in STEM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07635" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learning About Learning: A Physics Path from Spin Glasses to Artificial Intelligence</a><span class="id">[2601.07635]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability – from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems – it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling Gender Dynamics in Introductory Physics Labs</a><span class="id">[2509.10299]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The persistent underrepresentation of women and gender minorities within the physical sciences remains a significant issue. This study investigates gender dynamics in introductory algebra-based physics laboratories, focusing on participation, task preferences, and comfort levels. Statistical analysis revealed no significant gender difference in overall participation rates during lab activities. However, significant gender-based disparities emerged in both task preference [\(\chi^2(\text{df}=3) = 9.548,~ p = 0.023, ~ \alpha = 0.05 \)] and comfort levels [\(\chi^2(\text{df}=3) = 7.906,~ p = 0.048, ~ \alpha = 0.05\)]. Male students significantly preferred and felt more comfortable with hands-on equipment handling and data collection, whereas female students more frequently preferred and reported higher comfort with analytical and documentation tasks like note-taking, calculations, and report writing. Qualitative responses highlighted additional challenges reported by some women, including exclusion from group discussions and reluctance to contribute ideas in male-dominated groups. These findings suggest that while overall participation may appear gender-neutral, gendered patterns in task allocation and comfort persist. The results underscore the need for instructional strategies that promote equitable engagement and foster inclusive laboratory environments in physics education.</p></div></details></article>
