<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13708" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Making Symmetry Explicit: The Limits of Sophistication</a><span class="id">[2602.13708]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Symmetry is often treated in philosophy of physics as an interpretive problem. A particularly lively dispute concerns local symmetries: do they indicate surplus structure that ought to be expunged, or are they merely a harmless redundancy? One influential response favours the second option for certain theories – those dubbed internally sophisticated. And indeed, in much of physics practice, local symmetries are left implicit: one simply works &quot;up to isomorphism” without pausing over invariance. But not always. In some settings, local symmetry and invariance become pressing practical concerns for physicists. Yet philosophical discussions of sophistication have paid little sustained attention to when, and why, this happens. Surveying textbook general relativity (GR) and gauge theory, I identify the settings in which diffeomorphism invariance or gauge invariance must be handled explicitly. (Here a setting is a choice of representational framework or background assumptions within which one formulates and uses the theory – for instance, linearisation, an initial-value formulation, or a Hamiltonian $3+1$ formalism.) I propose an operational criterion – background-relative sophistication (BRS) – and argue that it accounts well for the pattern: it marks just where symmetry can stay implicit and where it must be made explicit. Quantum and subsystem settings raise a further difficulty: there, certain tasks (superposition and gluing) force symmetry into view even for theories that are BRS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14059" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Huygens-Leibniz-Lange framework for classical mechanics</a><span class="id">[2602.14059]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I discuss the physical basis of classical mechanics, such as expressed commonly using the framework of Newton's Principia. Newton's formulation of the laws of motion is seen to have quite a few ambiguities and shortcomings. Therefore I offer an alternative set of laws, based in particular on ideas of his contemporaries Huygens and Leibniz with a crucial addition by Ludwig Lange, which avoids the problems with Newton's formulation. It is shown that from these laws of motion all the usual results of classical mechanics, as it concerns the motion of idealized point masses, can be rederived. The application of these principles to relativistic point particles is discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The road of quantum entanglement: from Einstein to 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics</a><span class="id">[2602.14601]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explain the achievements that were awarded 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics, as well as the preceding and the later developments.

B. Fourier in his \emph{Théorie Analytique de la Chaleur} of 1822 introduced, amongst other things, two ideas that have made a fundamental impact in fields as diverse as Mathematical Physics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Music. The first one of these, a method to find the coefficients for a trigonometric series describing an arbitrary function, was very early on picked up by G. Ohm and H. Helmholtz as the foundation for a theory of \emph{musical tones}. The second one, which is described by Fourier's double integral, became the basis for treating certain kinds of infinity in discontinuous functions, as shown by A. De Morgan in his 1842 \emph{The Differential and Integral Calculus}. Both make up the fundamental basis for what is now commonly known as the \emph{Fourier theorem}. With the help of P. A. M. Dirac's insights into the nature of these infinities, we can have a compact description of the frequency spectrum of a function of time, or conversely of a waveform corresponding to a given function of frequency. This paper, using solely primary sources, takes us from the physics of heat propagation to the modern theory of musical signals. It concludes with some considerations on the inherent duality of time and frequency emerging from Fourier's theorem.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Students perceptions of their learning experience and self efficacy in physics online class with project based learning</a><span class="id">[2602.13251]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Project Based Learning (PBL), recognized as an active learning strategy, has been linked to self efficacy of student in prior studies, including those within Physics Education Research. Meanwhile, technological advancements have significantly facilitated the optimization of diverse learning modes, including online learning. However, comprehensive investigations addressing questions such as how students perceive PBL and their self efficacy, what forms of PBL design they prefer, and what benefits and challenges they encounter during its implementation remain underexplored in existing literature. This study sought to uncover the experiences of ten students through longitudinal observation in an online PBL Physics class, focusing on its influence on their self efficacy within a phenomenological study. Data were collected via semi structured, in depth interviews. Social Cognitive Theory, Self Efficacy theory of Bandura, and theoretical framework for the impact of project based learning on educational outcomes were employed as guiding frameworks to shape the interpretation of students experiences and perspectives. Through Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), the researchers identified four primary themes representing the experience of students. There are, variety of unique learning experiences based on students perceptions about their character, pivotal experience as a catalyst in the learning process, student self efficacy in Project Based Learning, and self reflection based on prior experience. The findings contribute novel insights for educators in implementing PBL, particularly in online contexts, by highlighting strategies to accommodate diverse student personality characteristics. Moreover, the study provides helpful references for longitudinal research on the interplay between PBL and self efficacy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13302" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex networks map test anxiety and wellbeing levels in students and ChatGPT</a><span class="id">[2602.13302]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Academic STEM evaluation can elicit anxiety, yet routine grading rarely captures how students semantically frame exams and wellbeing. We reconstruct these framings using behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMNs), that is, feature-rich networks of concepts linked by memory recalls and enriched with affective ratings and concreteness norms. We build BFMNs from 994 participants spanning STEM experts (N1 = 59), Italian high-schoolers (N2 = 206), physics undergraduates (N3 = 10), psychology undergraduates with math-anxiety levels (N4 = 301), and simulated students (N5 = 497) personified by a large language model (GPT-OSS 20B). Across all human groups, the concepts &quot;exam&quot; and &quot;grade&quot; were (i) perceived negatively, (ii) connected primarily to negatively valenced memory recalls, indicating a clustering of negative emotions around assessment, and (iii) framed through concepts eliciting fear and anticipation in most groups, including physics undergraduates (z-scores in the range [2.04, 2.53]). The semantic neighbourhoods of &quot;anxiety&quot; and &quot;exam&quot; overlapped three times more in human students than in GPT-based simulations, providing structural evidence of test anxiety in student populations. By contrast, experts displayed a neutral and more concrete network neighbourhood for &quot;exam&quot; (z = 1.87), with no clear trace of test anxiety. These negative assessment framings coexisted with positive representations of &quot;wellbeing&quot;, which were rich in concrete associations in humans but linked to more abstract concepts in GPT digital twins. Overall, our results show that BFMNs offer a quantitative and interpretable framework to study academic anxiety and to distinguish human affective framing from current AI-based simulations</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10301" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum three-body problem for nuclear physics</a><span class="id">[2504.10301]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A brief excursion into the three-body problem in quantum mechanics is presented for graduate students or researchers in nuclear physics. Starting from single-particle coordinates, the three-body Schrödinger equation is systematically transformed into a representation in Jacobi coordinates. Gradient, Laplacian, and kinetic energy operators are explicitly derived using the multivariable chain rule. Faddeev equations are reformulated in hyperspherical coordinates. In all transformations (from single-particle coordinates to Jacobi coordinates, rotation between Jacobi coordinates and from Jacobi coordinates to hyperspherical coordinates) the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is computed to ensure correct transformation of volume elements. The Faddeev equations in hyperspherical coordinates are projected onto a hyperspherical harmonics basis, leading to the coupled hyperradial equations that define the hyperspherical harmonics method.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Interplanetary Habitable Zone</a><span class="id">[2602.13404]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The concept of a system-wide measure of the sustainment of life (habitability) for space-faring interplanetary species is introduced and explored. Although largely agnostic to the details of how interplanetary life might operate (e.g., via technology or by utilizing organism traits that are, as of now, unknown to us), some assumptions must be made about energy harvesting, orbital mobility costs, radiation risks, and resource requirements. A multi-modal figure of merit is developed for evaluating an interplanetary habitable zone (IHZ). An agent-based model is also developed to simulate the dispersal of interplanetary life in a planetary system and characterize the IHZ. For the solar system, resource weightings between planetary bodies dictate many overall behaviors, including the sequence of migration from Earth to the Moon, Mars, and asteroid belt. Comparisons with the Trappist-1 exoplanetary system also point to critical sensitivities in the balance between resource availability and risk or cost factors (e.g., radiation risks and orbital Delta-v costs) that determine the structure of an IHZ. Results suggest that our solar system may have an inherent, and significant, advantage for a space-faring species over a system like Trappist-1. This modeling approach may also have application to emerging space economies in our own solar system.</p></div></details></article></body>
