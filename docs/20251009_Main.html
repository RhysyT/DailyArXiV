Both are potential candidates for dark matter. Using the scalar modified equations of state, we calculate models for white dwarf stars and compare their radii and masses with observed mass-radius data. The comparison results in stringent constraints on the masses of the particles and the coupling parameters. For a wide range of particle masses and coupling parameters, constraints from the white dwarf equation of state surpass existing limits, outperforming also dedicated laboratory searches. The remarkable accuracy of modern white-dwarf mass-radius relation data, exemplified by Sirius B, now allows stringent tests of dense-matter physics and constraints on new particle scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of the rapidly varying white dwarf ZTF 1851+1714</a><span class="id">[2510.06331]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on phase-resolved optical spectroscopy and photometry in the R and B bands of the white dwarf candidate ZTF 185139.81+171430.3. The source has been reported to be variable with a large amplitude of close to 1 magnitude, in the R band, and a short period of 12.37 min. We confirm this period and interpret it as the spin period of the white dwarf. The optical spectrum shows emission lines from hydrogen and helium superposed on a featureless continuum. The continuum changes shape throughout a cycle, such that it is redder when the source is bright. There is tentative evidence for Doppler shifts in the emission lines during the spin cycle with an amplitude of a few tens of km s$^{-1}$. Notably, the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines exhibit different radial velocity amplitudes, suggesting that they come from different emission regions. We also identify a candidate orbital period of 1.00 hr, based on potential orbital sidebands. These features - Doppler shifts modulated at the spin frequency, brightness variations, and continuum shape changes - are consistent with the accretion curtain model, in which material is funneled from a truncated inner disc along magnetic field lines onto the magnetic poles of the white dwarf.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Are all Binary Black Holes Detected from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Follow the Universal Time-Delay Distributions?

We present a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass-dependent DTD using the BBHs from the GWTC-4 that avoids restrictive assumptions of only power-law forms. Our analysis reveals for the first time the signature for mass-dependent evolutionary pathways: lower-mass systems ($20$-$40\,M_\odot$) are consistent with a scale-invariant DTD, whereas higher-mass BBHs ($40$-$100\,M_\odot$) provide the first direct tentative evidence of DTD that deviate from simple power laws, with a pronounced preference for rapid mergers around $2-6$ Gyrs. These findings reveal the advantage of the non-parametric technique in reconstructing the mass-dependent DTD and discovering for the first-time the presence of a potential time-scale associated with high-mass GW events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST occultation reveals unforeseen complexity in Chariklo's ring system</a><span class="id">[2510.06366]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ring systems have recently been discovered around several small bodies in the outer Solar System through stellar occultations. While such measurements provide key information on ring geometry and dynamical interactions, little is known about their composition, grain size distribution, origin, lifetime, or evolutionary pathways. Here we report near-infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of a stellar occultation by the Centaur (10199) Chariklo, providing unprecedented constraints on the material properties of a small-body ring system and offering insights into their origin and evolution. These measurements reveal that Chariklo's inner dense ring contains predominantly micrometer-sized particles and exhibits a significant increase in opacity compared to previous observations, suggesting active replenishment events. Most strikingly, the outer ring shows a much weaker near-infrared occultation signature than in earlier visible-light detections. This discrepancy may indicate ongoing material loss, implying that the outer ring is transient, or it may reflect wavelength-dependent opacity consistent with a dusty structure dominated by $0.2$-$0.5$ $\mu$m silicate grains. These scenarios, not mutually exclusive, point to an unprecedented level of complexity in small-body ring systems, unlike anything observed around other minor bodies in the Solar System.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The first proper motion measurement of the acceleration regions in the large-scale jets of SS 433 powering the W50 nebula</a><span class="id">[2510.06431]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on new Chandra ACIS-I observations of the X-ray knots located in the western and eastern lobes of W50 associated with the parsec-scale jets of the Galactic microquasar SS 433. These knots are likely counterparts of the recently detected very-high-energy ($E&gt;100$ GeV) gamma-ray emission by HAWC and H.E.S.S. These findings, together with the ultra-high-energy signal recently reported by the LHAASO collaboration, have established the SS 433/W50 system as a unique jet-driven PeVatron candidate. Combining new and archival Chandra data, we perform the first proper motion search of the X-ray knot structures over a time interval spanning approximately 20 years. We found no statistically significant motion of these knots at the 3$\sigma$ confidence level, and place an upper limit of $&lt;$ 0.019-0.033$c$ (5,800-9,800 km s$^{-1}$) for the speed of the innermost knots at an assumed distance $d=5.5$ kpc. Combined with the velocities reported in the literature, the upstream speed in the shock rest frame would reach several 10$^4$ km s$^{-1}$, suggesting that highly efficient particle acceleration, approaching the Bohm limit, is occurring. The absence of significant motion of the knots suggests the presence of a standing recollimation shock, formed by the balance between the jet pressure and the external pressure. This interpretation is consistent with the expected occurrence of such shocks at 20-30 pc from SS 433, matching the location of the observed knots.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation magnetohydrodynamics modeling of an impulsively driven chromospheric jet in the solar atmosphere</a><span class="id">[2510.06482]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we present a numerical simulation of an impulsively driven chromospheric jet in the solar atmosphere using the non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations coupled with frequency- and angle-averaged radiation transport equations. These include the dynamics of the radiation energy density and radiation flux. The jet is initiated by a localized Gaussian pulse applied to the vertical velocity component in the upper chromosphere (y = 1.75 Mm), producing a collimated plasma structure that exhibits characteristics similar to macrospicules. We focus on the formation and evolution of the chromospheric jet as it propagates through an optically thin region encompassing the upper chromosphere and solar corona, where both the Planck-averaged absorption and Rosseland-averaged scattering opacities are low. Although radiation transport terms only slightly affect the jet's morphology, they play a significant role in governing radiative processes in the corona. In particular, radiation transport contributes to the dissipation of the chromospheric jet, which effectively acts as a radiative cooling mechanism as the jet evolves through the optically thin solar corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ensemble seismic study of the properties of the core of Red Clump stars</a><span class="id">[2510.06494]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Red clump stars still pose open questions regarding several physical processes, such as the mixing around the core, or the nuclear reactions, which are ill-constrained by theory and experiments. The oscillations of red clump stars, which are of mixed gravito-acoustic nature, allow us to directly investigate the interior of these stars and thereby better understand their physics. In particular, the measurement of their period spacing is a good probe of the structure around the core. We aim to explain the distribution of period spacings in red clump stars observed by Kepler by testing different prescriptions of core-boundary mixing and nuclear reaction rate. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, we computed several grids of core-helium burning tracks, with varying masses and metallicities. Each of these grids have been computed assuming a certain core boundary mixing scheme, or carbon-alpha reaction rate. We then sampled these grids, in a Monte-Carlo fashion, using observational spectroscopic metallicities and seismic masses priors, in order to retrieve a period spacing distribution that we compared to the observations. We found that the best fitting distribution was obtained when using a &quot;maximal overshoot&quot; core-boundary scheme, which has similar seismic properties as a model whose modes are trapped outside a semi-convective region, and which does not exhibit core breathing pulses at the end of the core-helium burning phase. If no mode trapping is assumed, then no core boundary mixing scheme is compatible with the observations. Moreover, we found that extending the core with overshoot worsens the fit. Additionally, reducing the carbon-alpha reaction rate (by around 15%) improves the fit to the observed distribution. Finally, we noted that an overpopulation of early red clump stars with period spacing values around 250s is predicted by the models but not found in the observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Holes and their Mass Spectra: The Effects of Mergers and Accretion within Stasis Cosmologies</a><span class="id">[2510.06551]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A variety of processes in the very early universe can give rise to a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with an extended mass spectrum. For certain mass spectra of this sort, it has been shown that the evaporation of these PBHs into radiation can drive the universe toward an epoch of cosmological stasis which can persist for a significant number of $e$-folds of cosmological expansion. However, in general, the initial mass spectrum which characterizes a population of PBHs at the time of production can subsequently be distorted by processes such as mergers and accretion. In this paper, we examine the effects that these processes have on the spectra that lead to a PBH-induced stasis. Within such stasis models, we find that mergers have only a negligible effect on these spectra within the regime of interest for stasis. We likewise find that the effect of accretion is negligible in many cases of interest. However, we find that the effect of accretion on the PBH mass spectrum is non-negligible in situations in which this spectrum is particularly broad. In such situations, the stasis epoch is abridged or, in extreme cases, does not occur at all. Thus accretion plays a non-trivial role in constraining the emergence of stasis within scenarios which lead to extended PBH mass spectra.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the Orbital Dynamics of the Hot Jupiter WASP-12b with New Transit Times</a><span class="id">[2510.06589]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we examine the transit timing variations (TTVs) of the extensively studied hot Jupiter WASP-12b using a comprehensive dataset of 391 transit light curves. The dataset includes 7 new photometric observations obtained with the 1.3 m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope, the 0.61 m VASISTHA telescope, and the 0.3 m AG Optical IDK telescope, along with 119 light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), 97 from the Exoplanet Transit Database (ETD), 34 from the ExoClock Project, and 134 from previously published sources. To ensure homogeneity and precision, we modeled all 391 light curves and determined their mid-transit times. A detailed transit timing analysis revealed a significant orbital decay rate of $-30.31 \, \mathrm{ms \, yr^{-1}}$, corresponding to a stellar tidal quality factor of $Q'_\star = 1.61 \times 10^{5}$, thereby confirming that the orbit of WASP-12b is indeed decaying rapidly. Furthermore, the computation of model selection metrics ($\chi^2_r$, BIC, AIC) favors orbital decay as the most likely explanation. However, the presence of an eccentricity above the threshold value allows apsidal precession to remain a viable alternative. We also derived a planetary Love number of $k_p = 0.66 \pm 0.28$, consistent with Jupiter's value, suggesting a similar internal density distribution. Therefore, while orbital decay is strongly supported, apsidal precession cannot be ruled out as another contributing effect, highlighting the necessity of continued high-precision monitoring to resolve the system's orbital evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dual perspectives on GX 17+2: a simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR study</a><span class="id">[2510.06614]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We performed the first simultaneous NICER &amp; NuSTAR spectral and timing study of the Sco-like Z source GX 17+2. The source traced the full Z track during four observations. We detect signatures of relativistic reflection in the broadband spectra and report results using a reflection framework. The disk is relatively close to the innermost stable circular orbit ($\sim$ 1-4 R$_{ISCO}$), which agrees with previous studies of GX 17+2, but the location of the inner disk is farther out in the horizontal branch (HB) and moves inward toward the flaring branch (FB). We find the FB to be the point of closest approach of the disk to the neutron star. We qualitatively conclude that the evolution of the source along the HID is that of a relatively truncated disk in the HB ($\sim$ 4 R$_{ISCO}$) that approaches the neutron star as it goes along the HID towards the normal branch (NB), soft apex (SA), and finally the FB. We attribute the source evolution along the Z track to varying mass accretion rate and disk instabilities. Rms variability increases from the NB towards the SA and then drops to a constant along the FB indicating that the observed variability likely originates from the disk/boundary layer rather than the corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benchmarking AI-evolved cosmological structure formation</a><span class="id">[2510.06731]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The potential of deep learning-based image-to-image translations has recently attracted significant attention. One possible application of such a framework is as a fast, approximate alternative to cosmological simulations, which would be particularly useful in various contexts, including covariance studies, investigations of systematics, and cosmological parameter inference. To investigate different aspects of learning-based cosmological mappings, we choose two approaches for generating suitable cosmological matter fields as datasets: a simple analytical prescription provided by the Zel'dovich approximation, and a numerical N-body method using the Particle-Mesh approach. The evolution of structure formation is modeled using U-Net, a widely employed convolutional image translation framework. Because of the lack of a controlled methodology, validation of these learned mappings requires multiple benchmarks beyond simple visual comparisons and summary statistics. A comprehensive list of metrics is considered, including higher-order correlation functions, conservation laws, topological indicators, and statistical independence of density fields. We find that the U-Net approach performs well only for some of these physical metrics, and accuracy is worse at increasingly smaller scales, where the dynamic range in density is large. By introducing a custom density-weighted loss function during training, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the U-Net results at smaller scales. This study provides an example of how a family of physically motivated benchmarks can, in turn, be used to fine-tune optimization schemes – such as the density-weighted loss used here – to significantly enhance the accuracy of scientific machine learning approaches by focusing attention on relevant features.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diagnosing the Properties and Evolutionary Fates of Black Hole and Wolf-Rayet X-ray Binaries as Potential Gravitational Wave Sources for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Network</a><span class="id">[2510.06741]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>IC 10 X-1, NGC 300 X-1, and Cyg X-3 represent a unique class of X-ray binaries consisting of a stellar-mass black hole (BH) accreting material from a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star companion. These systems are particularly intriguing due to their short orbital periods (less than 1.5 d), making them promising progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) sources detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. With a newly implemented prescription for accretion efficiency in the standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) framework and a corrected treatment of dynamical tides, we present for the \textit{first} time detailed binary evolution models to diagnose their properties at different evolutionary states and evaluate their fates as potential GW sources detectable by the LVK network. With additional constraints on the observed properties of IC 10 X-1 and NGC 300 X-1, we determine that the upper limit of the BH mass in these systems (IC 10 X-1: $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 25\, M_\odot$, NGC 300 X-1: $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 15\, M_\odot$) is much lower than previously estimated. Both systems are expected to form binary black holes (BBHs) that will merge within a Hubble time, unless the BH in NGC 300 X-1 has a mass of $9\,M_\odot$, the lower limit estimated in a previous study based on the continuum-fitting method employing a relativistic slim-disc model. For Cyg X-3, we find that the upper limit on the BH spin magnitude cannot exceed 0.6. Interestingly, the WR star in Cyg X-3 is likely to form a lower-mass gap BH, and the resulting binary BH system will merge within the Hubble time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identifying the secondary jet in the RadioAstron image of OJ 287</a><span class="id">[2510.06744]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 136 year long optical light curve of OJ 287 is explained by a binary black hole model where the secondary is in a 12 year orbit around the primary. Impacts of the secondary on the accretion disk of the primary generate a series of optical flares which follow a quasi-Keplerian relativistic mathematical model. The orientation of the binary in space is determined from the behavior of the primary jet. Here we ask how the jet of the secondary black hole projects onto the sky plane. Assuming that the jet is initially perpendicular to the disk, and that it is ballistic, we follow its evolution after the Lorentz transformation to the observer's frame. Since the orbital speed of the secondary is of the order of one-tenth of the speed of light, the result is a change in the jet direction by more than a radian during an orbital cycle. We match the theoretical jet line with the recent 12 $\mu$as-resolution RadioAstron map of OJ 287, and determine the only free parameter of the problem, the apparent speed of the jet relative to speed of light. It turns out that the Doppler factor of the jet, $\delta\sim5$, is much lower than in the primary jet. Besides following a unique shape of the jet path, the secondary jet is also distinguished by a different spectral shape than in the primary jet. The present result on the spectral shape agrees with the huge optical flare of 2021 November 12, also arising from the secondary jet.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Giant Peanut-shaped Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Emitter Off the Galactic Plane</a><span class="id">[2510.06786]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-high-energy (UHE), exceeding 100 TeV (10^12 electronvolts), {\gamma}-rays manifests extreme particle acceleration in astrophysical sources. Recent observations by {\gamma}-ray telescopes, particularly by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), have revealed a few tens of UHE sources, indicating numerous Galactic sources capable of accelerating particles to PeV (10^15 electronvolts) energies. However, discerning the dominant acceleration mechanisms (leptonic versus hadronic), the relative contributions of specific source classes, and the role of particle transport in shaping their observed emission are central goals of modern UHE astrophysics. Here we report the discovery of a giant UHE {\gamma}-ray emitter at -17.5° off the Galactic plane - a region where UHE {\gamma}-ray sources are rarely found. The emitter exhibits a distinctive asymmetric shape, resembling a giant &quot;Peanut&quot; spanning 0.45° \times 4.6°, indicative of anisotropic particle distribution over a large area. A highly aged millisecond pulsar (MSP) J0218+4232 is the sole candidate accelerator positionally coincident with the Peanut region. Its association with UHE {\gamma}-rays extending to 0.7 PeV, if confirmed, would provide the first evidence of a millisecond pulsar powering PeV particles. Such a finding challenges prevailing models, which posit that millisecond pulsars cannot sustain acceleration to PeV energies. The detection reveals fundamental gaps in understanding particle acceleration, cosmic-ray transport, and interstellar magnetic field effects, potentially revealing new PeV accelerator (PeVatron) classes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hard X-ray view of two $γ$-ray detected low-luminosity active galactic nuclei: NGC 315 and NGC 4261</a><span class="id">[2510.06810]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aims. The accretion disk of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) is a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Our goal is to find evidence of RIAF radiation from LLAGNs with jets and analyze their radiation properties, which also adds samples to future research on LLAGNs. Methods. Weconducted an analysis of the X-ray data obtained from NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of NGC 315 and NGC 4261, encompassing both timing and spectral investigations. The joint X-ray spectra of the two LLAGNs were fitted using various functional forms and radiative models in XSPEC. Results. No significant variability on timescales of days is observed for both NGC 315 and NGC 4261. The X-ray continuum emission of NGC 315 is suitable for cutoff power-law (PL) fitting, yielding a cutoff energy of Ecut = 18.45 keV, which is the lowest value found in LLAGNssofar. In contrast, the X-ray continuum of NGC 4261 is composed of two PL components, with no signs of a cutoff energy. A prominent neutral Fe K{\alpha} line is observed in NGC 315, while an ionized Fe XXV line is seen in NGC 4261. The derived reflection fractions are R = 0.61 for NGC 315 and R = 0.18 for NGC 4579. Neither NGC 315 nor NGC 4261 shows evidence of a Compton reflection bump. Conclusions. The X-ray spectral characteristics support the RIAF emission as the dominant origin of the X-rays in both sources, although an additional soft PL component originating from the inner jet is observed in NGC 4261. The higher reflection fraction compared to other LLAGNs, along with the detection of a neutral Fe K{\alpha} line, suggests the existence of a truncated accretion disk with a relatively small radius in NGC 315. Bremsstrahlung radiation appears to be the dominant cooling mechanism for the plasma in NGC315, while Comptonization within the RIAF is more likely responsible for the X-ray emission in NGC 4261.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recasting the nature of INTEGRAL hard X-ray transients previously classified as active galactic nuclei</a><span class="id">[2510.06920]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new broad-band X-ray results aimed at the identification and characterization of four poorly studied hard X-ray transients discovered by INTEGRAL: IGR J16426+6536, IGR J09446-2636, IGR J21268+6203, and IGR J02447+7046. The key properties and X-ray behavior of these sources have remained largely unknown until now. We investigated the temporal, spectral, and energetic characteristics of their hard X-ray outbursts detected above 20 keV by INTEGRAL. In addition, we performed a systematic analysis of unpublished archival soft X-ray observations below 10 keV, enabling a full exploration of their large INTEGRAL error circles in search of the most likely soft X-ray counterparts. Within their arcsecond-sized X-ray error circles, we identified single optical/near-infrared counterparts for each source. We analyzed their photometric properties to constrain the nature of the systems. Our results show that the X-ray properties of these four transients are inconsistent with the previously proposed extragalactic AGN origin, and instead support a Galactic nature for all of them. Specifically, we propose a very faint X-ray transient classification for IGR J16426+6536, a nearby flaring star for IGR J09446-2636 and IGR J21268+6203, finally a gamma-ray binary nature for IGR J02447+7046.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06939" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is the high-energy environment of K2-18b special?</a><span class="id">[2510.06939]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>K2-18b lies near the radius valley that separates super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, marking a key transitional regime in planetary and atmospheric composition. The system offers a valuable opportunity to study how M-dwarf high-energy stellar radiation influences atmospheric stability and the potential for sustaining volatile species, especially important in the context of the upcoming ELT and its ANDES spectrograph. This study characterizes the high-energy environment of K2-18 with X-ray observations from eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. We derive a representative 0.2-2 keV X-ray flux with an APEC thermal plasma model fitted with the Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA). With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star, we estimate the photo-evaporation mass loss of exoplanet K2-18b using the energy-limited model. In addition, we examine the thermal structure of the system based on a hydrodynamic model. In 100 ks XMM-Newton observations we identified K2-18 as a very faint X-ray source with $\mathrm{F_X = 10^{-15}\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, with an activity level of (Lx/Lbol) $\sim 10^{-5}$. A small flare has been detected during the observation. The planet is irradiated by an X-ray flux of $\mathrm{F_{pl,X} = 12\pm3\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The X-ray flux measurement of K2-18 gives important limitations for atmospheric escape and photochemical modeling of its exoplanets. Despite its near orbit around an M-dwarf star, K2-18b's low activity level environment suggests that it can retain an atmosphere, supporting recent tentative detections of atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding an origin of palladium in metal-poor stars based on the non-LTE analysis of Pd I lines</a><span class="id">[2510.06968]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Palladium is one of poorly observed neutron-capture elements. Abundance determinations for stellar samples covering a broad metallicity range are needed for better understanding the mechanisms of Pd synthesis during the Galaxy evolution. We aim to obtain accurate abundances of Pd for the Sun and the sample of metal-poor stars based on the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) line formation for Pd I. We present a new, comprehensive model atom of Pd I. Abundances of Pd, Sr, Ba, and Eu were derived for 48 stars from the non-LTE analyses of high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra provided by the ESO archives. Non-LTE leads to weakened Pd I lines and positive non-LTE abundance corrections growing from 0.2 dex for the solar lines up to 0.8 dex for the lines in the most luminous star of the sample. Depending on a treatment of inelastic collisions with hydrogen atoms, the solar non-LTE abundance amounts to log eps = 1.61+-0.02 to 1.70+-0.02 and agrees within the error bars with the meteoritic abundance log eps_met = 1.65. Non-LTE largely removes the discrepancies in the LTE abundances between the giant and dwarf stars of similar metallicities. Palladium tightly correlates with Eu in the -1.71 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -0.56 range indicating the r- and s-process contributions to Pd synthesis of approximately 70% and 30%, respectively. Palladium is of pure r-process origin in our two r-II stars, and a dominant contribution of the r-process to the Pd abundances is found for another two very metal-poor (VMP, [Fe/H] &lt; -2) stars. The two VMP stars, which are strongly enhanced with Sr relative to Ba and Eu, reveal also enhancements with Pd. We propose that the source of extra Sr and Pd in these stars are VMP, fast rotating massive stars. Non-LTE is essential for obtaining the observational constraints to future models of the Galactic Pd evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06978" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protoplanetary disc population synthesis I. Constraining disc parameters to reproduce disc observations</a><span class="id">[2510.06978]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Protoplanetary discs are the birthplaces of planets. Recent studies highlight the role of stellar mass sampling in determining disc lifetimes from the observed fraction of stars with discs. Low-mass stars tend to host longer-lived discs, allowing planet formation via solid accretion. Observations also reveal a strong correlation between stellar (and substellar) mass and accretion rate, typically following $\dot{M}\propto M_\star^2$. Aims. We aim to identify the optimal parameters of a disc evolution model that reproduces both the observed disc fractions and accretion rates in young stellar populations. Methods. We performed a population synthesis study exploring different dependencies of the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ on stellar mass. Disc evolution includes viscous accretion and photoevaporation (internal and external). Initial disc masses and radii were drawn from observationally motivated distributions, while stellar masses followed a given distribution and a time-dependent star formation rate (SFR) was introduced. Results. Matching observed disc fractions and accretion trends requires $\alpha$ to increase with stellar mass. External photoevaporation is necessary to produce low-mass discs with high accretion rates, and a time-dependent SFR enhances accretion in young clusters while extending disc lifetimes in older ones. A stellar mass cut-off reproduces the distance-dependent biases in observed disc fractions. Conclusions. Both stellar and environmental effects are essential to explain the observed properties of protoplanetary discs. A stellar-mass-dependent viscosity reproduces the $\dot{M}$-$M_\star$ relation, while external photoevaporation and extended star formation histories shape the accretion rate distribution across environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing the Temporally Stable Bimodal Energy Distribution of FRB 20121102A with a Tripled Burst Set from AI Detections</a><span class="id">[2510.07002]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Active repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), with their large number of bursts, burst energy distribution, and their potential energy evolution, offer critical insights into the FRBs emission mechanisms. Traditional pipelines search for bursts through conducting dedispersion trials and looking for signals above certain fluence thresholds, both of which could result in missing weak and narrow-band bursts. In order to improve the completeness of the burst set, we develop an End-to-end DedispersE-agnostic Nonparametric AI model (EDEN), which directly detect bursts from dynamic spectrum and is the first detection pipeline that operates without attempting dedispersion. We apply EDEN to archival FAST L-band observations during the extreme active phase of the repeating source FRB 20121102A, resulting in the largest burst set for any FRB to date, which contains 5,927 individual bursts, tripling the original burst set. The much enhanced completeness enables a refined analysis of the temporal behavior of energy distribution, revealing that the bimodal energy distribution remains stable over time. It is rather an intrinsic feature of the emission mechanisms than a consequence of co-evolving with burst rate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling the formation of N2 and CH4 frost on Pluto's slopes</a><span class="id">[2510.07003]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context:Previous studies suggested that these frosts could result from the peculiar insolation driven by the geometry of these slopes, but this has never been quantitatively tested. We aim to investigate the origin, stability, and potential role in Pluto's volatile cycle of these localized frost deposits. Methods:We implemented a new sub-grid-scale slope parameterization in the Pluto Volatile Transport Model, which accounts for the specific solar irradiation and resulting surface and subsurface temperatures on sloped terrains. This parameterization also allows the condensation and sublimation of volatiles (either N2 or CH4) on slopes, including the effect of large-scale transport of these species, which is key to determining the amount of frost that forms or disappears. Results: Our simulations reproduce the observed CH4 frost on North-facing slopes as seasonal deposits currently sublimating, predict perennial CH4 frost on South-facing slopes, and show that slope microclimates should not alter global volatile cycles. Conclusions: Seasonal and perennial N2 and CH4 frosts can form across Pluto's slopes, even in its darkest and warmest regions, due to the locally reduced sunlight received on inclined terrain. Nevertheless, despite Pluto's abundance of sloped surfaces, slope microclimates appear to have only a minor effect on the planet's global volatile cycles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prolonged fallback and late-time rebrightening episodes in stellar tidal disruptions as imprints of a galactic environment</a><span class="id">[2510.07026]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extend the classical Keplerian framework of existing analytic TDE models by incorporating the gravitational potential of a spherically symmetric galactic mass distribution. We then demonstrate that this broader structure imprints light curve features beyond the predictive scope of traditional models, such as phases of shallower-than-standard decay and late-time rebrightening episodes. Importantly, our framework predicts the occurrence of environment-induced rebrightenings but only on very long timescales, unless the host environment is unrealistically ultra-compact. This means the early evolution of TDEs occurring in typical galaxies is essentially untouched by the host potential, which explains why Keplerian models have been so successful in describing the first few years after disruption. To illustrate, we applied our model to the TDE candidate eRASSt J133157.9-324321 (J1331), the event with the longest reported rebrightening interval, and find that even matching its ${\sim}$30-year rebrightening would demand an implausibly dense host. This demonstrates the limits of environmental effects as an explanation for early rebrightenings reported in the literature. More broadly, our work shows that while the host galaxy leaves TDEs nearly Keplerian at early times, it actively shapes their long-term evolution and can drive departures from the canonical $t^{-5/3}$ decay law. These delayed signals give us a testable way to see how the host galaxy shapes the event, and they may even offer clues about the galaxy's underlying structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07131" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CURLING - II. Improvement on the $H_{0}$ Inference from Pixelized Cluster Strong Lens Modeling</a><span class="id">[2510.07131]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) provide a powerful, independent method to measure the Hubble constant, $H_{0}$, through time delays between their multiple images. The accuracy of this measurement depends critically on both the precision of time delay estimation and the robustness of lens modeling. In many current cluster-scale modeling algorithms, all multiple images used for modeling are simplified as point sources to reduce computational costs. In the first paper of the CURLING program, we demonstrated that such a point-like approximation can introduce significant uncertainties and biases in both magnification reconstruction and cosmological inference. In this study, we explore how such simplifications affect $H_0$ measurements from glSNe. We simulate a lensed supernova at $z=1.95$, lensed by a galaxy cluster at $z=0.336$, assuming time delays are measured from LSST-like light curves. The lens model is constructed using JWST-like imaging data, utilizing both Lenstool and a pixelated method developed in CURLING. Under a fiducial cosmology with $H_0=70\rm \ km \ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$, the Lenstool model yields $H_0=69.91^{+6.27}_{-5.50}\rm \ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$, whereas the pixelated framework improves the precision by over an order of magnitude, $H_0=70.39^{+0.82}_{-0.60}\rm \ km \ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$. Our results indicate that in the next-generation observations (e.g., JWST), uncertainties from lens modeling dominate the error budget for $H_0$ inference, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the extended surface brightness of multiple images to fully leverage the potential of glSNe for cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Archival Inference for Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes in Space-Based Gravitational Wave Observations</a><span class="id">[2510.07174]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Space-based gravitational-wave observatories will detect the early inspiral of stellar-mass binary black holes and can track their eccentricity evolution. However, untargeted searches in the space band are computationally demanding and require relatively high detection thresholds (signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 15$). Information from ground-based detections can significantly shrink the parameter space for space-band analyses and thereby substantially reduce the detection threshold. We present a Bayesian inference pipeline for ground-triggered archival space-band analyses that includes eccentricity. Using ground-informed priors, we demonstrate that with one year of LISA or TianQin data a GW190521-like source with signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 7$ can be distinguished and tightly constrained. In this setup, space observations sharpened the redshifted chirp mass from $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})M_\odot$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})M_\odot$, and constrain the eccentricity to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ around the injected value $e_{0.01\mathrm{Hz}}=0.1$. These results demonstrate that inference of eccentric stellar-mass binary black holes in noisy space-band data is practically feasible, supports an expanded yield of multiband detections, and strengthens prospects for future astrophysical and gravitational tests.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fomalhaut's debris disc is not dominated by primordial Plutos</a><span class="id">[2510.07187]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A key challenge in debris-disc science is that we do not know the masses of debris discs, nor the sizes of the largest debris bodies. This is because modern observations can only detect objects up to centimetre sizes, whilst larger planetesimals, which dominate disc mass, remain hidden. We must therefore use other arguments, such as dynamics, to indirectly infer disc masses and body sizes. This paper presents a new method, applicable to narrow debris discs like Fomalhaut. We argue that such discs cannot be too massive, nor the largest bodies too large, otherwise they would self-scatter and the disc would be much broader than observed. Using n-body dynamics and collisional theory, we demonstrate that the mass of Fomalhaut's disc cannot be dominated by primordial Plutos. Instead, if the mass is dominated by primordial bodies, then they should have radii below $300^{+80}_{-70}$ km ($0.3 \pm 0.1$ RPluto) and above $5^{+20}_{-4}$ km. Such bodies would each have less than 1 per cent the mass of Pluto. Our conclusions are robust to additional physics, including shepherding planets and collisional damping. Our results provide independent, dynamical support for the idea that the masses of bright debris discs are dominated by objects smaller than Pluto.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-energy variability of the gravitationally lensed blazar PKS 1830-211</a><span class="id">[2510.07220]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The production site and process responsible for the highly variable high-energy emission observed from blazar jets are still debated.

We study the broad-band spectral properties and the high-energy variability of the gravitationally-lensed blazar PKS 1830-211, for which radio observations have revealed two images, to put constraints on the jet physics and the existence of a gravitationally-induced time delay and magnification ratio between the images. We utilize Swift/XRT, Nustar, and Fermi-LAT observations from 2016 and 2019 to compare periods of low activity and high activity in PKS 1830-211. Short-timescale variability is elucidated with an unbinned power spectrum analysis of time-tagged NuSTAR photon data. To study the gravitationally-induced time delay in the gamma-ray light curve observed with Fermi-LAT, we improve existing autocorrelation function based methods. Our modified auto-correlation method yields a delay of t_0=21.1 +/- 0.1 d and magnification factor a=0.13 +/- 0.01. These parameters remain time-invariant. In data from 2016 and 2019, the X-ray spectra remain remarkably stable, contrasting with extreme changes in gamma-rays. Both states can be fitted with a single component from Comptonisation of infrared emission from the dusty torus, with different gamma-ray states arising solely from a shift in the break of the electron energy distribution. The detection of a consistent lag throughout the whole light curve suggests that they originate from a persistent location in the jet.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing new-physics scenarios with the combined LHAASO and Carpet-3 fluence spectrum of GRB 221009A: axion-like particles and Lorentz-invariance violation</a><span class="id">[2510.07234]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>From gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, very high-energy photons were detected: &gt;10 TeV with LHAASO and &gt;100 TeV with Carpet-3.

Here, we construct a joint fluence spectrum by combining flux measurements from both experiments, and fit it under these hypotheses. LIV can account for the Carpet-3 observation, providing a modest improvement over standard physics in the overall fit.

While the gas within the disk is expected to disperse within the first million years, strong accretion has nonetheless been detected in older systems, including the 30–45 Myr-old planetary-mass companion Delorme 1 AB b. We conducted spectroscopic observations with JWST/MIRI to investigate the presence of circumplanetary material around this young, accreting planet, and to characterize the planet's atmospheric properties and composition. We perform forward modeling using atmospheric models to characterize the planet's atmosphere. Beyond 10 microns, the SED becomes dominated by this CPD rather than the planet itself. We detect strong emission from HCN and C$_2$H$_2$, while no O-bearing species are observed in the CPD spectrum, suggesting the gas in the CPD has an elevated C/O. We also identify spatially extended H$_2$ emission around the planet, tracing warm gas, with indications that it may be at a higher temperature than the non-extended component. The mid-infrared spectrum of the planetary-mass companion Delorme 1 AB b reveals the first detection of bright C-bearing species in a CPD, together with an outflow traced by H$_2$ extended emission, that could be interpreted as a disk wind. The hot dust continuum emission suggests an inner cavity in the CPD. The presence of warm gas in the CPD provides constraints on the disk's chemical composition and physical conditions, opening up new avenues for disk studies. The study of these long-lived &quot;Peter Pan&quot; disks will enhance our understanding of how accretion persists in evolved low-mass systems, shedding light on their formation, longevity, and evolutionary pathways in planetary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07306" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing evolution of Long GRB properties through their cosmic formation history aided by Machine Learning predicted redshifts</a><span class="id">[2510.07306]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are valuable probes of cosmic star formation reaching back into the epoch of reionization, and a large dataset with known redshifts ($z$) is an important ingredient for these studies. Usually, $z$ is measured using spectroscopy or photometry, but $\sim80\%$ of GRBs lack such data. Prompt and afterglow correlations can provide estimates in these cases, though they suffer from systematic uncertainties due to assumed cosmologies and due to detector threshold limits. We use a sample with $z$ estimated via machine learning models, based on prompt and afterglow parameters, without relying on cosmological assumptions. We then use an augmented sample of GRBs with measured and predicted redshifts, forming a larger dataset. We find that the predicted redshifts are a crucial step forward in understanding the evolution of GRB properties. We test three cases: no evolution, an evolution of the beaming factor, and an evolution of all terms captured by an evolution factor $(1+z)^\delta$. We find that these cases can explain the density rate in the redshift range between 1-2, but neither of the cases can explain the derived rate densities at smaller and higher redshifts, which may point towards an evolution term different than a simple power law. Another possibility is that this mismatch is due to the non-homogeneity of the sample, e.g., a non-collapsar origin of some long GRB within the sample.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diffuse continuum emission and large extended sources at MeV energies</a><span class="id">[2510.07311]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Future gamma-ray survey instruments, such as newASTROGAM and AMEGO-X, will significantly improve previous and current all-sky surveys at MeV energies.

In this paper, we show the correct formula of the helicity change in such a case for the Maxwell theory with the magnetic monopoles. We also discuss what happens when we embed the Maxwell theory with magnetic monopoles into non-Abelian gauge theories. We show that a similar formula holds for the 't Hooft–Polyakov monopole. In particular, we find the winding numbers and the zeroes of the Higgs field in the non-Abelian gauge theory play a crucial role in the helicity change.

These modes are of utmost relevance since they can be potentially excited in isolated as well as binary neutron star systems in the inspiral phase, thus allowing us to indirectly detect the presence of a deconfinement transition. In order to do this, we consider four categories of twin stars that present distinctive features in their equations of state. We employ the constant speed of sound parametrization, which accounts for a sharp phase transition between confined hadronic matter and deconfined quark matter. Then, working within the relativistic Cowling approximation to obtain the frequencies of non-radial oscillations, we find that, depending on the twin star category, the relations between $g$-mode frequencies and masses as well as tidal deformabilities display a highly distinct behavior across the diverse twin star categories that appear in the slow hadron-quark conversion regime. This distinct phenomenology provides smoking-gun evidence to clearly distinguish and further classify hybrid stars with a strong transition from purely hadronic stars using upcoming gravitational-wave data. In addition, we present for each of the categories studied the relation between the $g$-mode frequency and the normalized energy density jump. Finally, we present a novel universal relationship for the discontinuity $g$-mode able to encompass the four categories including long branches of slow stable twin stars and address its asteroseismological capability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06510" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Influence of Solar Sails on Magnetic Field Measurements in Space Plasmas</a><span class="id">[2510.06510]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar sail technology is ready to be deployed in a satellite mission carrying a science-grade magnetometer.

The solar wind magnetic field is a key parameter in space weather prediction, because it governs the energy-releasing magnetic reconnection process at Earth's magnetopause. This paper investigates the influence of solar sails on the ambient magnetic field, particularly focusing on two critical electromagnetic effects: eddy currents and magnetic pileup. We find the induced eddy currents in the metallic sail can significantly perturb the local magnetic field at high frequencies. We also suggest that magnetic pileup can influence the spacecraft's environment when the sail size is comparable to the electron kinetic scales of the surrounding plasma.

This can be considered as a simple non-canonical generalization of the Brans-Dicke theory with a potential term which corresponds to a special case of this model with the values of the parameter $\alpha = 1$, $\beta = -1$ and $\lambda = 2w_{_{BD}}$ where $w_{_{BD}}$ is the Brans-Dicke parameter. Considering a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe with scale factor $a(t)$, it is shown that, in the matter free Universe, the kinetic term $\lambda X^\alpha \phi^\beta$ can lead to a power law solution $a(t)\propto t^{n}$ but the maximum possible value of $n$ turns out to be $(1+\sqrt{3})/4 \approx 0.683$. When $\alpha \geq 18$, this model can lead to a solution $a(t)\propto t^{2/3}$, thereby mimicking the evolution of scale factor in a cold dark matter dominated epoch with Einstein's General Relativity (GR). With the addition of a linear potential term $V(\phi) = V_{0}\phi$, it is shown that this model mimics the standard $\Lambda$CDM model type evolution of the Universe. The larger the value of $\alpha$, the closer the evolution of $a(t)$ in this model to that in the $\Lambda$CDM model based on Einstein's GR. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that this model with a linear potential can mimic the GR based $\Lambda$CDM model. However, with an appropriate choice of the potential $V(\phi)$, this model can provide a unified description of both dark matter and dynamical dark energy, as if it were based on Einstein's GR.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GW231123: extreme spins or microglitches?</a><span class="id">[2510.07228]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recently reported binary black hole merger, GW231123, has unusual properties that make it hard to explain astrophysically. Parameter estimation studies are consistent with maximally spinning black holes and the dimensionless spin of the more massive component is constrained to be $\chi_1\gtrsim 0.8$. Analysis of data also revealed potential systematics that could not be fully replicated with simulated studies. We explore the possibility that these measurements are biased due to unmodeled non-Gaussian noise in the detectors, and that the actual black hole spins are more modest. We present evidence for a population of \textit{microglitches} in LIGO gravitational-wave strain data that can lead to biases in the parameter estimation of short-duration signals such as GW231123. Using simulated data of a massive event like GW231123, we demonstrate how microglitches can bias our measurements of black hole spins toward $\chi\approx1$ with negligible posterior support for the true value of $\chi\approx0.7$. We develop a noise model to account for microglitches and show that this model successfully reduces biases in the recovery of signal parameters. We characterize the microglitch population in real interferometer data surrounding GW231123 and find a single detector glitch duty cycle of $0.57_{-0.19}^{+0.21}$, which implies nearly a $100\%$ probability that at least one event through the fourth gravitational wave transient catalog coincides with microglitches in two detectors. We argue that further investigations are required before we can have a confident picture of the astrophysical properties of GW231123.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04924" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Inflation and Reheating Features in the Higgs-$R^2$ Model</a><span class="id">[2207.04924]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigated inflation in the Higgs-$R^2$ model and assumed the trajectory to follow a single-field approximation called minimal two-field mode. Using this approximation, we tried to constrain the Higgs' non-minimal coupling $\xi$. During inflation, we investigated the effect of $\xi$ on the non-gaussianity. We found that $\xi$ could not provide the large non-gaussianity. In this paper, we divided the preheating stage to be quadratic regime and quartic regime. During the quadratic regime, the gauge bosons' production is the most dominant. However, it could not drain the whole inflaton's energy. Thus, we introduced a dark matter candidate with a large coupling that could drain the whole inflaton's energy. We also found that if $\xi&lt;4.2$, the oscillation on the quadratic regime continued to the quartic regime. The reheating temperature obtained by this mode can be reached to be $\sim 10^{10}$ GeV and strongly depends on the remaining inflaton's energy density. On contrary, if $\xi&gt;4.2$, the oscillation only happens at the quadratic regime. As we assumed the Pauli exclusion principle does exist during the quadratic regime, the instant decay of gauge bosons to fermions is restricted. Hence we expected, the reheating temperature to be low for about $\sim 10^9$ GeV.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foreground Removal in Ground-Based CMB Observations Using a Transformer Model</a><span class="id">[2502.09071]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel method for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) foreground removal based on deep learning techniques. This method employs a Transformer model, referred to as \texttt{TCMB}, which is specifically designed to effectively process HEALPix-format spherical sky maps. \texttt{TCMB} represents an innovative application in CMB data analysis, as it is an image-based technique that has rarely been utilized in this field. Using simulated data with noise levels representative of current ground-based CMB polarization observations, the \texttt{TCMB} method demonstrates robust performance in removing foreground contamination. The mean absolute variance for the reconstruction of the noisy CMB Q/U map is significantly less than the CMB polarization signal. To mitigate biases caused by instrumental noise, a cross-correlation approach using two half-mission maps was employed, successfully recovering CMB EE and BB power spectra that align closely with the true values, and these results validate the effectiveness of the \texttt{TCMB} method. Compared to the previously employed convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach, the \texttt{TCMB} method offers two significant advantages: (1) It demonstrates superior effectiveness in reconstructing CMB polarization maps, outperforming CNN-based methods. (2) It can directly process HEALPix spherical sky maps without requiring rectangular region division, a step necessary for CNN-based approaches that often introduces uncertainties such as boundary effects. This study highlights the potential of Transformer-based models as a powerful tool for CMB data analysis, offering a substantial improvement over traditional CNN-based techniques.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark sirens and the impact of redshift precision</a><span class="id">[2502.17747]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the growing number of gravitational wave detections, achieving a competitive measurement of $H_0$ with dark sirens is becoming increasingly feasible. The expansion of the Ligo-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration into a four detector network will reduce both the localisation area and the luminosity distance uncertainty associated with each gravitational wave event. It is therefore essential to identify and mitigate other major sources of error that could increase the uncertainty in $H_0$. In this work, we explore three scenarios relevant to the dark siren method in future observing runs. First, we demonstrate that there is a precision gain offered by a catalogue of spectroscopic-like redshifts compared to photometric-like redshifts, with the greatest improvements observed in smaller localisation areas. Second, we show that redshift outliers (as occur in realistic photometric redshift catalogues), do not introduce bias into the measurement of $H_0$. Finally, we find that uniformly sub-sampling spectroscopic-like redshift catalogues increases the uncertainty in $H_0$ as the completeness fraction is decreased; at a completeness of 50% the benefit of spectroscopic redshift precision is outweighed by the degradation from incompleteness. In all three scenarios, we obtain unbiased estimates of $H_0$. We conclude that a competitive measurement of $H_0$ using the dark siren method will require a hybrid catalogue of both photometric and spectroscopic redshifts, at least until highly complete spectroscopic catalogues become available. This, however, will come at the cost of a more complex selection function.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Determining the 3D Dynamics of Solar Flare Magnetic Reconnection</a><span class="id">[2504.00913]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar flares are major space weather events that result from the explosive conversion of stored magnetic energy into bulk motion, plasma heating, and particle acceleration. While the standard flare model has proven highly successful in explaining key morphological features of flare observations, many aspects of the energy release are not yet understood. In particular, the turbulent three-dimensional structure of the flare current sheet is thought to play an important role in fast reconnection, particle acceleration, and bursty dynamics. Although direct diagnosis of the magnetic field dynamics in the corona remains highly challenging, rich information may be gleaned from flare ribbons, which represent the chromospheric imprints of reconnection in the corona. Intriguingly, recent solar imaging observations have revealed a diversity of fine structure in flare ribbons that hints at corresponding complexity in the reconnection region. We present high-resolution three-dimensional MHD simulations of an eruptive flare and describe our efforts to interpret fine-scale ribbon features in terms of the current sheet dynamics. In our model, the current sheet is characterized by many coherent magnetic structures known as plasmoids. We derive a model analogue for ribbons by generating a time series of field-line length maps (L-maps) and identifying abrupt shortenings as flare reconnection events. We thereby demonstrate that plasmoids imprint transient 'spirals' along the analogue of the ribbon front, with a morphology consistent with observed fine structure. We discuss the implications of these results for interpreting SolO, IRIS, and DKIST observations of explosive flare energy release.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Wave Memory of Primordial Black Hole Mergers</a><span class="id">[2505.01356]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The gravitational wave signal of binary compact objects has two main contributions at frequencies below the characteristic merger frequency: the gravitational wave signal associated with the early inspiral stage of the binary and the non-linear gravitational wave memory.

We demonstrate that for light primordial black holes, current and upcoming detectors are more sensitive to the inspiral signal. Our analysis incorporates the evolution history of primordial black hole binaries, key to accurately estimating the relevant event rates.

We forecast that galaxy shear data from the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) could limit an axion of mass $m = 10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to be $\lesssim 5\%$ of the dark matter, stronger than any current bound, if the interplay between axions and feedback is accurately modelled. Using a halo model emulator to construct power spectra for mixed cold and axion dark matter cosmologies, including baryonic effects, we find that galaxy shear is sensitive to axions from $10^{-27}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to $10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$, with the capacity to set competitive bounds across much of this range. For axions with $m \sim 10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$, the scales at which axions and feedback impact structure formation are similar, introducing a parameter degeneracy. We find that, with an external feedback constraint, we can break the degeneracy and constrain the axion transfer function, such that LSST could detect a $10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$ axion comprising 10\% of the dark matter at $\sim 3 \sigma$ significance. Direct reconstruction of the non-linear matter power spectrum provides an alternative way of analysing weak lensing surveys, with the advantage of identifying the scale-dependent features in the data that the dark matter model imposes. We advocate for dedicated cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with an axion dark matter component so that upcoming galaxy and cosmic microwave background lensing surveys can disentangle the dark matter-baryon transfer function.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Are magnetic fields in cosmic voids primordial?</a><span class="id">[2505.14774]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nature of magnetic fields in the voids of the large-scale structure of the Universe has been a multifaceted open puzzle for decades. On one hand, their origin is not clear with most of the magnetogenesis models using physics beyond the standard model in the early Universe, and on the other hand, their existence and potential role in explaining the spectra of TeV blazars have been intensely debated in the past decade. Here, we propose a mechanism, within classical electrodynamics, that could fill the voids with late-Universe fields and, under certain conditions, dispel the need for primordial fields altogether to explain the void fields. Specifically, we use the dipole component of the galactic fields to generate space-filling magnetic fields in voids with white-noise spectrum and sufficient amplitude to explain the lack of GeV halos around TeV blazars observed by Fermi-LAT. A definitive test for such fields in the voids will be the white-noise spectral shape, which will constrain possible plasma processes in the voids to the ones that allow for the propagation of these dipole fields into the voids.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direct reconstruction of the Reionization history from 21cm 2D Power Spectra</a><span class="id">[2506.19925]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 21cm line from the spin-flip transition of neutral hydrogen (HI) provides a unique window into the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), the final phase transition of our Universe. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) enables precise measurements of 21cm fluctuations that trace ionization, temperature, and density fluctuations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Nevertheless, a direct reconstruction of the timeline of the EoR in terms of the progress of ionization remains an ongoing challenge due to the highly non-Gaussian nature and thus intractable likelihood of the 21cm signal. Here, we present EoRFlow, a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework for reconstructing the global neutral hydrogen fraction $x_{\mathrm{HI}}(z)$ directly from 2D cylindrically averaged power spectra (2DPS) of the 21cm signal. We validate our method on realistic mock datasets for SKA-Low. Bypassing the need for explicit likelihood formulations, our approach enables fast, unbiased posterior estimation of the $x_{\mathrm{HI}}$ evolution in narrow redshift slices, allowing for piecewise reconstruction of the global reionization history. By directly inferring the reionization history from 21cm power spectra, our framework provides a scalable and robust path forward for 21cm cosmology in the SKA era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Type Ibn supernovae from ultra-stripped supernova progenitors</a><span class="id">[2507.05506]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-stripped supernovae are core-collapse supernovae from progenitors that lose a significant fraction of mass because of the binary interactions with their compact companion stars. Ultra-stripped supernovae have been connected to fast-evolving faint Type Ib or Ic supernovae. Here, we show that in some cases ultra-stripped supernovae can result in Type Ibn supernovae. Progenitors of ultra-stripped supernovae may trigger violent silicon burning shortly before the core collapse, leading to mass ejection that results in a dense circumstellar matter. By taking an ultra-stripped supernova progenitor that loses 0.2 Msun at 78 days before the core collapse, we compute the light-curve evolution of the ultra-stripped supernova within the dense circumstellar matter. The core collapse results in a supernova explosion with an ejecta mass of 0.06 Msun and an explosion energy of 9e49 erg. Because the dense circumstellar matter is more massive than the supernova ejecta, the ejecta are immediately decelerated and the light curve is powered mainly by the circumstellar interaction. Therefore, this ultra-stripped supernova is likely observed as a Type Ibn supernova. We suggest that some Type Ibn supernovae may originate from ultra-stripped supernova progenitors losing significant mass shortly before their explosion due to violent silicon burning.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thick Disks around White Dwarfs viewed 'Edge-off': Effects on Transit Properties and Infrared Excess</a><span class="id">[2507.20594]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A significant fraction of white dwarfs (WDs) host dust/debris disks formed from the tidal disruption of asteroids and planetesimals. Several studies indicate that the disks can attain significant vertical heights through collisional cascade. In this work I model the effects of geometrically thick disks on two primary observables: photometric transits by the disk when viewed at high inclinations and infrared dust emission. Specifically, I consider disks with a Gaussian vertical profile with scale heights comparable to or larger than the WD radius. I primarily focus on inclinations $\gtrsim$$87$ degrees (`edge-off'), which can produce significant transits with moderate disk thickness. Both the transit depth and color become strong functions of inclination, and I explore their dependence on the disk parameters. I show that such a setup can produce the recently discovered reddening in the transit of WD J1013$-$0427. Moving to infrared emission, I show that the contribution from the heated inner rim can be substantial even at high inclinations. It can potentially explain the infrared excess observed in two transiting debris systems, WD 1145$+$017 and WD 1232$+$563, consistently with the transits. The other two important radiation components are the optically thin dust emission from the disk's outer layers and the optically thick emission from the backwarmed disk interior. Extending my analysis to G29-38 shows that the former can adequately produce the silicate emission feature with optically thin dust mass of $&gt;$$10^{17}$ grams. The inner dense layers, on the other hand, allow the disk to contain orders of magnitude larger net dust mass. Overall, I show that thick disk effects can be significant and should be taken into account. I motivate detailed studies to quantify the effects accurately.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The source of the cosmic-ray excess in the Centaurus region – constraints on possible candidates, mass composition and cosmic magnetic fields</a><span class="id">[2509.06594]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The most significant excess in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with energies $\gtrsim40\,\mathrm{EeV}$ is found in the direction of several interesting source candidates, most prominently the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A. Naturally, Cen A has been suspected to create the anisotropy - but very different scenarios have been proposed. This includes a subdominant source contribution in combination with isotropic background sources, as well as a scenario where Cen A supplies the whole cosmic-ray flux above the ankle. Recently, it was suggested that the overdensity could instead consist of strongly deflected events from the Sombrero galaxy. Thanks to the recent development of several models of the Galactic magnetic field, it is now possible to test these proposed scenarios explicitly. Leveraging the measured overdensity direction, significance, angular scale, and energy evolution, we place limits on the allowed signal fraction, the possible ejected charge number and the strength of the extragalactic magnetic field between the respective source and Earth. We find that the scenario of a subdominant source in the overdensity region requires the charge number to be $Z\lesssim6$ and the extragalactic magnetic field quantity $B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{Mpc}}$ to be between $~1$ and $~100$. For the Sombrero galaxy to be the source, the dominant charge number has to be around $Z=6$ with $1\lesssim B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{Mpc}}\lesssim20$.

However, our understanding of the photospheric magnetic field topology is inherently constrained by the limitation of systematically observing the Sun from only one vantage point, Earth. To address this challenge, we introduce global magnetic field maps that assimilate far-side active regions derived from helioseismology into solar wind modeling. Through a comparative analysis between the combined surface flux transport and helioseismic Far-side Active Region Model (FARM) magnetic maps and the base surface flux transport model without far-side active regions (SFTM), we assess the feasibility and efficacy of incorporating helioseismic far-side information in space weather forecasting. We are employing the Wang-Sheeley-Arge Solar Wind (WSA) model for statistical evaluation and leveraging the EUropean Heliospheric FOrecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA), a three-dimensional heliospheric MHD model, to analyze a case study. Using the WSA model, we show that including far-side magnetic data improves solar wind forecasts for 2013-2014 by up to 50% in correlation and 3% in root mean square error and mean absolute error, especially near Earth and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory - Ahead (STEREO-A). Additionally, our 3D modeling shows significant localized differences in heliospheric structure that can be attributed to the presence or absence of active regions in the magnetic maps used as input boundaries. This highlights the importance of including far-side information to more accurately model and predict space weather effects caused by solar wind, solar transients, and geomagnetic disturbances.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Link Between Rocky Planet Density and Host Star Chemistry</a><span class="id">[2510.04981]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planets and their host stars form from the same cloud of gas and dust, so we assume that their chemical compositions are linked.

Here, we investigate the relationship between small (R$_{P}$ $\leq$ 1.8 R$_{\oplus}$) planet densities and host star elemental abundances. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper and an accompanying data-driven framework to obtain abundances for FGK and M dwarf hosts of 22 rocky planets. We find that planet densities exhibit a strong, inverse relationship to [Mg/Fe] abundances of FGK hosts (p = 0.001). This correlation becomes more significant with the addition of M dwarf hosts (p = 0.0005). If we assume that rocky planets have terrestrial-like compositions, this suggests that low [Mg/Fe] environments form planets with larger Fe-rich cores and thus higher densities. The thick disk planets in our sample help anchor this trend, illustrating the importance of sampling exoplanet properties across a range of host star populations. This finding highlights the connection between Galactic chemical evolution and rocky planet formation, and indicates that Earth-like planet compositions may vary significantly across different regions of the Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13053" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharpening the dark matter signature in gravitational waveforms I: Accretion and eccentricity evolution</a><span class="id">[2402.13053]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter overdensities around black holes can alter the dynamical evolution of a companion object orbiting around it, and cause a dephasing of the gravitational waveform.

Increasing plasma-$\beta$ always suppresses the instability, whereas a background pressure anisotropy can either enhance or further suppress it, depending on its sign: for $p_{\parallel,0} &lt; p_{\perp,0}$ the instability is strengthened, while for $p_{\parallel,0} &gt; p_{\perp,0}$ it is weakened. Importantly, this effect is not limited to low-collisionality plasmas at high $\beta$; it can also manifest in more collisional environments once the strict assumption of pressure isotropy is relaxed. This finding has profound implications for various astrophysical contexts characterized by high $\beta$ and varying degrees of collisionality, including the solar corona and heliospheric current sheets, planetary magnetospheres, as probed by space missions, and the intracluster medium, where magnetic reconnection critically impacts magnetic field evolution and cosmic ray transport. Our results therefore question the universality of the widely-accepted plasmoid-mediated fast reconnection paradigm and underscore the necessity of incorporating pressure anisotropy effects into reconnection models for accurate representation of astrophysical plasmas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20418" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Framework for phase transitions between the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions at finite temperature</a><span class="id">[2506.20418]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The characteristics of the hadron-to-quark first-order phase transition differ depending on whether charge neutrality is locally or globally fulfilled. In $\beta$-equilibrated matter, these two possibilities correspond to the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions. Recently, we presented a new framework in which a continuously-varying parameter allows one to describe a first-order phase transition in intermediate scenarios to the two extremes of fully local and fully global charge neutrality. In this work, we extend the previous framework to finite temperatures and out-of-$\beta$ equilibrium conditions, making it available for simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. We investigate its impact on key thermodynamic quantities across a range of baryon densities, temperatures, and electron fractions. We find that when matter is not in $\beta$-equilibrium, the pressure in the mixed phase is not constant even for the case of fully-local charge neutrality. Moreover, we compute the thermal index using three different approaches, demonstrating that the finite-temperature extension of an equation of state using a constant thermal index can be ill-defined when applied to the mixed phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling Gravitational Wave Modes from the Inspiral of Binaries with Arbitrary Eccentricity</a><span class="id">[2507.00169]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Eccentric binaries are key targets for current and future gravitational wave (GW) detectors, offering unique insights into the formation and environments of compact binaries. However, accurately and efficiently modeling eccentric waveforms remains challenging, in part due to their complex harmonic structure. In this work, we develop a post-Newtonian (PN) framework to compute the Fourier amplitudes of GWs from the inspiral of eccentric binaries, deriving simple expressions at 1PN order for all relevant $(l, m)$ multipoles, valid for arbitrary eccentricities. We then characterize the GW emission by analyzing the contribution of each $(l, m)$ mode to the strain, its mean frequency, frequency spread, and asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. Additionally, we introduce a method to determine the minimal set of Fourier modes needed to reconstruct the waveform to a given accuracy. Finally, we discuss how our framework can be extended to higher PN orders, obtaining closed-form expressions for the leading-order tail and spin contributions and outlining the steps required to include higher-order corrections. Our results provide both a deeper theoretical understanding of eccentric GW emission and practical tools for developing more accurate and efficient waveform models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14634" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universality of gravitational radiation from magnetar magnetospheres</a><span class="id">[2507.14634]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The intense magnetic fields inferred from magnetars suggest they may be strong gravitational-wave emitters. Although emissions due to hydromagnetic deformations are more promising from a detection standpoint, exterior fields also contribute a strain. However, numerical evidence suggests that the free energy of stable magnetospheric solutions cannot exceed a few tens of percent relative to the potential state, implying that the magnetospheric contribution to the gravitational-wave luminosity cannot differ significantly between models. This prompts 'universality', in the sense that the strain provides a direct probe of the near-surface field without being muddied by magnetospheric currents. Using a suite of three-dimensional, force-free, general-relativistic solutions for dipole and dipole-plus-quadrupole fields, we find that space-based interferometers may enable marginal detections out to $\lesssim$ kpc distances for slowly-rotating magnetars with fields of $\gtrsim 10^{15}$ G independently of internal deformations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flavour interferometry in Reissner-Nordstrom background</a><span class="id">[2508.05561]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive the phase acquired by a neutral scalar particle propagating along Reissner-Nordstrom geodesics.

Novel observations of fields and particles from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have shown the absence of reconnection in a large number of current sheets in the near-Sun solar wind. Using near-Sun observations from PSP Encounters 4 to 11 (Jan 2020 to March 2022), we investigate whether reconnection onset might be suppressed by velocity shear. We compare estimates of the tearing mode growth rate in the presence of shear flow for time periods identified as containing reconnecting current sheets versus non-reconnecting times, finding systematically larger growth rates for reconnection periods. Upon examination of the parameters associated with reconnection onset, we find that 85% of the reconnection events are embedded in slow, non-Alfvenic wind streams. We compare with fast, slow non-Alfvenic, and slow Alfvenic streams, finding that the growth rate is suppressed in highly Alfvenic fast and slow wind and reconnection is not seen in these wind types, as would be expected from our theoretical expressions. These wind streams have strong Alfvenic flow shear, consistent with the idea of reconnection suppression by such flows. This could help explain the frequent absence of reconnection events in the highly Alfvenic, near-Sun solar wind observed by PSP. Finally, we find a steepening of both the trace and magnitude magnetic field spectra within reconnection periods in comparison to ambient wind. We tie this to the dynamics of relatively balanced turbulence within these reconnection periods and the potential generation of compressible fluctuations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Quality Axion Dark Matter at Gravitational Wave Interferometers</a><span class="id">[2509.14323]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational effects are known to violate global symmetries, threatening the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) solution to the strong CP problem. Ultraviolet completions featuring a gauged $U(1)$ symmetry, where $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ arises as an accidental global symmetry, can suppress Planck-suppressed operators, enabling high-quality axions in a mass window where it can also account for the observed dark matter (DM) in the Universe. We show that in such models, the spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry generates a strong stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from gauge cosmic string loops. For breaking scales $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, the SGWB signal strength exceeds astrophysical foregrounds across a broad frequency range. Contrary to conventional gauge cosmic string scenarios, such quality axion models have a characteristic IR break frequency originating from the collapse of string-wall network around axion oscillation temperature. We propose this characteristic SGWB frequency-amplitude region, identified as \textit{Signature-Window-Axion-Gravitational waves} (SWAG), to be a novel probe of high-quality axion DM at future space and ground-based interferometers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extra Radiation Cosmologies: Implications of the Hubble Tension for eV-scale Neutrinos</a><span class="id">[2509.25478]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new analysis on sterile neutrino cosmologies using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) second data release (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements in combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB), CMB lensing, and supernova data. We show that BAO observables are intrinsically less sensitive to the combined effects of relativistic energy density, $N_{\rm eff}$, and the sum of neutrino masses, $\Sigma m_\nu$, which are both augmented in sterile neutrino cosmologies. With SH0ES local expansion rate, $H_0$, data, we find $N_{\rm eff} = 3.43 \pm 0.13$, reducing the Hubble tension to $2.4\sigma$. For a 0.1 eV sterile neutrino, we find $N_{\rm eff}=3.50$ as the best fit. For this representative $N_{\rm eff}$, we find an upper limit of $m_s &lt; 0.17$ eV (95% CL), greater than a factor of four weaker than standard constraints on $\Sigma m_\nu$. When SH0ES is included, light sterile neutrinos with masses $m_s\simeq0.1$-$0.2$ eV are favored at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$, whereas eV-scale sterile masses remain strongly excluded by the data in the cosmologies we study. Our findings confirm our previous results that partially thermalized sub-eV sterile neutrinos are preferred by the SH0ES $H_0$ data. The preferred $m_s$ mass scale overlaps with, but is not identical to, that favored in neutrino oscillation solutions to short-baseline anomalies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01221" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WISPFI Experiment: Prototype Development</a><span class="id">[2510.01221]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidates that couple to photons in external magnetic fields. The parameter space around $m_a \sim 50~\mu$eV remains largely unexplored by haloscope experiments. We present the first prototype of WISP Searches on a Fiber Interferometer (WISPFI), a table-top, model-independent scheme based on resonant photon-axion conversion in a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (HC-PCF) integrated into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). Operating near a dark fringe with active phase-locking, combined with amplitude modulation, the interferometer converts axion-induced photon disappearance into a measurable signal. A 2 W, 1550 nm laser is coupled into a 1 m-long HC-PCF placed inside a 2 T permanent magnet array, probing a fixed axion mass of $m_a \simeq 49~$meV with a projected sensitivity of $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \gtrsim 1.3 \times 10^{-9}~\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for a measurement time of 30 days. Future upgrades, including pressure tuning of the effective refractive index and implementation of a Fabry-Pérot cavity, could extend the accessible mass range and improve sensitivity, establishing WISPFI as a scalable platform to explore previously inaccessible regions of the axion parameter space.</p></div></details></article></body>
