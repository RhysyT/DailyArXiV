<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Math{é}matiques et M{é}canique {à} Strasbourg entre 1871 et 1939</a><span class="id">[2510.13280]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The University of Strasbourg, fundamentally humanistic since its creation, has a complicated history, being sometimes German, sometimes French through the ages. If one focus, from 1871, on the area of mathematics, we can identify two periods. Political goals led to send high-level scientists, sometimes rather young, to develop theoretical, later applied mathematics, leading to a novel area, mechanics. The first period, under Prussian influence until 1918, will see the emergence of an Institute of mathematics such it was existing in G{ö}ttingen; the second, dominated by the French influence, will make Strasbourg an anteroom to positions at the prestigious Faculty of Sciences in Paris, the Sorbonne, the Academy of Sciences or the ENS. Present communication will give an inside, through its history, of the development of Mathematics in Strasbourg, prelude to emerging Mechanics and the creation of what will become the Institut de M{é}canique des Fluides et des Solides en 2000.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Physical Mathematics: an approach through Gilles Châtelet's philosophy</a><span class="id">[2510.13125]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Starting from Greg Moore's description about Physical Mathematics, a framework is proposed in order to understand it, based on Gilles Châtelet's philosophy. It will be argued that Châtelet's ideas of inverting, splitting, augmenting and virtuality are crucial in the discussion about the nature of Physical Mathematics. Along this line, it will be proposed that mirror symmetry is a natural study case to test Châtelet's ideas in this context. This should be considered as a first step in a long term project aiming to study the relations among mathematics, physics and philosophy in the construction of a global understanding of the structure of the universe, as it was envisioned by Grothendieck in the late 80's of the last century and it was started to be developed independently by Châtelet in the beginning of the 90's. The main suggestion of the essay is that it is in the relations between mathematics, physics and philosophy that new knowledge arises.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agency cannot be a purely quantum phenomenon</a><span class="id">[2510.13247]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>What are the physical requirements for agency? We investigate whether a purely quantum system (one evolving unitarily in a coherent regime without decoherence or collapse) can satisfy three minimal conditions for agency: an agent must be able to create a world-model, use it to evaluate the likely consequences of alternative actions, and reliably perform the action that maximizes expected utility. We show that the first two conditions conflict with the no-cloning theorem, which forbids copying unknown quantum states: world-model construction requires copying information from the environment, and deliberation requires copying the world-model to assess multiple actions. Approximate cloning strategies do not permit sufficient fidelity or generality for agency to be viable in purely quantum systems. The third agency condition also fails due to the linearity of quantum dynamics. These results imply four key consequences. First, agency requires significant classical resources, placing clear constraints on its physical basis. Second, they provide insight into how classical agents emerge within a quantum universe. Third, they show that quantum computers cannot straightforwardly simulate agential behavior without significant classical components. Finally, they challenge quantum theories of agency, free will, and consciousness.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The counterfactual account of Lüders' rule is sufficient to rule out ontological models of quantum mechanics</a><span class="id">[2502.15615]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ontological models, as used in the generalised contextuality literature, play a central role in current research on quantum foundations, providing a framework for defining classicality, constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena, and examining the ontology of quantum states. In this work, we show that a counterfactual account of Lüders' rule – which we argue is naturally implied by the mathematical structure of the rule itself – renders such models inherently incompatible with the quantum formalism. This incompatibility arises because the counterfactual update requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn which in turn renders predictions of sequential measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given (this, typically implicitly-assumed account of) quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experimental Skills for Non-PhD Roles in the Quantum Industry</a><span class="id">[2510.12936]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As the quantum information science and engineering (QISE) workforce grows, there is an anticipated need for professionals with bachelor's and master's degrees who can fill a wide range of roles in the quantum industry. This report identifies the experimental skills needed for individuals with bachelor's or master's degrees to succeed in quantum industry roles. Through semi-structured interviews with quantum industry employers, we gathered data on 22 distinct positions spanning hardware, software, and business functions. While employers describe varying expectations of quantum expertise, the unifying requirement across these roles is proficiency in experimental skills, which fall into four key categories: instrumentation, computation and data analysis, experimental and project design, as well as communication and collaboration. Positions open to bachelor's and master's graduates use all four skill areas, but the balance of experimental skill set needed differs. Bachelor's roles lean toward instrumentation, computation and data analysis, as well as experimental and project design skills. Individuals in these roles build, operate, and troubleshoot hardware, and they gather and interpret data to design and carry out experiments. Master's roles stand out with the communication and collaboration skills needed on top of the other three skill categories. Individuals in these roles oversee experiments, coordinate teams, and align efforts with company and client needs. By articulating experimental skills needed for bachelor's and master's roles in the quantum industry, this report provides actionable insights for educators developing QISE courses and programs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How often does unguided peer interaction lead to correct response consensus? An example from Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism</a><span class="id">[2510.13806]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this research, we investigated the impact of peer collaboration and changes from individual to group performance of graduate students on the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) without any guidance from the instructor. We define construction of knowledge as a case in which the group answered the question correctly but in the individual administration of the survey before the group work, one member gave the correct answer and the other gave incorrect answer. We find that there was a significant improvement in the performance of students after peer interaction, which was mostly attributed to construction of knowledge. However, students had very few opportunities to co-construct knowledge as there were hardly any situations in which neither student in a group provided a correct answer. We analyzed the effect size for improvement from individual to group scores for each CSEM item to understand the characteristics of these questions that led to productive group interaction. We also compared the group performance of the graduate students to the introductory physics students in a prior study using the CSEM to get insight into the concepts that showed differences for the two groups and those that were challenging for both groups of students before and after collaboration with peers. Our findings can motivate physics instructors to incorporate group interactions both inside and outside of the classroom even without instructor's involvement so that students at all levels can learn from each other and develop a functional understanding of the underlying concepts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What we talk about when we talk about physics problem solving</a><span class="id">[2211.00694]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I am a second-year cognitive science major, and as a student who has completed my physical science distribution requirements, I will likely never again encounter Gauss's law. So why do I feel that the time and effort I devoted to solving Gauss's law problems was worth it? Partly, I simply enjoy learning and the new perspective on the physical world that comes from understanding electromagnetism. But I was also fascinated by how physics problems train the mind in effective problem-solving strategies – of course I was, being a cognitive science major! Two themes emerged as I reflected on this realization. First, physics problems serve as toy models for more complex problems outside of physics, cultivating broadly transferable problem-solving skills. Second, the process of solving physics problems invites reflection on our own cognitive and affective processes. These themes are deeply interconnected. A richer metacognitive understanding of our minds enables us to tackle more complex problems, while engaging with increasingly challenging problems, in turn, deepens our self-understanding. In what follows, Professor Zosia Krusberg and I consider nine general lessons offered by the physics problem-solving process.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14755" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reliable generation of isomorphic physics problems using Generative AI with prompt-chaining and tool use</a><span class="id">[2508.14755]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a method for generating large numbers of isomorphic physics problems using generative AI services such as ChatGPT, through prompt chaining and tool use. This approach enables precise control over structural variations-such as numeric values and spatial relations-while supporting diverse contextual variations in the problem body. By utilizing the Python code interpreter, the method supports automatic solution validation and simple diagram generation, addressing key limitations in existing LLM-based methods. We generated two example isomorphic problem banks and compared the outcome against two simpler prompt-based approaches. Results show that prompt-chaining produces significantly higher quality and more consistent outputs than simpler, non-chaining prompts. We also show that GenAI services can be used to validate the quality of the generated isomorphic problems. This work demonstrates a promising method for efficient and scalable problem creation accessible to the average instructor, which opens new possibilities for personalized adaptive testing and automated content development.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14950" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Electrochemical Appraisal of Coffee Qualities</a><span class="id">[2501.14950]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Despite coffee's popularity, there are no quantitative methods to measure a chemical property of a black coffee drink in situ and relate it to a flavor experience. Here we show that cyclic voltammetry can be used in coffee without any additional sample preparation to directly measure the strength of a coffee beverage and, separately, how dark the coffee has been roasted; these two properties are implicated in the sensory profile of the beverage. We show that the current passed for the cathodic features that precede hydrogen evolution are linearly related to beverage strength. The same features are suppressed with subsequent cycling, and we show that the magnitude of suppression is directly related to roast color, which dictates the ensemble chemical composition and thus flavor of the beverage. Together, this voltametric analysis decouples beverage strength from roast color and offers a new strategy for rapidly assessing chemical properties of coffee that correlate to flavor.</p></div></details></article></body>
