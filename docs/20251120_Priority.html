By disentangling the composite spectra, precise fundamental parameters and detailed chemical abundances were determined for both stars. The primary component has a mass of $1.4569_{-0.0100}^{+0.0094}$ $M_{\odot}$, a radius of $1.543_{-0.009}^{+0.012}$ $R_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $6556_{-26}^{+64}$ K, and a metallicity of $+0.18_{-0.01}^{+0.03}$ dex, while the secondary has a mass of $1.3579_{-0.0089}^{+0.0094}$ $M_{\odot}$, a radius of $1.377_{-0.015}^{+0.013}$ $R_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $6468_{-21}^{+32}$ K, and a metallicity of $+0.15_{-0.01}^{+0.02}$ dex. The system is estimated to be $577_{-60}^{+60}$ Myr old with a synchronized orbit. The available O-C data imply a minimum mass of 0.57 $M_{\odot}$ or 0.11 $M_{\odot}$ for the third body, corresponding to eccentric and circular orbits, respectively. \texttt{MESA} evolutionary models indicate that the primary will fill its Roche lobe and begin mass transfer to the secondary in about 2.8 Gyr, whereas the secondary will reach the terminal-age main sequence in approximately 3.2 Gyr. The chemical composition of both stars shows remarkable consistency, confirming their common origin, except for calcium, which is significantly enhanced in the primary. Line measurements support this difference and are therefore interpreted as an intrinsic abundance variation rather than an artifact of the analysis. The overall solar-rich metallicity, combined with a relatively low $\alpha$-element content, links V570 Per to the Galactic thin-disk population. In addition, Galactic orbit analyses of open clusters in the solar neighborhood have revealed that the V570 Per system may have originated from the Melotte 25 open cluster.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14833" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Localized Deviations from the CO-PAH Relation in PHANGS-JWST Galaxies: Faint PAH Emission or Elevated CO Emissivity?</a><span class="id">[2511.14833]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission is widely used to trace the distribution of molecular gas in the interstellar medium (ISM), exhibiting a tight correlation with CO(2-1) emission across nearby galaxies. Using PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-ALMA data, we identify localized regions where this correlation fails, with CO flux exceeding that predicted from 7.7$\mu$m PAH emission by more than an order of magnitude. These outlier regions are found in 20 out of 70 galaxies and are mostly located in galaxy centers and bars, without signs of massive star formation. We explore two scenarios to explain the elevated CO-to-PAH ratios, which can either be due to suppressed PAH emission or enhanced CO emissivity. We examine PAH emission in other bands (3.3$\mu$m and 11.3$\mu$m) and the dust continuum dominated bands (10$\mu$m and 21$\mu$m), finding consistently high CO-to-PAH (or CO-to-dust continuum) emission ratios, suggesting that 7.7$\mu$m PAH emission is not particularly suppressed. In some outlier regions, PAH size distributions and spectral energy distribution of the illuminating radiation differ slightly compared to nearby control regions with normal CO-to-PAH ratios, though without a consistent trend. We find that the outlier regions generally show higher CO velocity dispersions ($\Delta v_{\mathrm{CO}}$). This increase in $\Delta v_{\mathrm{CO}}$ may lower CO optical depth and raise its emissivity for a given gas mass. Our results favor a scenario where shear along the bar lanes and shocks at the tips of the bar elevate CO emissivity, leading to the breakdown of the CO-PAH correlation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14834" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mixing between AGN winds and ISM clouds produces luminous X-ray emission</a><span class="id">[2511.14834]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive powerful, multiphase outflows that are thought to play a key role in galaxy evolution. The hot, shocked phase of these outflows ($T \gtrsim 10^{6} \rm{\ K}$) is expected to dominate the energy content, but is challenging to observe due to its long cooling time and low emissivity. The cool phase ($T \lesssim 10^{4} \rm{\ K}$) is easier to detect observationally, but it traces a less energetic outflow component. In prior simulations of the interaction between an energy-driven AGN outflow and a clumpy ISM, we found that mixing between hot wind and cool ISM clouds produces a new, highly radiative, phase at $T \approx 10^{6-7} \rm{\ K}$ which fuels the formation of a long-lived ($\geq 5\ \rm{Myr}$) cool outflow. We investigate the X-ray emission generated by thermal Bremsstrahlung and high-ionisation metal line emission in this mixing phase, finding that it could contribute significantly to the X-ray output of the outflow. This mixing-induced X-ray emission is strongest in the part of the outflow propagating equatorially through the disc, and is extended on scales of $D\simeq 3-4\ \rm{kpc}$. For quasar luminosities of $L_{\rm{AGN}}\simeq 10^{45-46}\rm{\ erg\ s^{-1}}$, the resulting X-ray luminosity is equivalent to that expected from star formation rates $\rm{SFR}\simeq 10-200\ \rm{M_\odot\ yr^{-1}}$, showing that it could be an important source of soft X-rays in AGN host galaxies. Our results suggest that this extended emission could be resolvable in local quasars ($z\lesssim 0.11$) using high spatial-resolution X-ray observatories such as Chandra, or proposed missions such as AXIS and Lynx.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14836" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Mid-infrared Detection and Modeling of a Flare from Sgr A*. II. Mid-IR Spectral Energy Distribution and Millimeter Polarimetry</a><span class="id">[2511.14836]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>S. D. von Fellenberg et al. (2025a, Paper I) reported the first mid-infrared detection of a flare from Sgr A*. The JWST/MIRI/MRS observations were consistent with an orbiting hotspot undergoing electron injection with a spectrum that subsequently breaks from synchrotron cooling. However, mid-infrared extinction measurements appropriate for these data were not yet determined, and therefore the temporal evolution of the absolute spectral index remained unknown. This work applies new Galactic Center extinction measurements to the flare observations. The evolution of the spectral index after the peak is fully consistent with that reported in Paper I with a maximum absolute mid-infrared spectral index $\alpha_{\rm{MIR}}=0.45\pm0.01_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.08_{\rm{sys}}$ during the second mid-infrared flare peak, matching the known near-infrared spectral index during bright states ($\alpha_{\rm{NIR}}\approx0.5$). There was a near-instantaneous change in the mid-infrared spectral index of $\Delta\alpha_{\rm{MIR}}=0.33\pm0.06_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.11_{\rm{sys}}$ at the flare onset. We propose this as a quantitative definition for this infrared flare's beginning, physically interpreted as the underlying electron distribution's transition into a hard power-law distribution. This paper also reports the SMA millimeter polarization during the flare, which shows a small, distorted, but overall clockwise-oriented Stokes Q–U loop during the third mid-infrared peak. Extrapolating the mid-infrared flux power law to the millimeter yields a variable flux consistent with the observed 220 GHz emission. These results, together with the Paper I modeling, plausibly suggest a single hotspot produced both the mid-infrared and millimeter variability during this event. However, additional flares are required to make a general statement about the millimeter and mid-infrared connection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variability-selected AGN in dwarf galaxies: the incidence of AGN in dwarf and massive galaxies is similar</a><span class="id">[2511.14842]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the VST-COSMOS survey to identify, via their optical broadband variability, 30 AGN in nearby (z&lt;0.4) dwarf (10^8 MSun &lt; M &lt; 10^10 MSun) galaxies. VST-COSMOS offers a 1 deg^2 survey footprint, a single visit depth of 24.6 mag and 68 r-band visits spanning an eleven-year temporal baseline. Compared to a control sample matched in stellar mass and redshift, the dwarf AGN population shows an elevated fraction of early-type galaxies but a similar fraction of interacting objects, suggesting that interactions do not play a significant role in triggering these AGN. Dwarf AGN hosts do not show strong differences in their distances to nodes, filaments and massive galaxies compared to the controls, which indicates that AGN triggering, at least in this sample, is not strongly correlated with environment. Finally, by combining the true number of galaxies, the detectability of AGN and the measured numbers of variable sources in dwarf and massive (M &gt; 10^10 MSun) galaxies, we estimate the relative frequency of AGN in these two mass regimes. Our results suggest that the incidence of AGN in dwarfs and massive galaxies is similar (within less than a factor of 2 of each other), with some evidence that the AGN fraction increases with stellar mass in the dwarf population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the influence of the protocluster environment on galaxy morphology at z = 2.23</a><span class="id">[2511.14843]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As galaxies evolve in dense cluster and protocluster environments, they interact and quench their star formation, which gradually transforms the galaxy population from star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies. This transformation is identifiable by observing galaxy colors and can be seen in the morphological transformation of late-type galaxies into early-type galaxies, which creates the morphology-density relation seen when comparing populations in clusters to co-eval field galaxies. However, high-z (z &gt; 2) galaxy morphology studies are hindered by the high angular resolution necessary to characterize morphology. We present a study of HST WFC3 F160W observations of protoclusters from the MAMMOTH survey (BOSS1244 and BOSS1542) at z   2.23 with populations of previously identified HAEs. By measuring the Sersic index of 151 HAEs, we look for the early morphological transformation of star-forming galaxies in these well-studied, large, non-virialized protoclusters, which we believe are precursors of present-day clusters. We find the morphology of the populations of star-forming protocluster galaxies does not differ from the co-eval field. However, we identify a population of clumpy, potentially merging galaxies, which could lead to an increase in the population of early-type galaxies in these structures. Additionally, in BOSS1244, which has two previously identified massive quiescent galaxies including a BCG, we find an abundance of early-type galaxies near both the BCG and two co-eval high-z quasars. Although we find a strong similarity between the morphology of field and protocluster galaxies, the population of early-type star-forming galaxies surrounding the spectroscopically confirmed quiescent BCG in BOSS1244, something not seen in BOSS1542, may point to differences in the evolutionary state of these co-eval protoclusters and be a sign of an early forming cluster core in BOSS1244.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J-HERTz: J-PLUS Heritage Exploration of Radio Targets at z $&lt;$ 5</a><span class="id">[2511.14844]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce J-HERTz (J-PLUS Heritage Exploration of Radio Targets at $z &lt; 5$), a new multi-wavelength catalog that combines optical narrow-band photometry from J-PLUS, infrared observations from WISE, and deep low-frequency radio data from LoTSS for nearly half a million sources across 2,100 deg$^2$ of the northern sky. Key innovations of J-HERTz include Bayesian neural network classifications for 390,000 galaxies, 31,000 quasars, and 20,000 stars, along with significantly improved photometric redshifts for 235,000 galaxies compared to previous J-PLUS DR3 and LoTSS DR2 estimates. We identify 831 candidate Galactic radio stars, which, if confirmed, would constitute a significant addition to the number of radio-emitting stars identified to date. Among radio-loud galaxies with spectroscopic observations, $\gtrsim$20% lack Seyfert or LINER signatures, indicating a substantial population of optically quiescent radio galaxies, in agreement with previous works. Spectral energy distribution fitting of their host galaxies using J-PLUS photospectra reveals systematically low specific star formation rates, consistent with quenched stellar populations. J-HERTz thus provides a powerful dataset to exploit radio-optical synergies, enabling studies that span from the origin of stellar radio emission to the AGN life cycle and the role of jet activity in shaping host galaxy evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mid-infrared extinction toward the Galactic center</a><span class="id">[2511.14850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We determine the mid-infrared (MIR, $\sim$5 \mu m–22 \mu m) extinction towards the Galactic center using MIRI/MRS integral field unit (IFU) observations of the central $3''\times3''$ region (near 5 \mu m) to $7''\times7''$ region (near 22 \mu m). To measure the MIR extinction, we employ two approaches: modeling the intrinsic-to-observed dust thermal spectrum and assessing the differential extinction between hydrogen recombination lines. Expanding on prior work, we directly model the dust-opacity distribution along the line of sight, and we make available a Python code that provides a flexible tool for deriving intrinsic dust emission spectra. We confirm the spatial variability of extinction across the field, demonstrating that dusty sources–such as IRS 29N–exhibit higher local extinction. Furthermore, we verify the absence of PAH emission features in the Galactic center MIR spectra. Using the two complementary methods, we derive a refined “best guess” MIR extinction law for Sgr A* and the surrounding Galactic-center region. By applying the extinction law to a MIR flare measurement discussed in a companion paper Michail et al. 2025, we estimate a residual relative extinction uncertainty for the short MIRI/MRS grating on the order of $0.2~\mathrm{mag}$ {from $\sim$5 to $\sim$18 \mu m\ and $\sim$0.3 mag from $\sim$18 to $\sim$22 \mu m}, consistent with our uncertainty estimate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photometric Constraints on Intermediate-mass Black Holes in the Galactic Centre</a><span class="id">[2511.14856]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST/MIRI observations can place photometric limits on the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) near the Galactic Centre. The stellar complex IRS 13E, a co-moving conglomerate of young and massive stars, is a prime location to study because it has been speculated to be bound by an IMBH. Assuming a standard radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and a minimum fractional variability of 10% of intrinsic luminosity, the wavelength of peak emission in the spectral energy distribution for an IMBH would lie in the mid-infrared ($\sim$ 5-25 $\mu$m), and variability would be detectable in MIRI time-series observations. Monitoring fails to detect such variable emission (other than from Sgr A*) in and around the IRS 13E complex, and upper limits on a putative IMBH's intrinsic variability on timescales of minutes to about 1 hour are $\lesssim$1 mJy at 12 $\mu$m and $\lesssim$2 mJy at 19 $\mu$m. These translate to luminosities $\lesssim 25 \times 10^{32}$ erg/s. The resulting limits on the IMBH mass and accretion rate rule out any IMBH with mass $\gtrsim 10^3$ M$_\odot$ accreting at $\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ times Eddington rate at the location of IRS 13E. Further, the observations rule out an IMBH anywhere in the central 6&quot; $\times$ 6&quot; region that is more massive than $\approx$ 2 $\times 10^3$ M$_\odot$ and accreting at $\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ of the Eddington rate. Assuming Bondi accretion scaled to typical RIAF-accretion efficiencies, albeit somewhat uncertain, also allows us to rule out IMBHs moving with typical velocities of about 200 km/s and masses $\gtrsim 2 \times 10^3$ M$_\odot$. These methods showcase the effectiveness of photometric variability measurements in constraining the presence of accreting black holes in Galactic centre-like environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal Disruption Events</a><span class="id">[2511.14911]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stars that orbit too close to a black hole can be ripped apart by strong tides, producing a type of luminous transient event called a “tidal disruption event&quot; (TDE). Tidal disruption events of stars by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) provide windows into the nuclei of galaxies at size scales that are difficult to observe directly outside our own galactic neighborhood. They provide a unique opportunity to study these supermassive black holes under feeding conditions that change dramatically over  week-month timescales, and that regularly reach super-Eddington mass inflow rates. Their light curves are dependent on the properties of the disrupting black hole, and can be used to help constrain the lower mass end of the SMBH mass function – a region of parameter space that is difficult to access with classic dynamical mass measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamics in the Cores of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos: Reduced Stalling and Accelerated Core Collapse</a><span class="id">[2511.14912]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is an intriguing alternative to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, which predicts that dark matter halos typically have large, isothermal cores. Numerical simulations have shown that dynamical friction ceases to operate in cores of (roughly) constant density, a phenomenon known as core stalling. In addition, such cores often are unstable to a dipole instability that gives rise to dynamical buoyancy, causing massive central objects to move outward. Thus far, these manifestations of core dynamics have only been demonstrated in collisionless systems. In this paper, we use idealized N-body simulations to study whether core stalling and dynamical buoyancy operate in SIDM halos. We find that if the self-interactions are sufficiently strong, neither core stalling nor buoyancy are present, and a massive perturber will quickly sink all the way to the center of its host. In doing so, it gravitationally contracts the core, catalyzing a strongly accelerated core collapse. The reason why core dynamics are so different in SIDM halos is that self-interactions drive the halo's distribution function to a featureless exponential, removing any inflections or plateaus that are responsible for the dipole instability and core stalling in the case of CDM. We discuss implications of our finding for constraining the nature of dark matter by using observations of massive objects such as supermassive black holes (SMBHs), globular clusters, and nuclear star clusters in the central regions of galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding the Origin and Dynamical Evolution of the Unique Open Star Cluster Berkeley 20 using FIRE Simulations</a><span class="id">[2511.14958]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Open clusters (OCs) act as key probes that can be leveraged to constrain the formation and evolution of the Milky Way (MW)'s disk, as each has a unique chemical fingerprint and well-constrained age. Significant Galactic dynamic interactions can leave imprints on the orbital properties of OCs, allowing us to use the present day properties of long-lived OCs to reconstruct the MW's dynamic history. To explore these changes, we identify OC analogs in FIRE-2 simulations of MW-mass galaxies. For this work, we focus on one particular FIRE-2 OC, which we identify as an analog to the old, subsolar, distant, and high Galactic latitude MW OC, Berkeley 20. Our simulated OC resides  6 kpc from the galactic center and ultimately reaches a height $|Z_{\mathrm{max}}|&gt;2$ kpc from the galactic disk, similar to Berkeley 20. We trace the simulated cluster's orbital and environmental history, identifying key perturbative episodes, including: (1) an interaction with a gas overdensity in a spiral arm that prompts an outward migration event and (2) a substantial interaction with a Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy-mass satellite that causes significant orbital modification. Our simulated OC shows significant resilience to disruption during both its outward migration and the satellite-driven heating event that causes subsequent inward migration. Ultimately, we find these two key processes – migration and satellite heating – are essential to include when assessing OC orbital dynamics in the era of Gaia.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15006" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toward Complete Merger Identification at Cosmic Noon with Deep Learning</a><span class="id">[2511.15006]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As we enter the era of large imaging surveys such as $\textit{Roman}$, Rubin, and $\textit{Euclid}$, a deeper understanding of potential biases and selection effects in optical astronomical catalogs created with the use of ML-based methods is paramount.

We train a ResNet18 model on mock Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS images from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. Our focus is on a more challenging classification of galaxy mergers and nonmergers at higher redshifts $1&lt;z&lt;1.5$, including minor mergers and lower mass galaxies down to the stellar mass of $10^8 M_\odot$. We demonstrate, for the first time, that a deep learning model, such as the one developed in this work, can successfully identify even minor and low mass mergers even at these redshifts. Our model achieves overall accuracy, purity, and completeness of 73%. We show that some galaxy mergers can only be identified from certain observation angles, leading to a potential upper limit in overall accuracy. Using Grad-CAMs and UMAPs, we more deeply examine the performance and observe a visible gradient in the latent space with stellar mass and specific star formation rate, but no visible gradient with merger mass ratio or merger stage.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15079" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALMA-QUARKS survey: Evidence of a candidate high-mass prestellar core aside a bright-rimmed cloud IRAS 18290-0924</a><span class="id">[2511.15079]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although frequently reported in observations, the definitive confirmation of high-mass prestellar cores has remained elusive, presenting a persistent challenge in star formation studies. Using two-band observational data from the 3mm ATOMS and 1.3mm QUARKS surveys, we report a high-mass prestellar core candidate, C2, located on the side of the bright-rimmed cloud IRAS 18290-0924. The C2 core identified from the 3mm continuum data of the ATOMS survey ($\sim$2 arcsecond, $\rm\sim 10000~au$ at 5.3 kpc) has a mass ranging from 27-68 $M_{\odot}$ for temperatures 10-22K within a radius of $\sim$2800 au. The highest-resolution ($\sim$0.3 arcsecond, $\rm\sim 1500 au$) observations of this source presented to date from the QUARKS survey reveal no evidence of further fragmentation. Further analysis of a total $\sim$10 GHz band width of molecular line survey does not find star-formation activity (e.g., outflows, ionized gas) associated with the core, with a few molecular lines of cold gas detected only. Additionally, virial analysis indicates the C2 core is gravitationally bound ($\alpha_{\rm vir} \sim0.1-0.3$) and thus could be undergoing collapse toward star formation. These results strongly establish a candidate for a high-mass prestellar core, contributing to the very limited number of such sources known to date.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15115" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PHR J1724-3859: A Bipolar Planetary Nebula in Open Cluster Trumpler 25</a><span class="id">[2511.15115]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planetary nebulae (PNe) studies are essential for understanding late stellar evolution of low-to-intermediate mass stars. PNe in open clusters (OC) are rare but valuable since their study directly links their properties to those of their progenitors, something that cannot be achieved for field PNe. Here, we report the identification of one more OC-PN association to add to the small sample of, now, five pairs. The physical properties of the host cluster, PN and its central star (CSPN) have been explored using high and intermediate-resolution spectral and deep photometric data. The close agreement of the radial velocities of the PN and host cluster, together with concordance of reddening and distance, show that the PN PHR J1724-3859 is highly likely to be physically associated with the OC Trumpler 25. Deep photometric data allowed clear identification of the CSPN. We find a CSPN effective temperature of around 250 kK and a nebular kinematic age of 23 kyrs, both at the extreme end, like the other members of this small class. The progenitor and final CSPN masses have been estimated to be 5.12$_{-0.15}^{+0.16}$ $M_\odot$ and 0.95$\pm$0.12 $M_\odot$ respectively. These latest results agree with the emerging trend for our other OC-PNe, falling below, but approximately parallel to, the latest initial-to-final-mass relation estimates derived from cluster white dwarfs and has important implications for stellar evolution models.

This study examines how such perturbations influence the most eccentric comets in the Oort Cloud (OC), a thermalized reservoir of $\sim 10^{12}$ icy bodies extending from $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ AU. Recent Gaia-based analyses indicate about 20 stellar passages within 1 pc of the Sun per Myr. Using analytical estimates and direct $N$-body simulations, we quantify how these encounters modify highly eccentric orbits: individual flybys enhance comet-shower rates by factors of about 2, producing a cumulative increase of roughly 40 over a Myr. In parallel, we perform a full dynamical search through all stars with six-dimensional phase-space data in Gaia DR3 and identify a compelling candidate for a long-period stellar companion to the Sun. This star exhibits recurrent $\sim 45$ Myr perihelion passages and, in simulations, can elevate comet-shower activity by an order of magnitude. Because a perturber of this kind could also be a dispersed solar sibling, the companion hypothesis links the dynamical structure of the OC directly to the long-standing problem of identifying the Sun's birth-cluster relatives. The chemical-abundance pattern of such a star therefore becomes a critical observational test. Together, these results clarify how both stochastic encounters and potential long-period companions shape the dynamical evolution and observable output of the outermost OC, while highlighting the possibility that the OC retains a dynamical memory of the Sun's earliest stellar environment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Wave Phase shifts of black hole mergers in AGN Disks</a><span class="id">[2511.15193]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors have discovered about 200 compact object mergers. The astrophysical origins of these events are highly debated, and it is possible that at least a fraction of them originate from dynamical environments. Among these, the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are particularly interesting as promising environments, as some observed properties may be more readily produced there. When compact objects merge in these environments, acceleration from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) or nearby companions is inevitable. Such acceleration induces a phase shift in the observed GW waveforms, which can serve as a useful tool to distinguish the underlying merging environments for each GW event. In this paper, we investigate the expected distribution of such acceleration-induced GW phase shifts, using a semi-analytical model combined with a one-dimensional AGN population synthesis code. We find significant contributions from three-body interactions involving a nearby third object. Our results indicate that the GW phase shift is likely to be larger compared to other channels, making it distinguishable by future GW facilities such as TianQin, DECIGO, Taiji, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic Explorer. Interestingly, a notable fraction of mergers in fact exhibit a significant GW phase shift ($\gtrsim~{\rm 1\ rad}$) at frequencies above $10~{\rm Hz}$, which could even be detectable by current GW detectors such as LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Additionally, if gas-hardening during three-body interactions is taken into account, the GW frequency can be boosted to $\gtrsim 10~{\rm Hz}$, potentially further aiding in the detection of the phase shift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of action-space coherence in a Milky Way-like simulation</a><span class="id">[2511.15215]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Efforts to dynamically trace stars back to the now-dissolved clusters in which they formed rely implicitly on the assumption that stellar orbital actions are conserved. While this holds in a static, axisymmetric potential, it is unknown how strongly the time-varying, non-axisymmetric structure of a real galactic disk drives action drift that inhibits cluster reconstruction. We answer this question using a high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way-like spiral disc galaxy. We show that, while stars experience significant action evolution over $\lesssim 100$ Myr, they do so in a correlated fashion whereby stars born in close proximity maintain very similar actions for up to 0.5 Gyr. The degree of coherence shows no significant dependence on galactocentric radius, but varies between action components: vertical actions decohere for stars born more than a few hundred parsecs apart (likely due to giant molecular clouds), while radial and azimuthal actions remain correlated on kiloparsec scales (likely influenced by spiral arms). We use our measurements of the rate of action decoherence to develop a probabilistic framework that lets us infer the initial sizes of the star cluster progenitors of present-day stellar streams from their measured action distributions, which we apply to 438 known moving groups. Our results suggest that most of these streams likely originated from compact clusters, but that a significant minority are instead likely to be resonant or dynamically induced structures. This method of classifying streams complements existing methods, optimises the use of expensive spectroscopic abundance measurements, and will be enhanced by the more precise kinematic data that will soon become available from \textit{Gaia} DR4.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. IV. Broad Emission Line Evolution Sequence Among Hα, Mg II, and Hβ</a><span class="id">[2511.15275]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>From a parent catalog of 561 changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) identified by Guo et al. (2025), we investigate the evolutionary sequence of broad emission lines using a redshift-selected subset (0.35 &lt; z &lt; 0.45) of 54 CL-AGNs whose Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) spectra simultaneously cover the H{\alpha}, H\b{eta}, and Mg II emission lines. To provide a baseline for comparison, we construct a control sample of 19,897 normal Type 1 AGNs within the same redshift range from the DESI Year 1 data. Through stacked spectral analysis and line-continuum luminosity correlations, we identify a clear evolutionary sequence in all AGN where broad H\b{eta} fades first, followed by Mg II, and then H{\alpha}, as the AGN luminosity declines - consistent with expectations from reverberation mapping. This trend reflects a radially stratified broad line region (BLR), where each line's responsivity depends on its ionization potential and radial distance from the central engine. In addition, we find that more massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs) require lower Eddington ratios to fully suppress broad emission lines, suggesting that the critical accretion threshold for the CL phenomenon is mass-dependent. Our results present the first statistical confirmation of a stratified broad line fading sequence in AGNs, reinforcing the central role of accretion state in shaping BLR structure and visibility.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15309" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Rotation Dip in the Envelope-Disk Transition of HH 111: Evidence for Magnetic Braking</a><span class="id">[2511.15309]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic braking can drive angular momentum loss in star formation and influence disk evolution. A previous study of HH 111 VLA1 suggested a decrease in rotation velocity in a region between the infalling envelope and rotating disk. Using ALMA C$^{18}$O ($J = 2-1$) data, we analyzed the gas motion within 6000 au and found clear deviations from the simplest expectations of free-fall towards the central star with conserved angular momentum in the transition region between the envelope and disk (from $\sim$5200 to 160 au). The region can be further divided into three zones: (1) outer region with a significant decrease in infall velocity, dropping to approximately 60\% of the free-fall velocity and 70\% of conservation of angular momentum and energy; (2) middle region with a sharp drop in angular momentum and thus rotation velocity and an increase in infall velocity; and (3) inner region with rotation velocity increasing inward to connect to that of the Keplerian disk and infall velocity decreasing to zero. Comparison with non-ideal MHD simulations suggests that the reduced infall velocity in the outer region can be due to magnetic tension by the pinched magnetic field lines, the sharp drop of angular momentum in the middle region can be due to magnetic braking as the field lines pile up, and the rapid increase in rotation velocity in the inner region might result from weaker magnetic braking due to ambipolar diffusion of the field lines. The resulting dip in the rotation profile supports magnetic braking.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15349" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Type Iax supernovae as a source of iron-rich silicate dust</a><span class="id">[2511.15349]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We model the formation of dust in the ejecta of Type Iax supernovae (SNe), which is a low-luminosity subclass of Type Ia SNe. A non-equilibrium chemical kinetic approach is adopted to trace the synthesis of molecules, molecular clusters, and dust grains in the ejecta of thermonuclear SNe. We find that Type Iax SNe provide conditions conducive to the formation of several O-rich dust species in the ejecta. Particularly, iron-rich silicates of chemical type FeSiO3, Fe2SiO4, and MgFeSiO4 are found to form in abundance, suggesting that the ejecta of low-luminosity thermonuclear SNe can be a site where a large fraction of iron is locked up in dust, unlike other stellar sources. The final mass of dust formed in the ejecta ranges between 10^{-5} and 10^{-4} Msun, where most of the dust forms between 1000 and 2000 days post-explosion. Apart from Fe-rich silicates, Mg-silicates, and silicon carbide are also formed in the ejecta of Type Iax SNe. When compared to the dust budget of typical Type Ia SNe, we find that the expected dust-to-ejecta mass ratio is one or two orders of magnitude larger in Type Iax SNe. We conclude that the ejecta of typical Type Ia SNe form a negligible amount of dust, in agreement with observation, while the low-luminosity subclass Type Iax SNe are potential producers of iron-rich silicates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.

We identify 97 CL quasars showing significant variability in high-ionization broad emission lines, including 45 turn-on and 52 turn-off events, corresponding to a detection rate of approximately 0.042%. This rate is lower than that found for low-ionization CL quasars, likely due to both selection effects and physical differences in high-ionization lines. Based on the CL quasar sample, we find that CL quasars generally exhibit lower accretion rates compared to typical quasars, with average Eddington ratios of log lambda_Edd approximately -1.14 in the bright state and approximately -1.39 in the dim state, compared to approximately -0.65 for typical quasars. While high-ionization lines in CL quasars follow the Baldwin effect on a population level, some individual sources show inverse Baldwin trends. We also find a positive correlation between the variability of high-ionization lines such as Mg II and C III] and the change in bolometric luminosity. In addition, we estimate a characteristic rest-frame timescale of approximately 3 years for CL transitions, with no significant difference between turn-on and turn-off cases. Taken together, these results support an accretion-driven origin for the CL phenomenon and provide new insights into the variability of high-ionization emission lines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple relations from complex outflows: How the $M-σ$ relation emerges in a multi-phase environment</a><span class="id">[2511.15380]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The tight empirical $M-\sigma$ relation between the mass of a SMBH) and the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy bulge is often interpreted as the result of self-regulation by AGN feedback. This picture is motivated by analytical and semi-analytical models in which momentum-driven AGN winds can expel the gas once the SMBH reaches a critical mass. However, these models typically assume idealised conditions: smooth gas distributions, spherical symmetry, and very efficient cooling of the shocked AGN wind. We checked whether AGN outflows can establish the $M-\sigma$ relation in a multi-phase and turbulent galactic bulge subject to realistic radiative cooling while conserving the shocked AGN wind energy. We calculated a suite of purpose-built hydrodynamical simulations of AGN outflows in turbulent gas shells, covering a wide range of constant AGN luminosities. We tracked the outflow evolution over the course of $\geq1$ Myr. We analysed the effect of AGN outflow on the cold dense gas and SMBH feeding, estimating the luminosity threshold for removing most of the cold gas from the central regions. We find that AGNs with significantly sub-Eddington luminosities cannot suppress SMBH feeding, while luminosities exceeding $\sim 0.7$ times Eddington clear out both the diffuse hot gas and the cold clumps, consistent with the momentum-driven outflow formalism. We also show that dense gas clusters are affected almost exclusively by the AGN wind momentum, while the shocked wind energy escapes through low-density channels and inflates large bubbles of diffuse gas. Therefore, AGN wind-driven energy-conserving feedback in a turbulent multi-phase medium affects the dense gas only via the wind momentum. Thus, the momentum-driven outflow paradigm is applicable for explaining the $M-\sigma$ relation even in realistic systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights on Gas Distribution and Dynamics in Massive Proto-cluster G358.46$-$0.39: Possible Multiplicity in G358.46$-$0.39 MM1a</a><span class="id">[2511.15400]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work explored the spatial distribution of C$^{17}$O, SiO, HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ molecules, as well as the energetics of outflows in G358.46$-$0.39 proto-cluster using ALMA band 7 archival data, with the aim of providing an improved understanding of its protostellar nature, gas kinematics and dynamics. G358.46$-$0.39 is previously known to consist of 4 dust continuum cores (MM1a, MM1b, MM1c and MM2). The integrated intensity map of C$^{17}$O reveals filamentary and dumbbell-shaped structures that are probably compressed gases from the expansion of the HII region MM2. The SiO emission reveals spatially overlapped blue and red outflow lobes, likely driven by an unresolved young stellar object (YSO) in MM1a. The spatial distribution of HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ molecules in MM1a shows a compact morphology, with no detectable HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ emissions in the other cores. The SO$_{2}$ emission reveals a clear velocity gradient in MM1a, as well as large velocity dispersion ($\sim$ 3 \kms) within the inner core of MM1a, which are consistent with rotating structures. We estimated the mass, momentum and energy outflow rate, as well as other outflow parameters. The SiO outflow exhibits a different morphology compared to the $^{12}$CO outflow morphology previously observed in MM1a. The SiO and $^{12}$CO outflows are probably associated with disks of separate cores with one face-on and the other edge-on, pointing to multiplicity of YSOs in MM1a. The properties of MM1a indicate that it is a massive protostar that is actively accreting and undergoing star formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Explosions in the Empty: A Survey of Transients in Local Void Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.15401]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a systematic analysis of transient astrophysical events – including supernovae (SNe), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and fast radio bursts (FRBs) – in void and non-void galaxies within the local universe ($0.005 &lt; z &lt; 0.05$). Cosmic voids, defined by low galaxy densities and characterized by minimal environmental interactions, offer a natural laboratory for isolating the impact of large-scale underdensities on stellar evolution and transient production. Using multi-wavelength data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Supernova Catalogue, and high-energy space observatories, we compare transient occurrence rates and host galaxy properties across environments. We find that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are significantly more common in void galaxies, indicating that massive star formation remains active in underdense regions. In contrast, Type Ia supernovae are less frequent in voids, consistent with a scarcity of older stellar populations. Notably, we identify a short-duration GRB hosted by a void galaxy, demonstrating that compact object mergers can occur in isolated environments. Additionally, we find no FRBs associated with void galaxies. Taken together, these results show that cosmic voids exert a measurable influence on the star formation history of galaxies and hence on the production of transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elemental abundance ratios for the bulge of M31</a><span class="id">[2511.15415]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present radial trends of metallicity ([Fe/H]) and abundance ratios ([X/Fe]) for several chemical elements – including C, N, Na, and the so-called alpha-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti) – in the bulge of M31, out to  0.6kpc from the center. We estimated abundances using full-spectrum fitting, full-index fitting, and line-strength analysis, in combination with different stellar population models. We first tested these techniques on mock spectra and SDSS stacked spectra of ETGs, and then applied them to high-quality long-slit spectroscopy of the M31 bulge obtained with the OSIRIS spectrograph at the GTC. We find that O, N, and Na are significantly enhanced relative to Fe across the bulge, with typical abundances &gt;0.3 dex. In particular, N and Na show steep central enhancements, reaching  0.5dex. C, Mg, and Si exhibit intermediate enhancements of [X/Fe] 0.2dex, with C and Mg decreasing toward the center to &lt; 0.1dex; while Ca, and to a lesser extent Ti, closely follow Fe, with [X/Fe]&lt;0.1dex. Applying the same analysis to SDSS stacked spectra of ETGs revealed that the abundance pattern of the M31 bulge closely resembles that of the most massive galaxies, except for N, which is significantly more enhanced (by  0.1dex) in the bulge. For the bulk of the bulge, chemical evolution models assuming high star-formation efficiency and a short gas infall timescale reproduce the overall trends in [Fe/H] and [X/Fe]. In the central region (&lt; 100pc), the high metallicity content of the bulge can be explained by either an IMF flatter than Salpeter at high mass, or a prolonged star formation. Additional processes, such as differential galactic winds, appear necessary to account for the observed decoupling among alpha elements and the strong central N enhancement. Our results support a scenario whereby the bulk of the M31 bulge formed during a fast and intense episode of star formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the disk-jet coupling in M87</a><span class="id">[2511.15482]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Recent GMVA observations of M 87 at event horizon scales revealed a ring-like structure which is 50% larger at 86 GHz than the ring observed by the Event Horizon Telescope at 230 GHz. Aims. In this paper, we study a possible origin of the increased ring size at 86 GHz. We specifically aim to study the role the nonthermal electron population plays in the observed event horizon scales. Methods. We carry out 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations followed by radiative transfer calculations. We incorporate into the latter synchrotron emission from both thermal and nonthermal electrons. To better compare our results to observations, we generate synthetic interferometric data adjusted to the properties of the observing arrays. We fit geometrical models to this data in Fourier space through Bayesian analysis to monitor the variable ring size and width over the simulated time span of years. Results. We find that the 86 GHz ring is always larger than the 230 GHz ring, which can be explained by the increased synchrotron self-absorption at 86 GHz and the mixed emission from both the accretion disk and the jet footpoints, as well as flux arcs ejected from a magnetized disk. We find agreement with the observations, particularly within the error range of the observational value of M/D for M 87. Conclusions. We show that state-of-the art 3D GRMHD simulations combined with thermal and nonthermal emitting particles can explain the observed frequency-dependent ring size in M 87.

Its environment is challenging to explore because it is located at low Galactic latitudes, behind the Galactic disc. The long-term goal is to characterise the Circinus galaxy halo and determine the presence of dwarf satellites using near-infrared data. We selected 1,542 galaxies from the VVV NIRGC within a 2-degree radius around Circinus, representing 2/3 of the virial radius. Structural parameters such as half-light radii and colours were used, and correlations were examined. A neural network was trained with 486 galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts to estimate photometric redshifts for all galaxies. Potential satellites were defined based on half-light radii compatible with the typical sizes of dwarf satellites, and combined with photometric redshifts. The galaxy properties are reliably characterised down to $K_{s}$ $\sim$ 15.5 mag, which represents about 90% completeness of detections. At the distance of Circinus, this limiting magnitude corresponds to $K_{s}$ absolute magnitude of $-12.6$ mag, which allows us to find dwarf galaxies. There are 20 galaxies with half-light radii larger than 2.45 arcsec, only 8 have photometric redshifts below 0.04. None of these galaxies is close to Circinus, which has a redshift of 0.0015. The ANNz model exhibited a high degree of accuracy in the range $0.001 &lt; z_{phot} &lt; 0.023$. The presence of dwarf satellites could not be confirmed with the available data in the studied region. The apparent lack of satellites may be genuine, possibly related to AGN feedback effects. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining near-infrared data and machine learning techniques to estimate photometric redshifts at low Galactic latitudes, providing useful information for future spectroscopic follow-up campaigns.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catching the 2021 γ-ray flare in the blazar TXS 2013+370</a><span class="id">[2511.15601]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $\gamma$-ray-loud blazar TXS 2013+370, a powerful multiwavelength emitter at $z = 0.859$, underwent an exceptional GeV outburst in late 2020-early 2021.

The images revealed a compact near-core knot at $r \simeq 40$-$60~\mu\mathrm{as}$ contemporaneously with the GeV flare and a flat, core-dominated spectrum ($\alpha \gtrsim -0.5$). The core has strong linear polarization and exhibits a $\sim 50^{\circ}$ EVPA rotation at 86 GHz; pixel-based and integrated fits yield a high, uniform rotation measure, ${\rm RM} = (7.8 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{4}~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$, consistent with an external Faraday screen. Cross-correlation of Fermi-LAT and 15 GHz data shows a significant peak with the $\gamma$ rays leading by $\Delta t = (102 \pm 12)\,\mathrm{d}$; adopting $\beta_{\rm app} = 4.2 \pm 0.5$ and $\theta = 4.1^{\circ} \pm 0.2^{\circ}$ implies a de-projected separation $\Delta r_{\gamma-15} = (2.71 \pm 0.47)\,\mathrm{pc}$ and locates the GeV emission between the jet apex and $\sim 0.42$ pc ($1\sigma$ range) downstream. Our results do not uniquely pinpoint the emission site; rather, they support two valid scenarios. The $\gamma$-ray production may occur within the BLR ($\sim 0.07$pc), where external-Compton scattering of optical/UV photons produces the $\gamma$ rays, or beyond the BLR, reaching $\sim 0.42$ pc ($1\sigma$) within the inner parsecs, where external-Compton scattering of dusty-torus infrared photons dominates. Both scenarios are compatible within the allowed range of emission distances, while opacity-driven core shifts modulate the observed radio-$\gamma$ delay without requiring large relocations of the dissipation zone.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reporting a Deficit of Intrinsic NV Absorbers in Core-dominated, Radio-loud Quasars</a><span class="id">[2511.15627]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We searched the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph archive for ultraviolet spectra of 428 AGN to identify intrinsic NV absorption systems.

This yielded 175 Type 1 quasars, 34 radio-loud, 133 radio-quiet, and eight unconstrained. Our survey uncovered 77 associated NV systems in the spectra of 48 of these low-redshift quasars. We consider the incidence of intrinsic absorbers as a function of quasar properties (optical, radio and X-ray). We find a statistically significant dearth of intrinsic NV systems in the spectra of the 34 radio-loud quasars (6%), compared to 29% of the 133 radio-quiet quasars containing at least one intrinsic system. Assuming intrinsic systems are equally likely to occur in radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars and the orientations of the two subsamples are comparable, there is a 0.1% probability of such a deficit occurring by chance in the radio-loud population. We propose that this deficit of systems is caused by orientation effects. FIRST radio images are available for 14 of the 33 radio-loud quasars. These show that only three of the 14 radio-loud quasars have lobe-dominated morphologies, whereas 11 of the 14 radio-loud quasars have compact radio morphologies, implying that these quasars are face on, and suggesting that clouds that produce NV absorption are rarely found along the polar axis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Populating Galaxies Into Halos Via Machine Learning on the Simba Simulation</a><span class="id">[2406.16103]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a machine-learning framework, Machine Inferred Galaxy (MIG), to populate dark-matter haloes with galaxies in N-body simulations.

The pipeline first separates haloes into centrals and satellites, then uses classifiers to distinguish star-forming (SF) from quenched (Q) systems, followed by regressors trained on the SF subsets for both centrals and satellites. Trained on the $(100,h^{-1},\mathrm{Mpc})^3$ SIMBA galaxy-formation simulation at $z=0$, MIG achieves high accuracy for key baryonic properties (e.g. $R^2 \approx 0.9$ for $M_{\mathrm{HI}}$ of central galaxies), and remains robust at $z=1$ and $z=2$. Training on fractional quantities (e.g. $M_{\mathrm{HI}}/M_\ast$) and rescaling by predicted $M_\ast$ improves performance over direct predictions across properties and redshifts. MIG also reproduces galaxy mass distribution functions with higher fidelity, enabling accurate predictions of integrated tracers such as H I intensity maps.

When comparing to the primary mass distribution, our results indicate that either the average IMF in dwarf galaxies must be top heavy, or most of the 30-40 $\rm M_\odot$ black holes must be formed through a dynamical capture mechanism. For masses greater than about $50 \, \rm M_\odot$, the predicted number of BBH systems plummet to zero, revealing the well-known mass gap due to the pair instability mechanism and mass loss in binary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16158" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UHECR deflections in the coherent Galactic magnetic field</a><span class="id">[2501.16158]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the deflections of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in several widely used models of the coherent Galactic magnetic field (GMF), including PT11 (Pshirkov et al.

We use stacked Mg II absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars to study the cool gas out to 9Mpc from massive quiescent, star-forming and post-starburst galaxies with stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{gal}}/M_\odot) \gtrsim 11.4$ and $0.4 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.8$ selected from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS galaxies. Consistent with previous studies, we observe a decline in absorption strength indicating a decrease in cool gas content with increasing distance from the galaxies, as well as decreasing star formation rate of the galaxies. Beyond 1Mpc, this decline levels off to the same absorption strength in all galaxy types, suggesting a transition from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to the intergalactic medium (IGM) at approximately the virial radius of the host dark matter haloes. We find that post-starburst galaxies, that have experienced a recent burst of star formation that has rapidly quenched, exhibit significantly stronger Mg II absorption within 1Mpc than star-forming or quiescent galaxies of the same stellar mass. Because post-starburst galaxies are a potentially significant pathway for the formation of quiescent elliptical galaxies, our results have wide reaching implications for understanding the mechanisms involved in quenching star formation in galaxies. We speculate that the excess cool gas absorption out to 1Mpc around post-starburst galaxies is related to their observed high velocity ($\sim$1000 km/s) cool gas outflows. Thus, strong, short-lived bursts of star formation impact the CGM around galaxies on Mpc distances and Gyr timescales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST's PEARLS: A Candidate Massive Binary Star System in a Lensed Galaxy at Redshift 0.94</a><span class="id">[2507.03098]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive stars at cosmological distances can be individually detected during transient microlensing events, when gravitational lensing magnifications may exceed  1000. Nine such sources were identified in JWST NIRCam imaging of a single galaxy at redshift z=0.94 known as the &quot;Warhol arc,” which is mirror-imaged by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403. Here we present the discovery of two coincident and well-characterized microlensing events at the same location followed by a third event observed in a single filter approximately 18 months later. The events can be explained by microlensing of a binary star system consisting of a red supergiant (T   4000 K) and a B-type (T   13,000 K) companion star. The timescale of the coincident microlensing events constrains the estimated projected source-plane size to tens of AU. The most likely binary configurations consistent with the observational constraints on the temperature and luminosity of each star are stars with initial masses M1=23.6+5.3-4.3 Msol and an initial mass ratio between the two stars close to unity. A kinematic model that reproduces the observed light curve in all filters gives a relatively small transverse velocity of 50 km/s. This requires the dominant velocity component of several hundreds of km/s to be roughly parallel to the microcaustic. An alternative possibility would be that the three microlensing events correspond to unrelated stars crossing distinct microcaustics, but this would imply a highly elevated rate of events at their common position, even though no underlying knot is present at the location.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the Growth of Little Red Dot Descendants at z&lt;4 with the JWST</a><span class="id">[2507.04011]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of JWST's most remarkable discoveries is a population of compact red galaxies known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Their existence raises many questions about their nature, origin, and evolution. These galaxies show a steep decline in number density-nearly two orders of magnitude-from $z=6$ to $z=3$. In this study, we explore their potential evolution by identifying candidate descendants in CEERS, assuming a single evolutionary path: the development of a blue star-forming outskirt around the red compact core. Our color-magnitude selection identifies galaxies as red as LRDs at $z&lt;4$, surrounded by young, blue stellar outskirts. Morphological parameters were derived from single Sérsic profile fits; physical properties were obtained from SED fitting using a stellar-only model. These &quot;post-LRD&quot; candidates show LRD-like features with $M_\ast \sim 10^{10} \ M_\odot $, central densities ($ \Sigma_\ast \sim 10^{11} \ M_\odot \ \text{kpc}^{-2}$ ), compact sizes, and red rest-frame colors, but with an added extended component. Their number density at $z = 3 \pm 0.5$ ( $ \sim 10^{-4.15} \, \text{Mpc}^{-3} $) matches that of LRDs at $5 &lt; z &lt; 7$ , supporting a possible evolutionary link. We observe a redshift-dependent increase in outskirts mass fraction and galaxy size-from $\sim 250$ pc at $ z = 5 $ to $\sim 600$ pc at $ z = 3 $-suggesting global stellar growth. Meanwhile, the core remains red and compact, but the V-shaped SED fades as the outskirts grow. These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which LRDs gradually acquire an extended stellar component over cosmic time by cold accretion. This may explain the apparent decline in their observed number density at lower redshift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DELVE-ing into the Milky Way's Globular Clusters: Assessing extra-tidal features in NGC 5897, NGC 7492, and testing detectability with deeper photometry</a><span class="id">[2507.11629]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extra-tidal features around globular clusters (GCs) are tracers of their disruption, stellar stream formation, and their host's gravitational potential.

Forming 10^9 Solar Mass SMBHs by z=6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli2007,Lousto2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Population III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by approximately 20-30% by z=6 and creates a population of off-nuclear (“wandering”) BHs amounting to a few percent of the total.

We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H$_2$ cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H$_2$ cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations.

Recent studies have compared $\sigma$ in observed and modeled streams to probe DM properties, but have relied on stream models that neglect strong encounters, black holes (BHs), and mass segregation in GCs. Such phenomena may inflate stream $\sigma$ or introduce selection effects – e.g., a $\sigma$ that depends on star mass ($m$). We investigate this prospect using Monte Carlo $N$-body simulations of GCs under static Galactic tides to generate mock streams with realistic mass and velocity distributions. We find $\sigma$ correlates with $m$, especially after core collapse (the GC's observable increase in central density upon ejecting its BHs), rising from $1.2$–$2.2\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$ between $m=0.3$–$0.8\,M_\odot$, with typical kinematic cuts on stream membership. Similar in magnitude to heating by Galactic substructure, this enhancement occurs because the GC's loss of BHs allows its most-massive stars to occupy its dense center, raising their likelihood of strong ejection via binary interactions and adding broad, exponential wings to the stream's velocity distribution. Streams' kinematics thus probe properties (density, BH retention) of their progenitor GCs. Our results also imply observations of streams from some GCs, especially those not subject to highly episodic mass loss, may select for higher $\sigma$ than predicted by models neglecting $\sigma$'s $m$-dependence. This would cause observed $\sigma$ in streams – already on the low side of expectations for cold DM – to further favor alternatives such as warm or ultralight DM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18248" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: Stellar and nebular dust attenuation of main-sequence galaxies at z 4-6</a><span class="id">[2510.18248]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Characterizing dust attenuation is crucial for revealing the intrinsic physical properties of galaxies.

We fit the emission line fluxes from NIRSpec and the broad-band photometry from NIRCam with Prospector, using both spatially integrated emission and $\sim0.6$ kpc pixel-by-pixel measurements. We derive the stellar-to-nebular dust attenuation ratio ($f=E(B-V)_{\mathrm{star}}/E(B-V)_{\mathrm{neb}}$) from the SED fits and the Balmer decrement with H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. Although individual galaxies show large scatter, the best-fit value is $f = 0.51^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$, slightly higher than that measured for local starburst galaxies. We find weak correlations of $f$ with galaxy properties, increasing with higher specific star-formation rates, younger stellar ages, and more recent star-formation. For the range of $E(B-V)_{\mathrm{star}} = 0.009-0.15$ mag for in our sample, assuming $f = 1$ (often adopted in high-redshift studies) instead of $f = 0.51$ underestimate line luminosities and ionizing photon production efficiency $\xi_\text{ion}$ by $\sim3-36\%$ and $\sim4-46\%$, respectively. We also find that the total stellar masses estimated from spatially-integrated SED fits with a delayed-$\tau$ star-formation histories are systematically smaller than the sum of pixel-by-pixel SED fits, with a median offset of $\sim 0.26$ dex, likely because the integrated fits are biased toward luminous young stellar populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The interstellar flux gap: From dust to kilometer-scale objects</a><span class="id">[2511.01957]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Three kilometer-sized interstellar objects (ISOs) have been detected transiting the Solar System, and spacecraft have directly measured micrometer-scale interstellar dust (ISD). Yet no intermediate-size interstellar meteoroids have been identified in current meteor surveys. Aims. We test whether a power-law flux extrapolation connecting spacecraft ISD and kilometer-scale ISOs is consistent with meteor surveys, and we quantify the expected interstellar impacting flux based on various observational reports. Methods. We compiled differential fluxes and limits from spacecraft ISD, radar and optical meteor surveys, and theoretical estimates. We evaluated the power-law size-frequency fits, computed the 3I-like flux, and compared measured fluxes to predictions. Results. The spacecraft-measured dust flux exceeds extrapolations constrained by meteor surveys and kilometer-scale ISOs by $\sim$2-7 orders of magnitude. An $r^{-3.0}$ fit combining spacecraft ISD detections with kilometer-scale ISOs overpredicts the number of meteors with hyperbolic orbits, whereas slopes of $r^{-2.7}$-$r^{-2.3}$ (derived from radar and optical meteor upper limits, respectively) instead yield interplanetary-to-interstellar flux ratios of $10^{3}$-$10^{6}$. Conclusions. A simple power-law from ISD to ISOs is inconsistent with meteor survey constraints and yields unrealistic predictions for interstellar meteoroids. The data reveal a gap between submicron dust entrained in the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) and macroscopic bodies ejected from planetary systems. This gap may reflect distinct origins and destruction-transport processes rather than a continuous size-frequency distribution. This would imply either the dominance of a small-particle LIC component or the need to reassess spacecraft dust fluxes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST observes the assembly of a massive galaxy at z 4</a><span class="id">[2511.13650]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present JWST observations of the radio galaxy TGSSJ1530+1049, spectroscopically confirmed at $z=4.0$.

NIRCam images show a number of distinct continuum objects and evidence of interactions traced by diffuse emission, and the NIRSpec IFU cube reveals further strong line emitting regions. We identify six continuum and four additional strong Halpha emitting sources with weaker or no underlying continuum within the 3”x3” IFU field. From spatial alignment with high-resolution radio data and emission line profiles, the radio AGN host galaxy is clearly identified. The bright Halpha emission (but not the optical components) is distributed remarkably linearly along the radio axis, suggestive of a biconical illumination zone by a central obscured AGN. The emission line kinematics indicate jet-gas interactions on scales of a few kpc. However, due to large relative velocities and presence of underlying continuum, the alignment with the radio structure appears to be, at least partly, caused by a particular configuration of interacting galaxies. At least four objects within a 10x10 (projected) kpc^2 area which includes the radio source have high stellar masses (log($M_\star/M_\odot)&gt;10.3$) and star formation rates in the range 70-163 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Using a stellar mass-based analysis, we predict a total dark matter halo mass of $\approx10^{13} M_\odot$. Based on the physical separations and velocity differences between the galaxies, it is expected that these galaxies will merge to form a massive galaxy within a few Gyr. The system qualitatively resembles the forming brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological simulations that form early through a rapid succession of mergers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic Fields in the Shapley Supercluster Core with POSSUM: Challenging Model Predictions</a><span class="id">[2511.14377]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) Grids provide a sensitive means to trace magnetized plasma across a wide range of cosmic environments.

We combine RM Grid data with thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect data, obtained from the POSSUM pilot survey, and Planck, respectively. To robustly determine the gas density, its magnetic field properties, and their correlation, we study the RM scatter in the SSC region and its behavior as a function of distance to the nearest cluster/group. We compare observational results with semi-analytic Gaussian random field models and more realistic cosmological MHD simulations. With a sky-density of 36 RMs/deg$^{2}$, we detect an excess RM scatter of $30.5\pm 4.6 \, \mathrm{rad/m^2}$ in the SSC region. Comparing with models, we find an average magnetic field strength of 1-3 $\mu$G (in the groups and clusters). The RM scatter profile, derived from data ranging from 0.3-1.8 $r_{500}$ for all objects, is systematically flatter than expected compared to models, with $\eta&lt;0.5$ being favored. Despite this discrepancy, we find that cosmological MHD simulations matched to the SSC structure most closely align with scenarios where the magnetic field is amplified by the turbulent velocity in the intercluster regions on scales $\lesssim 0.8\,r_{500}$. The dense RM grid and precision provided by POSSUM allows us to probe magnetized gas in the SSC clusters and groups on scales within and beyond their $r_{500}$. Flatter-than-expected RM scatter profiles reveal a significant challenge in reconciling observations with even the most realistic predictions from cosmological MHD simulations in the outskirts of interacting clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding large-scale dynamos in unstratified rotating shear flows</a><span class="id">[2505.03660]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We combine simulations with new analyses that overcome previous pitfalls to explicate how nonhelical mean-field dynamos grow and saturate in unstratified, magnetorotationally driven turbulence.

The flexible and non-structured format of GCN Circulars, comprising of more than 40500 Circulars accumulated over three decades, makes it challenging to manually extract observational information, such as redshift or observed wavebands. In this work, we employ large language models (LLMs) to facilitate the automated parsing of transient reports. We develop a neural topic modeling pipeline with open-source tools for the automatic clustering and summarization of astrophysical topics in the Circulars database. Using neural topic modeling and contrastive fine-tuning, we classify Circulars based on their observation wavebands and messengers. Additionally, we separate gravitational wave (GW) event clusters and their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts from the Circulars database. Finally, using the open-source Mistral model, we implement a system to automatically extract gamma-ray burst (GRB) redshift information from the Circulars archive, without the need for any training. Evaluation against the manually curated Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRB table shows that our simple system, with the help of prompt-tuning, output parsing, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), can achieve an accuracy of 97.2 % for redshift-containing Circulars.

These triggers are grouped into superevents, raising a critical question for multimessenger astronomy: which g-event provides the most accurate sky localization for electromagnetic follow-up? Currently, the g-event with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected, under the assumption that it should provide the best estimators of the source's parameters, including its location on the sky. Analysis of simulated signals reveals systematic deviations from this expectation. In particular, a false-alarm rate (FAR)-based selector performs slightly better than the SNR-based method, but introduces pipeline biases. We present a neural network-based selector trained on simulated signals to identify the g-event with the minimum searched area – a metric quantifying localization accuracy. The network uses information (detector SNRs, FAR, and chirp mass) from all of the triggers associated with each astrophysical source and is designed to be pipeline-agnostic. Our results show that the neural network outperforms both traditional selectors, achieving a mean searched area  2% smaller than the SNR-based selector. Unlike FAR-based selection, the neural network preserves the underlying distribution of pipeline contributions, avoiding systematic biases toward specific pipelines. The network can be trained in approximately one minute on a few thousand events and performs event selection instantaneously, making it suitable for low-latency applications. These results demonstrate that machine learning can enhance multimessenger astronomy capabilities while maintaining fairness across detection pipelines. We recommend implementing this approach for future observing runs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Method for Gamma-Ray Energy Spectrum Inversion and Correction</a><span class="id">[2511.15313]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurate spectral analysis of high-energy astrophysical sources often relies on comparing observed data to incident spectral models convolved with the instrument response. However, for Gamma-Ray Bursts and other high-energy transient events observed at high count rates, significant distortions (e.g., pile-up, dead time, and large signal trailing) are introduced, complicating this analysis. We present a method framework to address the model dependence problem, especially to solve the problem of energy spectrum distortion caused by instrument signal pile-up due to high counting rate and high-rate effects, applicable to X-ray, gamma-ray, and particle detectors. Our approach combines physics-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with a model-independent spectral inversion technique. The MC simulations quantify instrumental effects and enable correction of the distorted spectrum. Subsequently, the inversion step reconstructs the incident spectrum using an inverse response matrix approach, conceptually equivalent to deconvolving the detector response. The inversion employs a Convolutional Neural Network, selected for its numerical stability and effective handling of complex detector responses. Validation using simulations across diverse input spectra demonstrates high fidelity. Specifically, for 27 different parameter sets of the brightest gamma-ray bursts, goodness-of-fit tests confirm the reconstructed spectra are in excellent statistical agreement with the input spectra, and residuals are typically within $\pm 2\sigma$. This method enables precise analysis of intense transients and other high-flux events, overcoming limitations imposed by instrumental effects in traditional analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15471" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optical gains measurement with a gain scheduling camera: On-sky demonstration with PAPYRUS and perspectives</a><span class="id">[2511.15471]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reaching the high angular resolution and contrast level desired for exoplanetary science requires us to equip large telescopes with extreme adaptive optics (XAO) systems to compensate for the effect of the atmospheric turbulence at a very fast rate. This calls for the development of ultra-sensitive wavefront sensors (WFSs), such as Fourier filtering wavefront sensors (FFWFSs), to be operated at low flux, as well as an increase in the XAO loop frame rate. These sensors, which constitute the baseline for current and future XAO systems, exhibit such a high sensitivity at the expense of a non-linear behaviour that must be properly calibrated and compensated for to deliver the required performance. We aim to validate on-sky a recently proposed method that associates the FFWFS with a focal plane detector, the gain scheduling camera (GSC), to estimate in real time the first-order terms of the sensor non-linearities, known as modal optical gains. We implemented a GSC on the adaptive-optics (AO) bench PAPYRUS to be associated with the existing pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS). We compared experimental results to expected results obtained with a high-fidelity numerical twin of the AO system. We validated experimentally the method both in laboratory and on-sky. We demonstrated the capability of the GSC to accurately estimate the optical gains of the PWFS at 100 Hz, corresponding to the current limit in speed imposed by PAPYRUS hardware, but it could be applied at higher frequencies to enable frame-by-frame optical gains tracking. The presented results exhibit good agreement on the optical gains estimation with respect to numerical simulations reproducing the experimental conditions tested. Our experimental results validate the strategy of coupling a FFWFS with a focal-plane camera to master the non-linearities of the sensor. This demonstrates its attractiveness for future XAO application.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LCS: A Learnlet-Based Sparse Framework for Blind Source Separation</a><span class="id">[2511.15475]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Blind source separation (BSS) plays a pivotal role in modern astrophysics by enabling the extraction of scientifically meaningful signals from multi-frequency observations. Traditional BSS methods, such as those relying on fixed wavelet dictionaries, enforce sparsity during component separation, but may fall short when faced with the inherent complexity of real astrophysical signals. In this work, we introduce the Learnlet Component Separator (LCS), a novel BSS framework that bridges classical sparsity-based techniques with modern deep learning. LCS utilizes the Learnlet transform: a structured convolutional neural network designed to serve as a learned, wavelet-like multiscale representation. This hybrid design preserves the interpretability and sparsity, promoting properties of wavelets while gaining the adaptability and expressiveness of learned models. The LCS algorithm integrates this learned sparse representation into an iterative source separation process, enabling effective decomposition of multi-channel observations. While conceptually inspired by sparse BSS methods, LCS introduces a learned representation layer that significantly departs from classical fixed-basis assumptions. We evaluate LCS on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating superior separation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods (average gain of about 5 dB on toy model examples). Our results highlight the potential of hybrid approaches that combine signal processing priors with deep learning to address the challenges of next-generation cosmological experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Efficient Exoplanet Imaging Simulations of the Habitable Worlds Observatory</a><span class="id">[2511.15511]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Direct imaging simulations of starshades and other proposed mission concepts are needed to characterize planet detection performance and inform mission design trades. In order to assess the complementary role of a 60 m starshade for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), we develop the optical model of a starshade and simulate solar system imaging at 0 degrees and 60 degrees inclinations. The optical core throughput of a direct-imaging system is a key metric that governs exposure time and the potential exoplanetary yield of a mission. We use our optical model to evaluate core throughput, incorporating 6 m segmented and obscured telescope apertures, over the visible to near-infrared wavelength band (500-1000 nm). Accurate diffractive optical simulations of this form require many large Fourier transforms, with prohibitive run-times, as both the starshade mask and telescope aperture require fine-scale spatial sampling. We introduce a Fourier sampling technique, the Bluestein Fast Fourier Transform (BFFT), to efficiently simulate diffractive optics and enable high-fidelity simulations of core throughput. By characterizing sampling requirements and comparing BFFT's computational complexity to standard Fourier methods (for example, DFT and FFT), we demonstrate its efficiency in our optical pipeline. These methods are implemented in PyStarshade (Taaki 2025), an open-source Python package offering flexible diffraction tools and imaging simulations for starshades. Our results show the HWO starshade used with a segmented off-axis telescope aperture achieves an optimal core throughput measured within a photometric aperture of radius 0.7 lambda/D of 68 percent. With an additionally obscured aperture, a 66 percent core throughput is achieved.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15537" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using Light Curve Derivatives to Estimate the Fill-out Factor of Overcontact Binaries</a><span class="id">[2511.15537]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a simple method for estimating the fill-out factor of overcontact binary systems using the derivatives of light curves. We synthesized 74,431 sample light curves, covering the typical parameter space of overcontact binaries. On the basis of a recent study that proposed a new classification scheme using light curve derivatives up to the fourth order, the sample light curves were classified. Among the classified types, for systems exhibiting high mass ratios and high inclinations (i.e., SPf type), we found that the fill-out factor has a strong correlation with the time interval between two local extrema in the third derivatives of their light curves. An empirical formula to estimate the fill-out factor was derived using regression analysis for the identified correlation. Application to real overcontact binary data demonstrated that the proposed method is practical for obtaining reliable estimates of the fill-out factor and its associated uncertainties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15636" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cherenkov Camera for the PBR mission</a><span class="id">[2511.15636]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) mission is a NASA super-pressure balloon experiment designed to advance the detection of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, high-altitude horizontal air showers, and astrophysical neutrinos. A key instrument of PBR is the Cherenkov Camera (CC), which utilizes a 2048-pixel SiPM camera to detect the optical Cherenkov emission from cosmic-ray-induced air showers and search for upward-going signals indicative of neutrinos. The CC operates in the 320-900 nm spectral range with a 10 ns integration time, leveraging a bi-focal optical design to enhance detection efficiency. The CC enables precise reconstruction of shower trajectories and provides valuable data on cosmic rays' composition and energy distribution. PBR's sub-orbital altitude is particularly advantageous for these measurements, offering a unique vantage point that bridges the observational gap between ground-based and space-based instruments. Additionally, the CC will play a critical role in neutrino searches, detecting tau-lepton decay showers from Earth-skimming neutrinos associated with astrophysical transients. By integrating the CC with fluorescence and radio detection systems, PBR will pioneer a multi-messenger approach to high-energy cosmic phenomena, refining observational techniques for future space-based missions. This contribution will describe the current status of the development of the CC as well as its expected performance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The data processing system of the POEMMA-Balloon with Radio mission</a><span class="id">[2511.15644]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) mission incorporates an advanced data processing system (DP) to enable the detection and characterization of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and astrophysical neutrinos.

Our method, which relies exclusively on comparing successive range intervals measured by independent local clocks, was applied to data from the GRACE-FO mission. We observe a coherent signal in the derivative of the relative velocity projection, (v_A-v_B) dot V, that exhibits a clear orbital-period modulation. Crucially, the phase and amplitude of this modulation are found to be in excellent agreement across four distinct seasonal datasets, providing strong evidence against a purely random origin. Expressing this observable within the Standard-Model Extension (SME) framework yields an effective velocity magnitude of |V|  = 139.3 +/- 0.1 km/s. While the corresponding effective SME coefficients (s-bar^0j from 10^-5 to 10^-4) exceed current laboratory bounds, the signal's stability and its coherence with the orbital frame make it a valuable diagnostic for systematic effects in orbital ranging. This work constitutes the first synchronization-free detection of a stable, orbital-scale signal of this type and establishes a clear, experimental path forward: applying this method to other platforms, most critically GNSS, to determine if the signal is a mission-specific systematic or a universal physical effect.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14934" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computational and Experimental Comparison of CLF5605 and roamx-0201 Martian Helicopter Rotor Airfoils</a><span class="id">[2511.14934]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study compares aerodynamic performance of the CLF5605 rotor airfoil – which flew on Ingenuity from 2021 to 2024 – with that of a new optimized roamx-0201 airfoil designed for Martian conditions at NASA Ames. Specifically, performance is studied at a Reynolds number of 20,000 and a Mach number of 0.60, across a range of angles of attack, using three independent state-of-the-art methodologies: implicit large eddy simulations (ILES) using NASA's OVERFLOW solver, direct numerical simulations (DNS) using the high-order GPU-accelerated PyFR solver, and experimental testing in the Mars Wind Tunnel at Tohoku University.

This generalization addresses a fundamental barrier: physically motivated stellar atmosphere models require non-integer exponents – most critically the square-root law ($\alpha=1/2$) essential for M-dwarf characterization and half-integer powers in Claret's four-parameter law – yet existing frameworks support only integer powers, forcing reliance on numerical integration or polynomial approximations that introduce systematic errors at the $\sim 10^{-3}$ level. We develop three mathematically equivalent formulations: (1) a geometric kernel representation expressing blocked flux as a one-dimensional radial integral; (2) a fractional-calculus framework yielding exact hypergeometric solutions via Riemann-Liouville operators; and (3) a numerically stable hypergeometric-integrand form with guaranteed convergence. All three reproduce established elliptic-integral expressions for integer $\alpha$, confirming our framework as a true generalization. For central transits, we obtain the exact closed form $\mathcal{F} = (1-p^2)^{1+\alpha/2}$. Linear superposition enables exact treatment of multi-parameter laws without special-case logic. Validation using 45-digit precision arithmetic demonstrates inter-method agreement at $|\Delta\mathcal{F}| \lesssim 10^{-13}$ across all geometric regions, including transcendental exponents ($\pi/2$, $\sqrt{2}$, $e-2$).

In high-energy astronomy, the choice of solar system ephemerides and source positions used to barycenter the photon arrival times has a significant impact on the procedure, requiring a full reprocessing of the data each time a new convention is used. Our method, developed as part of the activities of the International Astronomical Consortium for High Energy Calibration (IACHEC), adapts an existing pulsar solution to arbitrary JPL ephemerides and source positions by simulating geocentric TOAs and refitting timing models (implemented with PINT). We validate the procedure and apply it to thousands of observations of the Crab pulsar from 15 missions spanning 1996–2025, demonstrating inter-ephemeris TOA consistency at the $\lesssim5 \microsec$ level, using the DE200/FK5-based Jodrell Bank Monthly Ephemeris as a common reference. We release the TOAExtractor open-source tool and a TOA database to support future calibration and scientific studies.

Previous CALET observing runs (O3 and O4) relied on averaged pre/post-event baselines or low-order polynomial fits, approaches that neglect correlated noise, temporal non-stationarity, and the propagation of background uncertainty into derived flux upper limits. These simplifications can lead to reduced sensitivity to faint or atypical transients. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian framework for background estimation based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression and change-point modeling. Our approach captures correlated structures in the detector background, quantifies predictive uncertainties, and propagates them into both detection statistics and Bayesian credible upper limits. We demonstrate, using archival CALET time-tagged event data and simulated signal injections, that our method improves sensitivity to weak short-duration bursts by up to an order of magnitude compared to traditional polynomial fits. This probabilistic background treatment enables a more physically robust interpretation of non-detections and offers a scalable, real-time compatible extension for future joint multi-messenger searches.

This is a major limitation of precision interferometers as preventing such parasitic light is nearly impossible. Thus, substantial effort is put into mitigating the reentering of these fields in various ways. Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors employ such mitigation techniques to reduce otherwise restrictive stray light noise. However, they are now reaching sensitivities where conventional mitigation techniques reach limitations. Further improvements planed for future observatories are placing even more demanding constraints on tolerable stray light power. We previously presented tunable coherence as a possible technique to ease these constraints and suppress unwanted coherent interference. For these promising demonstrations, the remaining coherence length and achievable suppression in length-constrained layouts was limited, among other things, by the used pseudo-random-noise phase modulation frequency. In this work, we demonstrate stray light suppression and cavity performance at modulation frequencies up to 10 GHz. This reduces the remaining coherence to a few centimeter in an interferometer, and even to the scale of the laser wavelength in a cavity. We further present a first demonstration of tunable coherence in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer, successfully suppressing stray light in a more complex topology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generating optimal Gravitational-Wave template banks with metric-preserving autoencoders</a><span class="id">[2511.10466]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Matched filtering for signal detection in noisy data requires template banks that capture variation in signal waveforms while minimizing computational cost. Dimensionality reduction of signal waveforms can be important for building efficient template banks. In various domains of physics, dimensionality reduction is very commonly performed using linear methods such as singular value decomposition (SVD). This can, however, introduce redundancies if the signals span curved, nonlinear manifolds in parameter space. Alternatively, autoencoders are a type of neural networks that can be used for non-linear dimensionality reduction. We use a variation of the autoencoder which preserves the metric in its latent space ($g_{ij}^{\text{latent}} \approx g_{ij}^{\text{physical}}$); this enables template banks to be constructed by simply placing a uniform grid in the autoencoder's low-dimensional latent space. We apply our method for creating geometric template banks for gravitational wave searches and show that our banks require fewer dimensions compared to using the SVD basis. Our method can also be useful for other applications requiring dimensionality reduction, such as gravitational waveform modeling, fast parameter estimation and model-independent tests of general relativity. Finally, we discuss extensions to other domains including cosmological parameter estimation, and we show tests of our method in extreme cases of periodic signal manifolds.</p></div></details></article></body>
