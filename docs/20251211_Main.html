The addition of the 12-m Kitt Peak Telescope and NOEMA provides two key intermediate-length baselines to SMT and the IRAM 30-m, giving sensitivity to emission structures at scales of $\sim250~\mu$as and $\sim2500~\mu$as (0.02 pc and 0.2 pc). Without these baselines, earlier EHT observations lacked the capability to constrain emission on large scales, where a &quot;missing flux&quot; of order $\sim1$ Jy is expected. To probe these scales, we analyzed closure phases, robust against station-based gain errors, and modeled the jet base emission using a simple Gaussian offset from the compact ring emission at separations $&gt;100~\mu$as. Our analysis reveals a Gaussian feature centered at ($\Delta$RA $\approx320~\mu$as, $\Delta$Dec $\approx60~\mu$as), a projected separation of $\approx5500$ AU, with a flux density of only $\sim60$ mJy, implying that most of the missing flux in previous studies must arise from larger scales. Brighter emission at these scales is ruled out, and the data do not favor more complex models. This component aligns with the inferred direction of the large-scale jet and is consistent with emission from the jet base. While our findings indicate detectable jet base emission at 230 GHz, coverage from only two intermediate baselines limits reconstruction of its morphology. We therefore treat the recovered Gaussian as an upper limit on the jet base flux density. Future EHT observations with expanded intermediate-baseline coverage will be essential to constrain the structure and nature of this component.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viscously Spreading Accretion Disks around Black Holes: Implications for TDEs, LFBOTs and other Transients</a><span class="id">[2512.09017]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a simple time-dependent model of viscously spreading accretion disks around black holes (BHs) with masses between $10-10^8M_\odot$. We apply the results to observations of late-time emission in tidal disruption events (TDEs) and luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOT) such as AT2018cow. Our model generalizes previous work by incorporating outflows during super-Eddington accretion, non-conservation of mass and angular momentum in TDE circularization, irradiation of the outer disk by the inner accretion flow, and a range of viscous stress models. We show that many late-time plateaus in TDEs can be explained by disks formed with a large spread in angular momentum due to redistribution during circularization. Viscous spreading on year timescales is not required, although it is also compatible with the data. The collapse of radiation pressure dominated thin disks to the stable gas-pressure dominated phase greatly underpredicts TDE plateau luminosities, strongly favoring thermally stable magnetically dominated disk models. Irradiation of the outer disk in TDEs due to misalignment of the stellar orbit and black hole spin increases plateau luminosities and durations by factors of a few. Continued study of late-time TDE emission provides a unique opportunity to constrain the physics of disk formation and circularization, disk warps, angular momentum transport, and other poorly understood aspects of disk physics. The models we develop can also explain the late-time optical-UV emission in the LFBOT AT2018cow for BH masses of  $10-100M_\odot$. The faint X-ray emission at late times in AT2018cow is likely due to ongoing absorption. Our models predict that late-time X-rays should eventually be detectable again, and that HST/JWST observations of AT2018cow may detect a break in the SED at near-IR-optical wavelengths, providing a powerful probe of outer accretion disk thermodynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics of Black-Hole Coronae: QPOs, Turbulence, and Jets</a><span class="id">[2512.09026]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The variability of X-rays observed from accreting black hole systems, including quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), suggests a complex nonlinear dynamics in the corona. Here, we propose a new theoretical framework for this problem, based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In this model, coronal variability arises from feedback between a macroscopic oscillation of the plasma and the rate at which it is cooled by the inverse Compton scattering of soft photons from the disc. The &quot;pair thermostat” mechanism then allows the corona to act as a heat engine that extracts work cyclically from the underlying thermal disequilibrium between the low-entropy heating and the high-entropy cooling by the soft photons, in close analogy to the well-known $\kappa$-mechanism for pulsating stars. This coronal self-oscillation may explain QPOs without the need to invoke an external resonant driving. Moreover, we argue that this mechanism can provide the power to generate turbulence and jets in the corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterising the X-ray variability of QSOs to the highest Eddington ratios and black hole masses with eROSITA light curves</a><span class="id">[2512.09047]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>An important diagnostic of the inner structure of accretion flows onto supermassive black holes are the stochastic flux variations at X-ray wavelengths. Despite its significance, a systematic characterisation of the statistical properties of the X-ray variability to the highest Eddington ratios and most massive black holes is still lacking. In this paper we address this issue using SRG/eROSITA 5-epoch light curves to characterise the mean X-ray variability of optically selected SDSS QSOs extending to black holes masses of $10^{10}$ solar and accretion rates close to the Eddington limit. The adopted variability statistic is the ensemble normalised excess variance, which is measured using a novel hierarchical Bayesian model (eBExVar) tailored to the Poisson nature of the X-ray light curves. We find a clear anti-correlation of the ensemble variability with black hole mass, extending previous results to time scales of months. This can be interpreted as evidence for an X-ray corona size and/or physical conditions that scale with black holes mass. We also find an unexpected increase of the ensemble normalised excess variance close to the Eddington limit, which is contrary to the predictions of empirical variability models. This result suggests an additional variability component for fast growing black holes that may be related to systematic variations of the hot corona size with Eddington ratio or shielding of the hot corona by an inner puffed-up disk and/or outflows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal disruption event Calorimetry: Observational constraints on the physics of TDE optical flares</a><span class="id">[2512.09143]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal disruption events are routinely discovered as bright optical/UV flares, the properties of which are now well categorized on the population level. The underlying physical processes that produce the evolution of their X-ray emission and their long-lasting UV/optical plateau are well understood; however, the origin of their early-time optical/UV emission remains the subject of much debate and uncertainty. In this paper we propose and perform “Calorimetric” tests of published theories of these optical flares, contrasting theoretical predictions for the scaling of the radiated energy and peak luminosity of these flares with black hole mass (something which is predicted by each theory), with the observed (positive) black hole mass scaling. No one theory provides a satisfactory description of observations at all black hole mass scales. Theories relating to the reprocessing of an Eddington-limited compact accretion disk, or emission (energy) released in the formation of a Keplerian disk near the circularisation radius, perform best, but require extending. Models whereby the optical/UV flare are directly produced by shocks between debris streams (e.g., TDEmass), or the efficient reprocessing of the fallback rate (e.g., MOSFIT, or any other model in which $L \propto \dot{M}_{\mathrm{fb}}$), are ruled out at high $(&gt;5\sigma)$ significance by the data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delving into the depths of NGC 3783 with XRISM IV. Mapping of the accretion flow with Fe K$α$ emission lines</a><span class="id">[2512.09207]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using XRISM/Resolve $439 \, \rm ks$ time-averaged spectra of the well-known Seyfert-1.5 active galactic nucleus (AGN) in NGC 3783, we investigate the nature of the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line at 6.4 keV, the strongest and most common X-ray line observed in AGN. Even the narrow component of the line is resolved with evident Fe K$\alpha_{1}$ (6.404 keV) and K$\alpha_{2}$ (6.391 keV) contributions in a 2:1 flux ratio, fully consistent with a neutral gas with negligible bulk velocity. The narrow and intermediate-width components have a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 350 $\pm$ 50 km/s and $3510 \pm 470 \, \rm km/s$, respectively, suggesting that they arise in the outer disk/torus and/or BLR. We detect a $10\%$ excess flux around 4 $-$ 7 keV that is not well described by a symmetric Gaussian line, but is consistent with a relativistically broadened emission line. In this paper, we take the simplest approach to model the asymmetric line as a single emission line (assuming either neutral, He-like or H-like iron) convolved with a relativistic disk line model. As expected, the inferred inclination angle is highly sensitive to the assumed ionization state, and ranges between $i=17-44^{ \circ}$. This model also constrains the black hole spin via the extent of the red wing: the required gravitational redshift in the fitted disk-line profile disfavors a non-spinning (Schwarzschild) black hole. The derived inner radius is close to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit $r_{\rm ISCO}$ and strongly correlated with the black hole spin. To better constrain the spin, we fix the inner radius at $r_{\rm ISCO}$ and derive a lower limit on the spin of $a \ge 0.29$ at the 3 $\sigma$ confidence level. A Compton shoulder is detected in our data as well as a $2-3 \, \sigma$ detection of the Cr K$\alpha$ and Ni K$\alpha$ lines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09223" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An extragalactic gamma-ray binary formed in supernova 2022jli</a><span class="id">[2512.09223]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>On May 5 2022, a type Ic supernova (SN) explosion SN 2022jli was discovered. This SN showed additional optical emissions, which were found to exhibit 12.4-day periodic undulations and concordant periodic velocity shifts. These key features likely indicate a compact object in a binary system was formed. A faint $\gamma$-ray source was also detected at the position of the SN and upon checking the $\gamma$-ray photons' arrival times, it was revealed that the same 12.4-day periodicity was likely present. Here we report our detailed analysis results for the $\gamma$-ray source. Not only was the $\gamma$-ray emission detectable for $\sim$1.5 years since the discovery time, but a strong modulation at period 12.5 day was also clearly determined. Considering the newly formed compact object to be a neutron star or a stellar-mass black hole, the putative binary, having an orbital period of 12.5 day, is likely the first extragalactic high-energy system detected. The system may serve as a valuable example for the formation of many such binaries observed in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing a Multi-Temperature Quiescent Prominence's Thermodynamic Evolution from Sun to Earth</a><span class="id">[2512.09234]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar prominences are cool, dense stable structures routinely observed in the corona. Prominences are often ejected from the Sun via coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, they are rarely detected in a cool, low-ionized state within CMEs measured in situ, making their evolution hard to study. We examine the thermodynamic evolution of one of these rare cases where a quiescent prominence eruption clearly preserves its low-ionized charge state as evidenced by in situ detection. We use multi-viewpoint Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) observations to track and estimate the density, temperature and speed of the prominence as it erupts. We observe that part of the prominence remains in absorption well beyond initial liftoff, indicating the bulk of the prominence experiences minimal ionization and suggesting any strong heating is balanced by radiative losses, expansion, or conduction. From its subsequent in situ passage near 1au, charge states reveal that the prominence is composed of both cool, low-ionized ions as well as hotter plasma reflected by the presence of highly ionized iron, Fe$^{16+}$. Simulated non-equilibrium ionization and recombination results using observationally derived initial conditions match the in situ multi-thermal state for a prominence composed of 70% cool plasma with a 1.8MK peak temperature, and 30% hot plasma with a 4.3MK peak temperature. This suggests that the prominence may not be heated uniformly or that parts of it cools more rapidly. The complex, multi-thermal nature of this erupting prominence emphasizes the need for more comprehensive spectral observations of the global corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ONs and OFFs of Pulsar Radio Emission: Characterizing the Nulling Phenomenon</a><span class="id">[2512.09274]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radio emission from pulsars is known to exhibit a diverse range of emission phenomena, among which nulling, where the emission becomes temporarily undetectable, is an intriguing one. Observations suggest nulling is prevalent in many long-period pulsars and must be understood to obtain a more comprehensive picture of pulsar emission and its evolution. One of the limitations in observational characterisation of nulling is the limited signal-to-noise, making individual pulses often not easily distinguishable from noise or any putative faint emission. Although some of the approaches in the published literature attempt to address this, they lose efficacy when individual pulses appear indistinguishable from the noise, and as a result, can lead to less accurate measurements. Here we develop a new method (the $\mathbb{N}$sum algorithm) that uses sums of pulses for better distinguishability from noise and thus measures the nulling fraction more robustly. It can be employed for measuring nulling fractions in weaker pulsars and observations with a limited number of observed pulses. We compare our algorithm with the recently developed Gaussian Mixture Modelling approach, using both simulated and real data, and find that our approach yields consistent results for generic and weaker pulsars. We also explore quasi-periodicity in nulling and measure the related parameters for five pulsars, including PSRs J1453$-$6413, J0950$+$0755 and J0026$-$1955, for which these are also the first such measurements. We compare and contrast our analysis of quasi-periodic nulling with previously published work and explore the use of spin-down energy loss ($\dot E$) to distinguish between different types of modulation behaviour.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09303" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Cluster Detection and Dynamical Analysis in the VIPERS High-Redshift Spectroscopic Survey</a><span class="id">[2512.09303]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a dynamical analysis of galaxy clusters identified in the VIPERS spectroscopic survey within the redshift range 0.5 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.2. Cluster candidates were first detected as overdense regions in redshift space through the Finger-of-God (FoG) effect, and cluster membership was assigned using the GalWeight technique within the FoG-GalWeight methodology developed by our team. For each cluster, we derived the virial radius (R200), velocity dispersion (sigma200), and virial mass (M200) using the virial mass estimator. We identified ten VIPERS clusters spanning a mass range of 0.59 x 10^14 &lt;= M200/(h^-1 Msun) &lt;= 4.32 x 10^14 and velocity dispersions of 360 &lt;= sigma200 &lt;= 900 km s^-1. We cross-matched the VIPERS clusters with published catalogs and found at least one matching system for each cluster, offering external validation for our detections. We investigated the velocity dispersion-mass relation for these systems and obtained log(sigma200) = (2.73 +/- 0.06) + (0.36 +/- 0.18) log(M200), with an intrinsic scatter of sigma_int = 0.04 +/- 0.07. The derived relation is consistent with theoretical predictions from N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, confirming the reliability of the FoG-GalWeight methodology and the robustness of the virial mass estimator. Our findings demonstrate that the velocity dispersion can serve as a reliable and direct proxy for cluster mass, even at high redshift, without requiring additional dynamical mass modeling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of the redback millisecond pulsar PSR J1728-4608 with ASKAP</a><span class="id">[2512.09339]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the discovery of PSR J1728-4608, a new redback spider pulsar identified in images from the Australian SKA Pathfinder telescope. PSR J1728-4608 is a millisecond pulsar with a spin period of 2.86 ms, in a 5.05 hr orbit with a companion star. The pulsar exhibits a radio spectrum of the form $S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$, with a measured spectral index of $\alpha = -1.8(3)$. It is eclipsed for 42% of its orbit at 888 MHz, and multi–frequency image–domain observations show that the egress duration scales with frequency as a power law with index $n = -1.74$, where longer duration eclipses are seen at lower frequencies. An optical counterpart is detected in archival Gaia data within $0.5''$ of the radio position. It has a mean G-band magnitude of 18.8 mag and its light curve displays characteristics consistent with a combination of ellipsoidal modulation and irradiation effects. We also report the nearest Fermi $\gamma$-ray source, located 2$'$ away from our source, as a possible association. A radio timing study constrains the intrinsic and orbital properties of the system, revealing orbital period variations that we attribute to changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion star. At the eclipse boundary, we measure a maximum dispersion measure excess of $2.0 \pm 1.2 \ \mathrm{pc\ cm^{-3}}$, corresponding to an electron column density of $5.9 \pm 3.6 \times10^{18} \ \mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. Modelling of the eclipse mechanism suggests that synchrotron absorption is the dominant cause of the eclipses observed at radio wavelengths. The discovery and characterisation of systems like \psr\ provide valuable insights into pulsar recycling, binary evolution, the nature of companion-driven eclipses, and the interplay between compact objects and their plasma environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Machine Learning Regression Models for Advancing Foreground Mitigation and Global 21cm Signal Parameter Extraction</a><span class="id">[2512.09361]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extracting parameters from the global 21cm signal is crucial for understanding the early Universe. However, detecting the 21cm signal is challenging due to the brighter foreground and associated observational difficulties. In this study, we evaluate the performance of various machine-learning regression models to improve parameter extraction and foreground removal. This evaluation is essential for selecting the most suitable machine learning regression model based on computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. We compare four models: Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The comparison is based on metrics such as the root mean square error (RMSE) and $R^2$ scores. We examine their effectiveness across different dataset sizes and conditions, including scenarios with foreground contamination. Our results indicate that ANN consistently outperforms the other models, achieving the lowest RMSE and the highest $R^2$ scores across multiple cases. While GPR also performs well, it is computationally intensive, requiring significant RAM and longer execution times. SVR struggles with large datasets due to its high computational costs, and RFR demonstrates the weakest accuracy among the models tested. We also found that employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a preprocessing step significantly enhances model performance, especially in the presence of foregrounds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the outer boundary condition for the Babcock-Leighton dynamo models</a><span class="id">[2512.09371]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The evolution of the Sun's large-scale surface magnetic field is well captured by surface flux transport models, which can therefore provide a natural constraint on the outer boundary condition (BC) of Babcock-Leighton (BL) dynamo models. For the first time, we propose a zero radial diffusion BC for BL dynamo models, enabling their surface field evolution to align consistently with surface flux transport simulations. We derive a zero radial diffusion BC from the Magnetohydrodynamic induction equation and evaluate its effects in comparison with two alternatives: (i) a radial outer BC, and (ii) a radial outer BC combined with strong near-surface radial pumping. The comparison is carried out both for the evolution of a single bipolar magnetic region and within a full BL dynamo model. The zero radial diffusion outer BC effectively suppresses radial diffusion across the surface, ensuring consistency between the evolution of the bipolar magnetic region in the BL dynamo and the surface flux transport model. With this outer BC, the full BL dynamo model successfully reproduces the fundamental properties of the solar cycle. In addition, the model naturally produces a surface magnetic field that is not purely radial, in closer agreement with solar observations. The physically motivated zero radial diffusion boundary condition paves the way for deeper insight into the solar and stellar cycles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confirming the Magnetic Field Detection at the Surface of $χ$ Cyg</a><span class="id">[2512.09392]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present spectropolarimetric observations of $\chi$ Cygni obtained with Neo-Narval at Télescope Bernard Lyot in 2025.

The data analysis incorporates simultaneous and quasi-simultaneous observations from Swift-XRT and NuSTAR. Our results reveal a significant detection of X-ray polarization in the 2–6 keV band at a confidence level (CL) of 6.6$\sigma$, with a polarization degree of $\Pi_{\rm X}=17.9\%\pm2.7\%$ and an electric vector position angle (EVPA) of $\psi_{\rm X}=10^\circ.0\pm4^\circ.4$. An even higher polarization degree of $\Pi_{\rm X}=38.9\%\pm9.1\%$ with an EVPA of $\psi_{\rm X}=13^\circ.9\pm6^\circ.7$ is observed within a narrower time interval, at a CL of 4.3$\sigma$. During the IXPE observational campaign, the X-ray spectrum of 1ES 1101–232 exhibits a clear soft-to-hard spectral evolution in the 0.3–10 keV band, although no significant flux variability is detected. Additionally, a clockwise hysteresis loop is identified in the flux–photon index plane. These findings collectively indicate that the X-ray emission from 1ES 1101–232 originates in a region characterized by a well-ordered magnetic field through synchrotron radiation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on Spatial Curvature and Dark Energy Dynamics in the $w$CDM Model from DESI DR1 and DR2</a><span class="id">[2512.09486]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we investigate the $w$CDM dynamical dark energy model with spatial curvature utilizing the recently released DESI Collaboration data (DR1 and DR2) in conjunction with other observational probes such as BBN, Observational Hubble Data (OHD), and Pantheon Plus (PP). Our investigation attempts to discover which DESI dataset gives a better match to the $w$CDM framework and assess the impact of spatial curvature on cosmological constraints. We find that the cosmic curvature parameter, $\Omega_k$, disfavors the cosmological constant for the DR2+BBN and DR2+BBN+OHD data combinations. However, the deviation from the cosmological constant remains below the $1\sigma$ level, indicating a mild preference for a open universe. In contrast, when using the DR1 based combinations namely DR1+BBN and DR1+BBN+OHD-the deviation from the cosmological constant increases to approximately $1.2\sigma$, suggesting a slightly stronger indication of a open geometry. Also, the best-fit values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) obtained from the DR1+BBN+OHD+PP and DR2+BBN+OHD+PP combinations within the dynamical dark energy model are consistent with the results reported by the Planck Collaboration. Our findings provide constraints on the dark energy EoS parameter $ w_{\mathrm{}0}$, reveal a mild but notable deviation from the vacuum energy ($w = -1$) scenario at a significance level $1.8\sigma$ from DR2+BBN+OHD+PP and $0.5\sigma$ from DR1+BBN+OHD+PP, both favoring the quintessence region of dark energy. Furthermore, the key physical distance measures $D_H$, $D_V$, and $D_M$ show better consistency with our model when analyzed with the DR2 data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirac vs. Majorana Dark Matter Imprints on Neutron Star Observables</a><span class="id">[2512.09498]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fundamental character of a fermionic dark matter, whether it is a Dirac or Majorana particle remains a key unresolved issue whose answer would profoundly affect dark-sector phenomenology and detection strategies thereby motivates complementary probes across particle and astrophysical experiments. Compact stars, particularly neutron stars, offer unique astrophysical laboratories for probing such fundamental properties under extreme densities. The presence of a fermionic DM admixed with nuclear matter can modify the equation of state, thereby affecting observable quantities such as the mass-radius (M-R) relation and tidal deformability. In this work, we investigate how the intrinsic particle nature of fermionic DM influences neutron star structure. Within a relativistic mean-field framework extended by a scalar (or Higgs like) portal coupling between DM and nucleons, we construct self-consistent equation of states for both Dirac and Majorana cases and solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to obtain stellar configurations. Owing to the difference in internal degrees of freedom, Dirac DM (four degrees of freedom) generally softens the equation of state more strongly than Majorana DM (two degrees of freedom), leading to smaller radii and lower maximum masses. We identify the parameter space consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints, highlighting the potential of compact-star observations to discriminate between Dirac and Majorana dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SLICE – Combining Strong Lensing and X-ray in AC 114. Insights into the Merger Scenario</a><span class="id">[2512.09512]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>AC114 is a historically significant galaxy cluster, being one of the first strong lensing clusters detected from the ground in the early 1990s, prior to the launch of the HST. Despite this early prominence, no detailed lensing analyses have been carried out for more than fifteen years. We here study this cluster using JWST imaging obtained as part of the SLICE program, complemented by archival HST and X-ray observations. JWST data reveal ten new multiply imaged systems and enable the identification of conjugate substructures in several of the sixteen systems, significantly increasing the number of strong lensing constraints. Using these data, we construct a parametric mass model with Lenstool and extend it by explicitly incorporating the Chandra data in a combined strong lensing+X-ray fit. Our best-fit model reproduces the multiple images with an RMS of 0.4&quot; while simultaneously matching the X-ray data. The dark matter distribution is unimodal and centered on the brightest cluster galaxy, with a large core radius of 83+-5kpc, consistent with values reported in other strong lensing clusters. The strong lensing constraints require the inclusion of an external shear component which position angle points unambiguously towards a nearby ( 1Mpc), well defined mass concentration at the same redshift in the North-West, for which we propose the naming AC114b. The spatial coverage of the XMM-Newton data encompasses the whole structure, allowing us to probe the X-ray properties of the companion cluster and the thermodynamics of AC114, providing evidence for a major merger, in line with previous signatures seen in Chandra, radio and optical spectroscopic data. Our results shed new light on the merging scenario, revealing a major merger caught in a late post-collisional phase, where AC114 is the dominant system and Ac114b has likely been stripped of its hot gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surface image and activity-corrected orbit of the RS CVn binary HR 7275: Disentangling activity tracers</a><span class="id">[2512.09521]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quantifying stellar parameters and magnetic activity for cool stars in double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2) is not straightforward, as both stars contribute to the observed composite spectra and are likely variable. Disentangled component spectra allow a detailed analysis of a component's magnetic activity. We aim at separating the spectra of the two stellar components of the HR 7275 SB2 system. Our further aim is a more accurate orbital solution by cleaning the observed radial velocities (RV) from activity perturbations of the spotted primary (&quot;RV jitter&quot;) and obtain a surface image of this component. The Doppler image of the primary shows two large cool spots of size $\approx$20\% of the visible hemisphere plus three smaller spots, each still $\approx$13\% in size. In total, HR 7275a exhibited an impressive spottedness of $\approx$40\%\ of its entire surface in May-June 2022. The RV is modulated by the rotation of the primary with maximum amplitudes of 320 \ms\ and 650 \ms\ for two different modulation behaviors during the 250 d of our observations. This jitter is primarily caused by the varying asymmetries of the apparent disk brightness due to the cool spots. Its removal resulted in roughly ten times higher precision of the orbital elements. Our snapshot magnetic-field measurements reveal phase-dependent (large-scale) surface fields between +0.6$\pm$2.0 G at phase 0.1 and $-$15.2$\pm$2.7 G at phase 0.6, indicating a complex magnetic morphology related to the location of the photospheric spots. We also obtain a logarithmic lithium abundance of 0.58$\pm$0.1 for HR 7275a, indicating considerable mixing, and 0.16$^{+0.23}_{-0.63}$ for HR 7275b, which is an extremely low value. }</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational constraints on New Tsallis holographic energy in Rastall theory</a><span class="id">[2512.09540]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmological implications of New Tsallis holographic dark energy (NTHDE) in Rastall theory have been studied. Using the data set that includes DESI BAO (DR2), PantheonPlus SNe Ia, H(z) measurements, and BBN and the MCMC analysis, the key cosmological and model-specific parameters are constrained. The result is compared with that of the {\Lambda}CDM model indicating that in addition to providing a viable dynamical dark energy framework, predictions for H(z) are slightly more consistent with intermediate-redshift observations. Generally, the model remains compatible with current data and offers testable deviations from {\Lambda}CDM for upcoming surveys. It is also seen that when the energy density of quantum fields in vacuum, exposed by NTHDE, is combined with the Rastall correction term to the general relativity, a plausible candidate for dynamical dark energy is obtained that mimic the current value of the dark energy density parameter reported in the {\Lambda}CDM model. The latter cannot be repeated by NTHDE alone. The study also confirms previous theoretical and observational constraints on the Rastall parameter obtained by focusing on the thermodynamics, early universe, pulsars, and the early-type galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Response of Planetary Atmospheres to the Impact of Icy Comets III: Impact Driven Atmospheric Escape</a><span class="id">[2512.09556]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In an Earth-analogue atmosphere, water vapour is a key carrier of hydrogen in the lower atmosphere with its transport above the tropopause controlling the atmospheric hydrogen escape rate. On the Earth, this escape is limited by transport though the tropospheric cold trap where water vapour condenses. However, on a tidally-locked exoplanet, the strong day-night temperature gradient drives a global-scale circulation. This circulation could rapidly transport water through the cold trap, potentially increasing hydrogen escape and impacting the composition of potentially habitable worlds. We couple cometary impact and planetary atmospheric models to simulate water-depositing impacts with both a tidally-locked and Earth-analogue atmosphere and quantify how atmospheric circulations transport water from the impact site to high altitudes where it can potentially drive escape. The global nature of the atmospheric circulations on a tidally-locked world enhances hydrogen escape, with both our unimpacted tidally-locked and Earth-analogue atmospheres exhibiting similar mass loss rates despite the tidally-locked atmosphere being bpth cooler and drier near the surface. When considering the effects of a cometary impact, we find an order of magnitude difference in peak escape rates between impacts on the day-side ($\Phi_{\mathrm{escape}}=1.33\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{mol\,mth^{-1}}$) and night-side ($\Phi_{\mathrm{escape}}=1.51\times10^{9}\,\mathrm{mol\,mth^{-1}}$) of a tidally-locked atmosphere, with the latter being of the same order of magnitude as the peak escape rate found for an impact with an Earth-analogue atmosphere ($\Phi_{\mathrm{escape}}=2.7\times10^{9}\,\mathrm{mol\,mth^{-1}}$). Our results show the importance of understanding the underlying atmospheric circulations when investigating processes, such as hydrogen escape, which depend upon the vertical advective mixing and transport.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3-Dimensional WIMP Effective Velocity Distribution</a><span class="id">[2512.09567]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this talk, I discussed a 3-dimensional &quot;effective&quot; velocity distribution of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which, instead of the theoretically predicted velocity distribution of &quot;entire&quot; Galactic Dark Matter particles, describes the actual velocity distribution of WIMPs &quot;scattering off&quot; (specified) target nuclei in an underground detector.

This has been interpreted as a marker of atmospheric loss from the close-in hot Jupiter WASP-12b and the resulting formation of a gas torus around the star. In this paper we quantify the \ion{Mg}{ii} absorption from this torus, compared to that provided by the stellar wind, the stellar astrosphere and the ISM. To do this we piece together the full density profile of \ion{Mg}{ii} from WASP-12 to an observer on Earth using a combination of hydrodynamical simulations and observations. We find that the bulk of the gas along the line of sight is contained within a dense torus close to WASP-12. However, the temperatures in this torus are sufficient to promote Mg into a doubly (\ion{Mg}{iii}) or higher ionized state. As a result, the singly ionized fraction (\ion{Mg}{ii}) is low. We find that most of the \ion{Mg}{ii} is not in the torus but in the ISM. Despite this, the total column density of \ion{Mg}{ii} is two orders of magnitude lower than required to explain observations of the system. To resolve this discrepancy, we note that the torus gas is at a temperature where it will cool efficiently. We speculate that the onset of the cooling instability will cause the torus to fragment, forming cold clumps with a higher fraction of \ion{Mg}{ii}, capable of explaining the observed absorption.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Resolution of a Main Sequence G-Star Astrosphere Using Chandra</a><span class="id">[2512.09613]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report resolution of a halo of X-ray line emission surrounding the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) G8.5V star HD 61005 by Chandra ACIS-S. Located only 36.4 pc distant, HD 61005 is young (approx. 100 Myr), x-ray bright (300 times Solar), observed with nearly edge-on geometry, and surrounded by Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) material denser than in the environ of the Sun. HD 61005 is known to harbor large amounts of circumstellar dust in a dense ecliptic plane full of mm-sized particles plus attached, extended wing like structures full of micron sized particles, which are evidence for a strong LISM-dust disk interaction. These properties aided our ability to resolve the 220 au wide astrosphere of HD61005, the first ever observed for a main sequence G-star. The observed x-ray emission morphology is roughly spherical, as expected for an astrospheric structure dominated by the host star. The Chandra spectrum of HD 61005 is a combination of a hard stellar coronal emission (T=8 MK) at Lx = 6 x10e29 erg per sec, plus an extended halo contribution at Lx = 1x10e29 erg per sec dominated by charge exchange (CXE) lines, such as those of OVIII and NeIX. The Chandra CXE x-ray morphology does not track the planar dust morphology but does extend out roughly to where the base of the dust wings begins. We present a toy model of x-ray emission produced by stellar wind (SW)-LISM CXE interactions, similar to the state of the young Sun when it was approximately 100 Myrs old (Guinan and Engle 2007), and transiting through an approximately 1000 times denser part of the interstellar medium (ISM) such as a Giant Molecular Cloud (Stern 2003, Opher and Loeb 2024).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09635" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of AGN environmental effects on testing general relativity with space-borne gravitational wave detector</a><span class="id">[2512.09635]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as TianQin offers a new window to test General Relativity by observing the early inspiral phase of stellar-mass binary black holes. A key concern arises if these stellar-mass binary black holes reside in gaseous environments such as active galactic nucleus accretion disks, where environmental effects imprint detectable modulations on the gravita- tional waveform. Using Bayesian inference on simulated signals containing both environmental and dipole deviation, we have assessed the extent to which the presence of environmental effects affects the detectability of dipole radiation. Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of strong environmental coupling, the dipole parameter can be recovered with high precision, and the evidence for dipole radiation remains distinguishable. Crucially, we find that the existence of environmental effects does not fundamentally impede the identification of dipole radiation, provided both effects are simultaneously modelled in the inference process. This study establishes that future tests of modified gravity with space-borne observatories can remain robust even for sources in astrophysical environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion bottleneck in protoplanetary discs: the role of the stellar spin</a><span class="id">[2512.09638]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate angular momentum transport and accretion properties in a sample of protoplanetary discs with dynamical measurements of stellar masses, disc masses, and scale radii.

This spread correlates with the stellar rotation period: systems with shorter periods exhibit significantly lower accretion rates, suggesting that they are undergoing at least temporary episodes of accretion bottleneck. We interpret this behaviour within the framework of magnetospheric accretion models, where the transition between steady accretion and the propeller regime is set by the relative locations of the co-rotation and magnetospheric radii. Our results indicate that stellar spin is a key parameter in regulating mass transfer from the disc to the star, and provide new evidence that the observed dispersion in $\alpha$ reflects transitions between distinct accretion states rather than differences in global disc properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09643" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Orbital House of Cards: Frequent Megaconstellation Close Conjunctions</a><span class="id">[2512.09643]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The number of objects in orbit is rapidly increasing, primarily driven by the launch of megaconstellations, an approach to satellite constellation design that involves large numbers of satellites paired with their rapid launch and disposal. While satellites provide many benefits to society, their use comes with challenges, including the growth of space debris, collisions, ground casualty risks, optical and radio-spectrum pollution, and the alteration of Earth's upper atmosphere through rocket emissions and reentry ablation. There is substantial potential for current or planned actions in orbit to cause serious degradation of the orbital environment or lead to catastrophic outcomes, highlighting the urgent need to find better ways to quantify stress on the orbital environment. Here we propose a new metric, the CRASH Clock, that measures such stress in terms of the time it takes for a catastrophic collision to occur if there are no collision avoidance manoeuvres or there is a severe loss in situational awareness. Our calculations show the CRASH Clock is currently 2.8 days, which suggests there is now little time to recover from a wide-spread disruptive event, such as a solar storm. This is in stark contrast to the pre-megaconstellation era: in 2018, the CRASH Clock was 121 days.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09645" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A jet bent by a stellar wind in the black hole X-ray binary Cygnus X-1</a><span class="id">[2512.09645]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Jets provide an important channel for kinetic feedback from accreting black holes into their environment, without which models of the formation of large-scale structure in the universe fail to reproduce the observed properties of galaxies. Hence, an accurate measurement of jet power is critical for understanding black hole growth through accretion and also for quantifying the impact of kinetic feedback. However, the absence of instantaneous jet power measurements has precluded direct comparisons with the accretion luminosity, forcing kinetic feedback models to rely on ad hoc assumptions about how much jet power is released per accreted amount of mass. Here we report the detection of stellar wind-induced bending of the jets in the black hole X-ray binary Cygnus X-1, using 18 years of high-resolution radio imaging. By modeling jet-wind interactions, we determine the current kinetic instantaneous power of the jet to be log$_{10}(L_{\rm jet}/{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}) = 37.3_{-0.2}^{+0.1}$, comparable to the accretion energy determined from its bolometric X-ray luminosity.

Our investigation, preparing for the upcoming ESA Vigil mission, explores whether the progressive incorporation of HI data in real-time enhances forecasting accuracy. The role of human tracking variability is evaluated by comparing predictions based on observations by three different scientists, highlighting the influence of manual biases on forecasting outcomes. Furthermore, the study examines the efficacy of deriving CME propagation directions using HI-specific methods versus coronagraph-based techniques, emphasising the trade-offs in prediction accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of HI data to significantly improve operational space weather forecasting when integrated with other observational platforms, especially when HI data from beyond 35° elongation are used.

The results suggest a preference for dark energy to be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. Several recent analyses of DESI data indicate that the universe's expansion may not be accelerating in the way suggested by supernova based cosmology. Motivated by these studies, we investigated a tachyon type scalar field $\phi$ as a model for dark energy, assuming an exponential potential for the field and performed parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Such a model offers solutions that have $w \sim -1$ and are decelerating without requiring a phantom like equation of state. The present day value of the equation of state parameter is treated as a free parameter; however, for the reference model, we fix its present value to $-1$. The analysis is carried out using the latest Supernovae dataset (Pantheon+) and BAO measurements from DESI. The results show that both types of datasets consistently predict a turnaround in the equation of state, regardless of whether $w_{\phi 0}$ is treated as a free parameter or fixed to $-1$. The corresponding deceleration parameter also exhibits a future turnaround for both datasets when $w_{\phi 0}$ is free. However, in the reference model with $w_{\phi 0} = -1$, the deceleration parameter instead approaches $-1$ asymptotically. A model comparison using the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria shows that the Pantheon+ dataset favors the free $w_{\phi 0}$ scenario, while BAO observations prefer the $w_{\phi 0} = -1$ case. This indicates a disagreement in the future evolution trends predicted by the two datasets within the tachyon type dark energy model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09748" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation.

Thus, Euclid has the potential to test deviations from general relativity that will allow us to shed light on long-lasting problems in the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Euclid will mainly do this by using two complementary probes: weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. In this paper we review pre-launch Euclid analyses for dark energy and modified gravity. These include forecast constraints with future Euclid data on cosmological parameters for different cosmological models, such as a time-varying dark energy component, phenomenological modifications of the perturbation sector and specific modified gravity models, with further extensions that include neutrino physics and the coupling to the electromagnetic sector through the fine-structure constant. We review the study of the impact of nonlinear clustering methods on beyond-$\Lambda$CDM constraints with Euclid. This is of fundamental importance to efficiently predict the large-scale clustering of matter and dark matter halos, given that we will have access to a wealth of information on scales beyond the linear regime. We inspect the extension of theoretical predictions for observable quantities in alternative cosmologies to $\Lambda$CDM at fully nonlinear scales by means of $N$-body simulations. We discuss the impact of relativistic corrections in extended cosmological models. Overall, this review highlights the significant potential of the Euclid mission to tightly constrain parameters of dark energy and modified gravity models, or perhaps to detect possible signatures of a $\Lambda$CDM failure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09750" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin of the stellar Fe Kα line clarified with FUV and X-ray observations of a superflare on the RS Canum Venaticorum-type Star UX Arietis</a><span class="id">[2512.09750]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fluorescence line diagnostics of the Fe K{\alpha} line at $\sim 6.4$ keV observed in both solar and stellar flares can constrain the latitude and size of the flare loop, even in the absence of imaging observations.

We present clear evidence for the photoionization origin based on simultaneous far ultraviolet (FUV) and soft X-ray observations of a superflare on the RS Canum Venaticorum-type Star UX Arietis with Extreme ultraviolet spetrosCope for ExosphEric Dynamic (EXCEED; 900$-$1480 Å) onboard Hisaki and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER; 0.2$-$12 keV).

The FUV emission, a proxy for non-thermal activity, peaked approximately 1.4 hours before the soft X-rays. In contrast, the Fe K{\alpha} line, detected at a statistical significance of $5.3 \sigma$ with an equivalent width of $67^{+28}_{-20}$ eV, peaked simultaneously with the thermal X-ray maximum rather than the non-thermal FUV peak-strongly supporting the photoionization hypothesis.

These interactions define the environments that prevail on the planet, some of which may be more amenable to prebiotic chemistry, some to the evolution of more complex life. This review article covers (i) the physical conditions that determine the ratio of land to sea on a rocky planet, (ii) how this ratio would affect climatic and biologic processes, and (iii) whether future astronomical observations might constrain this ratio on exoplanets. Water can be delivered in multiple ways to a growing rocky planet – and although we may not agree on the contribution of different mechanism(s) to Earth's bulk water, hydrated building blocks and nebular ingassing could at least in principle supply several oceans' worth. The water that planets sequester over eons in their solid deep mantles is limited by the water concentration at water saturation of nominally anhydrous mantle minerals, likely less than 2000 ppm of the planet mass. Water is cycled between mantle and surface through outgassing and ingassing mechanisms that, while tightly linked to tectonics, do not necessarily require plate tectonics in every case. The actual water/land ratio at a given time emerges from the balance between the volume of surface water on the one hand, and on the other hand, the shape of the planet (its ocean basin volume) that is carved out by dynamic topography, the petrologic evolution of continents, impact cratering, and other surface-sculpting processes. By leveraging the contrast in reflectance properties of water and land surfaces, spatially resolved 2D maps of Earth-as-an-exoplanet have been retrieved from models using real Earth observations, demonstrating that water/land ratios of rocky exoplanets may be determined from data delivered by large-aperture, high-contrast imaging telescopes in the future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Oxygen Valve on Hydrogen Escape Since the Great Oxidation Event</a><span class="id">[2512.09844]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) was a $200$ Myr transition circa 2.4 billion years ago that converted the Earth's anoxic atmosphere to one where molecular oxygen (O$_2$) was abundant (volume mixing ratio $&gt;10^{-4}$). This significant rise in O$_2$ is thought to have substantially throttled hydrogen (H) escape and the associated water (H$_2$O) loss. Atmospheric estimations from the GOE onward place O$_2$ concentrations ranging between 0.1\% to 150\% PAL, where PAL is the present atmospheric level of 21% by volume. In this study we use WACCM6, a three-dimensional Earth System Model to simulate Earth's atmosphere and predict the diffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen due to varying O$_2$ post-GOE. We find that O$_2$ indirectly acts as a control valve on the amount of hydrogen atoms reaching the homopause in the simulations: less O$_2$ leads to decreased O$_3$ densities, reducing local tropical tropopause temperatures by up to 18 K, which increases H$_2$O freeze-drying and thus reduces the primary source of hydrogen in the considered scenarios. The maximum differences between all simulations in the total H mixing ratio at the homopause and the associated diffusion-limited escape rates are a factor of 3.2 and 4.7, respectively. The prescribed CH$_4$ mixing ratio (0.8 ppmv) sets a minimum diffusion escape rate of $\approx 2 \times 10^{10}$ mol H yr$^{-1}$, effectively a negligible rate when compared to pre-GOE estimates ($\sim 10^{12}-10^{13}$ mol H y$^{-1}$). Because the changes in our predicted escape rates are comparatively minor, our numerical predictions support geological evidence that the majority of Earth's hydrogen escape occurred prior to the GOE. Our work demonstrates that estimations of how the hydrogen escape rate evolved through Earth's history requires 3D chemistry-climate models which include a global treatment of water vapour microphysics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial non-Gaussianity – Fast simulations and persistent summary statistics</a><span class="id">[2512.09852]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the sensitivity of topological and traditional summary statistics to primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) using two suites of simulations. First, we introduce a new simulation suite for PNG, PNG-pmwd, comprising more than $20{,}000$ halo catalogs that vary individually local and equilateral shapes, together with variations in $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$. Second, we carry out a systematic comparison of topological descriptors, as well as powerspectrum and bispectrum measurements, evaluating their constraining power on both local and equilateral $f_{\rm NL}$ and how this sensitivity varies with halo mass. This dataset enables likelihood-free neural regression of $f_{\rm NL}$ across multiple halo mass bins for a wide range of summary statistics. Third, we assess the transferability of these learned mappings by testing whether models trained on fast pmwd simulations can robustly infer on simulations from the QuijotePNG suite. We find that a combination of simple descriptive statistics of the topological features (PD-statistics) leads to the best performance to constrain equilateral PNG. We observe that the constraining power of these summaries comes from large-mass halos, with small-mass halos adding noise and degrading performance. Similarly, we find that the transferability of the learned mappings, for both topological and powerspectrum plus bispectrum, degrades if small scales or small-mass halos are included.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Limits of Line Broadening: Modeling Stellar Spectra and Formation Temperatures at High Resolution</a><span class="id">[2512.09861]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The modeling of stellar spectra is pervasive in astronomy. Conventionally, the shapes of absorption lines are modeled by convolving thermal profiles (computed given some model stellar atmosphere and line list) with broadening kernels intended to account for the effects of rotation and other nonthermal sources of broadening (i.e., macroturbulence). Here, we show that the assumptions that permit this convolution can break down at high spectral resolution and produce appreciable errors in the modeled flux. We then consider the effects of rotation, microturbulence, and macroturbulence on the intensity and flux contribution functions, which astronomers use to map individual spectral segments to quasi-physical formation “locations” in the stellar atmosphere. We show that proper consideration of 1) the distinction between intensity and flux and 2) the inclusion of rotation and macroturbulence in the contribution function can dramatically change the modeled formation temperatures. To complement this analysis, we provide a package – this http URL – which quickly computes model line contribution functions and formation parameters given bulk stellar properties as input. In closing, we emphasize the assumptions inherent to this analysis, consider in which regimes the convolution expression for flux should be avoided, and caution how the concept of a singular “formation temperature” can oversimplify some realities of radiative transfer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09866" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond Two Parameters: Revisiting Dark Energy with the Latest Cosmic Probes</a><span class="id">[2512.09866]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark energy (DE) models with many free parameters are often considered excessive, as constraining all parameters poses a significant challenge. On the other hand, such models offer greater flexibility to probe the DE sector in more detail. With the rapid advancement of astronomical surveys and the availability of diverse datasets, it is timely to examine whether current combined observations can effectively constrain an extended parameter space in DE models. This article investigates a four-parameter dynamical dark energy (DDE) model that spans a broad region of the universe's expansion history through four key parameters: the present-day value of the DE equation of state ($w_0$), its initial value ($w_m$), the scale factor depicting transition from $w_m$ to $w_0$ occurs ($a_t$), and the steepness of this transition ($\Delta_{\rm de}$). We constrain the model using CMB data from Planck, BAO from DESI DR2, and three distinct compilations of Type Ia Supernovae: PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3. Our results show that constraining all four parameters remains difficult: $a_t$ is not constrained by any dataset, while the remaining three parameters can be constrained only when all observational probes are combined (with the exception of DESY5). The results further show that DE has a quintessential nature at present ($w_0 &gt; -1$), while $w_m$ is negative, indicating a phantom-like behaviour at early times. Interestingly, despite its larger parameter space, the proposed DDE model is preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, based on both $\Delta\chi^2$ and Bayesian evidence, for certain combined datasets, particularly CMB+BAO+DESY5 and CMB+BAO+Union3.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Binary asteroids in mean-motion resonances</a><span class="id">[2512.09868]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the relation between binary asteroids and mean motion resonances (MMRs). For more than 700 asteroids from two catalogues, the Johnston Archive [Johnston, 2024] and the Gaia DR3 VizieR list of binary candidates from Liberato et al. [2024], we applied a resonance identification algorithm, treating all planetary perturbations. Our results showed that the presence of binary asteroids in MMRs largely depends on their dynamical class. The highest percentage, more than 30%, is found in the Trans- Neptunian region, where most of these objects have exhibited resonant librations longer than 10 Myr. For the main-belt asteroid pairs, this percentage is about 10-12%. Contrary to expectations, the more unstable region populated with NEOs, showed a higher percentage of resonant pairs (above 17%), but with temporal resonant captures. These results could indicate that the mean motion resonances, particularly the stronger ones, could play a role in the evolution and formation of binary systems. Finally, we highlight that in the present paper, 82 resonant binary asteroids are newly identified.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quasinormal ringing of Kerr black holes.

While the frequencies themselves depend solely on the mass and spin of the remnant, the mode amplitudes depend on the merger dynamics. We investigate quasinormal mode excitation by a point particle plunging from the innermost stable circular orbit of a Kerr black hole. Our formalism is general, but we focus on computing the quasinormal mode excitation coefficients in the frequency domain for equatorial orbits, and we analyze their dependence on the remnant black hole spin. We find that higher overtones and subdominant multipoles of the radiation become increasingly significant for rapidly rotating black holes. This suggests that the prospects for detecting overtones and higher-order modes are considerably enhanced for highly spinning merger remnants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09079" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curvaton-assisted hilltop inflation</a><span class="id">[2512.09079]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Following the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) results, we consider hilltop inflation where the inflaton is coupled to a curvaton, simultaneously addressing two main challenges faced by conventional hilltop inflation models: the initial-value problem; and their viability for sub-Planckian field values. In standard single-field hilltop inflation, the inflaton must start extremely close to the maximum of the potential, raising concerns about the naturalness of the initial conditions. We demonstrate that the curvaton field not only solves the initial-value problem, but also opens up parameter space through modifying the curvature perturbation power spectrum, reviving the cubic and quartic hilltop inflation models in the sub-Planckian regime. We find viable parameter space consistent with the recent cosmological observations, and predict a sizable tensor-to-scalar ratio that can be tested in the next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial magnetic field from chiral plasma instability with sourcing</a><span class="id">[2512.09177]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In an electron-positron plasma, an imbalance in the number of right- and left-chiral particles can lead to the growth of a helical magnetic field through a phenomenon called the chiral plasma instability (CPI). In the early universe, scattering reactions that violate chirality come into thermal equilibrium when the plasma cools below a temperature of approximately $80 \, \mathrm{TeV}$. Since these reactions tend to relax any pre-existing chiral asymmetry to zero as the system approaches equilibrium, the standard lore is that primordial magnetogenesis via the CPI is not viable below $80 \, \mathrm{TeV}$. In this work, we propose that the presence of a source for chirality can allow the CPI to operate even below $80 \, \mathrm{TeV}$, we explore the implications of this scenario, and we derive predictions for the resultant magnetic field helicity using a combination of analytical methods and direct numerical simulation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the interaction of a Cosmic String with an Accreting Black Hole</a><span class="id">[2512.09380]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rotating black holes when attached to a cosmic string have their rotational energy extracted leading to a change in its spin and mass. The spin of a black hole can be measured using various methods for an accreting black hole in an X-ray binary system. Accretion disks around black holes have an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) whose location is directly dependent on spin and mass of the black hole. The orbit's location changes as the black hole's spin changes and hence can be a method to detect the presence of cosmic strings. This study investigates this change and suggests the ejection of accretion material as black hole spin approaches maximum for prograde motion and material falling into the black hole for retrograde motion, regardless of the presence of cosmic string. However, in the presence of cosmic string, the spin-up process due to accretion is found out to be slower, even with high accretion rates and is detectable. There is a transition phase that occurs as the black hole approaches maximum spin, where even small changes in spin result in significant changes in the ISCO's position. Accreting black holes attached to a large string never reach this transition phase and this absence serves as potential evidence for the existence of a cosmic string.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warm Inflation in a Braneworld Scenario</a><span class="id">[2512.09389]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the literature, many warm inflationary models are formulated.

A common remedy assumes that $M_0$ coincides with the actual mass of the star $M_S$; however, this approximation is only adequate for very slow rotation (when the dimensionless spin parameter is $\chi_S&lt;0.1$).

We refer to these events as Rogue Vertical Drafts (RVDs). They exceed five standard deviations of observed vertical velocities and appear as paired updraft-downdraft structures in varicose mode. Four-dimensional observations reveal that RVDs are intermittent, recurrent, and unpredictable. On average, they are expected to occur every sim 12 days during summer over Northern Norway, assuming a 1000 s interval. Different instruments may capture only portions of these events, for example, only upward or downward drafts when restricted to a single altitude range. Despite their rarity, their magnitudes and frequency suggest potential impacts on dust-sized matter escaping from planets, natural and anthropogenic space material, and MLT climate and processes. We propose that RVDs are a fundamental yet under-recognized feature of the MLT, underscoring the need for global observations to assess their prevalence and significance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09724" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayesian Model Selection with an Application to Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2512.09724]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate cosmological parameter inference and model selection from a Bayesian perspective.

These internal waves, generated by tidal flow over submarine topography, can propagate for thousands of kilometres across ocean basins, and become unstable through wave-mean flow or wave-wave interactions. Satellite observations of internal tides have shown that part of their lunar semidiurnal (M2) altimetry signal loses phase coherence in equatorial regions, thus affecting how we interpret their dynamics and energy distribution (Buijsman et al. 2017). We investigate the interaction of a baroclinic M2 internal tide wavepacket with an equatorial zonal jet, possibly of any horizontal or vertical structure. The dynamics of the low modes are explored as well as the potential excitation of higher vertical modes and how these interactions can generate incoherences in the baroclinic tide signal. We develop an idealized linear model using modal decomposition (Kelly et al. 2016), which is solved using Dedalus, to study the dynamics of a mode 1 M2 internal wavepacket on an equatorial beta plane. A zonal jet, with a uniform or a sheared vertical structure, is added at the equator to investigate potential wave-mean flow interaction. We find that a vertically uniform zonal jet affects the propagation of the mode 1 wavepacket. Depending on the strength of the jet, this can cause total reflection or strong distortion of the wavepacket. In contrast, a wavepacket entering a vertically sheared jet shows energy scattering into higher modes, which have lower phase and group speeds, shorter wavelengths, and are thus more susceptible to dissipation (and critical layers for non-uniform stratification). As the wavepacket exits the jet, reverse energy transfer occurs and the phase speed difference between the modes may explain part of the phase incoherence observed in altimetry data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reconciling ALP Dark Matter and Electroweak Baryogenesis through First-Order Electroweak Phase Transition</a><span class="id">[2512.09760]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that an axionlike particle (ALP) can simultaneously generate the baryon asymmetry and constitute dark matter through dynamics triggered by a first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT).

This sudden kick generates a large ALP velocity near the onset of EWPT enabling the broadening of relic satisfied parameter space and predict a complementary stochastic gravitational-wave signal from the underlying first-order transition.

Using EEH geometry, we compute the structure of circular motion, the effective potential and force, and we evaluate the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies together with the Lense-Thirring and periastron precession rates. Our calculations show that, compared to the Kerr model, the charge parameter $Q$ and the spin parameter $a$ significantly modify the strong gravitational field and shift the characteristic frequencies. We then model the dynamical structure formed by matter accreting toward the EEH black hole through the BHL mechanism, finding that the parameter $Q$ increases the amount of infalling matter and strengthens shock-cone instabilities near the horizon, while farther from the black hole it suppresses accretion and reduces turbulence. Time-series analysis of the accretion rate reveals robust QPOs, whose low-frequency components arise from the precession of the shock cone, while high-frequency components appear as a consequence of strong-field instabilities modified by $Q$ and $a$. A systematic parameter-space exploration identifies the regions where EEH corrections maximize QPO activity, indicating that nonlinear electrodynamics can leave observable imprints on accretion flows and may be testable with QPO and horizon-scale observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16358" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On priors and scale cuts in EFT-based full-shape analyses</a><span class="id">[2410.16358]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Parameter estimation from galaxy survey data from the full-shape method depends on scale cuts and priors on EFT parameters. The effects of priors, including the so-called ”prior volume” phenomenon have been originally studied in Ivanov et al. (2019) and subsequent works. In this note, we repeat and extend these tests and also apply them to other priors used in the literature. We point out that in addition to the ”prior volume” effect there is a more dangerous effect that is largely overlooked: a systematic bias on cosmological parameters due to overoptimistic scale cuts. Unlike the ”prior volume” effect, this is a genuine systematic bias due to two-loop corrections that does not vanish with better priors or with larger data volumes. Our study is based on the high fidelity BOSS-like PT Challenge simulation data which offer many advantages over analyses based on synthetic data generated with fitting pipelines. We show that some analysis choices associated with the PyBird code, especially the scale cuts, significantly bias parameter recovery, overestimating $\sigma_8$ by over $5\%$ (equivalent to $1\sigma$). The bias on measured EFT parameters is even more significant. In contrast, the analysis choices associated with the CLASS-PT code lead to much smaller ($\lesssim 1\%$) shifts in cosmological parameters based on their best-fit values.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Role of Planetary-Scale Waves on the Stratospheric Superrotation in Titan's Atmosphere</a><span class="id">[2503.15728]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze simulation results from the TitanWRF global circulation model to understand the mechanisms that maintain the equatorial superrotation in Titan's stratosphere. We find that the eddies associated with wave activities can transport angular momentum upgradient to zonal flow, leading to acceleration of the equatorial superrotation. The dominant wave modes identified in this study are consistent with previous studies, with zonal wavenumber 1 being the major contributor to the prograde acceleration. Despite the same conclusion of maintenance of equatorial superrotation via wave-mean interactions, we find that the way waves interact with the zonal flow in TitanWRF is slightly different from some other studies. We confirm our previous findings that in TitanWRF this occurs primarily during a dozen or so annual, short-duration (a few Titan sols) angular momentum &quot;transfer events&quot;, which have a repeatable seasonal pattern but differ slightly in timing and magnitude between years. This is not the case in the Titan Atmosphere Model (TAM), which found milder angular momentum transfers that produced the strongest acceleration of superrotation around solstice in the upper stratosphere and more continuous year-around acceleration in the lower stratosphere. Despite differences in angular momentum transfer across models, we further find that, similar to the TAM wave analysis results, eddies generated by Rossby-Kelvin instabilities may be the major source of prograde angular momentum for the equatorial superrotation, although TitanWRF may also include contributions from the absorption of vertically propagating equatorial Kelvin waves. This differs from our previous work, which suggested barotropic waves were responsible for TitanWRF's solsticial transfer event.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Average Power-Density Spectrum of short and long Fermi-GBM Gamma-Ray Bursts</a><span class="id">[2506.09610]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful electromagnetic outbursts in the Universe and emit a vast amount of their energy in the form of gamma rays.

This research investigates the redshift-corrected gamma-ray light curves of 159 long GRBs, observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope between 2008 and 2023. We calculate the average power-density spectrum (PDS) of different groups of GRBs that are distinguished based on fluence, peak rate, duration, redshift, and the different GRB phases. Almost all redshift-corrected spectra reveal a power-law behavior with high-frequency power-law indices distributed around $\sim -1.9 \pm 0.2$. The precursor phase and redshift-corrected short bursts exhibit a shallower power law with index $\sim -1.30 \pm 0.04$, potentially due to the limited statistics that these samples represent.

For all different models tested, including one with unrestricted inclination prior, we retrieve very similar non-antipodal hot regions geometries and radii. For the preferred model, we infer an equatorial radius of $R_{\rm eq}=10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}\,$km for a mass of $M=1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} \, M_{\odot}$ (median values with equal-tailed $68\%$ credible interval), the latter being essentially constrained from radio timing priors obtained by MeerKAT. A more complex model, fitting the data equally well, resulted in a consistent inferred radius. We find that, for all different models, the pulse emission originates from two hot regions, one at the pole and the other at the equator. The resulting radius constraint is consistent with previous X-ray and gravitational wave measurements of neutron stars in the same mass range. Equation of state inferences, including previous NICER and gravitational wave results, slightly soften the equation of state with PSR J0614$-$3329 included and shift the allowed mass-radius region toward lower radii by $\sim 300\,$m, which is compatible with previous analyses to within less than one standard deviation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Localisation and host galaxy identification of new Fast Radio Bursts with MeerKAT</a><span class="id">[2507.05982]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurately localising fast radio bursts (FRBs) is essential for understanding their birth environments and for their use as cosmological probes.

Unlike previous implementations, our approach first splits each simulation particle into separate dark matter and baryonic components, which are then displaced individually using the BFC technique. By applying the hydrostatic and ideal gas equations, we assign pressure and temperature values to individual gas particles. The model is validated against hydrodynamical simulations from the FLAMINGO and TNG suites (which feature varied feedback prescriptions) showing good agreement at the level of density and pressure profiles across a wide range of halo masses. As a further step, we calibrate the BFC model parameters to gas and stellar mass ratio profiles from the hydrodynamical simulations. Based on these calibrations, we baryonify $N$-body simulations and compare the resulting total matter power spectrum suppressions to the ones from the same hydrodynamical simulation. Carrying out this test of the BFC method at each redshift individually, we obtain a 2 percent agreement up to $k=5\,h$/Mpc across all tested feedback scenarios. We also define a reduced, 2+1 parameter BFC model that simultaneously accounts for feedback variations (2 parameters) and redshift evolution (1 parameter). The 2+1 parameter model agrees with the hydrodynamical simulations to better than 2.5 percent over the scales and redshifts relevant for cosmological surveys. Finally, we present a map-level comparison between a baryonified $N$-body simulation and a full hydrodynamical run from the TNG simulation suite. Visual inspection of dark matter, gas, and stellar density fields, along with the integrated pressure map, shows promising agreement. Further work is needed to quantify the accuracy at the level of observables.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13906" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transient QPOs of Fermi-LAT blazars with Linearly Multiplicative Oscillations</a><span class="id">[2507.13906]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a study on the detection and characterization of transient quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the $\gamma$-ray emission of blazars 4C +31.03, MG1 J123931+0443, and PKS 1622$-$253. Using light curves derived from \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope data, we investigate oscillatory patterns characterized by periodic multiplicative amplitudes that vary linearly over time. By segmenting the light curves into increasing and decreasing trends, we analyze each segment independently, allowing for precise measurements of both the periodicity and long-term variations. To interpret these QPOs, we explore various theoretical scenarios that could explain their origin and underlying physical mechanisms. The variability observed in 4C +31.03 is more consistent with a stochastic process, whereas the periods estimated for MG1 J123931+0443 and PKS 1622$-$253 align with the precessional dynamics expected from binary supermassive black hole systems.

However, it is difficult to distinguish different geometries by fitting the observed Comptonization spectra. In this work, we use the Monte Carlo ray-tracing code MONK to simulate the spectra for three simple corona toy models widely proposed in observational studies: sandwich, spherical, and lamppost, varying their optical depth and size (height). By fitting the simulated NuSTAR observations with the simplcut*kerrbb model, we infer the possible parameter space for the hard state and soft state of different coronal geometries. The influence of the disk inclination angle, black hole spin and coronal temperature is discussed. We find that in the lamppost model, if we exclude the case of a very extended corona, the disk emission is always dominant, making the lamppost geometry incompatible with the hard state. While the sandwich and spherical models can produce similar spectra in both the hard and soft states, the simulated IXPE polarimetric spectra show the potential to break this degeneracy. Geometrical effects arising from the limited size of the corona become evident in lower-spin black holes and affect the spectral fitting, where the larger ISCO reduces the corona coverage of the inner disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08052" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taking the Weight Off: Mitigating Parameter Bias from Catastrophic Outliers in 3$\times$2pt Analysis</a><span class="id">[2509.08052]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stage IV cosmological surveys will map the universe with unprecedented precision, reducing statistical uncertainties to levels where unmodelled systematics can significantly bias inference. In particular, photometric redshift (photo-z) errors and intrinsic alignments (IA) must be robustly accounted for to ensure accurate inference of cosmological parameters. The increasing depth of Stage IV surveys exacerbates these challenges by producing low signal-to-noise galaxy populations prone to inaccurate photo-z measurements. Catastrophically misidentified redshifts are especially problematic for 3$\times$2pt inferences that combine weak lensing and galaxy clustering information. We demonstrate that even modest outlier fractions (e.g. 5%) can lead to substantial biases in cosmological parameter estimates: up to 1.8${\sigma}$ in ${\Omega}_M$ and ${\sigma}_8$, and over 8${\sigma}$ in the IA redshift evolution parameter ${\eta}$. To address this, we introduce a flexible weighting scheme at the likelihood level that down-weights the most contamination-sensitive elements of the data vector during inference. This method mitigates biases without inflating the parameter space, reducing cosmological parameter biases to below 1${\sigma}$ without substantially degrading constraining power. Our approach offers a practical solution for future analyses, enabling robust cosmological inference in the presence of catastrophic redshift errors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Precise Constraints on the Energy Budget of WASP-121 b from its JWST NIRISS/SOSS Phase Curve</a><span class="id">[2509.09760]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-hot Jupiters exhibit day-to-night temperature contrasts upwards of 1000 K due to competing effects of strong winds, short radiative timescales, magnetic drag, and H2 dissociation/recombination. Spectroscopic phase curves provide critical insights into these processes by mapping temperature distributions and constraining the planet's energy budget across different pressure levels. Here, we present the first NIRISS/SOSS phase curve of an ultra-hot Jupiter, WASP-121 b. The instrument's bandpass [0.6 - 2.85 micron] captures an estimated 50-83% of the planet's bolometric flux, depending on orbital phase, allowing for unprecedented constraints on the planet's global energy budget; previous measurements with HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec/G395H captured roughly 20% of the planetary flux. Accounting for the unobserved regions of the spectrum, we estimate effective day and nightside temperatures of T_day = 2717 +/- 17 K and T_night = 1562 +/- 19 K corresponding to a Bond albedo of A_B = 0.277 +/- 0.016 and a heat recirculation efficiency of epsilon = 0.246 +/- 0.014. Matching the phase-dependent effective temperature with energy balance models yields a similar Bond albedo of 0.3 and a mixed layer pressure of 1 bar consistent with photospheric pressures, but unexpectedly slow winds of 0.2 km/s, indicative of inefficient heat redistribution. The shorter optical wavelengths of the NIRISS/SOSS Order 2 yield a geometric albedo of A_g = 0.093 +/- 0.029 (3 sigma upper limit of 0.175), reinforcing the unexplained trend of hot Jupiters exhibiting larger Bond albedos than geometric albedos. We also detect near-zero phase curve offsets for wavelengths above 1.5 micron, consistent with inefficient heat transport, while shorter wavelengths potentially sensitive to reflected light show eastward offsets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25915" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Formation of Electron-capture Supernovae: A Review</a><span class="id">[2509.25915]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is generally believed that the electron-capture reactions happen when the oxygen-neon (ONe) cores grow in masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit, leading to the formation of neutron stars (NSs) via electron-capture supernovae (EC-SNe). EC-SNe are predicted to be the most likely short-lived and faint optical transients, and a small ejecta mass is expected during the collapse. This kind of SNe provide an alternative channel for producing isolated NSs and NS systems, especially for the formation of X-ray binaries and double NSs. Although EC-SNe were proposed  45 yr ago, there are still some uncertainties for the origin of EC-SNe. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor channels of EC-SNe, i.e., the single star channel and the binary star channel. In the single star channel, EC-SNe can happen in super asymptotic giant branch stars or He stars, whereas in the binary star channel EC-SNe can occur in He stars in binaries (involving He star+MS systems and NS+He star systems) or accretion-induced collapse in white dwarf binaries (involving the single-degenerate scenario and the double-degenerate scenario). Recent progress on the two progenitor channels is discussed, including the initial parameter range for EC-SNe, the evolutionary paths to EC-SNe, related objects and some observational constraints, etc. We also make some discussions on the possible candidates for EC-SNe in this article, and the impacts of EC-SNe on some research fields, e.g., the properties of NSs, double NS population and chemical products, etc. We also discuss the differences between EC-SNe and ultra-stripped SNe in this article. Research on EC-SNe is at a pivotal stage, with key theoretical uncertainties and observational challenges requiring integrated modeling and multi-wavelength observations for robust identification.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XRISM/Resolve observations of Hercules X-1: vertical structure and kinematics of the disk wind</a><span class="id">[2510.07615]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray binary accretion disk winds can carry away a significant fraction of the matter transferred from the companion and hence strongly affect the accretion flow and the long-term evolution of the binary. However, accurate mass outflow rate measurements are challenging due to uncertainties in our understanding of the 3D wind structure. Most studies employ absorption line spectroscopy that only gives us a single sightline through the wind streamlines. Hercules X-1 is a peculiar X-ray binary which allows us to avoid this issue, as its warped, precessing accretion disk naturally presents a range of sightlines through the vertical structure of its disk wind. Here we present the first results from a large, coordinated campaign on Her X-1 led by the new XRISM observatory (with an exposure of 210 ks) and supported by XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Chandra. We perform a time-resolved analysis and constrain the wind properties. With XRISM/Resolve, we directly detect the Her X-1 orbital motion with an amplitude of 170 km/s in the evolution of the wind velocity. After correcting for this effect, we observe an increase in wind velocity from 250 km/s to 600 km/s as the wind rises to greater heights above the disk. The wind column density decreases with increasing height, as expected, but its ionization parameter log($\xi$/erg cm s$^{-1}$) evolves only weakly from 3.65 to 3.9 as the wind expands away. Additionally, we detect a new orbital dependence of the wind properties, revealing a likely second component that appears only briefly after the eclipse by the secondary star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13479" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaotic Dynamics and Zero-Velocity Structures in the Pluto-Charon CR3BP</a><span class="id">[2510.13479]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pluto and Charon are a dwarf binary system with a high mass ratio $\mu$, preventing Trojan companions. This instability creates ideal intersections for low-energy pathways that spacecraft can traverse and serves as an important test case for stability at Lagrange points for high $\mu$ binaries. This study models the Pluto-Charon system in the planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) and compares the tadpole and horseshoe orbits of a massless particle with known low-$\mu$ orbits. Moreover, it compares the trajectories for instances where the L1 neck is opened and closed, and exhibits the corresponding zero-velocity curves; RK4 integration was used to update the position and velocity of the particle. The simulations consistently showed chaotic and unpredictable trajectories, where small changes in initial parameters could completely alter the results; trajectories displayed the influence of higher values of $\mu$ on the stability of binary systems. These findings confirm that Pluto-Charon cannot host long-lived Trojan companions and instead behaves as a system of chaotic transport. Future work could extend the study to include the spatial or elliptic three-body problem, further refining the understanding of instability in high-$\mu$ binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13533" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Formation Rate and Luminosity Function of Fast X-ray transients from Einstein probe</a><span class="id">[2510.13533]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Following its launch on 2024 January 9, the Einstein Probe (EP) telescope has detected hundreds of fast X-ray transients (FXTs), yet their physical origins remain elusive. Understanding their luminosity function and formation rate is crucial for elucidating their nature. Recently, the EP team has provided the latest catalog of EP-detected FXTs. Based on this catalog, we present a model-independent nonparametric approach to derive the luminosity function and formation rate of FXTs. Our analysis reveals significant cosmological luminosity evolution, characterized by a scaling relationship of $(1+z)^{3.58}$. After accounting for this evolution, we establish that the local luminosity function is best represented by a broken power law, with a break luminosity of $(4.17 \pm 0.34) \times 10^{46}$ erg/s. The formation rate exhibits a broken power law as $\rho(z) \propto (1+z)^{-4.25}$ at $z \lessapprox 0.9$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1+z)^{-0.26}$ at $z \gtrapprox 0.9$, yielding a local rate of approximately $153.8_{-95.1}^{+249.4}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate is higher than that of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). Our findings indicate that a component of FXTs is associated with LGRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13946" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bell Instability and Cosmic-Ray Acceleration in AGN Ultrafast Outflow Shocks</a><span class="id">[2510.13946]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate magnetic-field amplification driven by the nonresonant hybrid (NRH or Bell) instability and its impact on cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at reverse shocks of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional MHD–CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion–convection equations to trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\!\lesssim\!10^{-4}\,\mathrm{G}$), NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a self-regulated state where $E_{\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields ($B_{0}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-3}\,\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for PeV–EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17710" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entity – Hardware-agnostic Particle-in-Cell Code for Plasma Astrophysics.

It achieves hardware-agnostic performance portability across various GPU and CPU architectures using the Kokkos library. Crucially, Entity maintains a high standard for usability, clarity, and customizability, offering a robust and easy-to-use framework for developing new algorithms and grid geometries, which allows extensive control without requiring edits to the core source code. This paper details the core general-coordinate special-relativistic module. Entity is the first PIC code designed to solve the Vlasov-Maxwell system in general coordinates, enabling a coordinate-agnostic framework that provides the foundational structure for straightforward extension to arbitrary coordinate geometries. The core methodology achieves numerical stability by solving particle equations of motion in the global orthonormal Cartesian basis, despite using generalized coordinates like Cartesian, axisymmetric spherical, and quasi-spherical grids. Charge conservation is ensured via a specialized current deposition technique using conformal currents. The code exhibits robust scalability and performance portability on major GPU platforms (AMD MI250X, NVIDIA A100, and Intel Max Series), with the 3D particle pusher and the current deposition operating efficiently at about 2 nanoseconds per particle per timestep. Functionality is validated through a comprehensive suite of standard Cartesian plasma tests and the accurate modeling of relativistic magnetospheres in curvilinear axisymmetric geometries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predictions of gravity mode pulsations of collisional blue straggler stars in globular clusters</a><span class="id">[2511.23189]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Blue straggler stars (BSSs) are exotic objects, which, being the results of processes such as mass transfer, mergers, or collisions, are considered key objects in the study of their host clusters' dynamics.

In particular, we explore the way the use of ekpyrotic potentials may dynamically help isotropization for the considered initial conditions corresponding to the macroscopic classical contracting universe with potentially large anisotropies. As an example of a concrete nonsingular bouncing mechanism, we consider the effective description of loop quantum cosmology for Bianchi-I and Bianchi-IX spacetimes for ekpyrotic and ekpyrotic-like potentials. Considering two different values of potential parameters and initial conditions corresponding to a classical macroscopic universe, we show that for both of these spacetimes, the cosmological singularity is resolved via multiple short-duration nonsingular bounces caused by quantum gravitational effects. We perform a large number of numerical simulations for a wide range of initial conditions which do not favor ekpyrosis initially. Even with such unfavorable initial conditions, we show that the relative strength of the anisotropies at the end of the bounce regime is noticeably reduced in more than 90% of the simulations. This provides a strong evidence for the isotropization ability of the ekpyrotic potentials. We find that isotropization can occur over cycles of rapid nonsingular bounces in the Planck regime via enhancement of the contribution of the (isotropic) energy density relative to the anisotropies at the bounces. Achieving isotropization is found to be easier in Bianchi-I spacetimes when compared to Bianchi-IX spacetimes. Our results demonstrate that, even with initial conditions which are not most favorable for the existence of ekpyrosis, an effective isotropization can occur in nonsingular anisotropic models with ekpyrotic and ekpyrotic-like potentials.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01542" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Wave Mountains: current-carrying domain walls</a><span class="id">[2501.01542]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Domain wall (DW) networks may have formed in the early universe following the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry.

However, lattice simulations performed in this work reveal a clear dependence of the scaling DW area on the initial configuration of the sourcing scalar field, specifically, its infrared (IR) properties. Namely, the DW area grows as one suppresses IR modes in the initial scalar field spectrum. This growth is saturated, when the area parameter $\xi$ commonly used in the literature reaches the value $\xi_{max} \approx 1.2$. The dependence of $\xi$ on IR modes is argued to be of non-physical origin: it is likely to be due to effects of the lattice boundary. Assuming that physically the memory of initial conditions is erased, one recognizes $\xi \approx 1.2$ obtained in the situation with maximally suppressed IR modes as a genuine universal value of the area parameter in the scaling regime. We demonstrate that ignorance about initial conditions may affect predictions for the energy density of gravitational waves by the factor five. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is also affected by the choice of initial conditions, most notably in the low-frequency part. Likewise, we revisit annihilation of DWs under the influence of a potential bias. It has been previously found in Ref. [19] that the annihilation happens significantly earlier compared to the estimate based on the simple balance between the potential bias and surface energy density. We further support this observation and show that the tendency towards an earlier annihilation gets even stronger upon removing IR modes in simulations.</p></div></details></article></body>
