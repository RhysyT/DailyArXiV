Modeling the redshift- and mass-dependent number counts of 1,201 clusters in the 10,347 deg$^2$ Legacy region, and accounting for survey completeness, intrinsic SZ scatter, and a weak-lensing-calibrated mass bias, we compute theoretical abundances using the Log–Edgeworth halo mass function. Assuming $\Lambda$CDM with well-motivated external priors, we obtain $f_{\rm NL} = 55 \pm 125$ (68% CL), consistent with Gaussian initial conditions. These constraints probe comoving scales of $5$–$10~{\rm Mpc}~h^{-1}$, complementing CMB bispectrum and scale-dependent bias measurements, which do not reach such small scales. We also find evidence for a 16.4% residual mass bias, which, although heavily informed by our adopted priors, plays a key role in matching observed and predicted counts but has negligible effect on $f_{\rm NL}$ constraints. We briefly discuss robustness of the results under relaxed priors and the prospects for next-generation SZ and lensing surveys to strengthen cluster-based tests of primordial non-Gaussianity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An emulator for the ionizing photon mean free path in ultra-high resolution simulations: the implications of mean free path measurements for the reionization history</a><span class="id">[2602.03923]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Measurements of the mean free path of ionizing photons from high-redshift quasar spectra at $z \sim 5$-$6$ constrain the reionization history, but interpreting them requires modeling the kiloparsec-scale clumping that large-volume reionization simulations cannot resolve. We present a deep learning emulator for the mean free path (MFP) trained on high-resolution cosmological radiative transfer simulations of ionization fronts sweeping through small 2 comoving Mpc/h volumes. Using a residual multi-layer perceptron neural network, we predict the MFP at a given redshift as a function of the reionization redshift, photoionization rate, wavelength, and box-scale density, achieving a median relative error of 1.6\% across nearly four orders of magnitude in MFP. Integrating its predictions over box-scale overdensity and an extended reionization history allows the emulator to predict the global MFP. We apply the emulator to extended reionization histories constrained by observed photoionization rates, finding that models prefer late reionization with substantial neutral fractions persisting at $z \lesssim 6$. Fitting a parametric ionization history yields a midpoint of reionization of $z_{\rm re} = 6.8\pm 1.2$ for reionization durations consistent with Planck and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich constraints, and the universe being $10\%$ neutral still at $z_{\rm re} &lt; 5.8 ~(6.3)$ at 1 (2)$\sigma$. Global ionizing emissivity inferences using measurements of the photoionization rate and MFP plus our emulator, which avoids common power-law assumptions, suggest a factor of $2-3$ decline between $z = 6$ and $4.8$, in agreement with previous studies. Our method provides an efficient (and more converged) alternative to large-volume radiative-hydrodynamic simulations of reionization for interpreting MFP measurements, and can also serve as a subgrid prescription for the ionizing opacity within such simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pop-cosmos: Forward modeling KiDS-1000 redshift distributions using realistic galaxy populations</a><span class="id">[2602.03935]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The accuracy of the cosmological constraints from Stage IV galaxy surveys will be limited by how well the galaxy redshift distributions can be inferred. We have addressed this challenging problem for the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) cosmic shear sample by developing a forward-modeling framework with two main ingredients: (1) the \texttt{pop-cosmos} generative model for the evolving galaxy population, calibrated on \textit{Spitzer} IRAC $\textit{Ch.\,1}&lt;26$ galaxies from COSMOS2020; and (2) a data model for noise and selection, machine-learned from the SURFS-based KiDS-Legacy-Like Simulations (SKiLLS). Applying KiDS tomographic binning to our synthetic photometric data, we infer redshift distributions in each of five bins directly from the population and data models, bypassing the need for spectroscopic reweighting. Keeping the data model fixed, we compare results using two different galaxy population models: \texttt{pop-cosmos}; and \texttt{shark}, the semi-analytic galaxy formation model used in SKiLLS. In the first ($0.1&lt;z&lt;0.3$) and last ($0.9&lt;z&lt;1.2$) tomographic bins we find systematic differences in the mean redshifts of $\Delta z\sim0.05$-$0.1$, comparable to the reported uncertainties from spectroscopic reweighting methods. This work paves the way for accurate redshift distribution calibration for Stage IV surveys directly through forward modeling, thus providing an independent cross-check on spectroscopic-based calibrations which avoids their selection biases and incompleteness. We will use the \texttt{pop-cosmos} redshift distributions in an upcoming full KiDS cosmology reanalysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling X-ray Bursting Neutron Star Atmospheres</a><span class="id">[2602.03982]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a verification of a computational model, developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) for simulating radiation transfer in X-ray bursting neutron star atmospheres. We tested a baseline case and demonstrated strong agreement in the behavior of the outgoing spectrum's color-correction factor with earlier work and theoretical expectations. By analyzing the relationship between the simulation time and outgoing flux, we also demonstrated how the model calculates through a sequence of time-independent atmospheric snapshots, each iteratively refined, and uses them to progressively converge toward the correct atmospheric state (as would be observed during a burst). We examined the behavior of the outgoing flux across different optical depths and explored the physical explanations for deviations from a pure blackbody spectrum, attributed to frequency-dependent opacity sources. Additionally, we assessed the impact of Compton scattering, highlighting its role in redistributing photon energies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A simple mechanism for the enhancement of the inflationary power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2602.04055]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The background evolution in two-field inflation can feature two distinct stages, corresponding to the evolution along two successive field directions. When the second stage occurs at a significantly lower energy scale, the inflationary trajectory includes a sharp transition, accompanied by a series of rapid turns in field space. Fluctuations crossing the Hubble horizon during this turning phase can experience amplification by several orders of magnitude. This mechanism is very intuitive and can be implemented even in simple two-field models. It produces a peak in the scalar power spectrum that can lead to significant abundances of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McFACTS IV: Electromagnetic Counterparts to AGN Disk Embedded Binary Black Hole Mergers</a><span class="id">[2602.04135]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising environments for producing binary black hole (BBH) mergers, which have been detected via gravitational waves (GW) with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). BBH mergers embedded in AGN disks are unique among GW formation channels in their generic ability to produce electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, via interactions between the merger remnant and the surrounding disk gas (though these are not always observable). While such mergers represent valuable multi-messenger sources, the lack of predictive statistical models in existing literature currently limits our ability to select possible EM counterparts with GW detections in archival data and in real time using time-domain surveys such as ZTF or LSST. Here, we employ the Monte Carlo For AGN Channel Testing and Simulation code (\texttt{McFACTS}\footnote{ this https URL }) to predict the bolometric luminosities of jets and shocks associated with LVK-detectable BBH merger remnants in AGN disks. \texttt{McFACTS} predicts the distribution of GW observables for an underlying BH population and disk model. In this work we present a new capability that simultaneously generates the distribution of bolometric EM luminosities corresponding to these predicted GW detections. We show that (i) migration traps in dense, Sirko-Goodman-like AGN disks efficiently drive hierarchical BH mergers, yielding high-mass, high-spin BH remnants capable of powering observable EM counterparts across merger generations; and ii) mergers embedded in sufficiently dense disks with chirp mass $\mathcal{M}\gtrsim40M_\odot$ are highly likely to yield observable EM counterparts for sufficiently long-lived disks and top-heavy BH initial mass functions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04203" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Nonparametric Distance Reconstruction to Testing the Etherington Relation and Cosmic Curvature Using 2D and 3D BAO Measurements</a><span class="id">[2602.04203]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a joint test of cosmic curvature, $\Omega_{k0}$, and the cosmic distance-duality relation (CDDR) using the Etherington relation, which connects the luminosity and angular diameter distances at the same redshift. In this work, we combine the angular diameter distance measurements from recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) observations with luminosity distances reconstructed from Cosmic Chronometers data of Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using a non-parametric technique, Gaussian Process. A key part of our analysis is the systematic comparison of different BAO measurements (2D BAO, 3D BAO, and 3D DESI BAO) to determine whether any potential tension between angular and anisotropic BAO data affects constraints on the distance duality parameter $\eta(z)$ and $\Omega_{k0}$. We adopt four representative parameterizations of $\eta(z)$ to examine the correlation between $\eta(z)$ and $\Omega_{k0}$. Our results show no evidence for violation of the CDDR, with $\eta(z)$ consistent with unity at the 99\% confidence level for all BAO datasets and parameterizations. In all scenarios, the best-fit values of $\Omega_{k0}$ mildly favor a non-flat universe, although a spatially flat universe remains compatible at the 95\% confidence level. The constraints on $\eta_1$ and $\Omega_{k0}$ indicate slight variations across different BAO datasets, but the discrepancies between the 2D and 3D BAO measurements do not introduce any significant bias, and no statistically meaningful tension is observed. Our work provides robust constraints on cosmic curvature and the validity of the CDDR based on non-parametric distance reconstruction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limb Shift of the Fe I 6569 Å line on the Sun</a><span class="id">[2602.04274]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The convective motions of solar granules generate a center-to-limb variation of Doppler velocity in the photospheric lines, known as the limb shift effect. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of this effect for the Fe I 6569 Å line using both observational data from the CHASE mission and numerical simulations from the Bifrost code. We employ two independent methods to derive the limb shift curve: a spectral-averaging method (Method 1) and a velocity-averaging method (Method 2). By comparing synthetic and observed data, we determine the convective blueshift, which is not accounted for in the CHASE observations. The simulations reproduce the observed trends for both methods at the instrument's spatial resolution of 1.2 arcsec. However, at resolutions below 1 arcsec, Method 2 produces limb-shift curves that depart significantly from both Method 1 results and traditional limb-shift profiles, whereas Method 1 remains in agreement with classical behavior. Further analysis finds that the results from Method 1 comprise two distinct components: a contrast contribution caused by the correlation between velocity and line depth, and a Dopplergram contribution caused by density inhomogeneities and corrugation effects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04285" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parametric Resonance and Backreaction Effects in Magnetogenesis from Ultralight Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2602.04285]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We take a more detailed look at the recently proposed magnetogenesis mechanism triggered by ultralight dark matter coupled to electromagnetism. The proposed mechanism made use of a tachyonic resonance channel which leads to the exponential amplification of infrared modes. Here, we first investigate a possible narrow band parametric resonance channel which can produce photons at higher frequencies. Secondly, we estimate the effects of back-reaction on terminating the resonance. We find that there is indeed a narrow resonance channel. It is characterized by a Floquet exponent which is slightly smaller than the corresponding exponent for the tachyonic resonance. However, there is a region of parameter space (corresponding to a very small coupling constant) for which the tachyonic resonance is ineffective. In this case, the narrow resonance will dominate, and it will still be sufficiently strong to generate the observed magnetic fields on cosmological scales. Our analytical treatment of the back-reaction effects considered here indicates that a fraction of order one of the initial dark matter density can flow into the gauge fields. Hence, our magnetogenesis scenario appears to be robust to back-reaction effects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04309" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2024abfl: A Low-Luminosity Type IIP Supernova in NGC 2146 from a Low-Mass Red Supergiant Progenitor</a><span class="id">[2602.04309]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) exhibit a significant diversity in their explosion properties, yet the physical mechanisms driving this diversity remain unknown. In this work, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024abfl, a SN IIP in NGC 2146 with a directly detected red supergiant (RSG) progenitor. We find it has a low plateau luminosity ($M_V \sim -15$ mag) and a relatively long plateau length ($\sim 126.5$ days). By fitting a semi-analytical model, we estimated a $^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim 0.009 M_\odot$, an initial kinetic energy of $\sim 0.42$ foe, an initial thermal energy of $\sim 0.03$ foe and an ejecta mass of $\sim 8.3 M_\odot$. The spectral evolution of SN 2024abfl is similar to those of other SNe IIP, except for much lower ejecta velocities at similar epochs. At later epochs, we find a relatively high-velocity H$\alpha$ absorption feature at $\sim -4000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly due to a fast-moving plume of matter in the inner ejecta, and two emission features at $\pm 2000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly caused by CSM interaction. We estimate the progenitor mass to be $\le 15 M_\odot$ based on nebular spectra. We conclude that SN 2024abfl is a low-luminosity SN IIP originating from a low-mass RSG progenitor.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04354" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Interpretation of Meteoritic Data and PLotting for Everyone (SIMPLE): Isotope Mixing Lines for Six Sets of Core-Collapse Supernova Models</a><span class="id">[2602.04354]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bulk meteorites and their inclusions exhibit, for many chemical elements, isotopic variability produced by nucleosynthetic events in stars and supernovae before the formation of the Sun. While the exact astrophysical origins of these variations are still a matter of debate, their identification provides insights on the environment of the Sun's birth and the formation of the Solar System. Here we present a new Python tool called SIMPLE (Stellar Interpretation of Meteoritic Data and Plotting for Everyone) designed to compare the isotopic composition of the ejecta from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with meteoritic data. In the present version, the SIMPLE toolkit includes a dataset of 18 CCSN models, from 6 different published sets, with initial masses of 15, 20, and 25 M$_{\odot}$ and solar metallicity. SIMPLE is designed to easily extract the isotopic abundances predicted by each CCSN model for any elements and post-process them into the format needed to compare to the meteoritic data, therefore, facilitating their interpretation. As an example of how to use SIMPLE, we analyze the composition of the Ni isotopes in the 18 models and confirm that bulk meteorite Ni anomalies are compatible with material from the innermost Si-rich region of CCSN ejecta. Designed as a collaborative platform, SIMPLE is open-source and welcomes community contributions to enhance its development and dissemination for stellar nucleosynthesis and meteoritic studies. Future enhancements include addition of more model predictions and inclusion of mixing between different layers of supernova ejecta.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Main Sequence Binary to Blast: MESA Modeling of the Double-Detonation Progenitor PTF1 J2238+7430</a><span class="id">[2602.04421]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars in close binaries with white dwarf (WD) companions are potential progenitors of double-detonation thermonuclear supernovae. The recently discovered system PTF1 J2238+7430 is a candidate for this evolutionary channel, hosting a low-mass sdB and a comparatively massive WD in a compact orbit. We aim to reproduce the evolutionary history of PTF1 J2238+7430, in which the sdB forms first via stable mass transfer, followed by the formation of the WD through a subsequent common-envelope (CE) phase. Additionally, we seek to constrain the range of initial binary parameters that can lead to such double-detonation progenitors. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we performed detailed binary evolution simulations from the zero-age main sequence to the present-day configuration. We explored initial stellar masses, orbital periods, and mass-loss fractions, including the effects of angular momentum transfer, tidal synchronization, and gravitational-wave-driven orbital evolution. The post-CE binary properties were derived using the standard energy formalism. Our models successfully reproduce the observed properties of PTF1 J2238+7430, consisting of a 0.406 solar-mass sdB and a 0.72 solar-mass WD in a 76.34-minute orbit. Stable Roche-lobe overflow of an approximately 2.7 solar-mass donor produces the sdB, while the WD forms from the initially less massive companion during an episode of CE evolution. We find that the CE ejection efficiency must be high to match the observed orbit, exceeding canonical values for similar systems. We further delineate the allowed parameter space for initial binaries that can evolve into sdB+WD systems consistent with double-detonation progenitors. These limits are preliminary; a systematic exploration of all parameters is needed for robust constraints, but our results provide a useful starting point for future work.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Ray Inter-Station Correlation Variations as Precursors of Geomagnetic Storms: A Statistical Study and Multi-Parameter Early Warning Framework</a><span class="id">[2602.04427]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The modulation of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) by interplanetary disturbances, manifested as Forbush decreases (FDs), has long been recognized as a signature of coronal mass ejection (CME) passages through the heliosphere. While individual FD events have been extensively studied, systematic investigations of how GCR inter-station correlation variations relate to geomagnetic storm (GS) intensity have not been established. Here we analyze the relationship between GCR characteristics (from a global NM network) and GSs, aiming to understand the physical mechanisms of heliospheric disturbances and to develop complementary predictive capabilities beyond existing L1 solar wind monitoring. By applying a newly introduced anisotropy characteristic method alongside correlation analysis to 25 years of hourly NM data (1995-2020, seven stations), we demonstrate significant correlations between GCR parameters and geomagnetic activity. Inter-station relative differences and anisotropy enhancements show distinct precursor signatures depending on storm intensity, with extreme events displaying detectable signals 48-96 hours in advance. Based on these intensity-dependent response patterns, we propose a &quot;two-stage multi-level&quot; early warning framework: mid-term identification (48-96 hr) triggered by sustained anisotropy increases, followed by short-term grading (0-48 hr) based on inter-station relative difference variations and high-latitude flux changes. Validated on the extreme November 2003 and severe August 2018 geomagnetic storms, our approach successfully identifies precursor signals, providing a potential means to extend GS prediction windows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04497" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A model-independent measurement of the Hubble constant from gravitational-wave standard sirens and electromagnetic observations</a><span class="id">[2602.04497]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Hubble tension is one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. Developing new approaches to estimate the Hubble constant is therefore crucial, and in this work, we employ a Gaussian process, a fully model-independent method that relies solely on observational data. To determine the Hubble constant, we use not only electromagnetic observations but also include gravitational-wave standard siren data from GWTC3. Our measurements of the Hubble constant are strongly consistent with the SH0ES result, with tensions less than $2\sigma$, indicating no statistically significant discrepancy. This approach quantifies the impact of gravitational-wave data on the determination of the Hubble constant, examines its consistency with electromagnetic measurements, and explores its potential role in addressing the Hubble tension.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weak Lensing Low Multipoles</a><span class="id">[2602.04504]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyse the low-multipole components of the weak-lensing convergence field in a FLRW universe. The low-multipole convergence field, encodes the largest-angle coherent potential gradients, essential for assessment of large-angle features in data. To study this large angle signal, we perform a combined analytical, numerical and observational study. Starting from exact analytical expressions for the convergence power spectrum, we quantify how the dipole, quadrupole and octupole build up with source redshift and show that, in $\Lambda$CDM, they saturate at an amplitude of order $10^{-4}$. We then use full-sky, horizon-scale $N$-body simulations (Quijote) to explore the dependence of this signal on the observer's environment, comparing random observers to “Milky Way-like” observers. In parallel, we reconstruct the convergence field due to our local Universe with the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), with proper treatment of incompleteness and galaxy bias. We find that the observed low multipoles from observation is above the $\Lambda$CDM mean predictions, but in full agreement with Milky Way-like observers in the simulation. Finally, by converting the convergence dipole into a number-count dipole, we test whether weak lensing can contribute to the cosmic dipole anomaly, an idea motivated by its natural alignment with the CMB dipole and by the fact that lensing, unlike clustering, cannot be removed by cross-matching surveys and thus survives in all high-redshift catalogues. We show that weak lensing by local structure contributes at most a few percent to this observed anomaly.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emergence of cyclic flux eruptions in kinetic simulations of magnetized spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole</a><span class="id">[2602.04519]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dynamics of black hole magnetospheres critically depend on the black hole spin and on the structure of the accretion flow. In the limit of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a zero-net angular momentum flow, accretion is spherical. However, in the presence of a large-scale vertical magnetic field, the classical Bondi accretion model is significantly altered. The frozen-in field is stretched radially as the plasma is pulled inward by gravity. This continues until the restoring force from the magnetic tension suddenly expels the material and resets the field, allowing a new cycle to begin. Although this scenario has been well depicted in previous studies, it remains incomplete as the issues of dissipation and particle acceleration are not yet fully resolved. In this work, we aim to revisit these issues with a first-principles kinetic plasma model. We perform two-dimensional global general relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, for both pair and electron-ion plasmas. The simulations are evolved over long timescales to capture multiple flux eruption events and establish a quasi-steady state. For each accretion cycle, we find that the system goes through three main stages: (i) an ideal advection phase where magnetic flux through the horizon increases quasi-linearly with time; (ii) a reconnection-regulated phase where the net increase of the flux is slowed down by intermittent reconnection events near the horizon; and (iii) a flaring phase when a major, large-scale reconnection event expels the flux, leading to efficient particle acceleration. The emergence of large-amplitude quasi-periodic flux eruptions and concomitant particle acceleration is reminiscent of Sgr A* flaring activity. This phenomenon could also be applicable to quiescent black holes, especially isolated black holes accreting the interstellar medium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Standard siren tests of viable $f(R)$ cosmologies</a><span class="id">[2602.04559]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We constrain the Hu-Sawicki and Starobinsky $f(R)$ gravity models utilizing current electromagnetic (PP+CC, Planck and DESI2) datasets and simulate standard siren catalogs based on the resulting best-fit parameters.

However, we note that standard sirens do not offer a viable resolution to the Hubble tension in this analysis, as the inferred constraints are predominantly driven by the fiducial cosmologies adopted in the simulations. Regarding the specific models, we find that for the Hu-Sawicki scenario, several data combinations favor $F_{RR0}&lt;0$, implying potential theoretical instabilities. And, for the Starobinsky model, while EM-only constraints are nearly symmetric between the two parameter branches ($b&lt;0$ and $b&gt;0$), the inclusion of SS constraints introduces mild asymmetries, revealing the sensitivity of SS observables to the curvature dependence of the theory.

We analyze NuSTAR observations to characterize hard X-ray timing and spectral properties, test robustness of candidate cyclotron features, and constrain magnetic field and accretion regime. We perform timing and spectral analysis of two observations, modeling spectra with continua used for accreting pulsars, and use simulations to assess significance of features. No coherent pulsations detected; pulsed fraction constrained below 1.5\%.

The afterglow light curves in both X-ray and optical show distinct steepening around $\sim9$ days, followed by a sharp post-break decay index of $\sim2.99\pm0.10$. We fit the light curves using the afterglow modelling package \texttt{afterglowpy} for both Top-hat and Gaussian jets for different values of the electronic participation fraction $\xi$ from 0.01 to 1.0 and find that, although the radio behavior is well described by the $\xi=1.0$ case, the required circumburst medium (CBM) densities are very low, $&lt;10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$. However, the resulting energy requirements are modest, $\sim10^{52}$ erg, with an electron energy distribution (EED) index $p\sim2.05$. Similar results are also obtained from an analytic model fit to the light curve, except the predicted $p$ is higher, $\sim2.40$. The observed post-break decay index of $2.99$ is at least 5$\sigma$ away from $p$, which is one of the steepest observed so far. We also find that when ignoring the radio observations, the CBM density is raised by a few orders of magnitude to $\sim0.01$ cm$^{-3}$ for $\xi=1.0$, still far from the expected ISM density ($&gt;1$ cm$^{-3}$) of GRB environments, which are highly star forming regions. Similarly low ISM densities have been seen in modeling of other LAT GRBs as well, especially ones with reverse-shock features (e.g., GRBs 130427A, 160509A and 160625B), thereby hinting at either an issue with the standard model or possible evacuated cavities where GRBs explode.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unclustered tracers remain unclustered: the lack of primordial non-Gaussianity response of bias-zero tracers</a><span class="id">[2602.04698]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Constraining primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) is one of the main goals of new-generation large-scale galaxy surveys. It had been proposed that unclustered tracers (with bias $b_1=0$) could be optimal for PNG studies, and that these could be found by selecting galaxies in bins of their local density. Here, we test this hypothesis in state-of-the-art simulations from the PNG-UNITsim suite with local $f_{\rm NL}=100$ and $f_{\rm NL}=-20$. We consider different parent tracer catalogues: all halos together, halos in large mass bins, and HOD models for LRGs and QSO. We then classify these tracers by their local density ($\delta_{t,R}$) and measure the linear bias ($b_1$) and PNG-response ($b_\phi$). Most $\delta_{t,R}$ bins show a PNG-response compatible with $b_\phi=0$ for all halos or the low-mass bin (log$M&lt;11$). For high-mass halos (log$M&gt;$12), QSO or LRG, we recover a trend closer to the universality relation ($b_\phi = 2 \delta_{\rm crit}(b_1-1)$) for $b_1&gt;1$, but the $b_\phi(b_1)$ curve flattens to 0 below $\vert b_1\lvert&lt;1$. Hence, we find $b_\phi\approx0$ for all bias-zero tracers considered. The complex $\delta_{t,R}$-based selection causes their clustering to strongly deviate from simple assumptions, namely the universality relation and Poisson shot noise, hindering their capability to constrain PNG.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04701" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Stages of Protostellar Disk Evolution: A Link to the Initial Cloud Core</a><span class="id">[2602.04701]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the structure and evolution of the very early protostellar disk (“protodisk”) just after protostar formation, where disk self-gravity dominates and the stellar contribution is dynamically minor. The disk redistributes angular momentum outward through outflows and gravitational torques, thereby helping to resolve the angular momentum problem of star formation. We develop a self-similar model and carry out a parameter study that examines disk stability as a function of the key drivers of early evolution, notably the infall rate from the envelope and the strength of the gravitational torques. The mass infall rate onto the disk is estimated to be that from the collapse of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Our results indicate that protostellar disks that form from more unstable initial cores are more likely to be Toomre-unstable. We also find that the specific angular momentum of young protostellar disks lie in the range $10^{19}\text{--}10^{20}\,{\rm cm^2\,s^{-1}}$.

To simplify the modelling, we investigate lines emitted from levels with principal quantum number $n\geq10$, which are expected to be in Saha-Boltzmann equilibrium with the ground state of the singly-charged ion. Optical depth effects are apparent in the lines and their response to atmospheric perturbations suggest that they will be useful in reconstructions of the atmosphere using inversions.

In this paper, we extend beyond this simplified assumption and investigate two realistic physical processes that terminate cosmic-ray particle propagation in the atmosphere: Bethe-Bloch energy loss mechanisms and hard scattering interactions with atmospheric atoms using total cross sections based on the Glauber-Gribov formalism. The former mechanism dominates at low rigidities (for protons below $\sim0.57$ GV), while the latter becomes dominant at higher rigidities. Consequently, we introduce two dimensionless variables up to detailed numerical criteria: the relative rigidity shift due to Bethe-Bloch effects ($\Delta\mathfrak{R}/\mathfrak{R}$), and the expected number of hard scattering events ($\langle N\rangle$). Using the corrected US Standard Atmosphere 1976 model, we demonstrate that the altitude dependence can be factorized as approximately $\exp(-0.14h/\textrm{km})$. Additionally, the effect of the local curvature radius of the trajectory near perigee can be similarly factorized. Our calculations indicate that the simplified sharp-boundary altitude should be at least $50$ km with $\Delta\mathfrak{R}/\mathfrak{R}+\langle N\rangle\lesssim1$ for protons, increasing by more than $15$ km for heavy nuclei such as iron.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03933" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electromagnetic Couplings of Dark Domain Walls</a><span class="id">[2602.03933]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extend Maxwell electrodynamics with a Chern–Simons coupling to a dark sector top form sourced by domain walls.

Such scalars can also interact with the time-varying electromagnetic fields of magnetized stars, modifying photon propagation and inducing observable effects in the redshift and residual time-delay measurements, as well as corrections to the background electromagnetic fields. We investigate these phenomena for the Crab pulsar, SGR 1806-20, and GRB 080805A. Using spectral and timing observations, we derive constraints on the scalar-electron and scalar-photon couplings. While the bounds obtained on the scalar-electron coupling from pulsar spin-down are weaker than existing limits, electromagnetic radiation measurements yield the strongest astrophysical constraints to date on the scalar-photon coupling. Compact stars with stronger surface magnetic fields and observations at lower photon frequencies can improve these bounds by several orders of magnitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eigenmodes in an ultra-relativistic ultra-magnetized pair QED-plasma</a><span class="id">[2602.04065]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-relativistic quantum-electrodynamic (QED) plasmas, characterized by magnetic field strengths approaching and even exceeding the Schwinger field of approximately $B_{Q} \approx 4 \times 10^{13}$ gauss, hold significant interest for laser-plasma experiments and astrophysical observations of neutron stars and magnetars.

These observations offer important insights into the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. Recently, Fornal and Grinstein, in order to overcame the discrepancy between the neutron lifetime measured in beam and bottle experiments, proposed the existence of neutron dark decay. In the present work, an effort is made to connect the interpretation of the above exotic compact objects with the possible existence of dark particles, assumed to be products of neutron dark decay. Our hypothesis offers an advantage over comparable proposals, as the coexistence of dark matter and hadronic matter within neutron stars emerges from an intrinsic mechanism, thereby obviating the need to invoke external merger-related processes. It is still unclear to what extent the proposed dark decay of the neutron is affected by the extreme environment within neutron stars. Within this framework, we examined the case in which a mechanism suppressing the dark neutron decay becomes operative at densities few times above nuclear saturation density. We found that the proposed alternative explanation accommodates the simultaneous existence of neutron dark decay while consistently predicting both the two solar mass limit and the presence of compact objects with subsolar masses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04772" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Near-Resonant Thermal Leptogenesis</a><span class="id">[2602.04772]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study leptogenesis in the quasi-degenerate but non-resonant regime.

We investigate vanilla and flavoured near-resonant leptogenesis and find that successful leptogenesis by right-handed neutrino decays can occur for $M \gtrsim 100~\mathrm{GeV}$ independent of washout regime, extending the viable parameter space of thermal leptogenesis down to the electroweak scale without invoking resonance. We also analyse near-resonant thermal leptogenesis during reheating and show that successful baryon asymmetry generation is compatible with reheating temperatures as low as $T_{RH}\simeq 10\rm GeV$ without relying on non-thermal production. Finally, we present a consistent framework for incorporating flavour effects in near-resonant leptogenesis during reheating. Overall, near-resonant thermal leptogenesis offers a controlled alternative regime to resonant leptogenesis, lowering the leptogenesis scale to the electroweak scale, without reliance on a disputed regulator used in resonant leptogenesis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04858" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial black holes as cosmic accelerators of light dark matter: Novel direct detection constraints</a><span class="id">[2602.04858]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current multiton dark matter (DM) detectors are largely incapable of detecting light dark matter from the Galactic halo due to the energy threshold limitations of their recoil measurements. However, primordial black holes (PBHs) can evaporate via Hawking radiation to particles whose energies are set by the black hole temperature. Consequently, weakly interacting light dark matter (or dark radiation) particles produced in this manner can reach the Earth with sufficient flux and kinetic energy above the experimental thresholds. This opens up a novel avenue to probe the light dark sector in terrestrial experiments. In this work, we explore this possibility by considering fermionic DM produced through PBH evaporation and investigate its electron recoil signatures in direct detection experiments. We analyze both energy independent (constant) and energy dependent (scalar and vector mediated) DM-electron interactions, highlighting the strong dependence of the recoil spectra on the underlying Lorentz structure of the interaction. In addition, we also account for the attenuation effects due to loss of kinetic energy while DM traverses through Earth's crust, which can significantly modify the incoming DM flux. Incorporating these effects carefully, we place constraints on light DM using the electron recoil data from XENONnT, LZ, and PandaX-4T. Finally, we also discuss the detection prospects of such dark matter in current and future generation neutrino detectors, such as Super Kamiokande and Hyper Kamiokande.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polar Mounds on Strangeon Stars: the Neutrino Emission from Ultraluminous X-ray Pulsars</a><span class="id">[2509.13732]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) serve as unique astrophysical laboratories, offering critical insights into accretion physics under extreme conditions, such as strong magnetic fields and super-Eddington accretion rates. Additionally, the nature of pulsars, i.e., the equation of state of supranuclear matter, is still a matter of intense debate, basing on either conventional neutron stars or strange stars. In this work, in order to differentiate the conjectured states of matter, we investigate accretion columns of ULXPs based on the strangeon-star (SS) model, focusing on the thermal mound at the column base. Accounting for Coulomb and strangeness barriers of SSs, we find that the mound can reach $0.7-0.95\,\rm km$ in height with temperatures above $10^9\, \rm K$, enabling substantial neutrino emission via electron-positron annihilation. At low accretion rates ($&lt; 10^{20}\, \rm g\,s^{-1}$), photons dominate the luminosity, while at higher rates ($&gt; 10^{21}\, \rm g\, s^{-1}$), photon trapping makes neutrino emission the main cooling channel, with total luminosity exceeding photon emission, which saturates near $10^{41}\, \rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Even though the predicted neutrino flux from the nearest system, Swift J0243.6$+$6124, lies well below the diffuse MeV background–implying that detectable emission would require substantially closer or more luminous sources–these results demonstrate the key role of the thermal mound and SS properties in accretion, providing a foundation for future ULXP studies and suggesting that neutrino observations could, in principle, offer a novel probe of SSs and extreme supranuclear matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16303" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New determination of the neutrino hadronic production cross sections from GeV to beyond PeV energies</a><span class="id">[2509.16303]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The flux of astrophysical neutrinos is now measured with unprecedented accuracy and over several decades of energy spectrum.

We present a new evaluation of the neutrino production cross section from $p+p$ collisions, building on our previous analysis of the production cross section for $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, and minor baryonic and mesonic channels. Cross sections for scatterings involving nuclei heavier than protons are also derived. The novelty of our approach is the analytical description of the Lorentz invariant cross section $\sigma_{\rm inv}$, and the fit of the model to the available accelerator data.

We investigate how different assumed interior structures affect the inferred bulk metallicity and its correlation with planetary mass. For a sample of 44 giant exoplanets (0.12-5.98 MJ), we computed evolutionary models with CEPAM and retrieved their bulk metallicities under three structural hypotheses: core+envelope (CE), dilute core (DC), and fully mixed (FM). Across all structures, we recover a significant positive correlation between total heavy-element mass (MZ) and planetary mass (M), and a negative correlation between bulk metallicity (Z) and M (also for Z/Zstar vs M). Dilute core structures yield metallicities comparable to CE models, regardless of the assumed extent of the composition gradient. Increasing atmospheric metallicity augments the inferred bulk metallicity, as enhanced opacities slow planetary cooling. Non-adiabatic DC models can further increase the retrieved metallicity by up to 35 percent. We find that the mass-metallicity anti-correlation is primarily driven by low-mass, metal-rich planets (M &lt; 0.2 MJ), and that massive planets (greater than about 1 MJ) can exhibit unexpectedly high metallicities (Z approximately 0.1-0.3). Improved constraints on convective mixing, combined with upcoming accurate measurements of planetary masses, radii, and atmospheric compositions from missions such as PLATO and Ariel, will provide further constraints on interior structure and formation models of gas giant planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonthermal electron acceleration in turbulent post-flare coronal loops</a><span class="id">[2510.18742]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The generation of nonthermal electrons during solar flares plays a critical role in energy transport from the corona to the chromosphere, producing regions of observed intense X-ray emission. Turbulence in post-flare loops, particularly from Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI), has been suggested and investigated as a mechanism for trapping and accelerating electrons in such scenarios. Starting from past results, we aim to characterize the energization process of electrons trapped in a turbulent post-flare looptop, quantifying the contributions of different acceleration mechanisms, and establishing a coherent numerical framework for describing particle energetics. We perform test-particle simulations with the guiding-centre approximation on top of a 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic model of a time-evolving post-flare coronal looptop. We implement an improved formulation of the guiding-centre equations that explicitly conserves energy, enabling a consistent analysis of electron acceleration in the turbulent plasma. We find that, in the plasma turbulence inside the looptop, electrons develop suprathermal energy distributions with tails compatible with hard X-ray emission. The dominant energization channel arises from perpendicular gradient effects in the form of second-order Fermi-like stochastic acceleration, while curvature effects are dominant for particles on long trajectories. Statistical correlations with the measured particle pitch angle confirm that the strongest acceleration occurs for electrons trapped in bouncing motions within turbulent magnetic structures. Our results provide an understanding of how KHI-induced turbulence in coronal looptops produces and sustains populations of trapped nonthermal electrons. We dissect and clarify the relative roles of different magnetic effects and the emergence of stochastic Fermi-like energization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unbiased analysis of primordial non-Gaussianity: the multipoles of the full relativistic power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2511.09466]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A major goal of ongoing and future cosmological surveys of the large-scale structure is to measure local type primordial non-Gaussianity in the galaxy power spectrum through the scale-dependent bias.

In this work, we develop a consistent framework to compute integrated effects, including lensing convergence, time delay, and integrated Sachs–Wolfe, along with the local relativistic projection and wide-separation corrections in the multipoles of the power spectrum. We show that, for a \textit{Euclid}-like H$\alpha$-line galaxy survey and a MegaMapper-like Lyman-break galaxy survey, ignoring these effects leads to a bias on the best fit measurement of the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity, $f_{\rm NL}$, of around $ 3\,\sigma$ and $ 20 \, \sigma$ respectively. When we include these corrections, the uncertainty in our knowledge of the luminosity function leads to further uncertainty in our measurement of $f_{\rm NL}$. In this work, we show that this degeneracy can be partly mitigated by using a bright-faint multi-tracer analysis, where the observed galaxy sample is subdivided into two separate populations based on luminosity, which provides a $15$–$20\%$ improvement on the forecasted constraints of local type $f_{\rm NL}$.

We present astrometric constraints on the presence of binary planets and exomoons in the $\beta$ Pictoris system using archival observations from the GRAVITY interferometer and SPHERE instruments. We calculate these limits by modeling the motion of the two orbiting planets and introducing an additional perturbation to the model that simulates the astrometric motion caused by an exomoon orbiting the planet $\beta$ Pictoris b. We find that for short orbital periods ($\approx50$ days), a lunar companion is only allowed if its mass remains below $\approx 180~M_{\oplus}$ ($0.6~M_{\text{Jup}}$) at $3\sigma$ confidence. At intermediate periods near 300 days, we exclude moons more massive than $\approx 65~M_{\oplus}$ ($0.2~M_{\text{Jup}}$) at $3\sigma$ confidence. At longer orbital periods, we place the tightest constraints, ruling out any potential exomoon above $\approx 50~M_{\oplus}$ ($0.15~M_{\text{Jup}}$) at $700$ days and $\approx 30~M_{\oplus}$ ($0.1~M_{\text{Jup}}$) at $1,100$ days (both at $3\sigma$ confidence). These results place the first astrometric constraints on moons and binary planets in the $\beta$ Pictoris system and demonstrate the sensitivity of interferometric observations for exomoon studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A multi-wavelength study of the 2025 low state of the intermediate polar BG CMi</a><span class="id">[2601.14156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present multi-wavelength observations of the first recorded low state of the intermediate polar BG CMi. Optical monitoring of the source by members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers reveals a decrease of  0.5 mag that lasted  50 d in early 2025. During the low state the optical timing properties imply that BG CMi underwent a change in the accretion mode, as power at the spin frequency $\omega$ dramatically dropped. An XMM-Newton observation revealed a substantial decrease in intrinsic absorption and a slight increase in intrinsic X-ray luminosity, compared to archival Suzaku data. Timing analysis of the X-ray light curves shows that power shifted from the orbital frequency $\Omega$ (prominent in Suzaku data) to $2\Omega$ in the low state XMM-Newton data, along with the strengthening of certain orbital sidebands. We suggest that BG CMi transitioned to disk-overflow accretion, where the white dwarf accreted matter via both a disk and a stream, the latter becoming more dominant during the low state due to a decrease in the mass and size of the disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Chandra Observations of the z = 1.16 Relaxed, Cool-core Galaxy Cluster SPT-CL J2215-3537</a><span class="id">[2601.14425]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy clusters serve as a unique and valuable laboratory for probing cosmological models and understanding astrophysics at the high-mass limit of structure formation. Clusters that are dynamically relaxed are especially useful targets of study because of their morphological and dynamical simplicity. However, at redshifts z &gt; 1, very few such clusters have been identified. We present results from new Chandra observations of the cluster SPT-CL J2215-3537 (hereafter SPT J2215), at z = 1.16, the second most distant relaxed, cool-core cluster identified to date. We place constraints on the cluster's total mass profile and investigate its thermodynamic profiles, scaling relations (gas mass, average temperature, and X-ray luminosity), and metal enrichment, resolving the cool core and providing essential context for the massive starburst seen in its central galaxy. We contextualize the thermodynamic and cosmological properties of the cluster within a sample of well-studied, lower-redshift relaxed systems. In this way, SPT J2215 serves as a powerful high-redshift benchmark for understanding the formation of cool cores and the evolution of massive clusters of galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating Twin Star Equation of States in Light of Recent Astrophysical Observations</a><span class="id">[2601.16674]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Twin stars are predicted to exist in nature if the hadron-to-quark phase transition is strong enough to form a new branch of hybrid stars, separated from the branch of neutron stars. We adopt an agnostic approach, using transition energy density, transition pressure, the discontinuity strength, and a constant speed of sound for quark matter as our parameter space to construct a large possibility of hybrid equations of state, and thereby encapsulating a comprehensive picture of the twin star scenario. First, we report the complete conditions on our parameter space imposed by the general relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium solutions. For a fixed transition energy density and speed of sound for quark matter, we define distinct ranges of transition pressures based on the allowed strengths of discontinuity. Below a maximum transition pressure, a range of discontinuity exists that increases as the transition pressure decreases. Thereby, we identify the loci of the limits on discontinuities as the `witch-hat' curves. Based on the causality limit, the witch-hat curves can be punctured or incomplete. Strong constraints on this picture are drawn from the inferences from GW170817 and the NICER measurements. We computed the maximum mass for twin stars to be $2.05~M_\odot$, the allowed strongest discontinuity in rest-mass density to be $7.76\rho_\mathrm{sat}$, and the upper bound on transition rest-mass density to be $4.03\rho_\mathrm{sat}$. Subsequently, we compute the implications of the stiffness of the quark matter equation of state on this picture. Different confidence levels for observational inferences are considered to assess the extent of inclusion (and rejection) of hybrid equations of state and, consequently, their effects on the limits of the maximum mass of twin stars and phase transition properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observations of Transition from Imbalanced to Balanced Kinetic Alfvénic Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2502.04764]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report observations of solar wind turbulence derived from measurements by the Parker Solar Probe.

If such a transition is followed by inefficient reheating, the evolution history of the universe is modified by a period of early matter domination. This leaves an imprint on the predicted gravitational-wave spectra. Using Fisher analysis we show the parameter space in reach of upcoming gravitational wave observatories where reheating can be probed due to its impact on the stochastic background produced by the transition. We use both the simplified geometric parametrisation and the thermodynamical one explicitly including the decay rate of the field undergoing the transition as a parameter determining the spectrum. We show the expansion history following the transition can be probed provided the transition is very strong which is naturally realised in classically scale invariant models generically predicting supercooling. Moreover, in such a scenario the decay rate of the scalar undergoing the phase transition, a parameter most likely inaccessible to accelerators, can be determined through the spectrum analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reheating and relic gravitational waves as remedies for degeneracies of non-canonical natural inflation</a><span class="id">[2506.12392]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Here, a natural non-canonical inflationary model based on a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We analyze the scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of the model and identify their degeneracies with respect to the free parameters. Notably, $n_{\rm s}$ and $r$ show effective independence from the model parameters due to degeneracies in the slow-roll parameters that leads to unresolved parameter degeneracies. Employing the constraints on reheating parameters such as the reheating duration $N_{\rm{reh}}$, the reheating temperature $T_{\rm{reh}}$, and the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm{reh}}$, is found to be insufficient to fully break these degeneracies. However, the relic gravitational wave spectrum provides a way to break degeneracy with respect to the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$, degeneracy with respect to the potential parameter $f$ persist. Finally, we specify the allowed ranges for the inflationary duration $N$ and the parameter $\alpha$, in light of the latest observational data. These results highlight the role of relic gravitational waves in refining inflationary models and illustrate the challenges in fully resolving parameter degeneracies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18738" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Common Envelope Evolution of Ultralight Boson Clouds</a><span class="id">[2508.18738]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultralight bosons can be excited around spinning black holes via black hole superradiance. These boson clouds may play an important role in the orbital evolution of binary black holes. In this work, we investigate the formation and evolution of common envelopes of ultralight boson clouds in comparable mass-ratio black hole binaries. We describe the cloud evolution using gravitational molecular eigenstates and analyze the possible level transitions during orbital decay, as well as the impact on orbital dynamics. We find that the cloud can generally lead to eccentricity growth. In particular, the eccentricity may vary significantly during level transition, leaving an eccentricity of ${\cal O}(0.1)$ within the detection band of ground-based gravitational wave detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A no-go theorem in bumblebee vector-tensor cosmology</a><span class="id">[2509.11647]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bumblebee models, a class of vector-tensor theories in which a vector field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value that spontaneously breaks spacetime symmetries, are ubiquitous in the literature. By constructing the most general bumblebee action from all diffeomorphism-invariant marginal operators together with a general potential, aiming to cover all the bumblebee models studied in the literature, we perform a complete linear perturbation analysis on a spatially flat FLRW background. We show that for generic marginal couplings, the scalar sector propagates extra degrees of freedom beyond the single scalar expected for a massive vector. Enforcing the correct number of propagating modes in a cosmological setup forces degeneracy relations between the marginal couplings, which in turn completely fix the potential at the background level and render the remaining scalar infinitely strongly coupled already at linear order of perturbations. We establish a no-go theorem stating that the following conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied: (i) the most general marginal action, (ii) a homogeneous and isotropic background, (iii) no extra propagating degrees of freedom around a spatially flat FLRW background, and (iv) healthy cosmological perturbations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational waves from two scalar fields unifying the dark sector with inflation</a><span class="id">[2509.21200]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the gravitational-wave background predicted by a two-scalar-field cosmological model that aims to unify primordial inflation with the dark sector, namely late-time dark energy and dark matter, in a single and self-consistent theoretical framework. The model is constructed from an action inspired by several extensions of general relativity and string-inspired scenarios and features a non-minimal interaction between the two scalar fields, while both remain minimally coupled to gravity. In this context, we derive the gravitational-wave energy spectrum over wavelengths ranging from today's Hubble horizon to those at the end of inflation. We employ the continuous Bogoliubov coefficient formalism, originally introduced to describe particle creation in an expanding Universe, in analogy to the well-established mechanism of gravitational particle production and, in particular, generalized to gravitons. Using this method, which enables an accurate description of graviton creation across all cosmological epochs, we find that inflation provides the dominant gravitational-wave contribution, while subdominant features arise at the inflation-radiation, radiation-matter, and matter-dark energy transitions, i.e., epochs naturally encoded inside our scalar field picture. The resulting energy density spectrum is thus compared with the sensitivity curves of the planned next-generation ground- and space-based gravitational-wave observatories. The comparison identifies frequency bands where the predicted signal could be probed, providing those windows associated with potentially detectable signals, bounded by our analyses. Consequences of our recipe are thus compared with numerical outcomes and the corresponding physical properties discussed in detail.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finite Populations &amp; Finite Time: The Non-Gaussianity of a Gravitational Wave Background</a><span class="id">[2511.09659]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strong evidence for an isotropic, Gaussian gravitational wave background (GWB) has been found by multiple pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The GWB is expected to be sourced by a finite population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) emitting in the PTA sensitivity band, and astrophysical inference of PTA data sets suggests a GWB signal that is at the higher end of GWB spectral amplitude estimates. However, current inference analyses make simplifying assumptions, such as modeling the GWB as Gaussian, assuming that all SMBHBs only emit at frequencies that are integer multiples of the total observing time, and ignoring the interference between the signals of different SMBHBs. In this paper, we build analytical and numerical models of an astrophysical GWB without the above approximations, and compare the statistical properties of its induced PTA signal to those of a signal produced by a Gaussian GWB. We show that finite population and windowing effects introduce non-Gaussianities in the PTA signal, which are currently unmodeled in PTA analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GWTC-4.0: Searches for Gravitational-Wave Lensing Signatures</a><span class="id">[2512.16347]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves can be gravitationally lensed by massive objects along their path. Depending on the lens mass and the lens–source geometry, this can lead to the observation of a single distorted signal or multiple repeated events with the same frequency evolution. We present the results for gravitational-wave lensing searches on the data from the first part of the fourth LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA observing run (O4a). We search for strongly lensed events in the newly acquired data by (1) searching for an overall phase shift present in an image formed at a saddle point of the lens potential, (2) looking for pairs of detected candidates with consistent frequency evolution, and (3) identifying sub-threshold counterpart candidates to the detected signals. Beyond strong lensing, we also look for lensing-induced distortions in all detected signals using an isolated point-mass model. We do not find evidence for strongly lensed gravitational-wave signals and use this result to constrain the rate of detectable strongly lensed events and the merger rate density of binary black holes at high redshift. In the search for single distorted lensed signals, we find one outlier: GW231123_135430, for which we report more detailed investigations. While this event is interesting, the associated waveform uncertainties make its interpretation complicated, and future observations of the populations of binary black holes and of gravitational lenses will help determine the probability that this event could be lensed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18637" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Framework for Lorentz-Dirac Dynamics and Post-Newtonian Interaction of Radiating Point Charges</a><span class="id">[2512.18637]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine classical radiation reaction by combining the covariant Lorentz–Dirac formulation, its Landau–Lifshitz (LL) order reduction, and a post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian treatment of interacting and radiating charges.

Global climate indices, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for machine learning. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel North East monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.</p></div></details></article></body>
