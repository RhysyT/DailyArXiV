Although many LRDs are suspected as active galactic nuclei (AGN), they show little variability on days-years timescales. We report the discovery of two gravitationally lensed LRDs at redshift $\sim$4.3 behind the cluster RXCJ2211-0350, one of which (RX1) is quadruply imaged with time delays spanning $\sim$130 years. RX1 exhibits intrinsic color and brightness variations of up to 0.7 magnitude among its images. These changes are consistent with blackbody-temperature variations of a photosphere, indicating long-term variability analogous to Cepheid-like pulsations but in a far more extended ($R \sim 2000$ AU) and massive ($M \gtrsim 10^6 \, M_{\odot}$) systems. These results suggest LRDs as a distinct class of AGN with stellar-like envelopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predictions of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Exoplanet Survey. V. Detection Rates of Multiplanetary Systems in High Magnification Microlensing Events</a><span class="id">[2512.05182]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will expand the reach of gravitational microlensing surveys by increasing the number of events monitored and the precision of their light curves. We investigate Roman's ability to detect triple-lens microlensing systems, cases where a foreground star with two bound exoplanets produces detectable anomalies in a microlensing event, using its planned high-cadence observations toward the Galactic bulge. We simulate a large set of high-magnification microlensing light curves based on Roman's expected survey characteristics. A detection criterion, based on a required $\chi^2$ improvement for a two-planet model, is applied to determine whether the second planet can be reliably distinguished from a single-planet (binary-lens) model. Our simulations show that the majority of two-planet microlensing events would be detectable with Roman. Events in which both planets are relatively massive (planet-star mass ratios of order $10^{-3}$), or in which the more massive planet occupies a favorable resonant configuration, produce strong central perturbations, resulting in detection efficiencies of roughly 90\%. By contrast, systems with only low-mass planets ($q \sim 10^{-4}$) or with less favorable alignments generate much weaker signals, which often fall below the detection threshold. In general, the planetary mass ratios and the resulting caustic geometry (e.g., central caustic size in resonant versus wide/close orbits) are the dominant factors governing detectability. Taking into account the expected frequency of planetary systems and the fraction of high-magnification events, we estimate that Roman will detect a high-magnification triple-lens event in approximately 4.5\% of multi-planet microlensing events, corresponding to about 64 events over the course of the full survey.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The dependence of the intracluster light fraction on galaxy cluster properties</a><span class="id">[2512.05187]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use machine learning to measure the intracluster light (ICL) fractions of 177 galaxy groups and clusters identified from Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program imaging to explore how the ICL varies with the properties of its host cluster. We study the variation in ICL fraction with host cluster redshift, halo mass, and magnitude gap to investigate how the ICL develops over time, in various cluster environments, and with cluster relaxation. We find that there is a decreasing correlation with redshift (Spearman correlation $r_S=-0.604$, p-value $=9\times10^{-10}$), however this can be plausibly accounted for by including the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and the passive aging of stellar populations. There is a weak negative correlation with halo mass ($r_S=-0.330$, p-value $=8\times 10^{-5}$) where ICL fractions are higher in lower halo mass groups than higher halo mass clusters. We also find that there is a marginal positive correlation with magnitude gap ($r_S=0.226$, p-value = 0.01), indicating that relaxed clusters are more likely to host higher ICL fractions. These results are consistent with a scenario where the dominant formation mechanism of the ICL is galaxy-galaxy interactions such as tidal stripping, and demonstrates the capability of the method to easily construct large samples and study large-scale trends in the ICL fraction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lagrangian versus Eulerian Methods for Toroidally-Magnetized Isothermal Disks</a><span class="id">[2512.05194]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A number of simulations have seen the emergence of strongly-toroidally-magnetized accretion disks from interstellar medium inflows. Recently, Guo et al. 2025 (G25) studied an idealized test problem of toroidally-magnetized disks in isothermal ideal MHD with an Eulerian static-mesh method, and argued the midplane behavior changes qualitatively (with a significant loss of toroidal magnetic flux) when the the thermal scale-length is resolved ($\Delta x &lt; H_{\rm thermal}$). We rerun the G25 test problem with two Lagrangian methods: meshless finite-mass, and meshless finite-volume. We show that Lagrangian methods reproduce the high-resolution ($\Delta x \ll H_{\rm thermal}$) Eulerian G25 results. At low resolution ($\Delta x \gg H_{\rm thermal}$), behaviors differ: Lagrangian methods still lose flux and evolve 'as close as possible' to the converged solution, while Eulerian methods show no evolution. We argue this difference in convergence behavior is related to the ability of Lagrangian codes to follow flows to an arbitrarily thin midplane layer, analogous to the well-studied difference in Jeans fragmentation problems. This and results from other higher-resolution simulations and different codes suggest that the sustained midplane toroidal fields seen in recent Lagrangian multi-scale, multi-physics simulations cannot be a numerical resolution effect, and some physical difference between those simulations and the G25 test problem explains their different behaviors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GA-NIFS: A smouldering disk galaxy undergoing ordered rotation at z=4.26</a><span class="id">[2512.05213]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rotating galaxies with relaxed gaseous disks have been discovered across cosmic time, from the local Universe to high redshift (z&gt;4). But few such sources have been confirmed at z&gt;4, making them a precious sample to examine what conditions result in such ordered kinematics in an early, more chaotic Universe. One of the best examples of this sample is the galaxy DLA0817g1 (z=4.2603), which shows remarkably clear rotation in ALMA [CII] data. We present recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (R 2700) of DLA0817g1, which we combine with archival ALMA [CII] observations to place constraints on its ISM conditions and morpho-kinematics. From a combination of line ratios, we find a high gas-phase metallicity ( 0.7 solar), high fraction of obscured star formation, low ionisation (compared to other high-redshift galaxies observed with JWST), and no significant evidence for AGN (based on the WHAN diagnostic). Dynamical modelling with 3DBarolo reveal nearly identical rotation in Halpha and [CII], but with a higher velocity dispersion in the former. Using our metallicity estimate and previous CO and [CII] detections, we derive a new estimate of the molecular gas mass, relieving a previous strain in the mass budget. Altogether, we suggest that this is a 'smouldering' galaxy, where past star formation resulted in significant chemical enrichment (i.e., Zgas and Mdust), but the current activity is low (i.e., lower ionisation parameter and electron temperature). These new observations have opened a window into questions regarding the interplay of gas, metallicity, star formation, and kinematics in a prototypical early disk galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruminations Upon the Modeling of X-ray Foregrounds, Backgrounds and Faint Sources</a><span class="id">[2512.05405]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the goal of extracting as much information as possible from Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of faint, diffuse sources such as galaxy clusters, as well as those of future X-ray telescopes, we present a strategy for forward modeling all the foreground and background signals present in these data. This work leverages widespread efforts to understand the soft X-ray emission from the Galaxy, as well as the cosmic X-ray background and instrument-specific, particle-induced backgrounds. Statistically, a forward model of the foregrounds and backgrounds is preferable to alternatives because it requires no binning of the data, and allows straightforward marginalization over systematic uncertainties. We apply these methods to several galaxy clusters at intermediate-to-high redshifts, spanning a range of masses and morphologies, using Chandra and/or XMM-Newton data. Our results suggest a modest improvement even for relatively bright clusters at these redshifts, and more substantial advantages in the high-redshift, low-surface-brightness regime. We also discuss and provide a simple correction for a time-dependent miscalibration of the Chandra ACIS detectors identified in archival galaxy cluster data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating Unusually Extended Main Sequence Turnoff of the Galactic Open Cluster NGC 3532</a><span class="id">[2512.05458]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extended main-sequence turnoffs are observed in the color-magnitude diagrams of some young and intermediate-age star clusters. Here we report the case study of NGC 3532. Among the cluster member candidates identified using the ML-MOC algorithm on Gaia DR3 sources, we found that fast rotators are significantly redder. Stars near the main-sequence turnoff exhibit a multi-modal distribution in the Gaia broadening velocity ($v_{\rm broad}$). A comparison with relevant literature suggests binaries being typically interspersed with fast rotators, often manifesting as slow to moderate rotators. Additionally, chemically peculiar stars are predominantly located in the bluer regions of the turnoff, with those in the fast-rotator region having large values of Gaia re-normalised unit weight error, indicating plausible companions. Our analysis suggests multiple channels responsible for angular momentum loss to account for the extended turnoff.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Crater II disrupting?</a><span class="id">[2512.05535]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Crater II (CraII) is a very intriguing, low-surface brightness and extended galaxy in the vicinity of our Milky Way. Motivated by its huge area and the number of RR Lyrae stars (RRLS) detected near to its core, we performed a follow-up campaign to get deep multi-band ($g,i$) and multi-epoch DECam observations in the outskirts of CraII, covering up to 8$r_h$ in the North-East direction and up to 13$r_h$ in the South-West direction (spanning almost 10 degr in the sky across the galaxy). We confirm the existence of tails coming out from CraII. In our survey, we detected a total of 97 periodic variable stars, of which 46 are CraII members [37 RRLS and 7 anomalous Cepheids (AC)]. The RRLS show a strong gradient in distance of 3.7 kpc/deg, which follows the relation: $d (\rm {kpc}) = (-3.70\pm 0.21)\, \xi' + (116.2 \pm 0.32)$ (where $\xi'$ is the planar coordinate rotated to fit the CraII tails). We also found an indication that the gradient in distance in the distant part of the near-side tail (North-East) may be less steep than it is in the inner $5°$. The leading tail also displays a significant over-density of RRLS located $\sim 3.25$ deg from the center of CraII. Despite covering a smaller area than previous works, our deeper photometry has allowed us to unveil more variable stars in the region and better define the tidal tails of CraII.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05584" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar feedback drives the baryon deficiency in low-mass galaxies</a><span class="id">[2512.05584]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar feedback, as a key process regulating the baryon cycle, is thought to greatly redistribute baryonic material inside and outside the dark matter halos (DMHs), however the observational evidences are lacking. Through stacking analyses of  400,000 galaxy spectra from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we find star formation driven cool outflows in Mg II absorption line. Assuming only gravity acts on the launched gas, our calculations reveal that outflows from low mass galaxies (log M*&lt;10) are capable of escaping beyond the DMHs, which aligns well with our finding in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) absorption along the minor-axes of galaxies using background quasars. This research offers indirect evidence that stellar feedback drives the low baryon retention rate in low-mass haloes, implicating that baryonic processes within galaxies are connected with the diffuse matter beyond the DMHs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05622" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Statistical Detection of Cool Gas Outflows with JWST Towards Cosmic Dawn</a><span class="id">[2512.05622]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galactic-scale outflows are a crucial component of galaxy evolution, yet their properties in the early universe remain poorly constrained. We present the first statistical investigation of cool gas outflows in galaxies spanning a wide cosmic timeline from $z \approx 1$ to $z \approx 10$. Using thousands of public JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we employ a signal-to-noise weighted spectral stacking technique on the \ion{Mg}{2} $\lambda\lambda2796, 2803$ absorption doublet. We robustly detect blueshifted \ion{Mg}{2} absorption in all stellar mass and redshift bins. The outflow equivalent width exhibits a strong, positive correlation with stellar mass ($M_*$) at all epochs, increasing from $\sim 1$ Å at $M_* \approx 10^9~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ to over $3$ Å at $M_* &gt; 10^{10.5}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Our work provides the first statistical constraints on cool outflows in the low-mass ($M_* \lesssim 10^{9.5}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$), high-redshift ($z &gt; 3$) regime, vital for constraining feedback in the numerous progenitors of typical present-day galaxies. Crucially, the scaling relation between outflow properties and stellar mass shows no significant evolution at $z &gt; 3$. This suggests a persistent, unevolving feedback mechanism governing the baryon cycle in the early universe, placing strong constraints on models that invoke a fundamental change in feedback physics at Cosmic Dawn, such as the feedback-free starburst model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05719" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar cores live long and prosper in cuspy dark matter halos</a><span class="id">[2512.05719]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The existence of cuspy or cored centers of dark matter halos is a crucial discriminant between different dark matter models. It has recently been claimed based on dynamical arguments that perfectly cored stellar systems cannot survive inside cuspy dark matter halos, which would make the observation of stellar cores in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, where dark matter cores cannot form through baryonic processes, a direct falsification of the cold dark matter paradigm. Here, we use idealized simulations to show explicitly that cored stellar systems like those observed in dwarf galaxies can be stable within cuspy dark matter halos over at least several Hubble times. We also demonstrate that observations of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies cannot distinguish mildly positive, flat, or negative inner density slopes, further precluding the dynamical inference of the gravitational potential from the stellar configuration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05739" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The X-ray/UV Connection in NGC 5548: A Rapidly Varying Corona</a><span class="id">[2512.05739]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent intensive monitoring campaigns of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have provided simultaneous X-ray, UV, and optical data of unprecedented quality. The observations reveal a strong correlation between the UV and optical variability, but a weaker correlation between the X-ray and UV bands, challenging the standard X-ray reprocessing scenario. We revisit the X-ray/UV connection in NGC 5548 by fitting archival 2014 HST and Swift/XRT light curves assuming X-ray reverberation from a dynamically evolving X-ray corona. Our results show that, as long as the corona height, photon index and power vary over time, X-ray reverberation can explain the observed UV and optical variability within 2% and 5%, respectively (on average). The evolution of the best-fit parameters suggests that fast changes in coronal geometry and energetics on a time scale of days are required to explain the observed variability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-band ALMA Polarization Observations of BHB07-11 Reveal Aligned Dust Grains in Complex Spiral Arm Structures</a><span class="id">[2512.05768]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polarization-mode observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are powerful tools for studying the dust grain populations in circumstellar disks. Many sources exhibit polarization signatures consistent with aligned dust grains, yet the physical origin of this alignment remains uncertain. One such source is BHB07-11, a Class I protobinary object in the Pipe Nebula with complex spiral arm structures in its circumbinary disk. While magnetic fields are often invoked to explain grain alignment in the interstellar medium, the contrasting conditions in circumstellar disk environments demand further investigation into grain alignment mechanisms. To determine BHB07-11's dominant polarization mechanism, we leverage ALMA polarization-mode dust continuum observations in Bands 3 ($\lambda$=3.1 mm), 6 ($\lambda$=1.3 mm), and 7 ($\lambda$=0.87 mm), in combination with high-resolution dust continuum and spectral line observations in Band 6. Observed polarization vectors in each band are consistent with emission from aligned grains and follow the structure of the spiral arms as shown in the high-resolution observations. Given the relationship between the observed polarization vector orientation and the spiral arms, we find that the polarization morphology is most consistent with grains aligned through a relative velocity flow between gas and dust in the spiral arms, as envisioned in the recently developed badminton birdie-like alignment mechanism, rather than alignment with a magnetic field or other known alignment mechanisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stability of the Milky Way Satellite Galaxy Plane under the Influence of Neighbors</a><span class="id">[2512.05801]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Trajectories of test particles in a time-varying nonspherical gravitational potential model of our Galaxy are considered.

It is shown that perturbations of the potential created by the environment can significantly change the trajectories of particles at distances greater than 100 kpc from the Galactic center, but the magnitude of this effect depends on the still poorly known trajectory of the galaxy M31.

These objects are bright both in X-rays and in the optical, so that the sample is characterized by nearly 100% statistical completeness. We have developed a new method for determining the $L_{\rm 2keV}-L_{\rm 2500}$ relation, which consistently takes into account (i) X-ray and UV flux limited object selection, (ii) X-ray and UV variability of quasars, and (iii) the decreasing space density of quasars with increasing luminosity. Assuming a linear relation between $l_{\rm X}\equiv\log(L_{\rm 2keV}/[{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}])$ and $l_{\rm UV}\equiv\log(L_{\rm 2500}/[{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}])$, we find the slope, $\gamma=0.69\pm0.02$ (hereafter all uncertainties are quoted at the 68% confidence level), and normalization, $l_{\rm X}=26.45\pm0.02$ at $l_{\rm UV}=30.5$, of the $L_{\rm 2keV}$ ($L_{\rm 2500}$) dependence. These values are not substantially different from the results of previous studies. A key novel aspect of our work is allowance for intrinsic scatter (which adds to the dispersion induced by quasar variability and flux measurement uncertainties) of the $L_{\rm 2keV}-L_{\rm 2500}$ relation in both variables, i.e. in X-ray and UV luminosity. The intrinsic X-ray scatter ($\sigma^2_{\rm intX}=0.066\pm0.005$) strongly dominates over the UV one ($\sigma^2_{\rm intUV}=0.001^{+0.003}_{-0.001}$). Further studies should seek to explain this behaviour in terms of accretion onto supermassive black holes and orientation of quasars with respect to the observer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05854" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new Gaia census of OB associations within 1 kpc</a><span class="id">[2512.05854]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>OB associations are primordial tracers of star formation and Galactic structure. Originally defined about 80 years ago, their historical membership lists have been superseded thanks to the precise astrometry from ESA's \textit{Gaia}'s satellite. Recent studies have however been mostly focused on individual OB associations or limited by the coverage of spectroscopic surveys. In this paper, we exploit a complete census of $\sim$25,000 O- and B-type stars within 1 kpc of the Sun to produce a highly-reliable catalogue of 57 OB associations using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, increasing the number of known OB associations by a factor of two within this volume. We assess the validity of this catalogue by crossmatching our OB association members with other catalogues of OB associations, star clusters and young stellar groups, confirming the high-confidence of our census of OB associations. We characterize these OB associations physically (total initial stellar mass, number of OB stars, ...) and kinematically (velocity dispersion, linear expansion ages, ...). Nearly three quarters of the OB associations (41 out of 57) exhibit a significant expansion pattern in at least one direction, including 13 in both plane-of-the-sky directions, though differences in expansion velocity suggest anisotropical expansion patterns. We compare the locations of these OB associations with superclouds and features in the local Milky Way such as the Radcliffe Wave and discuss the implications for star formation in the solar neighbourhood.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). From simulations to sky: Advancing machine-learning lens detection with real Euclid data</a><span class="id">[2512.05899]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the era of large-scale surveys like Euclid, machine learning has become an essential tool for identifying rare yet scientifically valuable objects, such as strong gravitational lenses. However, supervised machine-learning approaches require large quantities of labelled examples to train on, and the limited number of known strong lenses has lead to a reliance on simulations for training. A well-known challenge is that machine-learning models trained on one data domain often underperform when applied to a different domain: in the context of lens finding, this means that strong performance on simulated lenses does not necessarily translate into equally good performance on real observations. In Euclid's Quick Data Release 1 (Q1), covering 63 deg2, 500 strong lens candidates were discovered through a synergy of machine learning, citizen science, and expert visual inspection. These discoveries now allow us to quantify this performance gap and investigate the impact of training on real data. We find that a network trained only on simulations recovers up to 92% of simulated lenses with 100% purity, but only achieves 50% completeness with 24% purity on real Euclid data. By augmenting training data with real Euclid lenses and non-lenses, completeness improves by 25-30% in terms of the expected yield of discoverable lenses in Euclid DR1 and the full Euclid Wide Survey. Roughly 20% of this improvement comes from the inclusion of real lenses in the training data, while 5-10% comes from exposure to a more diverse set of non-lenses and false-positives from Q1. We show that the most effective lens-finding strategy for real-world performance combines the diversity of simulations with the fidelity of real lenses. This hybrid approach establishes a clear methodology for maximising lens discoveries in future data releases from Euclid, and will likely also be applicable to other surveys such as LSST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learning the Cosmic Web: Graph-based Classification of Simulated Galaxies by their Dark Matter Environments</a><span class="id">[2512.05909]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel graph-based machine learning classifier for identifying the dark matter cosmic web environments of galaxies. Large galaxy surveys offer comprehensive statistical views of how galaxy properties are shaped by large-scale structure, but this requires robust classifications of galaxies' cosmic web environments. Using stellar mass-selected IllustrisTNG-300 galaxies, we apply a three-stage, simulation-based framework to link galaxies to the total (mainly dark) underlying matter distribution. Here, we apply the following three steps: First, we assign the positions of simulated galaxies to a void, wall, filament, or cluster environment using the T-Web classification of the underlying matter distribution. Second, we construct a Delaunay triangulation of the galaxy distribution to summarise the local geometric structure with ten graph metrics for each galaxy. Third, we train a graph attention network (GAT) on each galaxy's graph metrics to predict its cosmic web environment. For galaxies with stellar mass $\mathrm{&gt;10^9 M_{\odot}}$, our GAT+ model achieves an accuracy of $85\,\%$, outperforming graph-agnostic multilayer perceptrons and graph convolutional networks. Our results demonstrate that graph-based representations of galaxy positions provide a powerful and physically meaningful way to infer dark matter environments. We plan to apply this simulation-based graph modelling to investigate how the properties of observed galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey are influenced by their dark matter environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05914" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMAGAL VI. The spatial distribution of dense cores during the evolution of cluster-forming massive clump</a><span class="id">[2512.05914]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-mass stars and star clusters form from the fragmentation of massive dense clumps driven by gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. The ALMAGAL project observed $\sim1000$ clumps at $\sim$1000 au resolution, enabling a statistically significant characterization of this process across a large range of clump physical parameters and evolutionary stages. In this work, we investigated the spatial distribution of dense cores in the 514 massive, potentially cluster-forming, clumps hosting at least 4 cores, to trace fragmentation's initial conditions and early evolution. We used quantitative descriptors, evaluated against the clump bolometric luminosity-to-mass ratio as an indicator of evolution. Core separations were measured with the minimum spanning tree method (MST) and compared with the Jeans gravitational fragmentation theory. We used the $Q$ parameter and the mass segregation ratio, $\Lambda_{MSR}$, to evaluate whether cores have specific arrangements or differences depending on their masses. ALMAGAL cores are usually arranged in elliptical groups with an axis ratio $e\sim2.2$, but $e\geq$5 is also observed. A single characteristic core separation per clump is found in $\sim76$% of cases, but signatures of multiple fragmentation lengths not rare. Typical core separations are compatible with the clump-averaged thermal Jeans length, $\lambda^{th}_{J}$, though a population, typical of low-fragmented/young clumps, has wider separations with $l\approx3\times\lambda^{th}_{J}$. The core separation decreases on average from $l\sim22000$ au in younger systems to $l\sim7000$ au in more evolved ones. Cores are typically distributed in fractal-type subclusters, with centrally concentrated patterns appearing only at later stages, but without a progressive evolutionary transition. Finally, mass segregation is found in 110 systems, with its occurrence increasing with evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inelastic Majorana Dark Matter and Its Self-Interactions in a Gauged $U(1)_{L_μ- L_τ}$ Model</a><span class="id">[2512.05694]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop an inelastic Majorana dark matter model gauged by $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry, featuring a complex scalar and fermions with a small Dirac mass. The model exhibits strong interactions between the dark fermion-antifermion pair and the scalar, with a large coupling generating a Majorana mass after symmetry breaking. The dark fermion splits into two nearly degenerate Majorana eigenstates, with the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge boson $Z^\prime$ interacting via inelastic axial vector currents. The lighter Majorana serves as dark matter (DM), while the heavier may also contribute. The model predicts DM masses ranging from about 10 GeV to hundreds of GeV, with the scalar favored below 100 MeV. Strong coupling causes DM particles to mainly annihilate into two scalars, which determines the relic abundance, while thermal equilibrium with the bath occurs through $Z^\prime$ interactions. Self-interacting DM particles scatter via ladder exchange of strongly coupled light scalars, helping resolve small-scale issues. The $Z^\prime$ interacts with the muon, affecting its magnetic moment and explaining the $(g-2)_\mu$ discrepancy. Effects on experiments, $N_{\text{eff}}$, and the Hubble tension from kinetic mixing between $Z^\prime$ and the photon, originating from high-energy scales, are discussed. The model details and parameter constraints used in experiments are also covered.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The galactic tooth-fairy and a cosmic bullet: Amateur discoveries and a call for further research</a><span class="id">[2309.14743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There are countless digital sky surveys and automated scans of the night sky which use computer algorithms to detect and categorize objects. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence such surveys will become even more efficient in the near future. Despite this some objects are missed by surveys or pose no initial interest. At times such missed objects are unique in nature and of decent angular sizes, demanding research, unlike the billions of tiny specs of galaxies that would be too tedious to name and study. In this scenario the amateur astronomer and their spirit for old school astronomical discovery steps in, to manually comb the sky and catalogue unique objects as was done in the early days of astronomy. In this paper two unique, previously uncatalogued galaxy candidates, namely Shaheer I and Shaheer II are identified and studied. Both galaxies lay at a distance of 6.67 arc-minutes from each other in the constellation of Camelopardalis. One boasts an unusual morphological profile, akin to a molar tooth, while the other seems to be shooting through space at tremendous velocities. The objects were discovered during visual inspection of digital surveys and then imaged from amateur telescopes at Taqwa observatory, Pakistan's first and only dark sky observatory (bortle 1). We perform photometry using PetroFit to discuss the potential nature of the galaxies and implore further collaborative research to fully uncover their characteristics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01437" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AGN – host galaxy photometric decomposition using a fast, accurate and precise deep learning approach</a><span class="id">[2410.01437]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Identifying active galactic nuclei (AGN) is extremely important for understanding galaxy evolution and its connection with the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBH). With the advent of deep and high angular resolution imaging surveys such as those conducted with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to identify galaxies with a central point source out to the very early Universe. In this study, we develop a fast, accurate and precise method to identify galaxies which host AGNs and recover the intrinsic AGN contribution to the observed total light ($f_{AGN}$). We trained a deep learning (DL) based method Zoobot to estimate the fractional contribution of a central point source to the total light. Our training sample comprises realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We injected different amounts of the real JWST point spread function (PSF) models to represent galaxies with different levels of $f_{AGN}$. We analyse the performance of our method and compare it with results obtained from the traditional light profile fitting tool GALFIT. We find excellent performance of our DL method in recovering the injected AGN fraction $f_{AGN}$, both in terms of precision and accuracy. The mean difference between the predicted and true injected $f_{AGN}$ is -0.002 and the overall root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.013. The relative absolute error (RAE) is 0.076 and the outlier (defined as predictions with RAE &gt;20%) fraction is 6.5%. In comparison, using GALFIT on the same dataset, we achieve a mean difference of -0.02, RMSE of 0.12, RAE of 0.19 and outlier fraction of 19%. We applied our trained DL model to real JWST observations and found that 33% of X-ray-selected AGN and 15% of MIR-selected AGN are also identified as AGN using a cut at $f_{\rm AGN} &gt; 0.1$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MUSE-DARK-I: Dark matter halo properties of intermediate-z star-forming galaxies</a><span class="id">[2506.19721]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>[Abridged] We analyse the dark matter (DM) halo properties of 127 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) down to low stellar masses (8&lt;log(Mstar/Msun)&lt;11), using data from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey and photometry from HST and JWST. We employ a 3D forward modelling approach to analyse the morpho-kinematics of our sample, enabling measurement of individual rotation curves out to 2-3 times the effective radius. We perform a disk-halo decomposition with a 3D parametric model that includes stellar, gas, and DM components, with pressure support corrections. We validate our methodology on mock data cubes generated from idealised disk simulations. We select the best-fitting DM model among six density profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White and the generalised alpha-beta-gamma profile of Di Cintio et al. (2014, DC14). Our Bayesian analysis shows that DC14 performs as well as or better than the other profiles in &gt;80% of the sample. We find that the kinematically inferred stellar masses agree with values from SED fitting. We find that 89% of galaxies have DM fractions &gt;50%. For 66% of SFGs, we infer a DM inner slope, gamma &lt; 0.5, indicating cored DM profiles, but no correlation is found between gamma and star formation rate of the sample. The stellar- and concentration-mass relations agree with theoretical expectations, but with larger scatter. We confirm the anticorrelation between halo scale radius and DM density. The halo scale radii and DM surface densities increase with Mstar, while DM densities stay constant. We find tentative evidence of an evolution of the DM density with z, which suggests that the DM halos of intermediate-z systems are denser than those of local galaxies. In contrast, the halo scale radii are z-invariant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16917" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atomic hydrogen reservoirs in quiescent galaxies at z = 0.4</a><span class="id">[2507.16917]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Based on Local Universe observations, quiescent galaxies (QGs) host lower to no HI compared to star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but no constraints have been derived so far at higher redshift (z&gt;0.1). Understanding whether QGs can retain significant HI reservoirs at higher z is crucial to refine quenching and gas accretion models and to constrain overall star formation efficiency at different epochs. Aims. We aim to probe HI in candidate QGs at intermediate redshifts (z=0.36) and to understand whether there exists a class of QGs retaining consistent HI reservoirs and which parameters (dust content, stellar mass, Dn4000, morphology, environment) effectively capture HI-rich QGs. Methods. We perform 21-cm spectral line stacking on MIGHTEE-HI data at z=0.36, targeting two different samples of QGs, defined by means of a color-selection criterion and a spectroscopic criterion based on Dn4000, respectively. We also perform stacking on subsamples of the spectroscopically-selected quiescent sample to investigate the correlation between the HI content and other galaxy properties. Results. We find that QGs with an IR counterpart (i.e., dusty galaxies) are found to host a substantial HI content, on average just 40% lower than SFGs. In contrast, color-selected QGs still hold HI, but lower than SFGs by a factor 3. Among dusty objects, we find morphology to have a mild impact on the atomic gas content, with spirals hosting approximately 15-30% more HI than spheroids. Environmental effects are also present, with low-density regions hosting galaxies that are HI-richer than in high-density ones, by approximately 30% for spirals and 60% for spheroids. We suggest that, in general, HI content is driven by several factors, including quenching mechanisms and ISM enrichment processes. Also, quiescent galaxies - and especially dusty systems - seem to yield HI more consistently than in the Local Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Wide Triples to UCXBs: Multimessenger Signatures of Dynamically-formed Black Hole-White Dwarf Systems in the LISA Band</a><span class="id">[2508.13264]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are a subclass of low-mass X-ray binaries characterized by tight orbits and degenerate donors, which pose significant challenges to our understanding of their formation. Recent discoveries of black hole (BH) candidates with main-sequence (MS) or red giant (RG) companions suggest that BH-white dwarf (BH-WD) binaries are common in the Galactic field. Motivated by these observations and the fact that most massive stars are born in triples, we show that wide BH-WD systems can naturally form UCXBs through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. Notably, EKL-driven eccentricity excitations combined with gravitational wave (GW) emission and WD dynamical tides can effectively shrink and circularize the orbit, leading to mass-transferring BH-WD binaries. These systems represent promising multimessenger sources in both X-ray and GW observations. Specifically, we predict that the wide triple channel can produce $\sim3-27$ ($\sim1-5$) detectable UCXBs in the Milky Way (Andromeda galaxy), including $\sim1$ system observable by the mHz GW detection of LISA. If the final WD mass can reach sufficiently small values, this channel could contribute up to $\sim 10^3$ UCXBs in the Galaxy. Furthermore, the identification of tertiary companions in observed UCXBs would provide direct evidence for this formation pathway and yield unique insights into their dynamical origins.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A catalog to unite them all: REGALADE, a revised galaxy compilation for the advanced detector era</a><span class="id">[2508.13267]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many applications in transient science, gravitational wave follow-up, and galaxy population studies require all-sky galaxy catalogs with reliable distances, extents, and stellar masses. However, existing catalogs often lack completeness beyond $\sim 100$ Mpc, suffer from stellar contamination, or do not provide homogeneous stellar mass estimates and size information. Our goal is to build a high-purity, high-completeness, all-sky galaxy catalog out to 2,000 Mpc, specifically designed to support time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. We combined major galaxy catalogs and deep imaging surveys – including the Legacy Surveys, Pan-STARRS, DELVE, and SDSS – and added spectroscopic, photometric, and redshift-independent distances. We cleaned the sample using the Gaia catalog to remove stars and visually inspected all ambiguous cases below 100 Mpc through a classification platform that gathered 27,000 expert votes. Stellar masses were estimated using optical and mid-infrared profile-fit photometry, and we improved the accuracy of photometric distances by combining multiple independent estimates. The resulting catalog, REGALADE, includes nearly 80 million galaxies with distances under 2,000 Mpc. It provides stellar masses for 88% of the sample and ellipse fits for 80%. REGALADE is more than 90% complete for galaxies contributing 50% of the total $r$-band luminosity out to 360 Mpc. In science tests, it recovers 60% more known supernova hosts, doubles the number of low-luminosity transient hosts, and identifies more reliable hosts for ultraluminous and hyper-luminous X-ray sources. REGALADE is one of the most complete and reliable all-sky galaxy catalog to date for the nearby Universe, built for real-world applications in transient and multi-messenger astrophysics. The full dataset, visual classifications, and code will be released to support broad community use.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic fields in galactic environments probed by Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2509.08896]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>FRBs constitute a unique probe of various astrophysical and cosmological environments via their characteristic dispersion and rotation (RM) measures that encode information about the ionized gas traversed by the FRB sightlines. In this work, we analyse observed RM measured for 14 localized FRBs at $0.05 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.5$, to infer total magnetic fields in various galactic environments. Additionally, we calculate $f_{\rm gas}$ - the average fraction of halo baryons in the ionized CGM. We build a spectroscopic dataset of FRB foreground galaxy halos, acquired with VLT/MUSE and FLIMFLAM survey. We develop a novel Bayesian algorithm and use it to correlate the individual intervening halos with the observed RM. This approach allows us to disentangle the magnetic fields present in various environments traversed by the FRB. Our analysis yields the first direct FRB constraints on the strength of magnetic fields in the ISM and halos of the FRB host galaxies, as well as in halos of foreground galaxies. We find that the average magnetic field in the ISM of FRB hosts is $B_{\rm host}^{\rm local} = 5.44^{+1.13}_{-0.87}\mu{\rm G}$. Additionally, we place upper limits on average magnetic field in FRB host halos, $B_{\rm host}^{\rm halo} &lt; 4.81\mu{\rm G}$, and in foreground intervening halos, $B_{\rm f/g}^{\rm halo} &lt; 4.31\mu{\rm G}$. Moreover, we estimate the average fraction of cosmic baryons inside $10 \lesssim \log_{10} \left( M_{\rm halo} / M_{\odot}\right) \lesssim 13.1$ halos $f_{\rm gas} = 0.45^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$. We find that the magnetic fields inferred in this work are in good agreement with previous measurements. In contrast to previous studies that analysed FRB RMs and have not considered contributions from the halos of the foreground and/or FRB host galaxies, we show that they can contribute a non-negligible amount of RM and must be taken into account when analysing future FRB samples.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vz-GAL: Probing Cold Molecular Gas in Dusty Star-forming Galaxies at z=1-6</a><span class="id">[2509.25167]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first results of Vz-GAL, a high-redshift CO(J=1-0) large survey with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, targeting 92 Herschel-selected, infrared-luminous, dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at redshifts 1 to 6. These sources are selected based on having redshifts and mid/high-J CO transitions from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array z-GAL survey. We successfully detect CO(J=1-0) emission in 90/92 galaxies at the expected positions and redshifts, including 9 tentative detections at $2\sigma - 3\sigma$ significance, and CO(J=2-1) emission in 10 of these galaxies. The CO(J=1-0) luminosities suggest apparent gas masses in the range $\mu {M}_{\rm H_2}$ = $(2-20) \times {10}^{11}~(\alpha_{CO}/{4.0})~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which implies gas depletion times of $(50-600)$ Myr. These timescales show similar spread as local ULIRGs, suggesting a self-regulatory mechanism that maintains a consistent SFR per unit gas mass in starbursts across redshifts. To quantify the contribution of &quot;excitation correction&quot; factors to gas mass estimates, we calculate median CO line brightness temperature ratios of $r_{21}=0.88\pm0.25$, $r_{31}=0.61\pm0.22$, $r_{41}=0.49\pm0.15$, $r_{51}=0.47\pm0.13$, and $r_{61}=0.28\pm0.13$. Accounting for these corrections results in a reduced scatter in 'gas mass$-$star formation rate' relations. We also find a median log(${L}^{\prime}_{\mathrm{[CI]}(^{3}P_1 - ^{3}P_0)}/{L}^{\prime}_{\mathrm{CO}(J=1-0)})=-0.71\pm0.12$ for a subsample of 23 sources, consistent with the ratios derived for local star-forming galaxies. Together, our findings are in agreement with common conditions in the cold gas reservoirs among star-forming galaxies over a broad range in star formation modes, efficiencies, and scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The warm outer layer of a Little Red Dot as the source of [Fe II] and collisional Balmer lines with scattering wings</a><span class="id">[2510.00103]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at $z=5.5$. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense ($n_{\rm H}=10^{9-10}$ cm$^{-3}$) warm layer with electron temperature $T_{\rm e}\approx7000$ K. The broad wings of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high $\rm H\alpha:H\beta:H\gamma$ flux ratio of $\approx10.4:1:0.14$ is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow H$\gamma$ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate $\sim5$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the $\lambda&gt;1500$ Å continuum and a low mass ($\sim10^8$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06755" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redshift-Frame Systematics and Their Impact on the Hubble Constant from Pantheon+ Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2511.06755]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform a full-sky, covariance-weighted quantification of redshift-frame systematics in the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova sample with the explicit goal of determining whether such effects can meaningfully bias the inferred Hubble constant.

EzTaoX achieves a speed increase of $\sim 10^2-10^4 \times$ on CPUs over current tools with similar capabilities, while maintaining equal or better accuracy in recovering simulated variability properties. This performance gain enables continuum time-delay measurements for all AGNs discovered by LSST – both in the Wide Fast Deep survey and the Deep Drilling Fields – thereby opening new opportunities to probe AGN accretion-flow geometries.

We calculate expected fluxes of both macroscopic interstellar objects (ISOs, $\geq100~$m), which could be detected by telescopic surveys, and smaller meteoroids ($\geq200~$microns), which could manifest as meteors in Earth's atmosphere. We estimate that the ISO population originating from these debris disks and currently within the inner solar system is on the order of  2, only a fraction of the expected total ISO population but nonetheless likely to be discovered by Rubin. Meteors in Earth's atmosphere from these systems are expected as well, but current methods, both radar and video, might require decades to collect even a single event. Our sample is found to be rich in relatively low excess velocity particles compared to the broader expected ISO population, which might make them harder to distinguish observationally from bound objects in some cases.

Beyond the extensively studied population at $z \ge 5$, the cosmic morning epoch ($3 \lesssim z \lesssim 5$) marks the peak of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and black hole accretion, yet remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we compiled the radio high-redshift quasar catalog (RHzQCat) by cross-matching the SDSS DR16Q catalog with four major radio surveys – FIRST,NVSS, RACS, and GLEAM. Our tier-based cross-matching framework and visual validation ensured reliable source identification across surveys with diverse beam sizes. The catalog included 1629 reliable and 315 candidate RHRQs, with radio luminosities uniformly spanning $10^{25.5}$ – $10^{29.3}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. About 95\% of the confirmed sources exhibited compact morphologies, consistent with Doppler-boosted or young AGN populations at high redshifts. Our catalog increases the number of known RHRQs at $z\ge3$ by an order of magnitude, representing the largest and most homogeneous catalog of radio quasars at cosmic morning, filling the observational gap between the early ($z&gt;6$) and local Universe.

However, the extreme conditions of astrophysical plasmas near compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars are often characterized by mixtures of electrons, protons, and positrons, whose dynamics can differ significantly because of the considerable mass contrast. We present the first two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic turbulence and magnetic reconnection in a three-species plasma, varying the relative abundance of electrons, protons, and positrons while employing realistic mass ratios to achieve unprecedented accuracy. We find that turbulence leads to the formation of magnetic islands, current sheets, and plasmoids. Reconnection occurs between these structures, with plasma composition playing a key role in determining the number of reconnection sites and their energy-conversion efficiency. In particular, as the proton fraction increases, very small-scale features of the turbulence are washed out, while global dissipative effects are amplified. Finally, using a novel generalization of Ohm's law for a relativistic multi-species plasma, we find that the reconnection rate is primarily governed by the electric fields associated to the divergence of the positron and electron pressure tensors. These results provide new insights into dissipation and particle acceleration in turbulent relativistic plasmas, such as those near black holes and neutron stars, and can be used to interpret their high-energy emission and phenomenology.</p></div></details></article>

Differentiating Earth from Neptunes During Discovery</a><span class="id">[2512.05279]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As the architecture for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is being developed, it is crucial to optimize the observing strategies for a survey to detect and characterize Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. Efficient target identification and characterization will help drive mission requirements that can be matched to the planned observations. Current HWO concepts allow simultaneous multi-bandpass observations with the coronagraph instrument, critical for performing a qualitative planetary reconnaissance to optimize observing time for deriving orbital constraints and prioritize characterization of promising targets. We describe a new algorithm designed to determine the best combination of broadband photometric observations for extracting maximum information from the first visit. It identifies degeneracies in the orbital configurations, fluxes, and noise, and determines optimal secondary photometry bands to reduce these. We demonstrate its application by comparing an Earth seen at quadrature with a cold and a warm Neptune at inclined orbits and varying phases, with comparable flux in the discovery bandpass centered at 500 nm (20\% bandwidth). Using the noise and exposure time calculator that we developed for the HWO coronagraph instrument, we find that the baseline $S/N=7$ (corresponding to 3.2 hours observing time for a planet at 10pc) is only sufficient to marginally differentiate the Earth from a cold Neptune-like planet assuming two parallel bandpasses (550 nm + 850 nm). However, increasing to $S/N=15$ (7 hours observing time) and using three parallel bandpasses (360 nm + 500 nm + 1.11 micron) would differentiate the Earth from either a warm or cold Neptune.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On-Orbit Calibration of Danuri/PolCam. I. Geometric Calibration</a><span class="id">[2512.05330]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The wide-angle Polarimetric Camera (PolCam) onboard South Korea's first lunar orbiter, Danuri, is a pioneering instrument designed to conduct the first global polarimetric and high-phase-angle survey of the Moon. Precise geometric calibration is critical for this mission, particularly due to PolCam's highly oblique viewing geometry, which introduces significant topographic distortion. We present a comprehensive on-orbit geometric calibration that relies on 160,256 tie points derived from matching features between PolCam images and the well-orthorectified global map of the Kaguya Multiband Imager (MI). This dataset allows us to address two fundamental challenges: (1) the accurate reconstruction of the observation time for each line of an observation strip via a simple linear model, and (2) the refinement of the precise camera model, geometric model for PolCam optics. Our optimization method for these two challenges transforms the 2D image coordinates of identified features into 3D lunar coordinates and minimizes the reprojection error against the reference coordinates provided by the Kaguya MI map. From the refined observation time and camera model, we compute the precise longitude, latitude, and elevation of each pixel of an observed image. These estimated 3D coordinates are then used to generate orthorectified images, the final product of the geometric calibration. The resulting calibration achieves a geometric precision comparable to that of previous lunar orbiters and establishes the foundational framework necessary to produce geometrically-corrected data products of PolCam.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commissioning an Inexpensive Off-the-shelf Spectrograph for Radial-Velocity Studies</a><span class="id">[2512.05601]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a way to set up an inexpensive out of the shelf spectrograph at a local observatory.

FoReRo2 is a multimode instrument mounted at the Ritchey-Chretien(RC) focus of the 2-meter Ritchey-Chretien-Coude (RCC) telescope at the Bulgarian National Astronomical Observatory (BNAO) - Rozhen. The primary targets of this instrument include novae, Be/X-ray binaries, symbiotic stars, asteroids, and comets. Standard stars with a high degree of polarisation are an essential part of the polarimetric observations. In our sample, HD 204827 shows short-term variability in position angle, making it unsuitable for calibration. HD 183143 displays intrinsic polarisation variability but remains stable in position angle. For the first time, we present a statistical study of K and {\lambda}_max of the Serkowski law, including their mean value, standard deviation, and distribution. In order to show the FoReRo2 polarimetric capabilities, we also present several examples. The recurrent nova RS Oph shows variability of Serkowski's K parameter due to dust formation within the first few days after the 2021 outburst. The examples also include imaging polarimetry of comet C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) and spectropolarimetric observations of the symbiotic star Z And.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05702" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ratan Active Region Patches (RARPs) Database: A New Database of Solar Active Region Radio Signatures from the RATAN-600 Telescope</a><span class="id">[2512.05702]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar flares and coronal mass ejections, originating from solar active regions (ARs), are the primary drivers of space weather and can disrupt technological systems. Forecasting efforts heavily rely on photospheric magnetic field data from the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARPs) data products. However, the crucial energy release occurs higher in the solar corona. Radio observations from instruments like the RATAN-600 telescope directly probe this region, but their scientific use has been hindered by a lack of standardized and accessible data products. To address this gap, we have developed the Ratan Active Region Patches (RARPs) database, a new public resource of multi-frequency radio spectra for solar ARs. Generated using RATANSunPy software, RARPs provides the first standardized radio counterpart to magnetic field archives. The database contains over 160,000 calibrated AR observations from 2009 to 2025, each including 3-18 GHz spectra and rich metadata. We demonstrate the scientific utility of this database by using machine learning to forecast solar flares. The radio spectra are first compressed into low-dimensional embedded features using an autoencoder, which are then used as predictors in baseline logistic regression classifiers. We compare the predictive power of these embedded RARPs features with that of the 18 SHARPs magnetic field parameters provided in the SHARPs data product headers. Our results show that while SHARPs data provides superior flare discrimination, the radio signatures in RARPs possess clear predictive potential and, for M-class and above flares, yield lower Brier Scores and positive Brier Skill Scores relative to SHARPs, indicating more accurate probabilistic forecasts for these events. This establishes radio data as a valuable and complementary information source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transformation of orientation and rotation angles of synchronous satellites: Application to the Galilean moons</a><span class="id">[2512.05935]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The orientation and rotation of a synchronous satellite can be referred to both its Laplace plane and the ICRF equatorial plane, in terms of Euler angles or spin axis Cartesian coordinates and Earth equatorial coordinates, respectively. We computed second-order analytical expressions to make the transformation between the two systems and applied them to the Galilean satellites (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto). If one term of the spin axis Cartesian coordinates series is dominant, trigonometric series can be generated for the inertial and orbital obliquities, node longitude and offset with respect to the Cassini plane. Since the transformation does not require any fit of amplitudes and frequencies on numerical series, the physical meaning of the frequencies is preserved from the input series and the amplitudes can be directly related to the geophysical parameters of interest. We provide tables for the coordinates and angles' series assuming that the satellites are entirely solid, and considering two different orbital theories. The possible amplitude ranges for the main terms are also examined in the case where a liquid layer is assumed in the interior model. We use our transformation method to propose an updated IAU WG solution which would result in an improvement with respect to zero obliquity models used so far. This method will also be useful for the interpretation of future Earth-based radar observations or JUICE data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05949" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Removing correlated noise stripes from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope survey images</a><span class="id">[2512.05949]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Weak gravitational lensing has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the matter distribution in the Universe and how it has evolved over cosmic time. The Wide Field Instrument (WFI) on the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will deliver some of the highest precision measurements of weak lensing ever made. Since weak lensing is based on statistics of faint sources, it can be biased by even tiny instrument systematics, including correlated read noise. Previous works have shown the infrared detectors used in the Roman WFI show correlations in their noise fields at a level significant for weak lensing measurements, even after application of standard reference pixel corrections; of particular concern is 1/f noise, which appears as horizontal banding in the detector frame. In this paper, we present imDestripe: a new Python module utilizing the multiple roll angles in Roman's observing strategy and linear algebra techniques to remove correlated noise stripes from observed images. We test imDestripe in a hybrid simulation by combining real noise realizations (from darks taken during ground testing) with simulated images of the astronomical scene, and find that the power spectrum of the banding can be suppressed by factors of 10–30 on large scales. We briefly discuss plans for further development of imDestripe in the context of the WFI pipeline.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07223" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Readout noise of digital frequency multiplexed TES detectors for CUPID</a><span class="id">[2509.07223]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors have been the standard in Cosmic Microwave Background experiments for almost two decades and are now being adapted for use in nuclear physics, such as neutrinoless double beta decay searches. In this paper we focus on a new high-bandwidth frequency multiplexed TES readout system developed for CUPID, a neutrinoless double beta decay experiment that will replace CUORE. In order to achieve the high energy resolution requirements for CUPID, the readout noise of the system must be kept to a minimum. Low TES operating resistance and long wiring between the readout SQUID and the warm electronics are needed for CUPID, prompting a careful consideration of the design parameters of this application of frequency multiplexing. In this work, we characterize the readout noise of the newly designed frequency multiplexed TES readout system for CUPID and construct a noise model to understand it. We find that current sharing between the SQUID coil impedance and other branches of the circuit, as well as the long output wiring, worsen the readout noise of the system. To meet noise requirements, a SQUID with a low input inductance, high transimpedance and/or low dynamic impedance is needed, and the wiring capacitance should be kept as small as possible. Alternatively, the option of adding a cryogenic low-noise amplifier at the output of the SQUID should be explored.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Energy Survey Year 3 results: $w$CDM cosmology from simulation-based inference with persistent homology on the sphere</a><span class="id">[2506.13439]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present cosmological constraints from Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) weak lensing data using persistent homology, a topological data analysis technique that tracks how features like clusters and voids evolve across density thresholds. For the first time, we apply spherical persistent homology to galaxy survey data through the algorithm TopoS2, which is optimized for curved-sky analyses and HEALPix compatibility. Employing a simulation-based inference framework with the Gower Street simulation suite, specifically designed to mimic DES Y3 data properties, we extract topological summary statistics from convergence maps across multiple smoothing scales and redshift bins. After neural network compression of these statistics, we estimate the likelihood function and validate our analysis against baryonic feedback effects, finding minimal biases (under $0.3\sigma$) in the $\Omega_\mathrm{m}-S_8$ plane. Assuming the $w$CDM model, our combined Betti numbers and second moments analysis yields $S_8 = 0.821 \pm 0.018$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m} = 0.304\pm0.037$-constraints 70% tighter than those from cosmic shear two-point statistics in the same parameter plane. Our results demonstrate that topological methods provide a powerful and robust framework for extracting cosmological information, with our spherical methodology readily applicable to upcoming Stage IV wide-field galaxy surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16302" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recovering unbiased CMB polarization maps using modern ground-based experiments with minimal assumptions about atmospheric emission</a><span class="id">[2509.16302]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a study of unbiased reconstruction of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization maps from data collected by modern ground-based observatories. Atmospheric emission is a major source of correlated noise in such experiments, complicating the recovery of faint cosmological signals. We consider estimators that require minimal assumptions about unpolarized atmospheric emission properties, instead exploiting hardware solutions commonly implemented in modern instruments, such as pairs of orthogonal antennas in each focal plane pixel, and polarization signal modulation via a continuously rotating half-wave plate (HWP). We focus on two techniques: (i) statistical down-weighting of low-frequency atmospheric signals, and (ii) pair-differencing (PD), which involves differencing signals collected by two detectors in the same focal plane pixel. We compare their performance against the idealized case where the atmospheric signal is perfectly known and cleanly subtracted. We show that PD can be derived from maximum likelihood principles under general assumptions about the atmospheric signal, optimizing map sensitivity. In the absence of instrumental systematics but with reasonable detector noise variations, PD yields polarized sky maps with noise levels only slightly worse than the ideal case. While down-weighting could match this performance, it requires highly accurate atmospheric models that are not readily available. PD performance is affected by instrumental systematics, particularly those leaking atmospheric signal to the difference time stream. However, effects like gain mismatch are efficiently mitigated by a rotating HWP, making PD a competitive, robust, and efficient solution for CMB polarization mapmaking without atmospheric modeling.</p></div></details></article></body>
