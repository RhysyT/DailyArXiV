Candidates are detected using a semi-automated algorithm tailored for low surface brightness dwarfs. Using tests with injected galaxies, we show the detection is $50\%$ complete to $m_g\sim20$ mag and $M_\star \sim 10^6$ $M_\odot$. Candidates are confirmed to be true nearby dwarfs through distance measurements including redshift, tip of the red giant branch, and surface brightness fluctuations. We identify isolated, field dwarfs using various environmental criteria. Over the survey footprint, we detect and confirm 95 LV dwarfs, 44 of which we consider isolated. Using this sample, we infer the field dwarf mass function and find good agreement at the high-mass end with previous redshift surveys and with the predictions of the IllustrisTNG simulation. This sample of isolated, field dwarfs represents a powerful dataset to investigate aspects of small-scale structure and the effect of environment on dwarf galaxy evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Causal Reversal in the $M_\unicode{x25CF}\unicode{x2013}σ_0$ Relation: Implications for High-Redshift Supermassive Black Hole Mass Estimates</a><span class="id">[2602.16775]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nascent methodology of applying the principles of causal discovery to astrophysical data has produced affirming results about deeply held theories concerning the causal nature behind the observed coevolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with their host galaxies. The key results from observations have demonstrated an apparent causal reversal across different galaxy morphologies$\unicode{x2014}$SMBHs causally influence the evolution of the physical parameters of their spiral galaxy hosts, whereas SMBHs in elliptical galaxies are passive companions that grow in near lockstep with their hosts. To further explore and ascertain insights, it is necessary to utilize galaxy simulations to track the time evolution of the observed causal relations to learn more about the temporal nature of the changing SMBH/galaxy evolutionary directions. We conducted experiments with the NIHAO suite of cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations to follow the evolution of individual galaxies along with their central SMBH masses ($M_\unicode{x25CF}$) and properties, including central stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_0$). We reproduce the causal results from real galaxies, but add clarity by observing that the SMBH/galaxy causal directions are noticeably inverted between the epochs before and after the peak of star formation. The implications for causal reversal of the $M_\unicode{x25CF}\unicode{x2013}\sigma_0$ relation portend larger concerns about the reliability of SMBH masses estimated at high redshifts and presumptions of overmassive black holes at early epochs. Toward this problem, we apply updated causally-informed scaling relations that predict high-$z$ black hole masses that are approximately two orders of magnitude less massive, and thus not overmassive with respect to local $z=0$ SMBH$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy mass ratios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ELVES-Field: Isolated Dwarf Galaxy Quenched Fractions Rise Below $M_* \approx 10^7$ $M_\odot$</a><span class="id">[2602.16778]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use a new sample of low-mass ($M_* &lt; 10^9$ $M_\odot$) isolated galaxies from the Exploration of Local VolumE Survey - Field (ELVES-Field) to examine the star formation properties and sizes of field dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume (LV; $D&lt;10$ Mpc). This volume-limited sample was selected from nearly 3,000 square degrees of imaging, relying on surface brightness fluctuations to determine distances to the majority of the systems and is complete to $M_* \approx 10^6$ $M_\odot$. Across the surveyed area, we catalog over 2300 candidate LV dwarfs, of which we confirm 95 as genuine LV members and reject over 1600 as background contaminants, with the remaining 600 candidates still requiring a distance measurement. Of the confirmed LV dwarfs, 46 are either new discoveries or confirmed via a distance measurement for the first time here. We explore different environmental criteria to select isolated dwarfs but primarily focus on dwarfs that are $&gt;2\times R_{\mathrm{vir}}$ in projection from any known group with $M_\star &gt; 10^9$ $M_\odot$. We find that, at higher dwarf masses ($M_\star \gtrsim 10^7$ $M_\odot$), essentially all field dwarfs are star-forming as has been found before. In contrast, at $M_\star \lesssim 10^7$ $M_\odot$, $\sim30\%$ of field dwarfs appear to be quenched. Finally, we find that isolated dwarfs are noticeably smaller ($\sim 20\%$) than satellite dwarfs of the same stellar mass, regardless of quenched status.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The CGM with local universe FRBs: evidence of strong AGN feedback in a massive elliptical galaxy</a><span class="id">[2602.16781]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modern cosmology and galaxy formation rely on an understanding of how cosmic baryons are distributed, a significant portion of which exist in the diffuse gas confined to halos. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a promising probe of the Universe's ionized gas. At low redshift, the contribution to the dispersion measure (DM) from the intergalactic medium (IGM) and intervening halos is subdominant, allowing us to study the circumgalactic media (CGM) of the host galaxies. We select a sample of five local universe FRBs whose host interstellar medium (ISM) DM is negligible and use these to constrain the mass of the CGM in each halo. We find that one of our sources, the only massive elliptical host galaxy, has been evacuated of its baryons ($M_\mathrm{gas}=0.02^{+0.02}_{-0.02}M_\mathrm{h}$, corresponding to $\sim$10$\%$ of the cosmological average $\frac{\Omega_b}{\Omega_m}$). This galaxy shows evidence of a past episode of AGN activity, consistent with the picture of strong AGN feedback in galaxy group-scale halos. The other sources are consistent with existing multiwavelength data and tentatively support more baryon retention in $L_*$ galaxies compared to group-scale halos. We show that FRBs can measure the halo gas fraction $f_\mathrm{gas}$ in halos of mass $M_\mathrm{h}\sim10^{11-13}M_\odot$, and up to $\sim10^{14}M_\odot$ if galaxy cluster hosts are included, which is a larger range than other gas probes can access. Finally, we demonstrate that a large sample of local universe FRBs, such as those expected from upcoming all-sky radio telescopes, will enable precision measurements of halo gas, which is crucial for understanding the effects of feedback.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16808" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytical Estimates of Gravitational Wave Background Anisotropies from Shot Noise and Large-Scale Structure in Pulsar Timing Arrays</a><span class="id">[2602.16808]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>An important next step for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is to measure anisotropies in the gravitational wave background (GWB) at $\sim$ nano-Hz frequencies. We calculate the expected GWB anisotropies using empirically calibrated models for the merger rates of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The anisotropies reflect both shot-noise in the discrete SMBHB populations while also tracing, in part, the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The shot-noise term is sensitive to the high-mass end of the merging SMBH mass function, depends somewhat on the low-redshift tail of the merger distribution, and is a strong function of observing frequency. The precise frequency dependence provides a test of SMBHB residence times. In our models, the mean shot-noise anisotropy typically lies close to or above the broad frequency-band NANOGrav upper limits. Consequently, near-future PTA data, and potentially re-analyses of existing measurements using frequency-dependent shot-noise anisotropy templates, should be capable of detecting this signal or placing meaningful constraints on SMBHB merger models. A full interpretation, however, will require modeling the probability distribution of shot-noise amplitudes rather than relying solely on ensemble-averaged predictions. The LSS-induced anisotropies are at least two to three orders of magnitude smaller. Although the LSS contribution contains valuable information regarding the redshift distribution and clustering bias of the merging SMBHBs, detecting this component will be challenging.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray Spectral-Timing Properties of Tidal Disruption Events</a><span class="id">[2602.16868]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform the first systematic study of the minute-to-hours-timescale stochastic variability observed in the X-ray luminosity of tidal disruption events (TDEs) using XMM-Newton data and Fourier analysis methods. We measure the spectral properties, power spectral densities (PSDs), fractional variability amplitudes, and energy dependence of the variability for 18 TDEs spanning 54 observations, of which 27 occur in thermal disk-dominated states and 27 show a nonthermal hard X-ray corona. Compared to pure thermal sources, we find TDEs with coronae are more X-ray variable and show steeper PSDs indicating longer correlation timescales. This state-transition behavior is qualitatively similar to X-ray binaries, which show higher fractional variability in the hard state than in the soft state. However, newborn TDE coronae show systematically flatter PSDs and softer energy spectra than their long-lived AGN counterparts. We also show that the variability amplitude of thermal TDEs increases with photon energy, consistent with variations sourced by local temperature fluctuations and exponentially enhanced in the Wien tail. Our work demonstrates that combining spectral and timing properties of X-ray TDEs can probe the microphysics of newly formed accretion flows around supermassive black holes, and that the coronae formed in TDEs fundamentally differ from those in AGN.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Paternity Tests: Matching High-Latitude B Stars to the Open Clusters of their Birth</a><span class="id">[2602.16925]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>OB stars generally form in open clusters within the Milky Way's thin disk, so when they are found at high Galactic latitudes, it is thought that they were ejected from their birth clusters during the past few tens of millions of years. Using Gaia Data Release 3 (hereafter DR3) data, we traced the kinematic trajectories of 39 high-latitude B-type stars and 447 Galactic open clusters with high-quality astrometry to search for moments of past intersection. In cases where we found matching trajectories, we also considered the clusters' HR diagrams to confirm parent-orphan pairs have matching ages. Further analysis of the clusters' core environments allowed us to determine a probable ejection mechanism. Through these paternity tests, we have identified possible origins for five of these orphaned B-type stars. Here we present the likely travel times, ejection velocities, and a discussion of the runaway mechanism for each case. We also identify one star whose trajectory did not bring it near the disk during the time period of our analysis, and we discuss its possible origins as well.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Varstrometry for Off-nucleus and Dual Subkiloparsec AGN (VODKA): Three Quadruply Lensed Quasars at Cosmic Noon in HST and JWST</a><span class="id">[2602.16995]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from imaging observations of three quadruply lensed quasars by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at redshifts $z = 2.550$, 2.975, and 1.500. We model our targets assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile and an elliptical SÃ\c{opyright}rsic profile for the lensing galaxies, and reconstruct the geometric configuration of each system with measured Einstein radii of 0.44$'$, 0.58$'$, and 0.49$'$. While no spectroscopic measurements are available for the lenses, we constrain the redshift of each lens to $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.2$, $1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$, and $0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.9$. For all three lenses, the best-fit light model yield a typical de Vaucouleurs $n_{\rm S\acute{e}rsic} \sim 4$ profile and an effective radius $R_e$ around $\sim 1.5 - 3.5$ kpc. We accordingly classify the three lenses as early-type galaxies at an intermediate to high redshift, a common type for strong lensing galaxies. Compared to other known quadruple lenses, the lensing galaxies in this work are at the lower end of the distribution of Einstein radii and upper end of the distribution of the lens redshifts. They represent an interesting quadrant of subarcsecond-separation lenses in the population of single-galaxy strong lensing which have been largely unexplored yet and will be great targets of interest in upcoming high-resolution lensing surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Under Pressure: UV Emission Line Ratios as Barometers of AGN Feedback Mechanisms</a><span class="id">[2602.17039]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is widely acknowledged to regulate the growth of massive galaxies, though its driving mechanisms are debated. Prevailing theories suggest that AGN-driven outflows are driven either by radiation pressure acting directly on the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) or by hot winds entraining cooler ISM gas, but the relative contribution of each mechanism remains uncertain. By combining optical emission line measurements with highly ionized UV emission lines, it is possible to constrain whether the pressure source applied to ionized clouds is primarily radiation or primarily hydrodynamic, and thus constrain the dominant driver. This study presents the first multi-object analysis of far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra from galactic-scale AGN-driven outflows in obscured quasars, based on Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations of five low-redshift targets. By comparing narrow-line region UV emission line ratios to theoretical models that vary the importance of the two pressure sources, we find three out of five targets fall within the radiation pressure-dominated regime. A fourth target exhibits intermediate emission-line ratios that suggest radiation pressure and pressure from a hot wind are both dynamically important. Finally, the lowest-luminosity object in our sample may have a dynamically important hot wind component, but non-detections prevent a clear conclusion in this case. These results suggest radiation pressure dominates circum-nuclear narrow-line region cloud dynamics, but pressure from a hot wind also plays a role in some cases. This is consistent with AGN feedback scenarios mediated by radiation pressure or a short-lived hot wind phase that dissipates after initially accelerating outflows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PRODIGE - envelope to disk with NOEMA: VII. (Complex) organic molecules in the NGC1333 IRAS4B1 outflow: A new laboratory for shock chemistry</a><span class="id">[2602.17177]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Shock chemistry is an excellent tool to shed light on the formation and destruction mechanisms of complex organic molecules (COMs). The L1157-mm outflow is the only low-mass protostellar outflow that has extensively been studied in this regard. Using the data taken as part of the PRODIGE (PROtostars &amp; DIsks: Global Evolution) large program, we aim to map COM emission and derive the molecular composition of the protostellar outflow driven by the Class 0 protostar NGC1333 IRAS4B1 to introduce it as a new laboratory to study the impact of shocks on COM chemistry. In addition to typical outflow tracers such as SiO and CO, outflow emission is seen from H2CO, HNCO, and HC3N, as well as from the COMs CH3OH, CH3CN, and CH3CHO, and even from deuterated species such as DCN, D2CO, and CH2DOH. Maps of integrated intensity ratios between CH3OH and DCN, D2CO, and CH3CHO reveal gradients with distance from the protostar. Intensity ratio maps of HC3N and CH3CN with respect to CH3OH peak in the southern lobe where temperatures are highest. Rotational temperatures derived towards two positions, one in each lobe, are found in the range  50-100 K. Abundances with respect to CH3OH are higher by factors of a few than for the L1157-B1. In conclusion, for the first time, we securely detected the COMs CH3CN, CH3CHO, and CH2DOH in the IRAS 4B1 outflow, serendipitously with limited sensitivity and bandwidth. Targeted observations will enable the discovery of new COMs and a more detailed analysis of their emission. Morphological differences between molecules in the IRAS 4B1 outflow lobes and their relative abundances provide first proof that this outflow is a promising new laboratory for shock chemistry, which will offer crucial information on COM formation and destruction as well as outflow structure and kinematics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deeper detection limits in astronomical imaging using self-supervised spatiotemporal denoising</a><span class="id">[2602.17205]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection limit of astronomical imaging observations is limited by several noise sources. Some of that noise is correlated between neighbouring image pixels and exposures, so in principle could be learned and corrected. We present an astronomical self-supervised transformer-based denoising algorithm (ASTERIS), that integrates spatiotemporal information across multiple exposures. Benchmarking on mock data indicates that ASTERIS improves detection limits by 1.0 magnitude at 90% completeness and purity, while preserving the point spread function and photometric accuracy. Observational validation using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Subaru telescope identifies previously undetectable features, including low-surface-brightness galaxy structures and gravitationally-lensed arcs. Applied to deep JWST images, ASTERIS identifies three times more redshift &gt; 9 galaxy candidates, with rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity 1.0 magnitude fainter, than previous methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Epoch of Reionization 21 cm Bispectrum at $z=8.2$ from MWA data II: Smooth Component Filtering</a><span class="id">[2602.17304]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 21 cm bispectrum (BS) offers a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), but its observational access is severely hindered by dominant astrophysical foregrounds. Considering Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $154.2~\mathrm{MHz}$ ($z=8.2$), we mitigate the foregrounds with Smooth Component Filtering (SCF) and estimate the 21 cm BS. We validate the pipeline using a simulated 21 cm signal and show that the input BS is recovered for modes $k_{\parallel} \ge [k_\parallel]_f=0.135~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Applied to actual data, the SCF produces substantial foreground suppression, reducing the amplitude of the cylindrical BS $B(k_{1\perp},k_{2\perp},k_{3\perp},k_{1\parallel},k_{2\parallel})$ by $3-4$ orders of magnitude. The artifacts due to the missing frequency channels in the data are also suppressed. The resulting EoR window is significantly cleaner at small $k_{\perp}$. We adopt the region $(k_{1 \perp},k_{2 \perp},k_{3 \perp})\leq 0.026~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $(k_{1\parallel},k_{2\parallel},k_{3\parallel})&gt;0.135~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ to evaluate the 3D spherical BS and constrain the EoR signal. By combining estimates over all triangle shapes, we place the lower and upper limits on the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations $\Delta^3$. The estimates are consistent with statistical fluctuations from system noise. The most stringent lower limit $\Delta^3_{\rm LL}=-(1.25\times 10^4)^3~{\rm mK}^3$ and upper limit $\Delta^3_{\rm UL}=(1.22\times 10^4)^3~{\rm mK}^3$ are obtained at $k_1=0.281~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Additional observing time will reduce the noise level and enable substantially tighter constraints on the EoR signal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIDIS: The identification of deep MIRI-red sources as candidates for extreme Balmer-break and line emitting galaxies at high-z</a><span class="id">[2602.17329]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the detection and nature of 5.6 \mu m MIRI-red sources in the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS), covering 2.4 arcmin$^2$ in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. MIDIS is the deepest JWST/MIRI survey to date, probing faint limits and enabling studies of rare high-redshift galaxy populations. We define MIRI-red sources as those detected at 5$\sigma$ significance in MIRI/F560W with red colors: $m_{\rm F444W} - m_{\rm F560W} \ge 0.5$. Using an empirical methodology, we estimate the purity and completeness of MIRI detections and find that a 5-sigma detection at 28.75 mag has a purity of 92\% and completeness of 54\%. We identify seven MIRI-red galaxy candidates, including an F115W dropout consistent with a high-redshift galaxy candidate. We explore possible physical origins for the MIRI-red population, including active galactic nuclei, dust-obscured galaxies, extreme emission-line galaxies, evolved stellar populations, and Little Red Dots (LRDs). Given the proximity of the F444W and F560W filters and the depth of MIDIS, MIRI-red galaxies are consistent with emission-line galaxies with $EW_0(H\alpha) \ge 750$ Å or $EW_0(H\beta + [OIII]) \ge 600$ Å, or high-redshift Balmer breaks of at least 1.6. We also discuss an extreme MIRI-red galaxy undetected in F444W, a potential MIRI-only source, for which we derive $EW_0(H\alpha) \sim 6000$ Å and $EW_0(H\beta + [OIII]) \sim 4000$ Å, or high-$z$ LRD analogs with Balmer breaks of 6.3. Finally, we find fewer MIRI-red detections than expected from extrapolations of the H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$+[OIII] line luminosity functions, consistent with previous deep searches, while the absence of $z&gt;10$ LRD candidates agrees with theoretical expectations for the MIDIS volume.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Modelling of Galactic Kinematics using Neural Networks</a><span class="id">[2602.17371]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The advent of integral field data has revolutionised the study of galaxy evolution. A key component of this is dynamical modelling methods which have allowed for crucial insights to be made from kinematic data. Despite this importance, most dynamical models make a number of key assumptions which do not hold for real galaxies. These include assumptions about the geometry (axisymmetry or triaxiality), the shape of the velocity ellipsoid, and the shape of the underlying stellar distribution. At the same time, machine learning methods are becoming increasingly powerful, with many applications appearing in astronomy. As a first step towards building new dynamical modelling methods with machine learning, it is important to understand the types of machine learning architectures that are best fit for dynamical modelling. To investigate this, we construct a training set of dynamical models of early-type galaxies using Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM). We then train a neural network on this data using the parameters of JAM and mock photometry as the input. We are able to accurately model JAM galaxies with relatively simple machine learning architectures, leading to a significant speed increase over traditional JAM modelling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lithium as a probe of stellar and galactic physics</a><span class="id">[2602.17470]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Lithium plays a unique role in astrophysics, as it is a powerful diagnostic for the physics and evolution of low-mass stars, Galactic archaeology, and cosmology.

Key takeaways from the current state of the research in the field are: 1) Stellar evolution models accounting for fundamental transport processes of chemical species and angular momentum hold the promise of providing a common stellar Li depletion explanation to the Li abundance patterns observed in all Galactic stellar populations, including the dip and the plateau(s). 2) Novae are most probably the main source of Li in the Galaxy, on observational (but not yet theoretically established) grounds. 3) Radial migration of stars in the Galactic disk holds the key to understand many aspects of the Li evolution in the Milky Way.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UV slopes of Starforming Galaxies in Strong Lensing fields at the Epoch of Reionization with JWST</a><span class="id">[2602.17499]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>UV slopes ($\beta$) are a powerful diagnostics for galaxies at the Epoch of Reionization, tracing star formation, ISM ionization, and the escape fraction $f_{esc}$ of ionizing photons. Studies at low and intermediate z find a gradual $\beta$ reddening with time and steeper slopes for fainter galaxies, however recent JWST studies reveal a flattening of this trend at $z&gt;7$. We want measure $\beta$ for galaxies at $z&gt;7.5$ using the strong lensing around massive galaxy clusters to observe high-redshift and faint galaxies. The low-brightness regime is of particular interest for reionization, as most of the recent models of this process posit that numerous faint galaxies are the prime drivers of reionization. We use NIRCam and NIRSpec data from CANUCS, Technicolor, JUMPS, Silver Bullet, UNCOVER and MEGASCIENCE across 7 strong lensing fields. We find galaxies down to $M_{UV}\sim-16$ and 7.5&lt;z&lt;12.5. We measure \b{eta} with a forward-modelling procedure and estimate $f_{esc}$ for a subsample with emission line data using a relation, calibrated from a low-z sample, with UV slope, galaxy size and H$\beta$ equivalent width. We find 378 galaxies (45 with spectrum), yielding average values $\beta=-2.3\pm0.4$, $z=8.5\pm1.0$, and $M_{UV}=-18\pm1$. We find no significant $\beta$ evolution across our redshift range, suggesting a flattening of the $\beta-z$ trend above $z\sim7.5$. We find a weak negative trend between $\beta$ and $M_{UV}$. For 14 galaxies we estimate an average $f_{esc}=0.26\pm0.22$. The flat trend of $\beta$ at $z&gt;7.5$ suggests similar properties between $300$ and $600 Myr$ after the Big Bang. The weak trend between $\beta$ and $M_{UV}$ suggests an analogous composition for low- and high-mass galaxies' ISM, likely due to a lack of time for dust buildup. While average $f_{esc}$ is higher than necessary to ionize the IGM by z 6, the model extrapolated at low-z may overestimate its value.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interstellar Formation of Thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS). Gas-Phase and Ice-Surface Mechanisms involving Secondary Sulfur Products</a><span class="id">[2602.17551]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formation pathways of sulfur-bearing species in the interstellar medium are crucial to understand astrochemical processes in cold molecular clouds and to gain new insights about the sulfur budget in these regions. We aim to explore the recently detected, thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS) formation mechanisms from thioethanol (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH) as a precursor in addition to secondary sulfur products. The electronic structure methods and density functional theory for both gas-phase and ice-grain surface environments is employed. To mimic interstellar ice-mantles, we use medium (W6) and large amorphized (W22) water clusters as implemented in Binding Energy Evaluation protocol. A barrierless formation mechanism for CH$_{3}$CHS under low-temperature interstellar conditions is identified, in the gas phase. Surface environments modulate activation barriers in a site-specific manner, elucidated through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal initiated surface reaction pathways. Compared to oxygen analogs, sulfur chemistry enables alternate pathways due to weaker S-H bonding, with a competing route forming ethane-1,1-di-thiol (CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH), on the ice-grain surface, potentially reducing CH$_{3}$CHS yields. The first accurate binding energy for thioethanol on water ice is also reported, confirming its greater volatility than ethanol. The proposed mechanism offers a tentative hypothesis for the apparent mutual exclusive detections of the CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH and CH$_{3}$CHS in TMC-1, Orion, and Sgr B2(N), that further requires validation through quantitative astrochemical modeling and also to distinguish this chemical differentiation from observational sensitivity limitations. These qualitative findings highlight the multifaceted chemical behavior of sulfur-bearing organics in the interstellar medium and support CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH as promising astro-chemical targets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The spectral state transition of Mkn 590, a potential link between AGNs and X-ray binaries?</a><span class="id">[2602.17572]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Seyfert galaxy Markarian 590 offers a rare glimpse into the dynamic life cycle of black hole accretion, captured across multiple wavelengths from the years 1975 to 2025. Using the decade-long multi-band observations from the Swift observatory, we capture a clear spectral state transition analogous to those seen in X-ray binaries but seldom observed in a single AGN. We track a complete AGN state transition in real time, as the source evolves from a faint, hard X-ray state to a bright, UV- and soft X-ray dominated phase. The X-ray loudness parameter $\alpha_{ox}$ follows a pronounced 'V'-shaped dependence on Eddington ratio $\lambda_{Edd}$, with a break at $\lambda_{Edd}$ = 0.021 +/- 0.008, coinciding with thresholds identified in population studies of changing-look quasars and X-ray binaries. Across this transition, Mkn 590 evolves through distinct accretion regimes in the Hardness Intensity Diagrams (HID): faint, flaring, transitional, and bright, on a timescale of $\sim$10 years, which is well below classical viscous timescales for a geometrically thin disk but in agreement with the propagation of thermal wavefronts in the inner disk. When placed on the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, the source broadly follows the expected radio/X-ray mass scaling, though with a 70% flatter slope, pointing towards a persistent coronal-jet coupling even in radiatively efficient states. Together, our results establish Mkn 590 as a rare, time-resolved case of AGN state transitions and offer compelling evidence for scale-invariant accretion physics across the black hole mass spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MUSEQuBES: Probing Anisotropies in Gas and Metal Distributions in the Circumgalactic Medium</a><span class="id">[2602.17593]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the azimuthal dependence of H I and O VI-bearing gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of 113 isolated galaxies in the redshift range 0.12 &lt; z &lt; 0.75, including 91 new measurements from the MUSE Quasar-fields Blind Emitters Survey (MUSEQuBES).

In contrast, such a bimodal distribution is not observed for higher mass galaxies (9 &lt; log10(M*/Msun) &lt; 11.3). Similarly, the O VI covering fraction (k_OVI), for a threshold of log10(N(OVI)/cm^-2) = 14.0, shows a tentative enhancement along both the projected major and minor axes for low-mass galaxies. In contrast, O VI-bearing gas around higher- mass galaxies appears more uniformly distributed, with no significant azimuthal dependence. Finally, using the halo circular-velocity-normalized pixel-velocity two-point correlation function (TPCF), we find that O VI absorbers are kinematically narrower along the disk plane compared to the polar directions of the host galaxies with similar stellar mass distributions. The observed isotropic distribution of O VI in high-mass halos suggests that its spatial distribution is governed by global halo properties; however, the O VI kinematics retain memory of the site of origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17652" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Chemodynamical Census of the Milky Way's Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites.

Very little is known about the nature and origins of this population of &quot;Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites&quot; (UFCSs) owing to a dearth of spectroscopic measurements. Here, we present the first spectroscopic census of these compact systems based on Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations of 19 individual UFCSs, representing $\sim$2/3 of the known population. We securely measure mean radial velocities for all 19 systems, velocity dispersions for 15 (predominantly upper limits), metallicities for 17, metallicity dispersions for 8, and $\textit{Gaia}$-based mean proper motions for 18. This large new spectroscopic sample provides the first insights into population-level trends for these extreme satellites. We demonstrate that: (1) the UFCSs are kinematically colder, on average, than the UFDs, disfavoring very dense dark matter halos in most cases, (2) the UFCS population is chemically diverse, spanning a factor of $\sim$300 in mean iron abundance ($\rm -3.3 \lesssim [Fe/H] \lesssim -0.8$), with multiple systems falling beneath the &quot;metallicity floor&quot; proposed for GCs, and (3) while some higher-metallicity and/or younger UFCSs are clearly star clusters, the dynamical and/or chemical evidence allows the possibility that up to $\sim$50% of the UFCSs in our sample (9 of 19) may represent the smallest and least-massive galaxies yet discovered.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peculiar dark matter halos inferred from gravitational lensing as a manifestation of modified gravity</a><span class="id">[2408.02725]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>If modified gravity holds, but the weak lensing analysis is done in the standard way, one finds that dark matter halos have peculiar shapes, not following the standard Navarro-Frenk-White profiles, and are fully predictable from the distribution of baryons. Here we study in detail the distribution of the apparent dark matter around point masses, which approximate galaxies and galaxy clusters, and their pairs for the QUMOND MOND gravity, taking an external gravitational acceleration $g_e$ into account. At large radii, the apparent halo of a point mass $M$ is shifted against the direction of the external field. When averaged over all lines-of-sight, the halo has a hollow center, and denoting the by $a_0$ the MOND acceleration constant, its density behaves like $\rho(r)=\sqrt{Ma_0/G}/(4\pi r^2)$ between the galacticentric radii $\sqrt{GM/a_0}$ and $\sqrt{GMa_0}/g_e$, and like $\rho\propto r^{-7}G^2M^3a_0^3/g_e^5$ further away. Between a pair of point masses, there is a region of a negative apparent dark matter density, whose mass can exceed the baryonic mass of the system. The density of the combined dark matter halo is not a sum of the densities of the halos of the individual points. The density has a singularity near the zero-acceleration point, but remains finite in projection. We compute maps of the surface density and the lensing shear for several configurations of the problem, and derive formulas to scale them to further configurations. In general, for a large subset of MOND theories in their weak field regime, for any configuration of the baryonic mass $M$ with the characteristic size of $d$, the total lensing density scales as $\rho({\vec{x}})=\sqrt{Ma_0/G}d^{-2}f\left(\vec{\alpha},\vec{x}/d,g_ed/\sqrt{GMa_0}\right)$, where the vector $\vec{\alpha}$ describes the geometry of the system. Distinguishing between QUMOND and cold dark matter seems possible with the existing instruments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measurements of the Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect with ACT and DESI Luminous Red Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2502.08850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons scatter off the free-electron gas in galaxies and clusters, allowing us to use the CMB as a backlight to probe the gas in and around low-redshift galaxies. The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, sourced by hot electrons in high-density environments, measures the thermal pressure of the target objects, shedding light on halo thermodynamics and galaxy formation and providing a path toward understanding the baryon distribution around cosmic structures. We use a combination of high-resolution CMB maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and photometric luminous red galaxy (LRG) catalogues from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to measure the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal in four redshift bins from $z=0.4$ to $z=1.2$, with a combined detection significance of 19$\sigma$ when stacking on the fiducial CMB Compton-$y$ map. We discuss possible sources of contamination, finding that residual dust emission associated with the target galaxies is important and limits current analyses. We discuss several mitigation strategies and quantify the residual modelling uncertainty.

They are often used for testing different dark matter and modified gravity theories, because it is difficult to reconcile their old stellar ages with the short time they need to settle in the center of the galaxy due to dynamical friction. Using high resolution $N$-body simulations with the Phantom of Ramses code, we investigate whether the GCs of Fornax can be reconciled with the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), namely its QUMOND formulation. Observational data interpreted in MOND indicate that Fornax is a tidal dwarf galaxy formed at redshift $z=0.9$ in a flyby of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda galaxies, and that its GCs were initially massive star clusters in the disk of the MW. This helps us to set up and interpret the simulations. In the simulations, a point-mass GC orbits Fornax, and they both orbit the MW. When we ran multiple simulations with varying initial conditions for the GC, we found a 20% probability of Fornax being observed with five unsunk GCs. The unsunk GCs have the observed radial distribution. Moreover, we found: 1) In MOND, Fornax has an orbit around the MW such that the pericenters coincide with the observed peaks in the star formation history of Fornax; 2) The simulations reproduce the observed “diffuse stellar halo” of Fornax; 3) The simulations predict that Fornax has a stellar stream, which could be detectable in the existing data. 4) An extra simulation shows that if Fornax was initially a rotating disky tidal dwarf galaxy, the gravitational influence of the MW would be able to transform it into a nonrotating spheroidal. 5) Sometimes Phantom of Ramses does not conserve angular momentum. This makes the GC sink too fast if it is simulated as an $N$-body object.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Three Hundred Project: deducing the stellar splashback structure of galaxy clusters from their orbiting profiles</a><span class="id">[2508.07232]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine the splashback structure of galaxy clusters using hydrodynamical simulations from the GIZMO run of The Three Hundred Project, focusing on the relationship between the stellar and dark matter components.

We find that the truncation radius $r_{\mathrm{t}}$, associated with the splashback feature, coincides for stars and dark matter, but the stellar profile exhibits a systematically steeper decline. Both components follow a consistent $r_{\mathrm{t}}{-}\Gamma$ relation, where $\Gamma$ is the mass accretion rate, which suggests that stellar profiles can be used to infer recent cluster mass growth. We also find that the normalisation of the density profile of infalling material correlates with $\Gamma$, and that stellar and dark matter scale radii coincide when measured non-parametrically. By fitting stellar profiles in projection, we show that $r_{\mathrm{t}}$ can, in principle, be recovered observationally, with a typical scatter of $\sim 0.3\,R_{200\mathrm{m}}$.

In gravitational imaging, strong gravitational lens observations are used to detect individual objects from this population, if they are large enough to perturb the strongly lensed images. We show here that low-mass haloes, below the individually detectable mass limit, have a detectable effect on the lensed images when in large numbers, which is the case in cold dark matter (CDM). We find that, in CDM, this population causes an excess of 40 per cent in the number of detected subhaloes for HST-like strong lens observations. We propose a pseudo-mass function to describe this population, and fit for its parameters from the detection data. We find that it mostly consists of objects two orders of magnitude in mass below the detection limit of individual objects. We show that including this modification, so that the effect of the population is correctly predicted, can improve the available constraints on dark matter from strong lens observations. We repeat our experiments using models that contain varying amounts of angular structure in the lens galaxy. We find that these multipole perturbations are degenerate with the population signal. This further highlights the need for better understanding of the angular mass structure of lens galaxies, so that the maximum information can be extracted from strong lens observations for dark matter inference.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OzDES Reverberation Mapping of Active Galactic Nuclei: Final Data Release, Black-Hole Mass Results, &amp; Scaling Relations</a><span class="id">[2512.01261]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the last decade, the Australian Dark Energy (OzDES) collaboration has used Reverberation Mapping to measure the masses of high redshift supermassive black holes. Here we present the final review and analysis of this OzDES reverberation mapping campaign. These observations use 6-7 years of photometric and spectroscopic observations of 735 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the redshift range 0.13-3.85 and bolometric luminosity range 44.3 - 47.5 erg/s. Both photometry and spectra are observed in visible wavelengths, allowing for the physical scale of the AGN broad line region to be estimated from reverberations of the H\b{eta}, MgII and CIV emission lines. We successfully use reverberation mapping to constrain the masses of 62 super-massive black holes, and combine with existing data to fit a power law to the lag-luminosity relation for the H\b{eta} and MgII lines with a scatter of  0.25 dex, the tightest yet identified, fit specifically for consistency with high redshift AGN. We fit a similarly constrained relation for CIV, resolving a tension with the low luminosity literature AGN by accounting for selection effects arising from finite survey length. We also examine the impact of emission line width and luminosity (related to accretion rate) in reducing the scatter of these scaling relationships and find no significant improvement over the lag-only approach for any of the three lines. Using these relations, we further estimate the masses and accretion rates of 246 AGN with single epoch methods. We also use these relations to estimate the relative sizes of the H\b{eta}, MgII and CIV emitting regions. In short, we provide a comprehensive benchmark of high redshift AGN reverberation mapping at the close of this most recent generation of surveys, including light curves, time-delays, and a set of significantly improved radius-luminosity relations for use with high-redshift populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Nuclear Star Cluster of M 74: a fossil record of the very early stages of a star-forming galaxy</a><span class="id">[2512.03999]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nuclear star clusters (NSC) are dense and compact stellar systems, of sizes of few parsecs, located at galactic centers. Their properties and formation mechanisms seem to be tightly linked to the evolution of the host galaxy, with potentially different formation channels for late- and early-type galaxies (respectively, LTGs and ETGs). While most observations target ETGs, here we focus on the NSC in M 74 (NGC 628), a relatively massive, gas-rich and star-forming spiral galaxy, part of the PHANGS survey. We analyzed the central arcmin of the PHANGS-MUSE mosaic, in which the NSC is not spatially resolved. We performed a two-dimensional spectro-photometric decomposition of the MUSE cube, employing a modified version of the C2D code, to disentangle the NSC from the host galaxy. Here we used three components: a bulge, a disk and a NSC approximated to the point spread function (PSF), obtaining three data cubes, one for each component. This allowed us to extract separately the age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] abundance for the NSC and the host galaxy. Our results show a very old and metal-poor NSC, in contrast to the surrounding regions. While similar properties were found in NSCs hosted by galaxies of different masses and/or morphological types from M 74, they are somewhat unexpected for a relatively massive star-forming spiral galaxy. The spatially resolved stellar populations of the host galaxy display much younger (light-weighted) ages and higher metallicities, especially in the central region (${\sim}500$ pc) surrounding the NSC. This suggests that this NSC formed a long time ago, and evolved passively until today, without any further growth. Our results show that the NSC was not involved in the active recent star-formation history of its host galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diverse stages of star formation in the IRAS 18162-2048 region.

Results: The near-IR continuum reveals two infrared sources, IRS 2 and IRS 7, while the main protostellar core IRAS 18162-2048 remains undetected up to $2.47 \mathrm{\mu m}$. IRS 7 shows a peculiar Hydrogen Recombination Line Br$\gamma$ profile with a narrow emission component superimposed on a broad absorption feature, consistent with a B2/B3 zero-age main-sequence star. Extended H$_2$ emission exhibits a `sawtooth' pattern in the excitation diagram, characteristic of UV radiation in a PDR rather than shock excitation. The radiative transfer model Cloudy reproduces the H$_2$ ro-vibrational populations for $T_\mathrm{gas}=600$ K and $n_\mathrm{H}=7.9\times10^3 \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. VLA X and C bands observations reveal a compact radio source previously reported as a stationary condensation (SC) and coincident with IRS 7. For the first time, we detect IRS 7/SC in mm wavelengths. The spectral index in the 3$-$6 cm and 3.3 mm regime is consistent with optically thin free-free emission. Conclusions: Our near-IR and radio observations reveal that IRS 7/SC is a B2/B3 ZAMS star that has begun to photoionise its environment, giving rise to an extended PDR and a compact \ion{H}{ii} region. The coexistence of this source with the deeply embedded protostar IRAS 18162-2048 and other bubble-like structures in the field, suggests a multigenerational star-forming environment. Future \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} observations targeting the H$_2$ pure rotational lines ($3-28 \mathrm{\mu m}$) and other HRLs less affected by extinction will be essential to characterise the cooler molecular and ionised gas to fully disclose the formation history of the region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deblending the MIGHTEE-COSMOS survey with XID+: The resolved radio source counts to $S_{1.4}\approx 5μ$Jy</a><span class="id">[2512.09290]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Deep radio continuum surveys provide fundamental constraints on galaxy evolution, but source confusion limits sensitivity to the faintest sources. We present a complete framework for producing high-fidelity deblended radio catalogs from the confused MIGHTEE maps using the probabilistic deblending framework XID+ and prior positions from deep multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field. To assess performance, we construct MIGHTEE-like simulations based on the Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation (T-RECS) radio source population, ensuring a realistic distribution of star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) for validation. Through these simulations, we show that prior catalog purity is the dominant factor controlling deblending accuracy: a high-purity prior, containing only sources with a high likelihood of radio detection, recovers accurate flux densities and reproduces input source counts down to $\sim 3\sigma$ (where $\sigma = $ thermal noise). On the other hand, a complete prior overestimates the source counts due to spurious detections. Our optimal strategy combines the high-purity prior with a mask that removes sources detected above $50~\mu$Jy. Applied to the $\sim$1.3 deg$^2$ area of the MIGHTEE-COSMOS field defined by overlapping multi-wavelength data, this procedure yields a deblended catalog of 89,562 sources. The derived 1.4 GHz source counts agree with independent P(D) analyses and indicate that we resolve the radio background to $\sim 4.8\,\mu$Jy. We also define a recommended high-fidelity sample of 20,757 sources, based on detection significance, flux density, and goodness-of-fit, which provides reliable flux densities for individual sources in the confusion-limited regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClearPotential: Revealing Local Dark Matter in Three Dimensions</a><span class="id">[2512.09989]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present ClearPotential, a data-driven, three-dimensional measurement of the gravitational potential of the local Milky Way using unsupervised machine learning, without the symmetry assumptions, specific functional forms, and binning required in previous work.

This density is obtained from data using normalizing flows, and our unsupervised solution to the Boltzmann equation automatically corrects for selection effects from crowding and the dust-driven extinction of starlight. Our fully-differentiable model of the gravitational potential allows us to map the acceleration and mass density of the Galaxy in the volume around the Sun, including in the dust-obscured disk towards the Galactic Center.

From these diagnostics we define a typology of ONC disks. \textit{Type I} sources show merged IFs and DFs close to the disk surface. \textit{Type II} sources have DFs at the disk surface and IFs located tens of astronomical units away. \textit{Type III} sources show a DF at the disk surface but no IF. For all types, PAH emission traces the PDR. We find that the disk radius $r{\rm disk}$ increases with projected distance to the ionizing source $d{\rm proj}$, following $r{\rm disk} \propto d{\rm proj}^{0.30}$, consistent with disk truncation by photoevaporation. Disk radii measured in the infrared are larger than those measured at millimeter wavelengths, suggesting radial dust segregation within the disks. In agreement with PDR models, the thermal pressure in the disk PDR increases with the FUV radiation field $G_0$, but with a flatter slope. Finally, the SEDs of candidate Jupiter Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) are similar to those of \textit{Type III} disks, except for JuMBO24, which resembles a \textit{Type I} or \textit{Type II} source.

To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable. Allowed domains in the parameter space of the jet precession around M87$^\ast$ are displayed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What does a regular star look like?</a><span class="id">[2602.12200]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, astronomers discovered unusual Einstein cross images of the galaxy HerS-3, which feature a bright central spot. Motivated by studies of images produced by regular stars, it has been proposed that optical appearances caused by compact stars acting as gravitational lenses may account for this central bright spot. We further suggest that images produced by regular stars exhibit additional characteristics distinct from those of ordinary black holes, such as the possible partial or complete absence of secondary images. These phenomena may serve as favorable observational criteria for identifying regular stars in future searches.</p></div></details></article>

Many are anticipated to be detectable hours to weeks before coalescence. We present a fast algorithm for the pre-merger detection and preliminary characterization of such binaries. The method performs a search for excess power with a chirping time-frequency morphology in short-time Fourier transform spectrograms. By tiling the time-frequency plane with slices defined by the quadrupole frequency evolution, we define a signal significance relative to a fitted background distribution of instrumental noise and Galactic foreground. Individual search triggers are followed by a coherence tracker, which groups over time triggers consistent with the same physical signal . Doing so, our analysis provides progressively refined estimates of the chirp mass and coalescence time. We validate our algorithm on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset, successfully detecting all 15 injected MBHBs: 14 of them hours-to-weeks before merger, while one is only detected after the binary coalescence. The algorithm yields chirp mass relative errors below $3\%$ for high-SNR sources and coalescence time uncertainties of up to a few hours. With a computational cost of less than a second to process a 10-day data segment on single core, our approach is suitable for generating real-time alerts, trigger protected observational periods, and provide informative priors for Bayesian parameter estimation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16946" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Status of the STIS Auto-wavecal Exposures</a><span class="id">[2602.16946]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We discuss the behavior of the default “wavecal” spectra obtained together with most STIS spectroscopic exposures, which are needed for proper wavelength calibration of the science data. Because the Pt/Cr-Ne lamps used for the wavecals have been fading (especially at the shortest wavelengths), some changes in the default lamp and/or exposure time have been implemented in recent years to maintain accurate calibrations. To assess whether additional changes might be appropriate, we examine the distribution of the SHIFTA1, SHIFTA2 values derived from the wavecals (the x and y offsets of the spectral image on the detector), we re-visit the wavelength-dependent fading of the lamps, and we perform simulations to estimate the exposure times that would be needed to obtain accurate SHIFTA values. While the current wavecals do appear to yield reasonable SHIFTA, increases in the default exposure times for some of the shortest-wavelength settings would help to ensure reliable wavelength zero points as the lamps continue to fade.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kolmogorov analysis of pulsar TOA</a><span class="id">[2602.17188]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter (KSP) as a sensitive descriptor of degree of randomness of signals is used to analyze the properties of the NANOGrav pulsar timing data associated to a stochastic gravitational wave background. The time of arrival (TOA) data of white noise for 68 pulsars are analyzed regarding their KSP properties. The analysis enables to obtain the degree of randomness of the white noise for various pulsars and to reveal its inhomogeneity, i.e. pulsars with low and high randomness of the white noise. The time-dependence of the randomness in the white noise is also studied, indicating the existence of non-stationary physical processes influencing the pulsar timing. The KSP thus is acting as an indicator for the degree of the agreement between the observations and the timing models and as a test in revealing the contribution of various physical processes in the stochastic background signal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16831" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Low-Thrust Trajectory Optimization for Cubesat Lunar Mission: HORYU-VI</a><span class="id">[2602.16831]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents a low-thrust trajectory optimization strategy to achieve a near-circular lunar orbit for a CubeSat injected into a lunar flyby trajectory. The 12U CubeSat HORYU-VI is equipped with four Hall-effect thrusters and designed as a secondary payload on NASA's Space Launch System under the Artemis program. Upon release, the spacecraft gains sufficient energy to escape the Earth-Moon system after a lunar flyby. The proposed trajectory is decomposed into three phases: (1) pre-flyby deceleration to avoid heliocentric escape, (2) lunar gravitational capture, and (3) orbit circularization to the science orbit. For each phase, an impulsive-burn solution is first computed as an initial guess, which is then refined through finite-burn optimization using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). The dynamical model incorporates Earth-Moon-Sun-Jupiter gravitational interactions and a high-fidelity lunar gravity field. All trajectories are independently verified with NASA's General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT). Results demonstrate that HORYU-VI achieves lunar capture within 200 days, establishes a stable science orbit at 280 days, and can spiral down to a near-circular 100 km orbit by 450 days, using a total Delta-V of 710 m/s, well within the capability of the electric propulsion system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17085" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ComptonUNet: A Deep Learning Model for GRB Localization with Compton Cameras under Noisy and Low-Statistic Conditions</a><span class="id">[2602.17085]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic transient phenomena in the universe and serve as powerful probes for high-energy astrophysical processes. In particular, faint GRBs originating from a distant universe may provide unique insights into the early stages of star formation. However, detecting and localizing such weak sources remains challenging owing to low photon statistics and substantial background noise. Although recent machine learning models address individual aspects of these challenges, they often struggle to balance the trade-off between statistical robustness and noise suppression. Consequently, we propose ComptonUNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that jointly processes raw data and reconstructs images for robust GRB localization. ComptonUNet was designed to operate effectively under conditions of limited photon statistics and strong background contamination by combining the statistical efficiency of direct reconstruction models with the denoising capabilities of image-based architectures. We perform realistic simulations of GRB-like events embedded in background environments representative of low-Earth orbit missions to evaluate the performance of ComptonUNet. Our results demonstrate that ComptonUNet significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving improved localization accuracy across a wide range of low-statistic and high-background scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17414" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nested Sampling with Slice-within-Gibbs: Efficient Evidence Calculation for Hierarchical Bayesian Models</a><span class="id">[2602.17414]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Nested Sampling with Slice-within-Gibbs (NS-SwiG), an algorithm for Bayesian inference and evidence estimation in high-dimensional models whose likelihood admits a factorization, such as hierarchical Bayesian models. We construct a procedure to sample from the likelihood-constrained prior using a Slice-within-Gibbs kernel: an outer update of hyperparameters followed by inner block updates over local parameters. A likelihood-budget decomposition caches per-block contributions so that each local update checks feasibility in constant time rather than recomputing the global constraint at linearly growing cost. This reduces the per-replacement cost from quadratic to linear in the number of groups, and the overall algorithmic complexity from cubic to quadratic under standard assumptions. The decomposition extends naturally beyond independent observations, and we demonstrate this on Markov-structured latent variables. We evaluate NS-SwiG on challenging benchmarks, demonstrating scalability to thousands of dimensions and accurate evidence estimates even on posterior geometries where state-of-the-art gradient-based samplers can struggle.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17444" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design of low-energy transfers in cislunar space using sequences of lobe dynamics</a><span class="id">[2602.17444]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dynamical structures in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) are fundamental for designing low-energy transfers, as they aid in analyzing phase space transport and designing desirable trajectories. This study focuses on lobe dynamics to exploit local chaotic transport around celestial bodies, and proposes a new method for systematically designing low-energy transfers by combining multiple lobe dynamics. A graph-based framework is constructed to explore possible transfer paths between departure and arrival orbits, reducing the complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem for designing fuel-efficient transfers. Based on this graph, low-energy transfer trajectories are constructed by connecting chaotic orbits within lobes. The resulting optimal trajectory in the Earth–Moon CR3BP is then converted into an optimal transfer in the bicircular restricted four-body problem using multiple shooting. The obtained transfer is compared with existing optimal solutions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05737" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for Lorentz Invariance Violation with spectral lags of GRB 190114C using profile likelihood</a><span class="id">[2506.05737]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We search for Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) by re-analyzing the spectral lag data for GRB 190114C from Fermi-GBM using frequentist analysis, where we deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters using profile likelihood.

The success of such searches depends on a reliable background prediction via Monte Carlo simulations. A widely used toolkit to construct these simulations is Geant4, which offers the user a wide choice of how to implement the physics of particle interactions. For example, for electromagnetic interactions, Geant4 provides pre-defined sets of implementations: physics constructors. As decay products of radioactive contaminants contribute to the background mainly via electromagnetic interactions, the physics constructor used in a Geant4 simulation may have an impact on the total energy deposition inside the detector target. To facilitate the selection of physics constructors for simulations of experiments that are using CaWO$_4$ and Ge targets, we quantify their impact on the total energy deposition for several test cases. These cases consist of radioactive contaminants commonly encountered, covering energy depositions via $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ particles, as well as two examples for the target thickness: thin and bulky. We also consider the computing performance of the studied physics constructors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$\texttt{HostSub_GP}$: Precise Galaxy Background Subtraction in Transient Long-slit Spectroscopy with Gaussian Processes</a><span class="id">[2508.15278]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel host galaxy subtraction technique in long-slit spectroscopy for extragalactic transients. Unlike classic methods which generally estimate the background using a simple linear interpolation of local galaxy flux in the 2D spectrum, our approach leverages multi-band archival images of the host galaxies to model the background emission from the galaxy in the 2D spectrum. Such imaging encodes the wavelength-dependent galaxy profile along the slit, and is readily accessible through wide-field imaging surveys. We construct a smooth prior for the 2D galaxy profile with a Gaussian process (GP) based on these reference images, and use another GP to model the correlated deviations from the prior in the observed spectrum. This enables accurate inference of the galaxy flux blended with the transient. On synthetic long-slit data of a spiral galaxy extracted from a Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer hyper-spectral cube, the GP method remains robust as long as the host galaxy is spatially resolved and consistently outperforms classic methods. We apply the method to archival Keck spectra of two real transients, SN 2019eix and AT 2019qiz, to further demonstrate how the method uniquely recovers weak spectral features amid strong galaxy contamination, enabling refined constraints on the properties of both transients. We have released the software implementation, $\texttt{HostSub_GP}$, a scalable toolkit that leverages $\texttt{JAX}$, with an MIT license.</p></div></details></article></body>
