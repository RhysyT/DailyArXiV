We present a study of the CGM of an isolated dwarf at $z=0.5723$ with a stellar mass of $\approx5\times10^7\rm\,M_{\odot}$ and star-formation rate ($\approx0.05\,\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$) and ISM metallicity ($\rm [O/H]\approx-0.9$) consistent with the star-forming main sequence and mass-metallicity relation. A background quasar sightline with archival UV spectra probes the dwarf's CGM at a projected distance of 28 kpc, corresponding to approximately half of the estimated virial radius. The dwarf's CGM is detected in H I, intermediate metal ions of C III, O III, and O IV, and kinematically broader, highly-ionized O VI, but is undetected in N IV and Ne VIII. Photoionization modeling of the intermediate ions indicates a modest volume-filling factor ($\sim 6\%$ along the sightline or $\sim 2\%$ globally), and a mass of $\sim2\times10^8 {\rm\,M_\odot}$, $\sim4\times$ higher than the dwarf's stellar mass, but $\sim10\times$ less than the highly ionized CGM. The O VI kinematics are comparable to the dwarf's estimated virial velocity, suggesting it is likely associated with cool, photoionized, and volume-filling CGM, with bulk motion or turbulence dominating over thermal pressure. The metallicity inferred for the intermediate ions is $\rm [O/H]=-0.6$, but with low relative abundances of $\rm [C/O]=-0.6$ and $\rm [N/O]&lt;-0.9$. The [N/O] is below levels expected of the dwarf's ISM, but consistent with core-collapse supernova ejecta, suggesting that supernova-enriched gas escaped the dwarf without mixing significantly with ISM enriched in nitrogen from evolved, low-mass stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond the stars: Linking H$α$ sizes, kinematics, and star formation in galaxies at $z\approx 4-6$ with JWST grism surveys and $\texttt{geko}$</a><span class="id">[2510.06315]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding how galaxies assemble their mass during the first billion years of cosmic time is a central goal of extragalactic astrophysics, yet joint constraints on their sizes and kinematics remain scarce. We present one of the first statistical studies of the $\mathrm{H}\alpha$ size-mass relation at high redshift with a sample of 213 galaxies at spectroscopic redshifts of $z\approx 4-6$ from the FRESCO and CONGRESS NIRCam grism surveys. We measure the $\mathrm{H}\alpha$ morphology and kinematics of our sample using the novel forward modelling Bayesian inference tool $\texttt{geko}$, and complement them with stellar continuum sizes in the rest-frame FUV, NUV, and optical, obtained from modelling of imaging data from the JADES survey with $\texttt{Pysersic}$. At $z\approx5$, we find that the average H$\alpha$ sizes are larger than the stellar continuum (FUV, NUV and optical), with $r_{\rm e, H\alpha}= 1.17 \pm 0.05$ kpc and $r_{\rm e,cont} \approx 0.9$ kpc for galaxies with $\log(M_{\star} ~\rm [M_{\odot}])= 9.5$. However, we find no significant differences between the stellar continuum sizes at different wavelengths, suggesting that galaxies are not yet steadily growing inside-out at these epochs. Instead, we find that the ratio $r_{\rm e, H\alpha}/r_{\rm e, NUV}$ increases with the distance above the star-forming main sequence ($\Delta \rm MS$), consistent with an expansion of H$\alpha$ sizes during episodes of enhanced star formation caused by an increase in ionising photons. As galaxies move above the star-forming main sequence, we find an increase of their rotational support $v/\sigma$, which could be tracing accreting gas illuminated by the \Ha\ emission. Finally, we find that about half of the elongated systems ($b/a &lt; 0.5$) are not rotationally supported, indicating a potential flattened/prolate galaxy population at high redshift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Deep Look into the Intermediate-Age Open Cluster NGC 2506: What Binary Systems Reveal About Cluster Distance and Age</a><span class="id">[2510.06320]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using high-precision observations from the space-based \textit{Gaia} and \textit{TESS} missions, complemented by ground-based spectroscopic data and multi-band photometric surveys, we perform a detailed investigation of the Galactic open cluster NGC 2506. We present a new analysis of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 2506, using joint fits to the radial velocities (RVs) and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of five double-lined binary systems, including two eclipsing binaries. The analysis yields self-consistent estimates of the cluster's age, distance, and extinction, based on 18 free parameters: 10 stellar masses, 5 orbital inclinations, and common values for age, distance, and $A_V$. The SED fitting incorporates stellar isochrones, and the resulting parameters are examined through HR diagrams (R–$T_{\rm eff}$, R–M, and M–$T_{\rm eff}$) to assess evolutionary consistency. The age we derive for the cluster is $1.94 \pm 0.03$ Gyr for an assumed [Fe/H] = -0.30, and a fitting formula is given for extrapolation to other metallicities. The distance we find from the SED fitting is $3189 \pm 53$ pc, and this is to be compared with our own inference from the Gaia data which is $3105 \pm 75$ pc, based on 919 stars identified as cluster members. Our results demonstrate the power of binary systems in tightly constraining cluster-wide age and distance at this evolutionary stage. This approach represents one of the most accurate characterizations of an intermediate-age open cluster using multiple binary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comparing XRISM cluster velocity dispersions with predictions from cosmological simulations: are feedback models too ejective?</a><span class="id">[2510.06322]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dynamics of the intra-cluster medium (ICM), the hot plasma that fills galaxy clusters, are shaped by gravity-driven cluster mergers and feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBH) in the cluster cores. XRISM measurements of ICM velocities in several clusters offer insights into these processes. We compare XRISM measurements for nine galaxy clusters (Virgo, Perseus, Centaurus, Hydra A, PKS 0745–19, A2029, Coma, A2319, Ophiuchus) with predictions from three state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suites, TNG-Cluster, The Three Hundred Project GADGET-X, and GIZMO-SIMBA, that employ different models of feedback. In cool cores, XRISM reveals systematically lower velocity dispersions than the simulations predict, with all ten measurements below the median simulated values by a factor $1.5-1.7$ on average and all falling within the bottom $10\%$ of the predicted distributions. The observed kinetic-to-total pressure ratio is also lower, with a median value of $2.2\%$, compared to the predicted $5.0-6.5\%$ for the three simulations. Outside the cool cores and in non-cool-core clusters, simulations show better agreement with XRISM measurements, except for the outskirts of the relaxed, cool-core cluster A2029, which exhibits an exceptionally low kinetic pressure support ($&lt;1\%$), with none of the simulated systems in either of the three suites reaching such low levels. The non-cool-core Coma and A2319 exhibit dispersions at the lower end but within the simulated spread. Our comparison suggests that the three numerical models may overestimate the kinetic effects of SMBH feedback in cluster cores. Additional XRISM observations of non-cool-core clusters will clarify if there is a systematic tension in the gravity-dominated regime as well.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preferential Accretion onto the Secondary Black Hole Strengthens Gravitational Wave Signals</a><span class="id">[2510.06325]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar timing arrays have recently found evidence for nanohertz gravitational waves that are consistent with being produced by a cosmological population of binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, the amplitude of this gravitational wave background is larger than predicted from theoretical and empirical models of SMBH binary populations. We investigate preferential accretion onto the secondary, less massive SMBH of the binary as a potential solution to this discrepancy. We carry out the first observationally-based analysis of the effect of preferential accretion on the SMBH binary population, and we find that preferential accretion onto the secondary SMBH increases the binary SMBH mass ratio, causing many minor galaxy mergers to lead to major SMBH mergers. The fraction of SMBH mergers that are major mergers increases by a factor of 2-3 when preferential accretion is included. Further, we find that only a small amount of preferential accretion (10% total SMBH mass growth) is needed to bring the predicted gravitational wave background amplitude into agreement with observations. Preferential accretion has an even larger effect on gravitational wave signals detected by LISA, which will probe SMBH binaries at higher redshifts where the environment is more gas-rich, and can also help explain the rapid build up of overmassive black holes at high redshifts observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. It also shortens the time to the first detection of an individual SMBH binary emitting continuous waves. Preferential accretion strengthens the gravitational wave signals produced by any binary embedded in a circumbinary disk, including LIGO sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asymmetries in stellar streams induced by a galactic merger</a><span class="id">[2510.06329]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar streams are sensitive to perturbations from, e.g., giant molecular clouds, bars and spiral arms, infalling dwarf galaxies, or globular clusters which can imprint gaps, clumps, spurs, and asymmetries in tails. In addition to these effects, the impact of a galactic major merger on a population of stellar streams remains to be explored. Here, we focus on the emergence and longevity of asymmetries between the leading and trailing tails of streams caused by such interactions. We run collisionless N-body simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy hosting 36 globular cluster streams and merging with a perturber galaxy. We propose a new asymmetry metric to quantify the structural differences between both tails from their respective cumulative density profiles. We find that the over- and under-densities along streams induced by the merger depend on the orbital characteristics of their progenitors. The non-simultaneity of this effect from stream to stream implies that global asymmetry signatures are less prominent than in individual cases. These population-averaged imprints remain detectable over only 2.5 Gyr but asymmetric signatures can persist over much longer periods for individual streams with wide orbits that have been perturbed prior to coalescence. We thus caution that the interpretation of streams' morphology in the context of dark matter mapping is strongly subject to degeneracies and should be performed considering the merger history of the host.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Walk on the Retrograde Side (WRS) project. II. Chemistry to disentangle in situ and accreted components in Thamnos</a><span class="id">[2510.06332]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the results of the first systematic and dedicated high-resolution chemical analysis of the Thamnos substructure, a candidate relic of the process of hierarchical merger of the Milky Way. The analysis is perfomed in comparison with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) remnant, within the fully self-consistent and homogeneous framework established by the WRS project. We analyse high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with UVES at VLT for 212 Red Giant Branch stars classified as candidate members of Thamnos and GSE, based on selections in the space of the integrals of motion. We derive precise abundances for 16 atomic species. Compared to GSE, stars attributed to the Thamnos substructure are, on average, more metal-poor, yet most of them show relatively higher [X/Fe] abundance ratios in several elements, like Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Cu, Zn, as well as lower [Eu/Fe]. The majority of candidate Thamnos stars show chemical signatures more consistent with the in situ Milky Way halo rather than a typical low-mass accreted dwarf galaxy. Our findings are further supported by comparisons with tailored galactic chemical evolution models, which fall short in reproducing the observed enhancement in the $\alpha$-elements, but are able to fit the more metal-poor component present in the Thamnos substructure. These results confirm a high level of contamination in the Thamnos substructure from the in situ population and to a lesser degree from GSE, while still leaving room for a genuine accreted population from a small disrupted dwarf galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MEGATRON: Disentangling Physical Processes and Observational Bias in the Multi-Phase ISM of High-Redshift Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.06347]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Now detected out to redshifts of $z\sim 14.5$, the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectra of galaxies encode numerous physical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). Accurately extracting these properties from spectra remains a key challenge that numerical simulations are uniquely suited to address. We present a study of the observed ISM of galaxies in MEGATRON: a suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations coupled to on-the-fly non-equilibrium thermochemistry, with multiple prescriptions for star formation/feedback and parsec-scale resolution; capable of directly predicting spectroscopic properties of early galaxies. We find that irrespective of feedback physics used, the ISM of high-redshift galaxies is denser, less metal enriched, and subject to higher ionization parameters and radiation fields compared to similar mass galaxies in the local Universe – in agreement with interpretations of JWST observations. Using common observational techniques to infer bulk galaxy properties, we find that ISM gas density controls the slope of the mass-metallicity relation. Similarly, at the densities reached in some high-redshift galaxies, O32 becomes a density tracer rather than one of ionization parameter. This motivates the use of other line ratios like C43 and N43 to infer the ionization state of the gas. Finally, various feedback models populate different regions of strong-line diagnostic diagrams as the line ratios are sensitive to the feedback-modulated density-temperature structure of the ISM. Therefore, observed strong-line diagnostics can provide a strong constraint on the underlying physics of star formation and feedback in the high-redshift Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence of violation of Case B recombination in Little Red Dots</a><span class="id">[2510.06362]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a new class of compact extragalactic objects, with a v-shaped optical spectral energy distribution breaking close to the Balmer break wavelength, and broad, typically exponentially-shaped lines. They are believed to be supermassive black holes surrounded by very dense, ionized gas, leading us to explore for any departures from Case B recombination by examining the ratios of multiple hydrogen Balmer lines: $H\alpha$, $H\beta$, $H\gamma$, and $H\delta$. We analyze a dozen high-S/N LRDs with JWST/NIRSpec, measuring Balmer ratios in the seven objects with coverage of at least three lines. We decompose the line ratios into their respective broad and narrow components. Broad line ratios are consistent with Case B plus dust extinction in all objects but one, RUBIES EGS-49140, which departs from Case B expectations by more than $5\sigma$. The narrow components are consistent with minimal dust attenuation, while two objects exhibit narrow $H\alpha$/$H\beta \approx 1.8$. Such low decrements are observed in highly ionized density bounded nebulae, associated with starburst environments. Nevertheless, both flat decrement cases can be reconciled assuming an unresolved absorption feature. RUBIES EGS-49140, shows a high broad $H\alpha$/$H\beta$, but $H\gamma$/$H\alpha$ and $H\delta$/$H\alpha$ ratios are lower than expected for extinction-modified Case B, hinting at an unphysically steep dust law. These line ratios may be due to increased optical depth in the Balmer lines, as a direct effect of high density (log$n_e$ &gt; 9) gas surrounding the black hole. If Case B recombination does hold in most LRDs, they must be moderate-to-heavily dust obscured ($A_V\simeq1-8$) while the host-galaxy should be dust-free, suggesting that the extinction in the broad lines is local to the LRD and not due to the general ISM of the host galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The rise and fall of Little Red Dots could be driven by the environment</a><span class="id">[2510.06408]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Little Red Dot (LRD) paradigm comprises three main unknowns that are intrinsically connected: (1) What is the nature of these sources? (2) How do they form? (3) How do they evolve? Larger spectroscopic samples and high-resolution data are needed to delve deeper into the mechanisms ruling these sources. Understanding their formation and evolution requires identifying the rise and fall of the key features that characterize these systems, such as their compactness and “V”-shaped spectral energy distributions. In this work, we present a galaxy system nicknamed The Stingray that was identified in the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). This group contains three sources at $z_{\mathrm{spec}} = 5.12$, including an active galactic nucleus (AGN), a Balmer break galaxy, and a star-forming satellite. The latter resembles a Building Block System in which interactions boost stellar mass and black hole mass growth beyond what is expected from secular processes alone. The AGN in this system exhibits features indicative of a transitional object, bridging a normal AGN and an LRD phase. These are a blue rest-frame ultraviolet slope, compact size, and a broad H$\alpha$ line (all of which are characteristic of LRDs), but a flatter rest-frame optical slope compared to that observed in LRDs. The features in this source point to the emergence or fading of an LRD, potentially triggered by environmental effects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A chemodynamical study of $r$-process-enhanced stars</a><span class="id">[2510.06630]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $r$-process enrichment in the Galaxy still remains elusive with regard to its nucleosynthesis conditions and the astrophysical sites where it occurs. As part of ongoing efforts to pinpoint the origin of chemically peculiar $r$-process-enhanced (RPE) stars, we concentrate in this study on the kinematics of RPE stars to investigate possible variations in the $r$-process enrichment among the Galactic components. We calculate the orbital parameters of a sample of 472 metal-poor RPE stars and associate them to the Galactic bulge, disk and halo populations using a physically motivated classification based on apocenter distance and maximum absolute vertical height of the orbit. We show that the Toomre diagram does not properly separate stars in the disk and halo components when they are on highly eccentric and/or retrograde orbits. The Galactic disk and halo share a similar fraction of RPE stars, in contrast to the earlier perception that the majority of RPE stars belong to the halo. We find that the stars most likely to be accreted belong to the halo. However, 3/4 of the stars lie in a mixed-zone. The inner disk, inner halo and outer halo stars exhibit similar abundance trends for the n-capture elements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06667" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ionized gas components in low surface brightness galaxy AGC 111629</a><span class="id">[2510.06667]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present integral field spectroscopy of ionized gas components in AGC 111629, an edge-on low surface brightness galaxy (LSBG) with a stellar mass of 5.7$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. AGC 111629 displays an irregular H$\alpha$ morphology and an arch-like structure in the extraplanar region, which is absent in continuous stellar image. The irregular H$\alpha$ morphology may be related to a past merger event with its satellite galaxy AGC 748815. A peanut-shaped structure at the center in the integrated [OIII]$\lambda$5007 map, with a position angle that differs from that of the main stellar disk. This structure exhibits a higher [OIII]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ flux ratio, a larger equivalent width (EW) of [OIII]$\lambda$5007, and a lower H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ flux radio ($&lt;$ 2.86). Some spaxels associated with the peanut-shaped structure fall within the composite region of the BPT diagram based on [NII]$\lambda$6583. These features may be associated with the central AGN. Additionally, a sub-peak in the southern disk is clearly visible in the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 map. An extended region ($\sim$ 2 kpc) with an extremely low value of H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ flux ratio is observed near this sub-peak. We interpret the sub-peak as a superbubble likely driven by supernova explosions in the southern disk. We derive the gas-phase metallicity, 12+log(O/H), using the [NII]$\lambda$6583/H$\alpha$ diagnostic and find that AGC 111629 exhibits low central metallicity.

The disk of the galaxy can be modeled using two S$\acute{\rm e}$rsic components with distinct central positions: one representing the inner bright disk and the other corresponding to the extended outer disk. We estimate the stellar masses of the NSC and the host galaxy using two methods: spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and mass-to-light versus color relations (MLCRs). The stellar mass ratio of the NSC to AGC 223218 is 0.094 based on the SED method and 0.072 using MLCRs. The NSC presents a younger stellar population and a lower [Fe/H] value than the host, as determined from SDSS and LAMOST spectra analysis using pPXF fitting. AGC 223218 is located at the boundary between the Seyfert and star-forming regions in the [SII]-BPT diagram, whereas in the [NII]-BPT diagram, it falls in the track of star-forming SDSS galaxies. This suggests the presence of strong shocks in AGC 223218. We propose that the NSC in AGC 223218 may have formed as a result of a merger event. Furthermore, the observed X-ray luminosity of AGC 223218 with eROSITA is two orders of magnitude higher than the expected X-ray luminosity from X-ray binaries, suggesting the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the NSC. To account for the observed X-ray luminosity, we estimate the IMBH accretion rate to be approximately 0.001.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Star-forming Main Sequence and Bursty Star-formation Histories at $z&gt;1.4$ in JADES and AURORA</a><span class="id">[2510.06681]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze JWST spectroscopic and HST+JWST photometric observations of 659 star-forming galaxies at $1.4 &lt; z &lt; 9$ from DR3 of the JADES survey and the AURORA Cycle 1 program. We measure the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) for galaxies above $10^{8.5}\rm\ M_\odot$ where the sample is largely representative, estimating star-formation rates (SFRs) using the H$\alpha$ line flux and rest-frame far UV (1600Å) continuum measurements, each independently corrected for dust attenuation. We find that the intrinsic, measurement-error-subtracted scatter in the SFMS ($\sigma_{\rm int}$) increases with decreasing stellar mass for the H$\alpha$-based SFMS, and we find no mass dependence of $\sigma_{\rm int}$ in the UV-based SFMS. Additionally, we find that $\sigma_{\rm int}$ decreases with increasing redshift, from $0.36^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ dex to $0.22^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ dex (H$\alpha$ SFMS), and from $0.28^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ dex to $0.20^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ dex (UV SFMS) between $z\sim2$ and $z\sim 6.5$. We also measure the redshift evolution of the specific SFR and find that, assuming $\rm sSFR\propto (1+z)^\gamma$, $\gamma=1.89^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ for the H$\alpha$-based SFMS, and $\gamma=1.36^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$ for the UV-based SFMS. Analyzing the observed H$\alpha$/UV luminosity ratios and star-formation histories from the {\sc prospector} fitting code, we find that 41–60\% of the sample is inconsistent with having a constant star-formation history. Finally, we find tentative evidence for shorter SFR burst timescales with increasing redshift based on the distribution of $\rm L_{H\alpha}/\nu L_{\nu,1600}$ vs. $\Delta\rm \log(L_{H\alpha})$. Taken together, these results are consistent with theoretical predictions of bursty star formation in the early Universe and provide valuable constraints for theoretical models of galaxy evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectropolarimetry of NGC 1275 reveals a narrow-line radio galaxy with polarization parallel to its radio jet axis</a><span class="id">[2510.06713]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Concomitant with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observation of the Perseus cluster, we obtained optical spectropolarimetry of its central active galactic nucleus, NGC 1275, using the Alhambra Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (ALFOSC) on the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT).

The angle of dust polarization by magnetically aligned grains provides the projected B-fields onto the plane-of-sky, while the degree of dust polarization provides the B-field's inclination angles with respect to the line-of-sight. Our previous theoretical studies proposed a new method of probing 3D B-fields using dust polarization combined with the Radiative Torque (RAT) alignment theory and demonstrated the accurate inference of B-field inclination angles using synthetic polarization data. In this paper, we report the first application of the new technique to study 3D B-fields and dust properties in the G11.11-0.12 filament (hereafter G11) from starlight polarization observations taken by ISRF/SIRPOL at $2.19\,\rm\mu m$. Using both observed starlight polarization and optical dust extinction curve from Gaia mission, we constrained the maximum grain size of $0.25\,\rm\mu m$ and the grain elongation with an axial ratio of $s\gtrsim 1.4$ in the outer regions of G11. We calculated the alignment properties in the G11 by using the \textsc{DustPOL\_py} code based on the RAT theory. The B-field's inclination angles are then inferred from the observed starlight polarization efficiency when the grain alignment is included, showing the inclined B-fields in the G11 with a mean angle of $\sim 50$ degrees. From these inferred inclination angles, we found evidence of the local 3D arc-shaped B-field structure toward the sightline. These findings are important for fully understanding 3D B-field's roles in the formation and evolution of massive filamentary clouds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warm absorber outflows in radio-loud active galactic nucleus 3C 59</a><span class="id">[2510.06752]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Both jets and ionized outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to play important roles in affecting the star formation and evolution of host galaxies, but their relationship is still unclear. As a pilot study, we performed a detailed spectral analysis for a radio-loud (RL) AGN 3C 59 ($z=0.1096$) by systematically considering various factors that may affect the fitting results, and thereby establishing a general spectral fitting strategy for subsequent research with larger sample. 3C 59 is one rare target for simultaneously studying jets and warm absorbers (WAs) that is one type of ionized outflows. Based on the multi-wavelength data from near-infrared (NIR) to hard X-ray bands detected by DESI, GALEX, and XMM-Newton, we used SPEX code to build broadband continuum models and perform photoionization modeling with PION code to constrain the physical parameters of WAs in 3C 59. We found two WAs with ionization parameter of $\log [\xi/(\rm{erg\ cm\ s}^{-1})] = 2.65^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ and $1.65\pm 0.11$, respectively, and their outflowing velocities are $v_{\rm out} = -528^{+163}_{-222}\ \rm{km\ s}^{-1}$ and $-228^{+121}_{-122}\ \rm{km\ s}^{-1}$, respectively. These WAs are located between outer torus and narrow (emission-)line region, and their positive $v_{\rm out}$-$\xi$ relation can be explained by the radiation-pressure-driven mechanism. We found that the estimations of these physical properties are affected by the different spectral fitting strategies, such as the inclusion of NIR to ultra-violet data, the choice of energy range of spectrum, or the composition of the spectral energy distribution. Based on the same fitting strategy, this work presents a comparative study of outflow driven mechanism between a RL AGN (3C 59) and a radio-quiet AGN (NGC 3227), which suggests a similar driven mechanism of their WA outflows and a negligible role of jets in this process.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06753" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Sample of HeII λ4686 &quot;Changing-Look&quot; Quasars</a><span class="id">[2510.06753]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first systematic search for &quot;changing-look&quot; (&quot;CL&quot;) behavior in the broad He ii {\lambda}4686 emission line in quasars, utilizing repeated spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

On-chip filterbank spectrometers are a promising technology in this respect; however, they must overcome an orders-of-magnitude increase in detector counts, efficiency loss due to dielectric properties, and stringent fabrication tolerances that currently limit scaling to resolutions of order 1000 over a large array. We propose coupling a medium-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer to a low-resolution filterbank spectrometer focal plane, which serves as a post-dispersion element. In this arrangement, medium resolution imaging spectroscopy is provided by the Fourier transform spectrometer, while the low resolution filterbank spectrometer serves to decrease the photon noise inherent in typical broadband Fourier transform spectrometer measurements by over an order of magnitude. This is achieved while maintaining the excellent imaging advantages of both architectures. We present predicted mapping speeds for a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer from a ground-based site and a balloon-borne platform. We also demonstrate the potential that an instrument of this type has for an R 1000 line intensity mapping experiment using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as an example platform. We demonstrate that a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer would be capable of R 1000 measurements of CO power spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10–100 with surveys of $10^5$–$10^6$ spectrometer hours.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST observations of photodissociation regions: II.

The James Webb Space Telescope, with its high spatial resolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage provides unique access to the detection of most of H2 lines and the analysis of its spatial morphology. Our goal is to use H2 line emission detected with the JWST in the Horsehead nebula to constrain the physical parameters (e.g., extinction, gas temperature, thermal pressure) throughout the PDR and its geometry. The study of H2 morphology reveals that FUV-pumped lines peak closer to the edge of the PDR than thermalized lines. From H2 lines, we estimate the value of extinction throughout the PDR. We find that AV is increasing from the edge of the PDR to the second and third H2 filaments. Then, we study the H2 excitation in different regions across the PDR. The temperature profile shows that the observed gas temperature is quite constant throughout the PDR, with a slight decline in each of the dissociation fronts. This study also reveals that the OPR is far from equilibrium. We observe a spatial separation of para and ortho rovibrational levels, indicating that efficient ortho-para conversion and preferential ortho self-shielding are driving the spatial variations of the OPR. Finally, we derive a thermal pressure in the first filament around P &gt; 6x10$^6$ K cm$^{-3}$, about ten times higher than that of the ionized gas. We highlight that template stationary 1D PDR models cannot account for the intrinsic 2D structure and the very high temperature observed in the Horsehead nebula. We argue the highly excited, over-pressurized H2 gas at the edge of the PDR interface could originate from the mixing between the cold and hot phase induced by the photo-evaporation of the cloud.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MEGATRON: The environments of Population III stars at Cosmic Dawn and their connection to present day galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.06853]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results of Pop.

While the very first Pop. III stars form in halos with masses well below the atomic cooling limit, whose cooling is dominated by molecular hydrogen, the majority of Pop. III stars form in more massive systems above the $10^4$ K atomic cooling threshold. The shift in cooling regime of halos hosting new Pop. III stars occurs within $100$ Myr of the first Pop. III star as the Lyman-Werner (LW) background rapidly increases to $10^{-21}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,Hz^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$. We find that the global Pop. III star formation rate stabilizes to a value of $10^{-3}\,\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$ at $z=20$. Among the three processes that quench Pop. III star formation in mini-halos, the LW background, gas starvation, and external chemical enrichment, the LW background is most important. A small fraction of haloes undergo multiple episodes of Pop. III star formation when the earlier forming stars all directly collapse to black holes. If the halos become massive enough, they can form up to $\sim100$ Pop. III stars in a single burst, which may be observable by JWST with moderate gravitational lensing. Pop. III stars form at a wide range of distances from UV-bright galaxies, with only $0.06\%$ of Pop. III stars forming within the virial radius of galaxies with $M_{\rm UV} &lt; -17$. Finally, by tracking Pop.

Using the unprecedented combination of depth, sky coverage, and cadence of the ZTF survey, we target even starlight-dominated AGN, known for their redder colours, weaker variability signals, and difficult nuclear photometry due to their resolved hosts. We perform aperture photometry on ZTF reference-subtracted images for 40 million sources across 8,000 deg^2, assemble light curves and classify objects employing an RF algorithm into 14 classes, including 341,938 candidate AGN. We compare variability metrics derived from our photometry to those obtained from ZTF Data Release light curves (DR11-psf), to assess the impact of our analysis. We find that the fraction of low-z quiescent galaxies exhibiting significant variability drops dramatically (from 98\% of the sample to 7\%) when replacing the DR11-psf light curves with our difference image, aperture photometry (DI-Ap) version. The overall number of variable low-z AGN remains high (99\% when using DR11-psf lightcurves, 83\% when using DI-Ap), however, implying that our photometry can detect the fainter variability in host dominated AGN. The classifier effectively distinguishes between AGN and other sources, demonstrating high recovery rates even for AGN in resolved nearby galaxies. AGN candidates in eROSITA's eFEDS field, detected in X-rays and bright enough for ZTF optical observations, were classified as AGN (79\%) and non-variable galaxies (20\%). These groups show a 2 dex difference in X-ray luminosity but not in X-ray flux. A significant fraction of X-ray AGN are optically too faint for ZTF, and conversely, a quarter of ZTF AGN in the eFEDS area lack X-ray detections, highlighting a wide range of X-ray-to-optical flux ratios in AGN.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The radial acceleration relation at the EDGE of galaxy formation: testing its universality in low-mass dwarf galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.06905]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A tight correlation between the baryonic and observed acceleration of galaxies has been reported over a wide range of mass ($10^8 &lt; M_{\rm bar}/{\rm M}_\odot &lt; 10^{11}$) - the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR). This has been interpreted as evidence that dark matter is actually a manifestation of some modified weak-field gravity theory. In this paper, we study the radially resolved RAR of 12 nearby dwarf galaxies, with baryonic masses in the range $10^4 &lt; M_{\rm bar}/{\rm M}_\odot &lt; 10^{7.5}$, using a combination of literature data and data from the MUSE-Faint survey. We use stellar line-of-sight velocities and the Jeans modelling code GravSphere to infer the mass distributions of these galaxies, allowing us to compute the RAR. We compare the results with the EDGE simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies with similar stellar masses in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that most of the observed dwarf galaxies lie systematically above the low-mass extrapolation of the RAR. Each galaxy traces a locus in the RAR space that can have a multi-valued observed acceleration for a given baryonic acceleration, while there is significant scatter from galaxy to galaxy. Our results indicate that the RAR does not apply to low-mass dwarf galaxies and that the inferred baryonic acceleration of these dwarfs does not contain enough information, on its own, to derive the observed acceleration. The simulated EDGE dwarfs behave similarly to the real data, lying systematically above the extrapolated RAR. We show that, in the context of modified weak-field gravity theories, these results cannot be explained by differential tidal forces from the Milky Way, nor by the galaxies being far from dynamical equilibrium, since none of the galaxies in our sample seems to experience strong tides. As such, our results provide further evidence for the need for invisible dark matter in the smallest dwarf galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06942" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulations of Globular Cluster Evolution with Multiple Stellar Populations</a><span class="id">[2510.06942]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formation of stars with light-element abundance variations in globular clusters and the subsequent dynamical evolution of these multiple populations remains an open question. One of the most widely discussed is the AGB scenario, in which chemically processed material from the envelopes of AGB stars mixes with re-accreted primordial gas flowing into the center of the cluster. Based on this scenario, more than two hundred MOCCA simulations of cluster evolution have been carried out, incorporating additional physical processes related to the external environment of globular clusters and the initial properties of multiple stellar populations. Analysis of the simulations shows that most observed properties of multiple stellar populations and the global parameters of Milky Way clusters are well reproduced, with the exception of the correlation between cluster mass and the fraction of second-population stars. We present a speculative scenario of globular cluster evolution that may account for the observed properties of Milky Way clusters, including the correlation between cluster mass and the fraction of enriched stars. The scenario further predicts that, under certain conditions, the pristine first population can be more centrally concentrated than the enriched second population, as observed in some clusters. \end{abstract</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning Techniques to Distinguish Giant Stars from Dwarf Stars Using Only Photometry – Pushing Redwards</a><span class="id">[2510.07005]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present our photometric method, which combines Subaru/HSC $NB515$, g, and i band filters to distinguish giant stars in Local Group galaxies from Milky Way dwarf contamination.

The properties of circumstellar disks around these objects may provide a valuable probe into their origin, but is currently limited by the small sizes of the sample explored. We aim to perform a statistical study of the occurrence of circumstellar disks down to the planetary-mass regime. We performed a systematic survey of disks among the population identified in the 5-10 Myr-old Upper Scorpius association (USC), restricted to members outside the younger, embedded Ophiuchus region and with estimated masses below 105 M_Jup. We took advantage of unWISE photometry to search for mid-infrared excesses in the WISE (W1-W2) color. We implemented a Bayesian outlier detection method that models the photospheric sequence and computes excess probabilities for each object, enabling statistically sound estimation of disk fractions. We explore disk fractions across an unprecedentedly fine mass grid, reaching down to objects as low as  6 M_Jup assuming 5 Myr or  8 M_Jup assuming 10 Myr, thus extending the previous lower boundary of disk fraction studies. Depending on the age, our sample includes between 17 and 40 FFPs. We confirm that the disk fraction steadily rises with decreasing mass and exceeds 30% near the substellar-to-planetary mass boundary at  13 M_Jup. We find hints of a possible flattening in this trend around 25-45 M_Jup, potentially signaling a transition in the dominant formation processes. This change of trend should be considered with caution and needs to be confirmed with more sensitive observations. Our results are consistent with the gradual dispersal of disks over time, as disk fractions in Upper Scorpius appear systematically lower than those in younger regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07256" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond diagnostic-diagrams: A critical exploration on the classification of ionization processes</a><span class="id">[2510.07256]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, such as the classical BPT, are widely used to identify ionisation mechanisms in galaxies but often suffer from degeneracies, especially when multiple sources coexist. We critically evaluate the effectiveness of these diagnostics in distinguishing star-forming galaxies, retired galaxies (RGs), and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and propose refined methods to reduce misclassifications. Using a large sample of nearby galaxies from the NASA-Sloan Atlas cross-matched with SDSS spectroscopy, we define representative subsamples of late-type/star-forming galaxies, early-type/RGs, and multiwavelength-selected AGNs. Their distributions are analysed across traditional and modern diagnostics, including WHaN, WHaD, and the newly introduced WHaO diagram, which combine H{\alpha} equivalent width with [N II]/H{\alpha}, {\sigma}(H{\alpha}), and [O III]/[O II], respectively. Quantitative comparisons reveal that classical BPT diagrams overestimate star-forming galaxies by  10% and misclassify up to 45% of AGNs and nearly all RGs. Diagnostics incorporating EW(H{\alpha}) achieve improved accuracy, reducing misclassifications to {\sim} 20\ % for AGNs and {\sim} 15\% for RGs. A revised classification scheme based on EW(H{\alpha}) thresholds and consistent WHaD/WHaO results yields the highest purity (8-25% misclassifications) and better reflects underlying physical conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that BPT-based methods fail to reliably separate ionisation mechanisms, particularly in galaxies hosting weak AGNs or evolved stellar populations. Updated EW(H{\alpha})-based diagnostics offer a more accurate framework for studying galaxy ionisation and should replace traditional schemes in future population studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The cosmic web's Lyman-$α$ glow at $z \approx 2.5$; varying hydrodynamic models, dust, and wide-field, narrow-band imaging detection</a><span class="id">[2510.07259]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The diffuse glow of the cosmic web in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission has long been predicted, yet remained elusive to direct wide field detection.

However, the method is undermined if the redshift used for the SED fitting is incorrect. Low mass galaxies, log(M) &lt; 9:5, can contain relatively warm dust that emits in the 4 - 6 micron range. We show that the potential contamination of AGN samples by purely star forming low-mass galaxies can be avoided by the use of the infrared properties of Haro 11 as a limiting star-forming SED template.

Studying satellite systems around spiral galaxies thus remains key in addressing these tensions. In this series of papers we report the first results of an on-going systematic survey of faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the vicinity of the bright late-type spiral NGC 253 galaxy, the brightest member of the Sculptor filament located at a distance of 3.7 Mpc. We performed a new NGC 253 satellite search by means of visual inspection using co-added image cutouts reprocessed in the DESI Legacy image surveys, reaching a very low surface brightness regime (28.0–29.0 mag arcsec-2). Five new dwarf galaxy candidates have been discovered in the vicinity of NGC 253, that we named them Do V, Do VI, Do VII, Do VIII and Do IX. Assuming they are associated to NGC 253, their total absolute V-magnitudes fall in the -7 to -9 mag range, which is typical for dwarf satellites in the local Universe. The central surface brightness tend to be extremely low for all the discovered dwarfs and fall roughly in the range of 25–26 mag arcsec-2 in g-band. We present a new list of galaxies located around the giant spiral NGC 253. With the inclusion of these additional satellite candidates, the overall spatial distribution of the system becomes less flattened and is now broadly consistent with analogs drawn from Lambda-CDM expectations. Interestingly, the distribution appears to be rather lopsided. Yet, firm conclusions on the presence of absence of a correlated satellite structure are hampered since distance information is lacking, the census of observed dwarfs in the system remains far from complete, and spectroscopic velocities are not even available for most known satellites.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distribution of Europium in The Milky Way Disk; Its Connection to Planetary Habitability and The Source of The R-Process</a><span class="id">[2411.10711]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The energy provided in the radioactive decay of thorium (Th) and uranium (U) isotopes, embedded in planetary mantles, sustains geodynamics important for surface habitability such as the generation of a planetary magnetic dynamo. In order to better understand the thermal evolution of nearby exoplanets, stellar photospheric abundances can be used to infer the material composition of orbiting planets. Here we constrain the intrinsic dispersion of the r-process element europium (Eu) (measured in relative abundance [Eu/H]) as a proxy for Th and U in local F, G, and K type dwarf stars. Adopting stellar-chemical data from two high quality spectroscopic surveys, we have determined a small intrinsic scatter of 0.025 dex in [Eu/H] within the disk. We further investigate the stellar anti-correlation in [Eu/$\alpha$] vs [$\alpha$/H] at late metallicities to probe in what regimes planetary radiogenic heating may lead to periods of extended dynamo collapse. We find that only near-solar metallicity stars in the disk have Eu inventories supportive of a persistent dynamo in attendant planets, supporting the notion of a “metallicity Goldilocks zone” in the galactic disk. The observed anti-correlation further provides novel evidence regarding the nature of r-processes injection by substantiating $\alpha$ element production is decoupled from Eu injection. This suggests either a metallicity-dependent r-process in massive core-collapse supernovae, or that neutron-star merger events dominate r-process production in the recent universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Semi-analytic Framework of Population III and Subsequent Galaxy Formation on Cosmological N-body Simulations</a><span class="id">[2501.17540]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a new semi-analytic framework of Population (Pop) III and subsequent galaxy formation designed to run on dark matter halo merger trees. In our framework, we consider the effect of the Lyman-Werner flux from Pop III and II stars and the dark matter baryon streaming velocity on the critical halo mass for the Pop III formation. Our model incorporates the Lyman-Werner feedback in a self-consistent way, therefore, the spatial variation of Lyman-Werner feedback naturally emerges. The Pop III mass depends on the properties of a halo as reproducing radiative hydrodynamical simulation results. We perform statistical studies of Pop III stars by applying this framework to high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations with a maximum box size of 16 Mpc/h and enough mass resolution to resolve Pop III-forming halos. A top-heavy initial mass function emerges and two peaks corresponding to the H$_2$ ($20 \lesssim z \lesssim 25$) and atomic cooling halos ($z \lesssim 15$) exist in the distribution. Supermassive stars can be formed in the atomic cooling halos, and the fractions of such supermassive stars increase with the value of streaming velocity. At least an 8 Mpc/h simulation box and the self-consistent model for the Lyman-Werner feedback are necessary to correctly model the Pop III formation in the atomic cooling halos. Our model predicts one supermassive star per halo with several $10^9$ Msun at z=7.5, which is enough to reproduce a high redshift quasar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Southern Photometrical Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS): searching for metal-poor dwarf galaxies</a><span class="id">[2501.18498]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The metal content of a galaxy's interstellar medium reflects the interplay between different evolutionary processes such as feedback from massive stars and the accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium. Despite the expected abundance of low-luminosity galaxies, the low-mass and low-metallicity regime remains relatively understudied. Since the properties of their interstellar medium resemble those of early galaxies, identifying such objects in the Local Universe is crucial to understand the early stages of galaxy evolution. We used the DR3 catalog of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) to select low-metallicity dwarf galaxy candidates based on color selection criteria typical of metal-poor, star-forming, low-mass systems. The final sample contains approximately 50 candidates. Spectral energy distribution fitting of the 12 S-PLUS bands reveals that $\sim$ 60% of the candidates are best fit by models with low stellar metallicities. We obtained long-slit observations with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph to follow-up a pilot sample and confirm whether these galaxies have low metallicities. We find oxygen abundances in the range $7.28&lt;$ 12 + log(O/H) $&lt; 7.82$ (4% to 13% of the solar value), confirming their metal-poor nature. Most targets are outliers in the mass-metallicity relation, i.e. they display a low metal content relative to their observed stellar masses. In some cases, perturbed optical morphologies might give evidence of dwarf-dwarf interactions or mergers. These results suggest that the low oxygen abundances may be associated with an external event causing the accretion of metal-poor gas, which dilutes the oxygen abundance in these systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03683" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AGN ruled out as the dominant source of cosmic reionization</a><span class="id">[2502.03683]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic reionization represents the latest phase transition in the Universe, when the Lyman continuum (LyC) photons turned the intergalactic medium (IGM) from neutral to highly ionized. It has long been debated whether galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the major source of LyC photons responsible for reionization. Previous observations slightly favored galaxies as the major ionizing source. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) recently discovered an unexpectedly high density of AGN candidates at high redshift, which has largely enhanced the influence of AGNs. Here we derive a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution to reionization using the latest JWST data, and conclusively rule out AGNs as the dominant ionizing source during the peak epoch of reionization (EoR). We build a sample of galaxies and AGNs in a specific redshift range $7.15 \leq z \leq 7.75$ with a high completeness. Each object is then decomposed into a point-source component and an extended component in their rest-frame far-UV JWST images. We assume all point-source components are AGNs. Our fiducial AGN sample reaches an unprecedentedly low luminosity of $M_{\rm UV} \approx -15$ mag. Based on this sample, AGNs can contribute at most one third of the LyC photons budget required at $z\sim7.5$. Our result implies that galaxies dominate the ionizing source during the EoR.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmology with One Galaxy: Auto-Encoding the Galaxy Properties Manifold</a><span class="id">[2502.17568]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmological simulations like CAMELS and IllustrisTNG characterize hundreds of thousands of galaxies using various internal properties. Previous studies have demonstrated that machine learning can be used to infer the cosmological parameter $\Omega_m$ from the internal properties of even a single randomly selected simulated galaxy. This ability was hypothesized to originate from galaxies occupying a low-dimensional manifold within a higher-dimensional galaxy property space, which shifts with variations in $\Omega_m$. In this work, we investigate how galaxies occupy the high-dimensional galaxy property space, particularly the effect of $\Omega_m$ and other cosmological and astrophysical parameters on the putative manifold. We achieve this by using an autoencoder with an Information-Ordered Bottleneck (IOB), a neural layer with adaptive compression, to perform dimensionality reduction on individual galaxy properties from CAMELS simulations, which are run with various combinations of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We find that for an autoencoder trained on the fiducial set of parameters, the reconstruction error increases significantly when the test set deviates from fiducial values of $\Omega_m$ and $A_{\text{SN1}}$, indicating that these parameters shift galaxies off the fiducial manifold. In contrast, variations in other parameters such as $\sigma_8$ cause negligible error changes, suggesting galaxies shift along the manifold. These findings provide direct evidence that the ability to infer $\Omega_m$ from individual galaxies is tied to the way $\Omega_m$ shifts the manifold. Physically, this implies that parameters like $\sigma_8$ produce galaxy property changes resembling natural scatter, while parameters like $\Omega_m$ and $A_{\text{SN1}}$ create unsampled properties, extending beyond the natural scatter in the fiducial model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01272" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating dusty Red Supergiant outflows in Westerlund 1 with 3D Hydrodynamic simulations</a><span class="id">[2503.01272]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the \textsc{pion} code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 $\mu$m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of $\sim1000-6000$ MJy ster$^{-1}$ which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 $\mu$m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forming the local starburst galaxy Haro 11 through hydrodynamical merger simulations</a><span class="id">[2503.01982]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Haro 11 is a metal-poor, starburst galaxy believed to be the result of an ongoing merger, which is shaping the properties of the galaxy.

By varying galaxy parameters describing the orbital configurations, masses, and their inclination, we perform a total of $\sim$500 simulations. We demonstrate that a two-disc galaxy merger reproduces key, observed features of Haro 11, including its morphology, gas kinematics, star formation history, and stellar population ages and masses. In particular, we present a fiducial Haro 11 model that produces the single observed tidal tail, three stellar knots, and inner gas morphology and kinematics. The resulting orbit and galactic morphology are robust against small variations of the initial parameters.

In this study, we investigate CR perpendicular superdiffusion and parallel transport in turbulent, partially ionized media using high-resolution 3D two-fluid simulations that treat ions and neutrals separately. We examine the influence of neutral-ion decoupling and the associated damping of turbulence on CR propagation in both transonic and supersonic conditions. Our simulations demonstrate that neutral-ion decoupling significantly damps velocity and magnetic field fluctuations at small scales, producing spectral slopes steeper than those of Kolmogorov and Burgers scaling. In supersonic turbulence, large-scale shock motion is not subject to damping and generates small-scale density enhancements. Moreover, the damping of magnetic field fluctuations substantially decreases pitch-angle scattering, which, however, only slightly affects the CR parallel mean free path $\lambda_\|$, due to the nonresonant mirror interactions of CRs. In the direction perpendicular to the mean magnetic field, we identify two regimes of the perpendicular superdiffusion of CRs: a diffusive regime ($\lambda_\|&lt;L_{\rm inj}$, where $L_{\rm inj}$ is turbulence injection scale) with perpendicular separation of CR proportional to $t^{3/4}$, and a ballistic-like regime ($\lambda_\|&gt;L_{\rm inj}$), with perpendicular separation scaling as $t^{3/2}$. At initially large pitch angles, the effects of magnetic mirroring-naturally arising in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence-become significant, enhancing the confinement of CRs and resulting in $\lambda_\|&lt;L_{\rm inj}$, despite the damping effect. These results imply that large-pitch-angle CRs can be well confined in the cold ISM, such as molecular clouds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09123" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The hot circumgalactic medium in stacked X-rays: observations vs simulations</a><span class="id">[2506.09123]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current cosmological simulations rely on active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback to quench star formation and match observed stellar mass distributions, but models for AGN feedback are poorly constrained. The circumgalactic medium (CGM) provides a valuable laboratory to study this process, as its metallicity, temperature, and density distributions are directly shaped by AGN activity. Recent observations from the eROSITA instrument provide constraints on the CGM through measurements of extended soft X-ray emission. In this work, we generate synthetic eROSITA observations from the EAGLE and SIMBA cosmological simulations and compare them to observations of galaxies stacked by stellar mass, halo mass, and star-formation rate. SIMBA outperforms EAGLE in matching observed surface brightness profiles, but neither simulation achieves consistent agreement with observations across the full range of galaxy properties we studied. We find that variations in CGM X-ray emission between simulations are primarily driven by density differences at $R \lesssim 0.2 R_{200c} $, and temperature and metallicity changes at larger radii. These results highlight the need for further refinement of AGN feedback models in cosmological simulations and demonstrate the power of stacked X-ray observations as a tool for constraining feedback physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03888" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synthesizer: a Software Package for Synthetic Astronomical Observables</a><span class="id">[2508.03888]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Synthesizer, a fast, flexible, modular and extensible platform for modelling synthetic astrophysical observables.

However, there is a list of puzzles for this magnetar-for-all-FRBs scenario: known Galactic magnetars are all isolated and none of them are active repeaters; some cosmological repeaters have extremely high repetition rates but without any measurable spin-related periodicity; some show long-term periodic active windows; and some show diverse rotation measure (RM) evolution patterns, such as quasi-periodic fluctuations, sign reversals, and abrupt RM flares. Here we propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of magnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary systems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a triple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well; whereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars in isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry. By studying various magnetar formation channels using population syntheses, we show that a few percent of magnetars in the universe can be in binary systems, most with a massive star companion and some with aligned geometry. We suggest that such binary systems can account for the rich phenomenology of active repeaters. We suggest that the existence of a companion helps to maintain the aligned geometry and that the companion may play an active role in triggering FRBs in an active repeater source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyper Suprime-Cam Y3 results: photo-$z$ bias calibration with lensing shear ratios and cosmological constraints from cosmic shear</a><span class="id">[2508.21681]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an independent calibration of the photometric redshift (photo-$z$) distributions for source galaxies in the HSC-Y3 weak lensing survey using small-scale galaxy-galaxy lensing. By measuring the tangential shear around spectroscopic lens galaxies from GAMA, SDSS, and DESI, divided into fifteen narrow redshift bins, we compute shear ratios that are sensitive to the mean redshift of source galaxies. Using a blinded analysis, we derive constraints on the photo-$z$ bias parameters in source bins 2, 3 and 4, achieving signal-to-noise ratios of 59, 75, and 62, respectively. Our constraints for $\Delta z_2$, $\Delta z_3$ and $\Delta z_4$ are consistent with those from HSC-Y3 cosmic shear modeling. We observe a mild shift in the $\Delta z_3$-$\Delta z_4$ plane due to the heterogeneous depth of the lens sample, which disappears when using only DESI-DR1 lenses. Combining shear-ratio measurements with cosmic shear data, we obtain joint constraints on cosmological parameters: $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.304_{-0.029}^{+0.03}$ and $S_8 = 0.773_{-0.031}^{+0.031}$, consistent with cosmic shear-only results.

We have determined Sr abundance in a sample of 31 red giant branch stars located in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc with the aim to identify potential differences in the Sr abundance between first population (1P, Na-poor) and second population (2P, Na-rich) stars. Methods. We derived the Na and Sr abundances from the archival spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph. To do this, we used 1D ATLAS9 model atmospheres and a 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral synthesis method. Particular attention was paid to assessing the potential impact of CN line blending on the obtained Sr abundances. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential influence of convection on the Sr line formation by using 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the CO5BOLD code. Results. Our results suggest a weak correlation between the abundances of Sr and Na. Together with a similar correlation between the abundances of Zr and Na determined in our previous study, our analysis of Sr suggests that polluters that have enriched 2P stars with light elements may have produced some s-process elements as well. The mean Sr abundance determined in 31 red giant branch stars of 47 Tuc is $\langle {\rm [Sr/Fe]} \rangle = 0.18\pm0.08$ (the error denotes the standard deviation due to the star-to-star abundance scatter). This value is within the range of the Sr abundance variation that is observed in Galactic field stars of similar metallicity. The mean [Sr/Zr] abundance ratio in our sample stars suggests that the two s-process elements could have been synthesized by either low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars ($M=1-4 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) or massive ($M=10-20 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) fast-rotating ($v_{\rm rot}=200-300$ km/s) stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04907" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospects of future MeV telescopes in probing weak-scale Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2503.04907]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galactic weak-scale Dark Matter (DM) particles annihilating into lepton-rich channels not only produce gamma-rays via prompt radiation but also generate abundant energetic electrons and positrons, which subsequently emit through bremsstrahlung or inverse Compton scattering (collectively called `secondary-radiation photons').

Our framework couples the state-of-the-art binary population synthesis code SEVN with Arepo-GW – a module fully integrated into the moving-mesh code Arepo – to assign merger events of binary compact objects to stellar particles in simulations by stochastically sampling merger tables generated with SEVN. Arepo-GW supports both on-the-fly operation, producing event catalogs during simulations, and post-processing, using snapshots from existing runs. The algorithm is fully parallel and can be readily adapted to outputs from other simulation codes. To demonstrate the capabilities of our new framework, we applied Arepo-GW in post-processing to simulations from the MillenniumTNG suite, including its flagship box. We investigate key properties of the resulting GW event catalog, built on SEVN predictions, focusing on comoving merger rates, formation efficiencies, delay-time distributions, and progenitor mass and metallicity distributions. We also examine how these properties vary with simulated volume. We find that GW progenitor rates closely track simulated star formation histories and are generally consistent with current observational constraints at low redshift, aside from a factor of $\sim 4.5$ excess in binary black hole mergers. Moreover, our binary black hole merger rates decline more slowly with redshift than current observational estimates for $z \lesssim 1$. Finally, the analysis of progenitor mass functions across different formation channels reveals only mild redshift evolution, while the binary black hole mass function displays features compatible with current observational determinations. These findings highlight the potential of our novel framework to enable detailed predictions for upcoming GW surveys within a full cosmological context.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCAT: Readout of over 10,000 280 GHz KIDs in Mod-Cam using RFSoC Electronics</a><span class="id">[2510.06491]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the past decade, kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) have emerged as a viable superconducting technology for astrophysics at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.

The natural frequency-division multiplexed readout of KIDs allows hundreds of detectors to be coupled to a single radio frequency (RF) transmission line, but requires sophisticated warm readout electronics. The FPGA-based Xilinx ZCU111 radio frequency system on chip (RFSoC) offers a promising and flexible solution to the challenge of warm readout. CCAT uses custom packaged RFSoCs to read out KIDs in the Prime-Cam instrument. Each RFSoC can simultaneously read out four RF channels with up to 1,000 detectors spanning a 512 MHz bandwidth per channel using the current firmware. We use five RFSoCs to read out the &gt;10,000 KIDs in the broadband 280 GHz instrument module inside a testbed receiver.

Firmamento confirms the 4FGL-DR4 and 4LAC-DR3 counterparts or unassociated sources in 4,493 cases (88.8%), demonstrating the robustness of both approaches. Beyond this general agreement, we identify 421 new blazar counterparts among previously unassociated sources, thereby reducing the fraction of unidentified extragalactic Fermi-LAT sources from 25% to 17%. In addition, in 64 cases we find alternative blazar associations, while in 49 instances we do not confirm the 4FGL-DR4 association. For all confirmed blazar counterparts we provide homogeneous estimates of synchrotron peak frequency and peak flux using machine-learning and template-based methods; these agree with 4LAC-DR3 values in most cases, though significant discrepancies appear for a few dozen sources, often due to improved X-ray coverage. The primary outcome of this work is the 1st Firmamento LAT AGN table (1FLAT), made publicly available through the Firmamento platform ( this https URL ), where all related multi-wavelength data and images are available. The project involved extensive manual validation and benefited from the active participation of graduate and undergraduate students, highlighting the platform's value for both research and education.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In-flight performance of the IXPE telescopes</a><span class="id">[2510.06963]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive characterization of the on-orbit imaging performance of the three telescopes on board the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). Each telescope comprises a Wolter-I mirror module assembly and a Gas Pixel Detector focal-plane detector unit (DU). We analyze data from point-like X-ray sources and fit a composite point spread function (PSF) model that we compare with ground calibrations. We study the dependence of the PSF parameters and of the angular resolution, in terms of half-power diameter (HPD), on the time and source counting rate. We find no significant secular evolution of PSF parameters or HPD over 30 months on orbit, with average HPDs of $26.1 \pm 0.5$ arcsec (Telescope 1), $32.1 \pm 0.5$ arcsec (Telescope 2), and $30.9 \pm 0.6$ arcsec (Telescope 3), and rate trends consistent with zero up to source counting rates of $\sim60$ cts s$^{-1}$ in the 2-3 keV energy band for all three telescopes. We set a 99% C.L. upper limit of 4.4% on the optics-induced polarization in the PSF halo, and find no measurable degradation of the polarization modulation factor in the wings versus the core due to mis-reconstructed photoelectron tracks. IXPE's imaging performance thus is consistent with the $\leq30$ arcsec observatory requirement with high stability, ensuring robust spatially resolved polarization measurements for the mission's projected lifetime through 2030.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07034" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning for Radial Velocity Analysis I: Vision Transformers as a Robust Alternative for Detecting Planetary Candidates</a><span class="id">[2510.07034]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) surveys usually require extensive observational baselines to confirm planetary candidates, making them resource-intensive. Traditionally, periodograms are used to identify promising candidate signals before further observational investment, but their effectiveness is often limited for low-amplitude signals due to stellar jitter. In this work, we develop a machine learning (ML) framework based on a Transformer architecture that aims to detect the presence and likely period of planetary signals in time-series spectra, even in the presence of stellar activity. The model is trained to classify whether a planetary signal exists and assign it to one of several discrete period and amplitude bins. Injection-recovery tests on randomly selected 100 epoch observation subsets from NEID solar data (2020-2022 period) show that for low-amplitude systems ($&lt;$1 ms$^{-1}$), our model improves planetary candidate identification by a factor of two compared to the traditional Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Our ML model is built on a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that processes reduced representations of solar spectrum observations to predict the period and semi-amplitude of planetary signal candidates. By analyzing multi-epoch spectra, the model reliably detects planetary signals with semi-amplitudes as low as 65 cms$^{-1}$. Even under real solar noise and irregular sampling, it identifies signals down to 35 cms$^{-1}$. Comparisons with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram demonstrate a significant improvement in detecting low-amplitude planetary candidates, particularly for longer orbital periods. These results underscore the potential of machine learning to identify planetary candidates early in EPRV surveys, even from limited observational counts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polka-dotted Stars II: Starspots and obliquities of Kepler-17 and Kepler-63</a><span class="id">[2510.07130]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Starspots trace stellar magnetic activity and influence both stellar evolution and exoplanet characterization.

We apply the StarryStarryProcess Bayesian surface-mapping framework to archival Kepler light curves of two planet hosts, Kepler-63 and Kepler-17, extending the validation established on TOI-3884 (Paper I). Across both systems, we infer characteristic spot radii smaller than 10 degrees. The latitudinal spot distributions of these G dwarfs show bimodal belts: Kepler-63 near 30 degrees and Kepler-17 near 15 degrees. Our analysis yields stellar obliquity measurements in excellent agreement with previous studies, validating our methodology and demonstrating that transit-based surface mapping can simultaneously recover planetary parameters, stellar orientations, and magnetic morphologies. Together, these results reveal a range of stellar geometries from nearly aligned (Kepler-17) to highly misaligned (Kepler-63).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the cosmological 21 cm global signal from the Antarctic ice sheet</a><span class="id">[2510.07198]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The redshifted 21 cm line, arising from neutral hydrogen, offers a unique probe into the intergalactic medium and the first stars and galaxies formed in the early universe. However, detecting this signal is a challenging task because of artificial radio-frequency interference (RFI) and systematic errors such as ground effects. The interior of the Antarctic continent provides an excellent location to make such observations, with minimal RFI and relatively stable foreground signals. Moreover, a flat plateau in central Antarctica, with an ice cap over 2000 m deep, will show less ground reflection of radio waves, reducing the signal complexity in the area around the probing antenna. It may be advantageous to perform cosmological 21 cm experiments in Antarctica, and a 21 cm Antarctic global spectrum experiment can potentially be deployed on the Antarctic ice cap. We have performed preliminary instrumental design, system calibration, and implementation of such an instrument optimized for extreme cold and capable of long-term autonomous operation. This system shows the ability to effectively detect the 21 cm signal, confirming Antarctica as an excellent observational site for radio cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppleCiDEr II: SpectraNet – A Deep Learning Network for Spectroscopic Data</a><span class="id">[2510.07215]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Time-domain surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) have opened a new frontier in the discovery and characterization of transients. While photometric light curves provide broad temporal coverage, spectroscopic observations remain crucial for physical interpretation and source classification. However, existing spectral analysis methods – often reliant on template fitting or parametric models – are limited in their ability to capture the complex and evolving spectra characteristic of such sources, which are sometimes only available at low resolution. In this work, we introduce SpectraNet, a deep convolutional neural network designed to learn robust representations of optical spectra from transients. Our model combines multi-scale convolution kernels and multi-scale pooling to extract features from preprocessed spectra in a hierarchical and interpretable manner. We train and validate SpectraNet on low-resolution time-series spectra obtained from the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) and other instruments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in classification. Furthermore, in redshift prediction tasks, SpectraNet achieves a root mean squared relative redshift error of 0.02, highlighting its effectiveness in precise regression tasks as well.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Comoving Framework for Planet Migration</a><span class="id">[2510.07282]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The migration of planets within their nascent protoplanetary disks is a fundamental process that shapes the final architecture of planetary systems. However, studying this phenomenon through direct hydrodynamical simulations is computationally demanding, with traditional methods on fixed grids being ill-suited for tracking planet migration over long timescales due to their high cost and limited domain. In this work, we present a self-consistent comoving framework designed to overcome these challenges. Our method employs a coordinate transformation that scales with the planet's evolving semi-major axis, keeping the planet stationary with respect to its local computational grid. This transforms the standard hydrodynamic equations by introducing a source term that accounts for the inertial forces of the non-inertial reference frame. We implement this framework in the FARGO3D code and validate it through a benchmark test, demonstrating excellent agreement with conventional fixed-grid simulations until the latter are compromised by boundary effects. Our analysis shows that the comoving method can be over an order of magnitude more computationally efficient, dramatically reducing the cost of simulating migrating planets. Furthermore, the framework's adaptability enables efficient, high-resolution studies of planets on eccentric orbits by keeping them stationary within the computational grid. This framework serves as both a powerful numerical and theoretical tool, simplifying the time-dependent flow around a migrating planet that offers clearer physical insight. It enables long-term, self-consistent studies of planet-disk interaction, representing a crucial step towards performing planet-population synthesis based on full hydrodynamical simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vision Transformer for Transient Noise Classification</a><span class="id">[2510.06273]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of gravitational waves (GW).

We develop a pipeline to integrate over the bandpass transmission in both the time-ordered data (TOD) and the map-making processing steps. We introduce the systematic effect by having a mismatch between the “real”, high resolution bandpass $\tau$, entering the TOD, and the estimated one $\tau_s$, used in the map-making. We focus on two aspects: the effect of degrading the $\tau_s$ resolution, and the addition of a Gaussian error $\sigma$ to $\tau_s$. To reduce the computational load of the analysis, the two effects are explored separately, for three representative LiteBIRD channels (40 GHz, 140 GHz and 402 GHz) and for three bandpass shapes. Computing the amount of bias on $r$, $\Delta r$, caused by these effects on a single channel, we find that a resolution $\lesssim 1.5$ GHz and $\sigma \lesssim 0.0089$ do not exceed the LiteBIRD budget allocation per systematic effect, $\Delta r &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-6}$. We then check that propagating separately the uncertainties due to a resolution of 1 GHz and a measurement error with $\sigma = 0.0089$ in all LiteBIRD frequency channels, for the most pessimistic bandpass shape of the three considered, still produces a $\Delta r &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-6}$. This is done both with the simple deprojection approach and with a blind component separation technique, the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC). Due to the effectiveness of NILC in cleaning the systematic residuals, we have tested that the requirement on $\sigma$ can be relaxed to $\sigma \lesssim 0.05$.

The detection of these systems could arise via searches using a power-based GW anisotropy model or a deterministic template model. In Schult et al. 2025, we compared the efficacy of these models in constraining the GW signal from a single SMBHB using realistic, near-future PTA datasets, and found that the full-signal deterministic continuous wave (CW) search may achieve detection and characterization first. Here, we continue our analyses using only the CW model given its better performance, focusing now on characterization milestones. We examine the order in which CW parameters are constrained as PTA data are accumulated and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) grows. We also study how these parameter constraints vary across sources of different sky locations and GW frequencies. We find that the GW frequency and strain are generally constrained at the same time (or S/N), closely followed by the sky location, and later the chirp mass (if the source is highly evolving) and inclination angle. At fixed S/N, sources at higher frequencies generally achieve better precision on the GW frequency, chirp mass, and sky location. The time (and S/N) at which the signal becomes constrained is dependent on the sky location and frequency of the source, with the effects of pulsar terms and PTA geometry playing crucial roles in source detection and localization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expectations for the first supermassive black-hole binary resolved by PTAs I: Model efficacy</a><span class="id">[2510.01317]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the most promising targets for Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) is identifying an individual supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) out of the population of binaries theorized to produce a gravitational wave background (GWB). In this work, we emulate an evolving PTA dataset, complete with an increasing number of pulsars and timing baseline, into which we inject a single binary on top of a Gaussian GWB signal. We vary the binary's source parameters, including sky position and frequency, and create an ensemble of simulated datasets with which we assess current Bayesian binary search techniques. We apply two waveform-based template models and a frequency-resolved anisotropy search to these simulations to understand how they compare in their detection and characterization abilities. We find that a template-based search including the full gravitational-wave signal structure (i.e., both Earth and pulsar effects of an incident GW) returns the highest Bayes Factors (BF), exceeding our estimator's capabilities by (S/N) 9-19, and has the most robust parameter estimation. Our anisotropy model attains a realization-median BF&gt;10 at 7&lt;(S/N)&lt;15. Interestingly, despite being a deterministic model, the Earth-term template struggles to detect and characterize low-frequency binaries (5 nHz). These binaries require higher (S/N) 16-19 to reach the same BF threshold. This is likely due to neglected confusion effects between the pulsar and Earth terms. By contrast, the frequency-resolved anisotropy model shows promise for parameter estimation despite treating a binary's GW signal as excess directional GW power without phase modeling. Sky location and frequency parameter constraints returned by the anisotropy model are only surpassed by the Earth term template model at (S/N) 12-13. Milestones for a first detection using the full-signal GW model are included in a companion paper (Petrov et al. 2025).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09502" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M5 - Mars Magnetospheric Multipoint Measurement Mission: A multi-spacecraft plasma physics mission to Mars</a><span class="id">[2303.09502]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mars, lacking an intrinsic dynamo, is an ideal laboratory to comparatively study induced magnetospheres, which can be found in other terrestrial bodies as well as comets. Additionally, Mars is of particular interest to further exploration due to its loss of habitability by atmospheric escape and possible future human exploration. In this context, we propose the Mars Magnetospheric Multipoint Measurement Mission (M$^5$), a multi-spacecraft mission to study the dynamics and energy transport of the Martian induced magnetosphere comprehensively. Particular focus is dedicated to the largely unexplored magnetotail region, where signatures of magnetic reconnection have been found. Furthermore, a reliable knowledge of the upstream solar wind conditions is needed to study the dynamics of the Martian magnetosphere, especially the different dayside boundary regions but also for energy transport phenomena like the current system and plasma waves. This will aid the study of atmospheric escape processes of planets with induced magnetospheres. In order to resolve the three-dimensional structures varying both in time and space, multi-point measurements are required. Thus, M$^5$ is a five spacecraft mission, with one solar wind monitor orbiting Mars in a circular orbit at 5 Martian radii, and four smaller spacecraft in a tetrahedral configuration orbiting Mars in an elliptical orbit, spanning the far magnetotail up to 6 Mars radii with a periapsis within the Martian magnetosphere of 1.8 Mars radii. We not only present a detailed assessment of the scientific need for such a mission but also show the resulting mission and spacecraft design taking into account all aspects of the mission requirements and constraints such as mass, power, and link budgets. This mission concept was developed during the Alpbach Summer School 2022.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Regression of Suspension Violin Modes in KAGRA O3GK Data with Kalman Filters</a><span class="id">[2509.20658]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Suspension thermal modes in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors produce narrow, high-Q spectral lines that can contaminate gravitational searches and bias parameter estimation. In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such a low-temperature environment, which may further affect inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical behavior compared to typical interferometers. As these modes remain a prominent source of narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections, we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.</p></div></details></article></body>
