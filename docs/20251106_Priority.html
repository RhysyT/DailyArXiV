While their existence appears to require exotic formation or growth processes, it is possible that BH mass estimates are incorrect due to differences from the low-$z$ quasars where BH mass scaling relations are calibrated. In this work, we employ JWST MIRI-MRS spectroscopy to measure the rest-frame optical/IR properties of the four highest-redshift known luminous type-1 quasars at $7.08\leq z&lt;7.64$. We use three new broad lines to measure updated BH masses, H$\alpha$, Pa$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$, finding them to be in the range $(4-15)\cdot10^8 M_\odot$. Our black hole mass estimates from all tracers agree with each other and with previous, less accurate, ground-based measurements based on MgII. The flux ratios of the H lines deviate from expectations for case A and B recombination in the same way as in $z&lt;3$ quasars, indicating similar physical conditions in the Broad Line Region. Rest-frame near-IR continuum emission from a hot dusty torus surrounding the accretion disc is unambiguously detected in all four objects. We model the emission with SKIRTOR and constrain the inclination (face-on) and the opening angle ($\theta=40-60^\circ$) of the tori. These constraints are consistent for the four objects and with expectations from luminous quasars. We estimate a total dust mass $(1-4)\cdot10^6 M_\odot$ in the tori, corresponding to $(0.2-7)\%$ of the total dust in the quasar host galaxies. Given observed accretion rates, these SMBHs will deplete their tori in only $\sim5$ Myr. Overall, we confirm that $z&gt;7$ SMBHs in quasars could not have grown from stellar-remnant BHs if the radiative efficiency of accretion is $10\%$. We also find no evidence that inferred BH masses and accretion processes in $z&gt;7$ quasars differ significantly from their near-identical counterparts at $z&lt;3$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical evolution of stellar binaries in galactic centers</a><span class="id">[2511.02905]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar binaries in galactic centers are relevant to several observable phenomena, including hypervelocity stars, X-ray binaries, and mergers of stars and compact objects; however, we know little about the properties of these binaries. Past works have suggested that a small fraction of them should contract to a few stellar radii or collide, due to the co-operation of stellar tides and the eccentricity oscillations induced by the strong tidal field of the central massive black hole. We revisit this model with several updates. We first argue that when a binary's pericenter separation is driven down to a few stellar radii, diffusive excitation of stellar tides should quickly contract the orbit, saving the stars from collision. Instead, the stars should end up as a very tight binary. We then show that vector resonant relaxation and perturbations from passing stars – effects not included in past models – dramatically increase the prevalence of such encounters. In numerical experiments, we find that 1 in 5 binaries around 1 pc from Sgr A* should tidally contract in this way while still on the main sequence. This rate climbs to 3 in 5 around 0.01 pc, inward of which it plateaus. We briefly discuss observable implications of these results, with particular attention to young stellar binaries in the Galactic Center.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Challenge in Illuminating the Invisible: Constraining LyC Escape with Bayesian Modelling and Symbolic Regression</a><span class="id">[2511.02908]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Direct observations of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation from galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) are impeded by absorption in the intergalactic medium, requiring indirect methods to infer the escape fraction of ionizing photons ($f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$). One approach is to develop and validate such methods on local analogues of the high-redshift galaxies with directly detected LyC leakage. In this work, we constrain $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ using a Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting framework built on Prospector, which incorporates a non-parametric star-formation history, a flexible dust attenuation curve, self-consistent nebular emission, and fiber aperture-loss corrections. Our methodology jointly fits broadband photometry and emission line fluxes. We apply six models to the Low-redshift LyC Survey (LzLCS), a sample of local galaxies with properties comparable to EoR galaxies, and evaluate them based on their ability to recover the observed LyC flux and their relative Bayesian evidence. The best-performing model is further assessed through a parameter recovery test, demonstrating that $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$can be recovered within uncertainties. Building on these results, we present updated $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ estimates for the LzLCS sample, with a median of 0.3%, corresponding to very low leakage, and values reaching as high as 70%, with six of 64 galaxies having a cosmologically relevant $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ ($&gt;5%$). Additionally, we present a revised UV $\beta$-slope vs $\log_{10}(f_\mathrm{esc}^\mathrm{LyC})$ relation, derived using symbolic regression with PySR trained on a synthetic dataset generated from our best-performing model: $\log_{10}(f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}) = (-3.59\beta - 9.45) \, \pm \, 0.30$. The relation successfully reproduces the $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ obtained from full SED fitting of the LzLCS sample within uncertainties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A dust condensation instability in AGN atmospheres: failed winds and the broad line region</a><span class="id">[2511.02920]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are important drivers of galactic evolution; however, the underlying physical processes governing their properties remain uncertain. In particular, the specific cause for the generation of the broad-line region is unclear. There is a region where the underlying accretion disc atmosphere becomes cool enough for dust condensation. Using models of the disc's vertical structure, accounting for dust condensation and irradiation from the central source, we show that their upper atmospheres become extended, dusty, and radiation-pressure-supported. Due to the density–temperature dependence of dust condensation, this extended atmosphere forms as the dust abundance slowly increases with height, resulting in density and temperature scale heights considerably larger than the gas pressure scale height. We show that such an atmospheric structure is linearly unstable. An increase in the gas density raises the dust sublimation temperature, leading to an increased dust abundance, a higher opacity, and hence a net vertical acceleration. Using localised 2D hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate the existence of our linear instability. In the non-linear state, the disc atmosphere evolves into “fountains” of dusty material that are vertically launched by radiation pressure before being exposed to radiation from the central source, which sublimates the dust and shuts off the radiative acceleration. These dust-free clumps then evolve ballistically, continuing upward before falling back towards the disc under gravity. This clumpy ionized region has velocity dispersions $\gtrsim 1000$ km/s. This instability and our simulations are representative of the Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow (FRADO) model proposed for the AGN broad-line region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1): Hunting for luminous z &gt; 6 galaxies in the Euclid Deep Fields – forecasts and first bright detections</a><span class="id">[2511.02926]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The evolution of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) is a powerful probe of early star formation and stellar mass build-up. At z &gt; 6, its bright end (MUV &lt; -21) remains poorly constrained due to the small volumes of existing near-infrared (NIR) space-based surveys. The Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) will cover 53 deg^2 with NIR imaging down to 26.5 AB, increasing area by a factor of 100 over previous space-based surveys. They thus offer an unprecedented opportunity to select bright z &gt; 6 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and constrain the UV LF's bright end. With NIR coverage extending to 2um, Euclid can detect galaxies out to z = 13. We present forecasts for the number densities of z &gt; 6 galaxies expected in the final EDF dataset. Using synthetic photometry from spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of z = 5–15 galaxies, z = 1–4 interlopers, and Milky Way MLT dwarfs, we explore optimal selection methods for high-z LBGs. A combination of S/N cuts with SED fitting (from optical to MIR) yields the highest-fidelity sample, recovering &gt;76% of input z &gt; 6 LBGs while keeping low-z contamination &lt;10%. This excludes instrumental artefacts, which will affect early Euclid releases. Auxiliary data are critical: optical imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam and Vera C. Rubin Observatory distinguishes genuine Lyman breaks, while Spitzer/IRAC data help recover z &gt; 10 sources. Based on empirical double power-law LF models, we expect &gt;100,000 LBGs at z = 6-12 and &gt;100 at z &gt; 12 in the final Euclid release. In contrast, steeper Schechter models predict no z &gt; 12 detections. We also present two ultra-luminous (MUV &lt; -23.5) candidates from the EDF-N Q1 dataset. If their redshifts are confirmed, their magnitudes support a DPL LF model at z &gt; 9, highlighting Euclid's power to constrain the UV LF's bright end and identify the most luminous early galaxies for follow-up.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scylla V: Constraints on the spatial and temporal distribution of bursts and the interaction history of the Magellanic Clouds from their resolved stellar populations</a><span class="id">[2511.02947]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We measure the star formation histories (SFHs) from the Scylla survey in approximately 98,000 pc^2 and 75,000 pc^2 of the SMC and LMC, respectively, using deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging (80% complete to more than 1 mag below the ancient main-sequence turnoff, 25.1 and 26.0 mag in F475W and F814W) from 74 pointings. We group the fields into eight sub-regions in the SMC and seven in the LMC. We use the birth rate parameter to identify bursts of star formation and measure their properties in each sub-region. Our methodology provides a standardized framework for burst identification and reveals both broad and fine burst characteristics. We identify global and local bursts, defined as those occurring in at least half or less than half of a galaxy's sub-regions, respectively. In the SMC we find two global (about 5 and 1.5 Gyr ago) and one local burst (about 3 Gyr ago). In the LMC we find one global burst (about 3 Gyr ago). Comparing these findings with dynamical models of the LMC and SMC orbital histories, we find that when models predict a shared dynamical trigger for bursts across both galaxies, the burst begins earlier in the SMC with a greater enhancement in star formation rate than in the LMC. Finally, using age-metallicity relations (AMRs) and cumulative SFHs, we report that the Wing/Bridge region in the SMC resembles the southwestern LMC both chemically and in stellar mass assembly over the last about 7 Gyr, possibly due to stellar material stripped from the LMC during their last interaction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). Quenching precedes bulge formation in dense environments but follows it in the field</a><span class="id">[2511.02964]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>(Abridged) The bimodality between star-forming discs and quiescent spheroids requires the existence of two main processes: the galaxy quenching and the morphological transformation. In this paper, we aim to understand the link between these processes and their relation with the stellar mass of galaxies and their local environment. Taking advantage of the first data released by the Euclid Collaboration, covering more than 60 deg2 with space-based imaging and photometry, we analyse a mass-complete sample of nearly one million galaxies in the range 0.25&lt;z&lt;1 with $M_\ast&gt;10^{9.5} M_\odot$. We divide the sample into four sub-populations of galaxies, based on their star-formation activity and morphology. We then analyse the physical properties of these populations and their relative abundances in the stellar mass vs. local density plane. Together with confirming the passivity-density relation and the morphology-density relation, we find that quiescent discy galaxies are more abundant in the low-mass regime of high-density environment. At the same time, star-forming bulge-dominated galaxies are more common in field regions, preferentially at high masses. Building on these results and interpreting them through comparison with simulations, we propose a scenario where the evolution of galaxies in the field significantly differs from that in higher-density environments. The morphological transformation in the majority of field galaxies takes place before the onset of quenching and is mainly driven by secular processes taking place within the main sequence, leading to the formation of star-forming bulge-dominated galaxies as intermediate-stage galaxies. Conversely, quenching of star formation precedes morphological transformation for most galaxies in higher-density environments. This causes the formation of quiescent disc-dominated galaxies before their transition into bulge-dominated ones.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black holes in the low-mass galaxy regime: imprint of AGN feedback on the circumgalactic medium of central dwarf galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.02965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been observed in dwarf galaxies, yet the impact of black hole feedback in these low-mass systems remains unclear. To uncover the potential effects of AGN in the low-mass galaxy regime, we study the properties and demographics of active dwarf galaxies at $z=0$, using the IllustrisTNG simulations. We use data from the TNG50-1 simulation, selecting central galaxies with stellar masses in the range $8 \leq \log(M_\ast/{\rm M_\odot}) \leq 9.5$, and selecting AGN based on their Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$). We analyzed the properties and environment of AGN host galaxies and compared them with inactive control galaxies. The AGN fractions found in the simulation depend strongly on the threshold for $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ in the AGN selection, ranging from $\sim$ 1\% ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \geq 0.05$) to $\sim$ 24\% ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \geq 0.01$). In comparison with non-AGN galaxies of similar stellar and halo mass, dwarf AGN hosts are deficient in neutral gas, having $\sim$ 3.9 times less neutral mass, in qualitative agreement with observations. The dearth in neutral gas is stronger beyond two stellar half-mass radii ($r \gtrsim 3$ kpc), and AGN hosts have more extended gas components than non-AGN galaxies, with a gas half-mass radius, on average, $\gtrsim$ 10 kpc larger. AGN hosts are also slightly less star-forming, but have no differences in local environment. We found that AGN can significantly decrease the neutral gas component of dwarf galaxies, a direct effect of the high-accretion feedback mode employed in IllustrisTNG. However, it is important to test our findings with observations to unveil the complete role of AGN in dwarf galaxies. In TNG50, dwarf AGN fractions are an order of magnitude larger than those observed, motivating a detailed investigation to precisely quantify the mismatch between simulations and observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid: Quick Data Release (Q1)- The connection between galaxy close encounters and radio activity</a><span class="id">[2511.02970]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using the large statistics provided by both Euclid and the LOFAR surveys, we present the first large-scale study of the connection between radio emission, its morphology, and the merging properties of the hosts of radio sources up to z=2. By dividing the radio sample into active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies, we find that radio-emitting AGN show a clear preference to reside within galaxies undergoing a merging event. This is more significant for AGN that present extended and/or complex radio emission: indeed, about half of them are associated with merging systems, while only 15% are hosted by an isolated galaxy. The observed trend is primarily driven by AGN residing at z &lt; 1, especially in the case of high - P144MHz &gt; 10^24 W Hz-1 sr-1 - radio luminosities (60% in mergers versus 10% isolated regardless of radio appearance). The situation is reversed in the case of radio-emitting star-forming galaxies, which are preferentially associated with isolated systems. This is more significant as we move towards low radio-luminosity/star-formation objects (P144MHz &lt; 10^23 W Hz-1 sr-1) for which we find 40% in isolated systems versus 20% in mergers. These values hold regardless of redshift. We interpret the above result for AGN with their need to accrete outer gas from local encounters in order to trigger (radio) activity, especially in the case of extended radio emission such as hot-spots and lobes. This is mostly observed at z &lt; 1, since in the local Universe galaxies are more gas deprived than their higher-redshift counterparts. Internal gas reservoirs instead seem sufficient to trigger star formation within the majority of galaxies, which indeed prefer to be associated with isolated systems at all redshifts probed.

The satellite observes in 102 spectral bands from 0.75 to 5.0 um with a resolving power ranging from 35 to 130 in 6.2 arcsecond pixels. The observatory obtains a 5-sigma depth of 19.5 - 19.9 AB mag for 0.75 to 3.8 um and 17.8 - 18.8 AB mag for 3.8 to 5.0 um after mapping the full sky four times over two years. Scientifically, SPHEREx will produce a large galaxy redshift survey over the full sky, intended to constrain the amplitude of inflationary non-Gaussianity. The observations will produce two deep spectral maps near the ecliptic poles that will use intensity mapping to probe the evolution of galaxies over cosmic history. By mapping the depth of infrared absorption features over the Galactic plane, SPHEREx will comprehensively survey the abundance and composition of water and other biogenic ice species in the interstellar medium. The initial data are rapidly released in the form of spectral images to the public. The project will release specialized data products over the life of the mission as the surveys proceed. The science team will also produce specialized spectral catalogs on planet-bearing and low-mass stars, solar system objects, and galaxy clusters 3 years after launch. We describe the design of the instrument and spacecraft, which flow from the core science requirements. Finally, we present an initial evaluation of the in-flight performance and key characteristics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid: Quick Data Release (Q1) – Secondary nuclei in early-type galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.02988]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) are believed to form primarily through mergers of less massive progenitors, leaving behind numerous traces of violent formation histories, such as stellar streams and shells. A particularly striking signature of these mergers is the formation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, which can create depleted stellar cores through interactions with stars on radial orbits - a process known as core scouring. The secondary SMBH in such systems may still carry a dense stellar envelope and thereby remain observable for some time as a secondary nucleus, while it is sinking towards the shared gravitational potential of the merged galaxy. We leverage Euclid's Q1 Early Release data to systematically search for secondary nuclei in ETGs. We present a preliminary sample of 666 candidate systems distributed over 504 hosts (some of which contain multiple secondary nuclei). The vast majority of these fall at separations of 3 kpc to 15 kpc, indicative of normal mergers. 44 fall at projected separations of less than 2 kpc. We argue those candidates at very close angular separations are unlikely to be a consequence of chance alignments. We show that their stellar masses are mostly too large for them to be globular clusters and that a significant subset are unresolved even at Euclid's spatial resolution, rendering them too small to be dwarf galaxies. These may represent the highest-density nuclei of a previously merged galaxy, currently sinking into the centre of the new, common gravitational potential and thus likely to host a secondary SMBH. We then demonstrate that convolutional neural networks offer a viable avenue to detect multiple nuclei in the thirty-times larger sky coverage of the future Euclid DR1. Finally, we argue that our method could detect the remnants of a recoil event from two merged SMBHs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). The average far-infrared properties of \Euclid-selected star-forming galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.02989]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The first Euclid Quick Data Release contains millions of galaxies with excellent optical and near-infrared (IR) coverage. To complement this dataset, we investigate the average far-IR properties of Euclid-selected main sequence (MS) galaxies using existing Herschel and SCUBA-2 data. We use 17.6deg$^2$ (2.4deg$^2$) of overlapping Herschel (SCUBA-2) data, containing 2.6 million (240000) MS galaxies. We bin the Euclid catalogue by stellar mass and photometric redshift and perform a stacking analysis following SimStack, which takes into account galaxy clustering and bin-to-bin correlations. We detect stacked far-IR flux densities across a significant fraction of the bins. We fit modified blackbody spectral energy distributions in each bin and derive mean dust temperatures, dust masses, and star-formation rates (SFRs). We find similar mean SFRs compared to the Euclid catalogue, and we show that the average dust-to-stellar mass ratios decreased from z$\simeq$1 to the present day. Average dust temperatures are largely independent of stellar mass and are well-described by the function $T_2+(T_1-T_2){\rm e}^{-t/\tau}$, where $t$ is the age of the Universe, $T_1=79.7\pm7.4$K, $T_2=23.2\pm0.1$K, and $\tau=1.6\pm0.1$Gyr. We argue that since the dust temperatures are converging to a non-zero value below $z=1$, the dust is now primarily heated by the existing cooler and older stellar population, as opposed to hot young stars in star-forming regions at higher redshift. We show that since the dust temperatures are independent of stellar mass, the correlation between dust temperature and SFR depends on stellar mass. Lastly, we estimate the contribution of the Euclid catalogue to the cosmic IR background (CIB), finding that it accounts for &gt;60% of the CIB at 250, 350, and 500$\mu$m. Forthcoming Euclid data will extend these results to higher redshifts, lower stellar masses, and recover more of the CIB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). Spectroscopic unveiling of highly ionised lines at z = 2.48-3.88</a><span class="id">[2511.03025]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study explores a rare population of sources in a currently uncharted region of spectroscopic redshift space in the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), and is intended potentially to support upcoming spectroscopic studies. Our goal is to identify and investigate a population of sources characterised by highly ionised emission lines in their spectra, which are indicative of active galactic nucleus activity, extreme shock phenomena, or Wolf–Rayet stars. A comprehensive visual inspection of spectra is conducted to ensure the reliability of the sample, focusing on the simultaneous detection of both NeV and OII emission-line measurements, a condition that restricts the Euclid spectroscopic redshift range to z=2.48–3.88. To characterise this population, we analysed the morpho-spectrophotometric properties of their host galaxies. This allowed for a direct comparison with control sources that exhibit similar OII properties and spectroscopic redshifts, but not NeV lines. We identify sources solely based on spectroscopic criteria in the redshift range beyond the Halpha regime. Encompassing 65 potential NeV candidates, the resulting sample delivers the first systematic probe of these NeV candidate emitters at high redshift. We found a good agreement, within 1$\sigma$, between the spectral measurements calculated using both direct integration and Gaussian fitting methodologies. The NeV candidates exhibit colours similar to bright QSOs, with only a few in the tail of very red quasars. We observed a higher stellar mass content, a lower continuum around the 4000A break, and a similar Sérsic index distribution compared to the control sample. This unique sample paves the way for a wide range of scientific investigations, which will be pursued in the forthcoming data releases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03035" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Significant Evidence of an AGN Contribution in GHZ2 at z = 12.34</a><span class="id">[2511.03035]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GHZ2 is among the highest-redshift galaxies discovered to date, exhibiting a spectrum rich with prominent emission lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and optical. These features raise critical questions about the mechanism powering this nebular emission, in particular the extremely strong C IV$\lambda$1548 emission (rest-frame EW $=$ 45 Angstrom). Here we aim to quantify the AGN contribution within this system using the BEAGLE-AGN tool to simultaneously fit the spectrum and photometry of GHZ2. We consider a range of models with and without AGN components, allowing us to disentangle the stellar and AGN contribution of GHZ2 for the first time. We conclude that a partial contribution by an AGN is significantly favored based on the Bayes factor comparison to models without an AGN component, measuring an AGN contribution of 54$^{+1}_{-1}$% and 26$^{+4}_{-2}$% for the C IV$\lambda$1548 and C III]$\lambda$1908 emission lines, respectively. We obtain an estimate for the black hole mass using the accretion luminosity ($L_{acc}$) from the best fit BEAGLE-AGN model, computing a value of log$_{10}$(M$_{BH}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 7.20$^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, for an Eddington ratio of $\eta$ = 0.5 (with a systematic uncertainty of $\sim$1 dex). The inferred black hole mass to stellar mass ratio is 0.05$^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, consistent with other high redshift AGN systems. If the black hole interpretation is confirmed, GHZ2 would represent the most distant black hole identified to date, making it an ideal laboratory to study AGN growth and their role in shaping high-redshift galactic evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03064" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). Searching for giant gravitational arcs in galaxy clusters with mask region-based convolutional neural networks</a><span class="id">[2511.03064]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strong gravitational lensing (SL) by galaxy clusters is a powerful probe of their inner mass distribution and a key test bed for cosmological models. However, the detection of SL events in wide-field surveys such as Euclid requires robust, automated methods capable of handling the immense data volume generated. In this work, we present an advanced deep learning (DL) framework based on mask region-based convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNNs), designed to autonomously detect and segment bright, strongly-lensed arcs in Euclid's multi-band imaging of galaxy clusters. The model is trained on a realistic simulated data set of cluster-scale SL events, constructed by injecting mock background sources into Euclidised Hubble Space Telescope images of 10 massive lensing clusters, exploiting their high-precision mass models constructed with extensive spectroscopic data. The network is trained and validated on over 4500 simulated images, and tested on an independent set of 500 simulations, as well as real Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) observations. The trained network achieves high performance in identifying gravitational arcs in the test set, with a precision and recall of 76% and 58%, respectively, processing 2'x2' images in a fraction of a second. When applied to a sample of visually confirmed Euclid Q1 cluster-scale lenses, our model recovers 66% of gravitational arcs above the area threshold used during training. While the model shows promising results, limitations include the production of some false positives and challenges in detecting smaller, fainter arcs. Our results demonstrate the potential of advanced DL computer vision techniques for efficient and scalable arc detection, enabling the automated analysis of SL systems in current and future wide-field surveys. The code, ARTEMIDE, is open source and will be available at this http URL .</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03072" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-Gaussian Magnetic Structures in the Small-Scale Turbulent Dynamo</a><span class="id">[2511.03072]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The small-scale turbulent dynamo is a key mechanism for amplifying galactic magnetic fields, yet the resulting field morphology remains poorly understood. Using 3D driven turbulence simulations across a range of compressibilities, characterised by Mach number, and Minkowski functionals, we quantitatively investigate the morphology of magnetic fields generated by the small-scale turbulent dynamo in both the exponentially growing kinematic stage and the statistically steady saturated stage. In both stages and across all Mach numbers, we find that the magnetic field departs significantly from a Gaussian random field. Magnetic structures are statistically less curved and more interconnected in the saturated stage than in the kinematic stage, with these morphological differences decreasing as compressibility increases. Our work provides a quantitative description of how density fluctuations in turbulence and the back-reaction of amplified magnetic fields via the Lorentz force together shape complex, non-Gaussian magnetic structures and offers a valuable framework for comparing simulations with polarisation observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peculiar galaxies I: A Catalog of Polar-Ring Galaxies from the TNG50 Simulation</a><span class="id">[2511.03127]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The hydrodynamic cosmological simulation, TNG50, is employed to conduct an analysis of multi-spin galaxies that exhibit ringed structures composed of gas and stars that orbit nearly perpendicular around a host galaxy, known as polar ring galaxies (PRG). To ensure a robust sample, we select subhalos based on the angle subtended by the angular momentum profiles, as well as on a visual inspection. The analysis is focused on galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10$^{9}$ M$_\odot$. In addition, a dynamic decomposition is employed to separate the stellar and gaseous ring from the host galaxy. This results in a sample of 32 subhalos with PRGs. This sample exhibits properties similar to those observed. These include colours typical of early-type galaxies (ETGs) or those transitioning toward blue systems. Most host galaxies are classified as ETGs, with 37.5\% exhibiting a disk-dominated morphology. The mean bulge-to-total (B/T) ratio is 0.64. Rings have average radii that are 2.36 and 3.41 times larger than their effective radii for the stellar and gaseous components, respectively, with star formation occurring predominantly within the rings. In contrast with observations, rings in the simulation tend to be less massive and slightly less perpendicular. The obtained sample displays a variety of host galaxy morphologies, including wide and narrow rings, providing a robust framework for studying the varied structural characteristics of PRG variants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quasi-Periodic Polarized Emissions from Kink Structure in Magnetized Relativistic Jets</a><span class="id">[2511.03140]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent polarimetric observations of blazars indicate the development of current-driven (CD) kink instability after passing the recollimation shocks in the relativistic jets and association with quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). To investigate multi-wavelength polarized features of CD kink instability in jets, we develop {\tt RaptorP}, a new special relativistic module of the polarized General Relativistic Radiative Transfer (GRRT) code {\tt RAPTOR}. Based on 3D SRMHD simulations of over-pressured magnetized jets, we find that jet images vary at different frequencies. At low frequencies, the emission comes from the turbulent ambient medium surrounding the jet that obscures the inner jet structure. Electronic Vector Position Angle (EVPA) patterns are perpendicular to the jet propagation direction, indicating a dominance of the poloidal magnetic field. At high frequencies, bright knots and twisted kink structures appear, and EVPA patterns are consistent with a toroidal magnetic field. We also find that QPOs in light curves of intensity and linear polarization (degree and angle). The peak frequency in Power Spectral Densities (PSDs) is well-matched with the rotation period of the kink structure in relativistic jets. It shows an anti-correlation between total intensity and the degree of polarization at a lower inclination angle. Our findings, based on realistic polarized radiation calculations, will explain the observational signatures seen in blazars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03195" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Multi-Phase Circumgalactic Medium of DESI Emission-Line Galaxies at z 1.5</a><span class="id">[2511.03195]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the multi-phase circumgalactic medium (CGM) of emission line galaxies (ELGs) at $z\sim1.5$, traced by MgII$\lambda2796$, $\lambda2803$ and CIV$\lambda1548$, $\lambda1550$ absorption lines, using approximately 7,000 ELG-quasar pairs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Our results show that both the mean rest equivalent width ($W_{0}$) profiles and covering fractions of MgII and CIV increase with ELG stellar mass at similar impact parameters, but show similar distributions when normalized by the virial radius. Moreover, warm CIV gas has a more extended distribution than cool MgII gas. The dispersion of MgII and CIV gas velocity offsets relative to the galaxy redshifts rises from $\sim100 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$ within halos to $\sim 200 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$ beyond. We explore the relationships between MgII and CIV $W_{0}$ and show that the two are not tightly coupled: at a fixed absorption strength of one species, the other varies by several-fold, indicating distinct kinematics between the gas phases traced by each. We measure the line ratios, FeII/MgII and CIV/MgII, of strong MgII absorbers and find that at $&lt;0.2$ virial radius, the FeII/MgII ratio is elevated, while the CIV/MgII ratio is suppressed compared with the measurements on larger scales, both with $\sim4-5\, \sigma$ significance. We argue that multiphase gas that is not co-spatial is required to explain the observational results. Finally, by combining with measurements from the literature, we investigate the redshift evolution of CGM properties and estimate the neutral hydrogen, metal, and dust masses in the CGM of DESI ELGs – found to be comparable to those in the ISM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of Free-Floating Planets via Ejection: Population Synthesis with a Realistic IMF and Comparison to Microlensing Observations</a><span class="id">[2511.03246]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Microlensing observations suggest that the mass distribution of free-floating planets (FFPs) follows a declining power-law with increasing mass. The origin of such distribution is unclear. Using a population synthesis framework, we investigate the formation channel and properties of FFPs, and compare the predicted mass function with observations. Assuming FFPs originate from planet-planet scattering and ejection in single star systems, we model their mass function using a Monte Carlo based planet population synthesis model combined with N-body simulations. We adopt a realistic stellar initial mass function, which naturally results in a large fraction of planetary systems orbiting low-mass stars. The predicted FFP mass function is broadly consistent with observation: it follows the observed power-law at higher masses ($10 \lesssim m/M_\oplus &lt; 10^4$), while at lower masses ($0.1 &lt; m/M_\oplus \lesssim 10$) it flattens, remaining marginally consistent with the lower bound of the observational uncertainties. Low-mass, close-in planets tend to remain bound, while Neptune-like planets at wide orbits dominate the ejected population due to their large Hill radii and shallow gravitational binding. We also compare the mass distribution of bound planets with microlensing observations and find reasonably good agreement with both surveys. Our model predicts $\simeq 1.20$ ejected planets per star in the mass range of $0.33 &lt; m/M_\oplus &lt; 6660$, with a total FFP mass of $\simeq 17.98~M_\oplus$ per star. Upcoming surveys will be crucial in testing these predictions and constraining the true nature of FFP populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A semi-analytical mock galaxy catalog for the CSST extragalactic surveys from the Jiutian simulations</a><span class="id">[2511.03281]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a mock galaxy catalog built for the CSST extragalactic surveys using the primary runs of the Jiutian $N$-body simulation suites.

The Euclid Galactic Bulge Survey represents a unique opportunity to revisit a large number of past events and attempt the lens-source resolution of known events falling in the covered area. As the analysis of individual events requires non-negligible efforts, it is important to establish priorities among all possible targets, identifying those candidates with the higher chance for a successful resolution of the lens from the source and with the highest scientific interest. Drawing from the databases of the three main microlensing surveys (OGLE, MOA and KMTNet), we compile the complete catalog of past microlensing events in the Euclid survey footprint up to year 2023, containing 8081 entries. By re-modeling all events and cross-checking with Galactic models, we estimate the relative lens-source proper motions for all events. Taking into account all uncertainties, for each microlensing event we are able to estimate the probability that the lens is separated from the source by more than a given angular distance threshold. Hence, we rank all events by their resolution probability, providing additional useful information that will guide future analyses on the most promising candidates. A particular attention is dedicated to known planetary microlensing events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03374" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Distribution of Earth-Impacting Interstellar Objects</a><span class="id">[2511.03374]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper we calculate the expected orbital elements, radiants, and velocities of Earth-impacting interstellar objects. We generate a synthetic population of $\sim10^{10}$ interstellar objects with M-star kinematics in order to obtain $\sim10^4$ Earth-impactors. The relative flux of impactors arriving from the direction of the solar apex and the galactic plane is enhanced by a factor of $\sim2$ relative to the mean. The fastest impactors also arrive from these directions, although Earth-impactors are generally slower than objects in the overall population. This is because the Earth-impacting subset contains a higher fraction of low-eccentricity hyperbolic objects which are more strongly affected by gravitational focusing. Earth-impacting interstellar objects are more likely to have retrograde orbits close to the ecliptic plane. A selection effect makes the distribution of inclination of Earth-impacting interstellar objects uniform/sinusoidal at low/high perihelion distances. In turn, low perihelion impactors have higher impact probability towards the ecliptic plane. The overall impactor population therefore exhibits an intermediate inclination distribution between uniform and sinusoidal. The highest velocity impacts are most likely to occur in the spring when the Earth is moving towards the solar apex. However, impacts in general are more likely to occur during the winter when the Earth is located in the direction of the antapex. Interstellar objects are more likely to impact the Earth at low latitudes close to the equator, with a slight preference for the Northern hemisphere due to the location of the apex. These distributions are independent of the assumed interstellar object number density, albedos, and size-frequency distribution and are publicly available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Life in the dark: Potential urability of moons of rogue planets</a><span class="id">[2511.03392]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Free-floating planets are thought to be numerous in the Galaxy and may retain their moons after ejection from their natal systems. If those satellites acquire or preserve orbital eccentricity, tidal dissipation could provide a long-lasting internal heat source, potentially creating urable environments (capable of enabling abiogenesis) in the absence of stellar radiation. We explore (i) whether moons remain bound to planets expelled by a core-collapse supernova, (ii) how the explosion reshapes their orbits, and (iii) under which circumstances tidal heating can sustain urable subsurface oceans. We carried out three-dimensional N-body simulations with an 8th-order Runge-Kutta scheme, modelling homologous stellar mass loss for progenitors of 10 M$_{\odot}$. Post-explosion orbital elements of single moons and resonant moon systems were analysed, and tidal heating power was estimated with a constant phase-lag model for several tidal dissipation functions and moon densities. All simulated moons survive the supernova and remain bound to their planets. The explosion excites moon eccentricities up to $\sim7\times10^{-4}$ and $\sim3\times10^{-3}$ for single moons of planets with circular and eccentric orbits, respectively. For resonant pairs, an eccentricity of $\leq2\times10^{-2}$ is preserved. The semi-major axis of the moons changes by $\leq0.2\%$. For 12-15\% of cases – preferentially moons at $a\leq15\,R_{\mathrm{planet}}$ and with $e\geq10^{-3}$ – the specific tidal heating power lies between 0.1 and 10 times what is estimated on Europa or Enceladus, sufficient to maintain liquid oceans beneath an ice crust. Eccentricity damping timescales exceed the age of the Solar System for $a\geq10\,R_{\mathrm{planet}}$, implying billions of years of continuous heating on the moons. Such worlds represent promising targets for future searches for extraterrestrial life.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The subtle statistics of the distance ladder: On the distance prior and selection effects</a><span class="id">[2511.03394]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Statistical methodology is rarely considered significant in distance ladder studies or a potential contributor to the Hubble tension. We suggest it should be, highlighting two appreciable issues. First, astronomical distances are inferred latent parameters, requiring a prior. We show that the common assumption of (perhaps implicit) uniform priors on distance moduli biases distances low due to objects being intrinsically uniformly distributed in volume. At fixed measured redshifts, this biases the Hubble constant high. Second, selection effects introduce additional factors in the posterior. These typically counteract the effect of the volume prior to some extent, but depend significantly on the nature of the selection. Typical assumptions place $H_0$ at the top of the plausible range, corresponding to a redshift-selected sample. After a detailed analytic and mock-based study of these effects, we apply them to the CosmicFlows-4 sample, where introducing the distance prior causes an approximately 12 per cent increase in distances and $&gt;8$ km/s/Mpc (55 statistical $\sigma$) decrease in the Hubble constant for the case of volume or magnitude selection. Redshift selection would fully undo this shift and is the more likely scenario, as a phenomenological model shows. We also investigate the SH0ES sample, where the volume-prior effect is modest ($1.6\sigma$) and is likely already accounted for within the SH0ES pipeline. Our work highlights the crucial need to model both the distance prior and selection accurately for robust distance ladders and derived parameters. The latter requires samples with known, homogeneous selection criteria, which should be prioritised in future surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark-Matter-Powered Population III Evolution: Lifetimes, Rotation, and Quasi-Homogeneity in massive Stars</a><span class="id">[2511.03540]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Population III stars supplied the first light and metals in the Universe, setting the pace of re-ionisation and early chemical enrichment. In dense haloes their evolution can be strongly influenced by the energy released when WIMPs annihilate inside the stellar core. We follow the evolution of a \(20\,M_\odot\) Population III model with the \textsc{genec} code, adding a full treatment of spin dependent WIMP capture and annihilation. Tracks are calculated for six halo densities from \(10^{8}\) to \(3\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}\) and three initial rotation rates between zero and \(0.4\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\). As soon as the capture product reaches \(\rho_\chi\sigma_{\mathrm{SD}}\simeq2\times10^{-28}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-1}}\), the dark-matter luminosity rivals hydrogen fusion, stretching the main-sequence lifetime from about ten million years to more than a gigayear. The extra time allows meridional circulation to smooth out differential rotation; a star that begins at \(0.4\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\) finishes core hydrogen burning with near solid-body rotation and a helium core almost twice as massive as in the dark-matter-free case. Because the nuclear timescale is longer, chemically homogeneous evolution now sets in at only \(0.2\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\), rather than the \(\gtrsim0.5\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\) required without WIMPs. For a star with \(0.4\,v/v_{\mathrm{crit}}\), the surface hydrogen fraction drops to \(X\!\sim\!0.27\), helium rises to \(Y\!\sim\!0.73\), and primary \(^{14}\mathrm N\) increases by four orders of magnitude at He exhaustion. Moderate rotation combined with plausible dark-matter densities can therefore drive primordial massive stars towards long-lived, quasi-homogeneous evolution with distinctive chemical and spectral signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiative transfer modeling of the low-mass proto-binary system, IRAS 4A1 and 4A2</a><span class="id">[2511.03543]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>NGC 1333 IRAS4A is a well-studied low-mass sun-like proto-binary system. It has two components, A1 and A2, which are diverse according to their physical and chemical properties. We modeled this hot corino using the RATRAN radiative transfer code and explained different spectral signatures observed towards A1 and A2, specifically for CH3OH and H2CO. Our main goal is to understand the kinematical and chemical differences between A1 and A2 and to classify their dust emission and absorption properties. We considered a simple 1D spherical infalling envelope consisting of collimated outflow in the source. Recent high-resolution interferometric observations of ALMA shed new light on why the same molecular transitions towards A1 and A2 show different spectral profiles. The significant difference between spectral profiles observed towards A1 and A2 is mainly due to the dust opacity effect. Dust continuum emission toward A1 is optically thick, causing the transitions observed in absorption. Meanwhile, A2 is optically thin, leading to the observed emission profiles, and an inverse P-Cygni profile suggests the presence of an infalling envelope. Using high-resolution observations from ALMA and VLA, we expanded our model from the millimeter wavelength range to the centimeter wavelength range. This expansion demonstrates the opacity effect, which is reduced in the centimeter wavelength range, causing us to observe the lines in emission. Using our model, we reproduced the population inversion causing maser emission of methanol 44 GHz and 95 GHz transitions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03562" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living on the edge.

We demonstrated that this excess population is spatially correlated with the box edges; the smallest TNG50 box is most affected by these problems. This is a unique and irreplaceable resource for studying galaxy structure. Manual inspection confirmed abrupt, unphysical mass-loss events coincident with boundary crossings.

However, there is a discrepancy in the ratio of the singly deuterated methanol isotopologues, CH2DOH/CH3OD, between low- and high-mass protostars, which puts into question whether prestellar isotopic ratios are generally preserved during the star- and planet-forming process. Resolving this puzzle is only made harder by the complete lack of data on this ratio in the prestellar stage. This work presents observations with the IRAM 30m telescope that securely detect CH3OD in the prestellar core L1448 in Perseus and tentatively in B213-C6 in Taurus. This work constrains the ratio of CH2DOH/CH3OD and the D/H ratios for both singly deuterated methanol isotopologues for the first time at the prestellar stage. Column densities calculated under the assumption of local thermal equilibrium lead to a CH2DOH/CH3OD ratio of 2.8-8.5 in L1448 and $\leq$ 5.7 in B213-C6. The values are marginally consistent with the statistically expected ratio of 3, but most assumptions put the values in an elevated range in line with values found around low-mass protostars. The D/H ratio in CH2DOH is between 3.6% and 6.8% in L1448 and in the range of 2.4-5.8% in B213-C6. The D/H ratio derived for CH3OD is lower, namely 1.4-4.4% in L1448 and $\leq$ 3.8% in B213-C6.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMA and JWST Imaging of $z\ &gt;\ 6$ Quasars: No Spatial Position Offset Observed Between Quasars and Their Host Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.03659]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a study determining the spatial offset between the position of the supermassive black hole (as traced through their broad line regions) and the host galaxy in six $z &gt; 6$ quasars.

We determined the quasar's position from $\lesssim$ 400 pc resolution James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Camera (JWST NIRCam) imaging. We estimated the observational uncertainties on the quasar's position using astrometric data from the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) of field stars within the NIRCam images. We find that all six quasars are found within the central $\sim 400$ pc of their host galaxy dust continuum and [CII] emission. Apparent offsets seen in rest-frame optical JWST observations are not detected in our ALMA data, suggesting they likely result from dust obscuration rather than a true physical separation between the SMBH and its host galaxy. Kinematic modeling of these data further reveals that none of the galaxies show evidence for recent merger activity, and most of the galaxies can be accurately modeled using a simple disk model. The lack of an offset supports theoretical models that predict that positional offset within these galaxies are either short-lived or intrinsically rare.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D Full Spectrum Fitting: Algorithm Comparison</a><span class="id">[2511.03663]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Full spectrum fitting is the prevailing method for extracting stellar kinematic and population measurements from 1D galaxy spectra. 3D methods refer to analysis of Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) data where spatial and spectral dimensions are modelled simultaneously. While several 3D methods exist for modelling gas structures there has been less investigation into the more computationally demanding problem of 3D full spectrum fitting for stellar recoveries. This work introduces and compares two algorithms for this task: the Projected Nesterov Kaczmarz Reconstruction method (PNKR) and a version of the Bayes-LOSVD software which has been modified to account for spatial correlations. We aim to understand strengths and weaknesses of both algorithms and assess the impact of 3D methods for stellar inferences. We apply both recovery algorithms to a mock IFS data over a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range from 20-200 and evaluate the quality of the recoveries compared to the known ground truth. Accounting for spatial correlations in Bayes-LOSVD significantly improved the accuracy and precision of kinematic recoveries. 3D modelling with PNKR did not provide any significant improvement over 1D fits however, for SNR&gt;40, PNKR did recover the most accurate kinematics overall. Additionally, by modelling the joint distribution over kinematics and populations, PNKR could successfully infer trends between these quantities e.g. inferring local metallicity-velocity trends, albeit with a significant bias on the absolute metallicity. Having demonstrated advantages of (i) 3D modelling with Bayes-LOSVD, and (ii) joint kinematic-population analyses with PNKR, we conclude that both methodological advances will prove useful for detecting and characterising stellar structures from IFS data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Only Nitrogen-Enhanced Galaxies Have Detectable UV Nitrogen Emission Lines at High Redshift</a><span class="id">[2511.03681]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detections of bright UV nitrogen emission lines in some high-redshift galaxies suggest unexpectedly high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios ($\log(\rm N/O)\gtrsim-1.0$) compared to local values ($\log(\rm N/O)\gtrsim-1.5$) at similar metallicities ($12+\log(\rm O/H)\lesssim8.0$). Although the presence of these `N-enhanced' galaxies indicates signatures of atypical chemical enrichment processes in the early universe, the prevalence of nitrogen enhancement in high-$z$ galaxies is unclear.

We find that CEERS can only detect galaxies with significant nitrogen enhancement ($\log(\rm N/O)\gtrsim-0.4$), while JADES can only detect galaxies with moderately elevated N/O ratios compared to local values ($\log(\rm N/O)\gtrsim-1.0$). Even for the deepest exposure in JADES, UV nitrogen lines produced by `N-normal' galaxies at $z&gt;5$ are too faint and thus not detectable, making their nitrogen abundance unmeasurable. Our results suggest that the existing sample of galaxies with measurable nitrogen abundances at $z\gtrsim5$ is incomplete and biased toward galaxies with significantly elevated N/O ratios. Deep ($t_{\rm exp}\sim40-500\,$hours) spectroscopic surveys will be crucial for building a complete sample to study nitrogen enrichment mechanisms in the early universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Echoes of the First Stars: Massive Star Evolution in Extremely Metal-Poor Environments with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</a><span class="id">[2511.03715]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A remarkable span of frontier astrophysics, from gravitational-wave archaeology to the origin of the elements to interpreting snapshots of the earliest galaxies, depends sensitively on our understanding of massive star formation and evolution in near-pristine, relatively enriched gas. From the surprisingly massive black holes detected by LIGO/Virgo to highly ionized nebulae with peculiar enrichment patterns observed in galaxies at Cosmic Dawn, evidence is mounting that our understanding of massive-star populations at very low metallicity remains critically incomplete. The fundamental limitation is the hand nature has dealt us: only a few star-forming galaxies within $\lesssim$1 Mpc can currently be resolved into individual stars, and none reach the extreme metallicities and star-formation intensities that characterized the early Universe. With an ultraviolet integral-field spectrograph aboard the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), this barrier will finally be broken. HWO will bring rare, actively star-forming, extremely metal-poor dwarf galaxies at $\sim$10-20 Mpc such as I Zw 18 within reach of resolved UV-optical spectroscopy, providing our first direct, statistical view of individual massive stars and the feedback they drive at $&gt;$30 $M_\odot$ and $&lt;$10% $Z_\odot$. This science is deeply synergistic with many next-generation facilities, yet requires the unique combination of spatial resolution and UV/optical sensitivity that only HWO can provide. The massive star science enabled by HWO within the Local Volume represents a transformational advance in our ability to probe the earliest stellar populations - those that seeded the Milky Way and other galaxies with the first heavy elements, and paved the way for life in the transparent, reionized Universe we inhabit today.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capturing Turbulence with Numerical Dissipation: a Simple Dynamical Model for Unresolved Turbulence in Hydrodynamic Simulations</a><span class="id">[2410.23339]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modeling unresolved turbulence in astrophysical gasdynamic simulations can improve the modeling of other subgrid processes dependent on the turbulent structure of gas: from flame propagation in the interiors of combusting white dwarfs to star formation and chemical reaction rates in the interstellar medium, and nonthermal pressure support of circum- and intergalactic gas. We present a simple method for modeling unresolved turbulence in hydrodynamic simulations via tracking its sourcing by local numerical dissipation and modeling its decay into heat. This method is physically justified by the generic property of turbulent flows that they dissipate kinetic energy at a rate set by the energy cascade rate from large scales, which is independent of fluid viscosity, regardless of its nature, be it physical or numerical. We calibrate and test our model against decaying supersonic turbulence simulations. Despite its simplicity, the model quantitatively reproduces multiple nontrivial features of the high-resolution turbulence run: the temporal evolution of the average small-scale turbulence, its dependence on spatial scale, and the slope and scatter of the local correlation between subgrid turbulent velocities, gas densities, and local compression rates. As an example of practical applications, we use our model in isolated galactic disk simulations to model locally variable star formation efficiency at the subresolution scale. In the supersonic, star-forming gas, the new model performs comparably to a more sophisticated model where the turbulent cascade is described by explicit subgrid terms. Our new model is straightforward to implement in many hydrodynamic codes used in galaxy simulations, as it utilizes already existing infrastructure to implicitly track the numerical dissipation in such codes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMA chemical survey of disk-outflow sources in Taurus (ALMA-DOT) VII: the layered molecular outflow from HL Tau and its relationship with the ringed disk</a><span class="id">[2501.03920]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ringed disk around HL Tau stands out as the iconic signature of planet formation, but the origin of the substructures is still debated. The HL Tau system also drives a powerful bipolar wind, and we analyze its outermost component traced by CO emission, to determine the relationship of the flow with the disk and its substructures. We use ALMA observations of the ${}^{12}$CO (2-1) line at 1.3 mm, with 0.2 km/s and   0.28&quot; resolution, conducted within the ALMA-DOT project. The channel maps and position-velocity diagrams show a rich structure of concatenated bubble- and arc-shaped features, whose size and distance from the source increase with velocity. The superposition of the features generates the apparent conical shape. The tomographic reconstruction of the morphology and kinematics of the red-shifted lobe suggests the presence of distinct nested shells having higher velocity and steeper velocity gradient for shells closer to the axis, rotating in the same sense of the disk. Such configuration can be justified by different classes of models. In this paper we compare the derived wind parameters with the predictions of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk winds. Under this hypothesis, the launch radii of the three outermost shells are found to be at about the position of three adjacent dust rings in the disk at 58, 72 and 86 au. The wind may be capable of removing angular momentum from the outer disk, and we derive a magnetic lever arm of $\lambda \sim 4 - 5$, higher than that commonly adopted for MHD winds from these regions. Interpretations are discussed. The arrangement of the wind in nested shells with brighter emission rooted at the location of ring substructures could support the results of non-ideal MHD simulations according to which magnetic instabilities can generate the disk ring-gap system with a connected layered wind, alternatively to the action of yet undetected protoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray properties of massive compact relic galaxies</a><span class="id">[2505.14768]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the X-ray analysis of seven local compact elliptical galaxies (cEGs), selected for their morphological resemblance to high-redshift red nuggets. As likely descendants of the red nugget population, cEGs offer a unique window into the early Universe, enabling the study of early galaxy evolution and the interplay between black holes, stellar bulges, and dark matter halos. Using data from Chandra and XMM-Newton, we investigate the properties of the hot gaseous halos in cEGs. Two galaxies - MRK 1216 and PGC 32873 - host luminous, spatially extended X-ray atmospheres, allowing us to derive radial thermodynamic profiles. For MRK 1216, we performed high-resolution spectral modeling with RGS data, which hints at super-solar $\alpha/\rm{Fe}$ abundance ratios. The remaining galaxies show either faint or undetected X-ray halos, though several display AGN-like (active galactic nucleus) power-law emission. In the context of local scaling relations, cEGs show only mild deviations from the general galaxy population, exhibiting a slightly steeper $M_{\star}-L_{X}$ relation and occupying the lower boundary of the $M_{\star}$-$M_{\rm vir}$ relation. These trends suggest that high-redshift red nuggets may also host a diverse range of X-ray atmospheres. We speculate that the compactness of cEGs may trace back to the population of `little red dots' (LRDs), hinting at a potential link between LRDs, red nuggets, and compact relic galaxies in the local Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15089" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soft X-ray line emission from hot gas in intervening galaxy halos and diffuse gas in the cosmic web</a><span class="id">[2506.15089]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic hot-gas emission is closely related to halo gas acquisition and galactic feedback processes. Their X-ray observations reveal important physical properties and movements of the baryonic cycle of galactic ecosystems. However, the measured emissions toward a target at a cosmological distance would always include contributions from hot gases along the entire line of sight to the target. Observationally, such contaminations are routinely subtracted via different strategies. With this work, we aim to answer an interesting theoretical question regarding the amount of soft X-ray line emissions from intervening hot gases of different origins. We tackled this problem with the aid of the TNG100 simulation. We generated typical wide-field light cones and estimated their impacts on spectral and flux measurements toward X-ray-emitting galaxy-, group- and cluster-halo targets at lower redshifts. We split the intervening hot gases into three categories; that is, the hot gas that is gravitationally bound to either star-forming or quenched galaxy halos, and the diffuse gas, which is more tenuously distributed permeating the cosmic web structures. We find that along a given line of sight, the diffuse gas that permeates the cosmic web structures produces strong oxygen and iron line emissions at different redshifts. The diffuse gas emission in the soft X-ray band can be equal to the emission from hot gases that are gravitationally bound to intervening galaxy halos. The hot-gas emission from the quiescent galaxy halos can be significantly less than that from star-forming halos along the line of sight. The fluxes from all of the line-of-sight emitters as measured in the energy band of 0.4–0.85 keV can reach  20–200 % of the emission from the target galaxy, group, and cluster halos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19457" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal tails in open clusters: Morphology, binary fraction, dynamics, and rotation</a><span class="id">[2508.19457]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: This research presents unsupervised machine learning and statistical methods to identify and analyze tidal tails in open star clusters using data from the Gaia DR3 catalog. Aims: We aim to identify member stars and to detect and analyze tidal tails in five open clusters, BH 164, Alessi 2, NGC 2281, NGC 2354, and M67, of ages between 60 Myr and 4 Gyr. These clusters were selected based on the previous evidence of extended tidal structures. Methods: We utilized machine learning algorithms such as Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and principal component analysis (PCA), along with statistical methods, to analyze the kinematic, photometric, and astrometric properties of stars. Key characteristics of tidal tails, including radial velocity, the color-magnitude diagram, and spatial projections in the tangent plane beyond the cluster's Jacobi radius, were used to detect them. We used N-body simulations to visualize and compare the observables with real data. Further analysis was done on the detected cluster and tail stars to study their internal dynamics and populations, including the binary fraction. We also applied the residual velocity method to detect rotational patterns in the clusters and their tails. Results: We identified tidal tails in all five clusters, with detected tails extending farther in some clusters and containing significantly more stars than previously reported (tails ranging from 40 to 100 pc, one to four times their Jacobi radius, with 100-200 tail stars). The luminosity functions of the tails and their parent clusters were generally consistent, and tails lacked massive stars. In general, the binary fraction was found to be higher in the tidal tails. Significant rotation was detected in M67 and NGC 2281 for the first time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The GECKOS Survey: revealing the formation history of a barred galaxy via structural decomposition and resolved spectroscopy</a><span class="id">[2509.15976]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Disentangling the (co-)evolution of individual galaxy structural components remains a difficult task, owing to the inability to cleanly isolate light from spatially overlapping components. In this pilot study of PGC 044931, observed as part of the GECKOS survey, we utilise a VIRCAM $H$-band image to decompose the galaxy into five photometric components, three of which dominate by contributing $&gt;50\%$ of light in specific regions: a main disc, a boxy/peanut bulge, and a nuclear disc. When the photometric decompositions are mapped onto MUSE observations, we find remarkably good separation in stellar kinematic space. All three structures occupy unique locations in the parameter space of the ratio of the light-weighted stellar line-of-sight mean velocity and velocity dispersion ($\rm{V}_{\star}/\sigma_{\star}$), and the high-order stellar skew ($h_{3}$). These clear and distinct kinematic behaviours allow us to make inferences about the formation histories of the individual components from observations of the mean stellar ages and metallicities of the three components. A clear story emerges: the main disc built over a sustained and extended star formation phase, possibly partly fuelled by gas from a low-metallicity reservoir. Early on, that disc formed a bar that buckled and subsequently formed a nuclear disc in multiple and enriched star-formation episodes. This result is an example of how careful photometric decompositions, combined with spatially well-resolved stellar kinematic information, can help separate out age-metallicity relations of different components and therefore disentangle the formation history of a galaxy. The results of this pilot study can be extended to a differential study of all GECKOS survey galaxies to assert the true diversity of Milky Way-like galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Walk on the Retrograde Side (WRS) project.

The analysis was perfomed in comparison with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) remnant, within the fully self-consistent and homogeneous framework established by the 'A Walk on the Retrograde Side' (WRS) project. We analysed high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with UVES at VLT for 212 red giant branch stars classified as candidate members of Thamnos and GSE, based on selections in the space of the integrals of motion. We derived precise abundances for 16 atomic species. Compared to GSE, stars attributed to the Thamnos substructure are, on average, more metal-poor, yet most of them show higher [X/Fe] abundance ratios in several elements, such as Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Cu, Zn, as well as lower [Eu/Fe]. The majority of candidate Thamnos stars show chemical signatures more consistent with the in situ Milky Way halo rather than a typical low-mass accreted dwarf galaxy. Our findings are further supported by comparisons with tailored galactic chemical evolution models, which fall short in reproducing the observed enhancement in the $\alpha$-elements, but are able to fit the more metal-poor component present in the Thamnos substructure. These results confirm a high level of contamination in the Thamnos substructure from the in situ population and to a lesser degree from GSE, while still leaving room for a genuine accreted population from a small disrupted dwarf galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luminosity-Dependent Assembly Bias of Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing and Clustering</a><span class="id">[2510.21377]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Assembly bias, which is the variation in halo clustering at fixed mass driven by formation history, has long been predicted by numerical simulations but remains difficult to confirm observationally. Previous studies have reported evidence for halo assembly bias by dividing samples according to galaxy stellar mass using various methods. In this work, we present observational measurements of halo assembly bias based on the luminosity of spectroscopically confirmed brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Using cluster catalogs and shear measurements from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, we employ a mass-dependent halo-bias model to disentangle halo bias from its underlying mass dependence in galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering measurements. We confirm that brighter BCGs reside in more concentrated halos yet are less strongly clustered on large scales, with a relative bias ratio deviating from unity at the $\sim 3\sigma$ level, providing clear evidence of assembly bias. The results are further supported by the FLAMINGO and MillenniumTNG hydrodynamical simulations, in which we directly detect assembly bias signals consistent with the observations, thereby strengthening the connection between galaxy luminosity and halo formation history.</p></div></details></article>

In our Solar System, we observe its effects directly: atmospheric escape, chemical disruption, and spectacular auroral displays. Yet for exoplanets, we lack the tools and data to comprehensively assess the impacts of space weather, especially invisible elements like stellar winds, coronal mass ejections, energetic particles, and variable interplanetary magnetic fields. This problem lies at the intersection of four key fields: heliophysics, planetary science, astrobiology, and astrophysics. In 2023–2025, experts from these four fields convened at the W. M. Keck Institute for Space Studies to explore pathways for advancing the study of exospace weather. Organizing the subject into five core themes – planets and their stellar particle environments, stellar magnetism and space weather modeling, quasi-steady stellar winds, transient events, and programmatic pathways – our team synthesized concepts from across relevant fields and identified a wide array of opportunities for progress. This report is the product of that effort. It assembles cross-disciplinary knowledge; highlights outstanding theoretical challenges; explores promising innovations in observation, modeling, methodology, and instrumentation; and makes recommendations for accelerating community-wide progress. Together, these lay out a path to transforming the challenging, yet tractable problem of exospace weather into a foundational element of our understanding exoplanetary systems, and our own Solar System, in their entirety.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02917" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling the Cosmos: XMM-Newton's Scientific Strategy</a><span class="id">[2511.02917]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In December 2024, the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton X-ray Observatory celebrated the 25th anniversary of its launch. The annual number of peer-reviewed articles utilising XMM-Newton data has exhibited a consistent upward trajectory over the past two and a half decades, attaining more than 400 in 2022. The annual call for observing time proposals continues to experience a high level of oversubscription, typically ranging from a factor of 6 to 7. In order to enhance the scientific discovery space, XMM-Newton, primarily through the Project Scientist and Science Operations Centre, has pursued a strategy of expansion, which can be grouped into three phases: Large Projects with long observing time (2006-2009), Joint Observations (2011-2016), and Targets of Opportunity (2016-2024), respectively. A salient feature of XMM-Newton's time allocation is the systematic removal of biases from the second call onwards, a strategy that has enabled the attainment of comparable gender success rates and high acceptance rates for young scientists over 25 years, a feat only recently accomplished by similar missions through the introduction of double-anonymous review. XMM-Newton research is conducted by an active community of 4,300 scientists, of which approximately 570 are leading (1st author). The foundation of this community and its research is predicated on XMM-Newton data, with the project's policy of user support and calibration being fundamental constituents, as well as the project's active engagement and communication with its members.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secondary standards in the UKIRT faint standard fields</a><span class="id">[2511.02945]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present precise J- and K-band photometric measurements for 128 near-infrared secondary standard stars, located in the 19 UKIRT/MKO primary faint standard fields.

However, residual aberrations, especially non-common path aberrations between the AO channel and the coronagraph channel, limit the instrument performance. While post-processing techniques such as spectral or angular differential imaging (ADI) can partially address those issues, they suffer from self-subtraction and inefficiencies at small angular separations or when observations are conducted far from transit. We previously demonstrated the on-sky performance of coherent differential imaging (CDI), which offers a promising alternative. It allows for isolating coherent starlight residuals through speckle modulation, which can then be subtracted from the raw images during post-processing. This work aims to validate a CDI method on real science targets, demonstrating its effectiveness in imaging almost face-on circumstellar disks, which are typically challenging to retrieve with ADI. We temporally modulated the speckle field in VLT/SPHERE images, applying small phase offsets on the AO deformable mirror while observing stars surrounded by circumstellar material: HR 4796A, CPD-36 6759, HD 169142, and HD 163296. We hence separated the astrophysical scene from the stellar speckle field, whose lights are mutually incoherent. Combining a dozen of data frames and reference coronagraph point spread functions through a Karhunen-Loève image projection framework, we recover the circumstellar disks without the artifacts that are usually introduced by common post-processing algorithms (e.g., self-subtraction). The CDI method therefore represents a promising strategy for calibrating the effect of static and quasi-static aberrations in future direct imaging surveys. Indeed, it is efficient, does not require frequent telescope slewing, and does not introduce image artifacts to first order.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The first year of LISA Galactic foreground</a><span class="id">[2511.03604]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galactic white-dwarf binaries play a central role in the inference model for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

These challenges are emblematic of broader issues in decision science, where model over-parameterization and prior sensitivity can compromise both computational tractability and the reliability of the results. We address these issues in the framework of hierarchical Bayesian modeling by introducing a reparameterization strategy. Our approach employs Normalizing Flows (NFs) to decorrelate the parameters governing hierarchical priors from those of astrophysical interest. The use of NF-based mappings provides both the flexibility to realize the reparametrization and the tractability to preserve proper probability densities.

In this work, we present a statistical method to detect and characterize RTN-affected pixels using a series of dark frames. Identifying RTN contaminated pixels enables post-processing strategies that mitigate their impact and the development of manufacturing quality metrics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self-gravity in thin protoplanetary discs: 1. The smoothing-length approximation versus the exact self-gravity kernel</a><span class="id">[2506.10812]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planet-forming discs often contain structures like spiral arms, typically linked to the disc's gravitational forces. In 2D models, an ad hoc softening prescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical structure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short distances and doesn't respect Newton's third law. To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation, we developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported discs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a precise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D numerical tests. The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian gravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from light to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In contrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of leading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational runaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances. We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods based on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational efficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations inherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent treatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that makes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to studying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by 2D-flat numerical simulations. Accordingly, in an accompanying paper, we will investigate how the occurence of the gravitational instability is affected.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02179" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A general polynomial emulator for cosmology via moment projection</a><span class="id">[2507.02179]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present MomentEmu, a general-purpose polynomial emulator for fast and interpretable mappings between theoretical parameters and observational features. The method constructs moment matrices to project simulation data onto polynomial bases, yielding symbolic expressions that approximate the target mapping. Compared to neural-network-based emulators, MomentEmu offers negligible training cost, millisecond-level evaluation, and transparent functional forms. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we develop two emulators: PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$, which maps six cosmological parameters to the CMB power spectra (TT, EE, BB, TE), and PolyCAMB-peak, which enables a bidirectional mapping between the cosmological parameters and the acoustic peak features of $D_\ell^{\rm TT}$. PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$ achieves sub-percent accuracy over multipoles $\ell \leq 4050$, while PolyCAMB-peak also attains comparable precision and produces symbolic forms consistent with known analytical approximations. The method is well suited for forward modelling, parameter inference, and uncertainty propagation, particularly when the parameter space is moderate in dimensionality and the mapping is smooth. MomentEmu offers a lightweight and portable alternative to regression-based or black-box emulators in cosmological analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First release of LiteBIRD simulations from an end-to-end pipeline</a><span class="id">[2507.07122]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The LiteBIRD satellite mission aims at detecting Cosmic Microwave Background $B$ modes with unprecedented precision, targeting a total error on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of $\delta r \sim 0.001$.

The shearing box formalism offers a conceptually simple framework for studying differential rotation in the local approximation. Aimed at self-gravitating, and importantly, vertically stratified PPDs, we develop two novel methods for solving Poisson's equation in the framework of the shearing box with vertical vacuum boundary conditions (BCs). Both approaches naturally make use of multi-dimensional fast Fourier transforms for computational efficiency. While the first one exploits the linearity properties of the Poisson equation, the second, which is slightly more accurate, consists of finding the adequate discrete Green's function (in Fourier space) adapted to the problem at hand. To this end, we have revisited the method proposed by Vico et al. (2016) and have derived an analytical Green's function satisfying the shear-periodic BCs in the plane as well as vacuum BCs, vertically. Our spectral method demonstrates excellent accuracy, even with a modest number of grid points, and exhibits third-order convergence. It has been implemented in the NIRVANA-III code, where it exhibits good scalability up to 4096 CPU cores, consuming less than 6% of the total runtime. This was achieved through the use of P3DFFT, a fast Fourier Transform library that employs pencil decomposition, overcoming the scalability limitations inherent in libraries using slab decomposition. We have introduced two novel spectral Poisson solvers that guarantees high accuracy, performance, and intrinsically support vertical vacuum boundary conditions in the shearing-box framework. Our solvers enable high-resolution local studies involving self-gravity, such as MHD simulations of gravito-turbulence or gravitational fragmentation.</p></div></details></article></body>
