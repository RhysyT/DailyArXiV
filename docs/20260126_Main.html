Using Gaussian Processes, we can determine if various datasets are consistent, independently of dark energy or modified gravity models, and of the sound horizon and SNIa peak magnitude. We found that the DES-Y5 SNIa data showed non-negligible tension with other datasets. However, the recent update DES-Dovekie removes this tension. We find that all uncalibrated data from DESI DR2 BAO and three SNIa datasets, Union3, Pantheon+, and DES-Dovekie, are consistent with each other within $\sim 1\sigma$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolutions of mean distance ratios in the planetary and satellite systems under primary tides and nebular gas drag effects</a><span class="id">[2601.16245]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The near geometrical progressions of distances of main regular secondaries in the planetary system and in the satellite systems of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus are often disregarded, contrary to other regular orbital features. Among dynamical effects other than direct gravitational interactions, primary tides and gas drag cause the secondary's semi-major axis to evolve secularly. The consequences of these two effects on the mean ratios of secondary orbital distances are assessed for the four systems. A general relation is first derived to estimate a past initial mean distance ratio and is characterised for primary tides and for the drag caused by primordial nebulae. Results show first that the mean distance ratios of the four systems did not evolve sensibly under primary tidal action for periods corresponding to the age of the Solar System, and that the mean distance ratios are approximately conserved after the dissipation of initial nebulae. Secondly, the mean distance ratios may not have changed much due to gas drag caused by primaeval nebulae after formation of initial proto-secondaries and for periods corresponding to assumed lifetimes of nebulae, depending on initial nebulae models and on periods of effective drag. These results involve only the systems' mean distance ratios and do not imply that neither the secondary distances nor the individual distance ratios are conserved. Resonances among secondaries mean motions would reinforce the approximate conservation of mean distance ratios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16253" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion Rate Changes Detected in a Polluted White Dwarf</a><span class="id">[2601.16253]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This letter reports statistically significant changes in the equivalent widths of MgII and CaII lines in the dusty and polluted white dwarf WD 0106-328, based on six epochs of spectroscopy using the VLT and Keck spanning 25 yr. Furthermore, the ratio of these two equivalent widths may also vary, with a 7% probability of being constant. Between 2000 and 2025, both Mg and Ca have experienced decreases in accretion rates, of approximately 20 and 60%, respectively, but with individual variation during the interim. These metal abundance decreases are the first empirical corroboration of diffusion theory in white dwarfs, which predict sinking timescales on the order of days for this star. However, the persistent atmospheric metals require a more gradual, circumstellar process, where one possibility is viscous spreading in an ionized disk of metals, consistent with $\alpha\approx0.1$ within that formalism. The combination of optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope detects all the major rock-forming elements (O, Mg, Si, Fe), and demonstrates that Fe dominates the accreted material by mass, and that it is delivered mostly as pure metal from within a differentiated parent body. This inference is consistent with the possibility that chemically-segregated accretion may result from a combination of planetary assembly, fragmentation, disk evolution, and be observed on relatively short timescales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assessing the Vera Rubin Observatory's Ability to Discover Asteroid Impactors Before They Collide with Earth</a><span class="id">[2601.16255]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Asteroid impactors larger than  10 m, from Chelyabinsk-scale airburst and Tunguska-scale events to &gt;300 m continental threats, remain the dominant planetary-defense risk. While the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will transform Solar System science, its observing cadence and survey design were not specifically optimized to discover imminent impactors. To assess its performance, we introduce a new method for efficiently generating synthetic impactor populations by minimally perturbing sampled NEOMOD3 orbits and evaluate their discovery efficiency with the Sorcha survey simulator. Our simulations show that LSST discovers 79.7% of large impactors (&gt;140 m), decreasing to 50.3% for upper mid-sized (50-140 m), 26.8% for lower mid-sized (20 - 50 m), and 10.5% for small objects (10-20 m). Warning times of the discovered impactors show a similar size dependence: small objects are typically discovered only weeks before impact (median:12.4 days), lower mid-sized within a month (median: 21.5 days), and upper mid-sized objects on timescales of a few months (median: 106.2 days). 39.0% of large impactors are discovered more than a year before impact, lacking long-lead warning despite their brightness. A loss-mode analysis reveals the underlying cause that small impactors are limited mainly by photometric sensitivity, whereas mid-sized and large objects are missed primarily due to cadence and linking constraints from LSST and its Solar System Processing (SSP) Pipelines. These results show that LSST excels at discovering faint, small impactors, but cannot by itself guarantee long-lead warning across the hazardous size spectrum. Coordinated multi-survey strategies will therefore be essential in the LSST era to achieve robust planetary-defense capability, and we study a complementary high-cadence, shallow-depth example with the Argus Array.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring the Black Hole and Accretion Parameters of Sagittarius A* from EHT Observations using a Semi-Analytic Model</a><span class="id">[2601.16267]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration produced the first image of the apparent shadow of the central black hole of Sagittarius A$^*$ (\sgra). \sgra source structure varies significantly on timescales shorter than the duration of an observation, preventing improved data coverage through Earth rotation aperture synthesis. This rapid variability provides the opportunity to quantify intrinsic variability and separate time-variable emission features from stable signatures of strong gravity and the accretion environment. To infer the properties \sgra and its surrounding accretion flow, we perform Bayesian inference on a series of EHT data segments (“snapshots”). We directly fit parameters of a semi-analytic emission model jointly with complex station gains to snapshot visibilities, then extract estimates of the time-averaged, persistent source structure and temporal variability by stacking snapshots in a Bayesian hierarchical model. This approach successfully reproduces parameters of General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics simulations using synthetic EHT observations. Even with physically motivated assumptions about the \sgra environment, black hole spin and magnetic field parameters are poorly constrained by 2017 EHT observations. Our inference constrains other parameters, favoring a nearly face-on observer inclination ($\theta_{\rm o} = 9.2\degree \pm 3.6 \degree \pm_{\rm v} 11.6\degree$), an emission peak near the horizon ($R_{\rm peak} = 4.9 \pm 0.1 \pm_{\rm v} 0.5\,GM/c^2$), near-vertical projected spin position angle ($p.a. = 7.3\degree \pm 7.08 \degree \pm_{\rm v} 43.5\degree$ counterclockwise from vertical), and dominant emission $43.4\degree \pm 2.0\degree \pm_{\rm v} 5.9\degree$ above the equatorial plane, where we separate average structure uncertainty ($\pm$) from the impacts of temporal variability and model misspecification ($\pm_{\rm v}$).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16277" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relaxing DESI DR2 BAO Constraints on $\sum m_ν$ with Planck and SPT-3G 2018 in the Context of SPT D1</a><span class="id">[2601.16277]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present constraints on the sum of neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu$ from a dataset incorporating the full SPT-3G 2018 TT/TE/EE+lensing spectra together with Planck PR4 lensing and low-$\ell$ parts of the Planck PR3 spectra. Using it as a baseline for the DESI DR2 BAO measurements, we arrive at a $95\%$ upper limit of $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.11$ eV, relaxing the tension between $\rm \Lambda$CDM and lower bounds on $\sum m_\nu$ based on neutrino oscillation experiments. When including DES Y1 weak lensing information and the Pantheon+ SNIa catalog, the limit is further loosened to $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.138$ eV with a slight preference for $\sum m_\nu&gt;0$. On contrast, replacing SPT-3G 2018 primary CMB and lensing spectra with ones from the SPT-3G 2019-2020 (D1) release tightens the overall constraint to $&lt;0.082$ eV and pushes the $\sum m_\nu$ posterior mode value to zero, indicating a preference for quasi-negative neutrino masses in line with the D1 analysis. This is a curious shift within SPT-3G measurements of the same field taken in 2018 and in 2019-2020 and processed with different analysis pipelines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MeerKAT observations of Abell 1775 and Abell 1795: the discovery of a hadronic radio halo?</a><span class="id">[2601.16288]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Giant radio haloes are diffuse synchrotron sources typically found in merging galaxy clusters, while smaller mini-haloes occur in cool-core clusters. Both trace cosmic-ray electrons in the intracluster medium, though recent observations suggest their distinction is not always clear. We present new 903-1655 MHz MeerKAT observations of Abell 1775 and Abell 1795, both hosting cool cores and cold fronts. Combined with reprocessed 120-168 MHz LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey data, we perform imaging and spectral analyses of their radio emission. In both clusters, we detect radio haloes with distinct inner and outer components. In Abell 1775, the halo appears diffuse at 1.3 GHz, while LOFAR images reveal steep-spectrum filaments. In Abell 1795, the inner component corresponds to a previously reported mini-halo candidate, but the full structure extends to $\sim$1 Mpc with a spectral index of $\alpha=-1.08\pm0.06$. The presence of such a large, flat-spectrum halo in a dynamically relaxed cluster makes Abell 1795 an outlier relative to typical merging systems. This suggests that some relaxed clusters may still retain sufficient turbulence to sustain particle re-acceleration, or that hadronic interactions producing secondary electrons play a significant role. Together with other recent discoveries in cool-core systems, our results indicate that some large radio haloes may have been overlooked in past studies due to limited dynamic range near bright central AGN. Finally, we detect steep-spectrum emission south of Abell 1795's central AGN, tracing a 45 kpc X-ray and optical filament that terminates in an X-ray cavity, likely linked to a past AGN outburst.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unifying cluster and galaxy cosmology analyses using the galaxy-halo connection</a><span class="id">[2601.16353]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxies and galaxy clusters trace the same cosmic density field, but their statistics have been modeled separately in cosmological analyses.

TOI-6692 b was first detected as a community TESS Object of Interest (cTOI) by the Visual Survey Group and the Planet Hunters group as a single transit candidate via TESS observation. The period was subsequently confirmed via radial velocity monitoring from the Planet Finder Spectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan telescope. Additional radial velocities were acquired with the CHIRON, FEROS, and CORALIE spectrographs. LCOGT ground-based photometric follow-up was conducted over 2 weeks to detect another transit and refine the period. Although we did not detect an ingress or egress of the 11.04 hr transit, we did detect a possible in-transit signal in the multi-night data and provide an updated ephemeris for future monitoring. TOI-6692 b is one of few planets with orbital periods longer than 100 days that have a secure mass, radius, and eccentricity detection. As with most giant planets at these orbital periods, the eccentricity of TOI-6692 b is lower than that expected of planets undergoing high-eccentricity tidal migration, but is more consistent with the expectations of planet-planet scattering outcomes. A long-term radial velocity trend was detected and further monitoring is warranted to determine the outer companion period. TOI-6692 b is also one of few TESS single transit targets that have its period eventually confirmed via follow-up photometric campaigns timed to capture transits despite the relatively large ephemeris uncertainties. Such efforts highlight the capabilities of night-to-night stability on ground-based photometric facilities today.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot, Retrograde Tilted MADs: Misaligned, Precessing, and Shaped by Electromagnetic Torques</a><span class="id">[2601.16370]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tilted accretion disks in the magnetically arrested (MAD) state may be present in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei such as Sgr A* and M87. We have carried out 3D global GRMHD simulations to study the evolution of these accretion flows as a function of black hole spin and misalignment angle. Prograde MADs align with the spin through a two-stage process: an initial rapid alignment phase that operates on the magnetic flux saturation timescale, followed by a slower, spin-independent phase. In contrast, retrograde MADs remain persistently misaligned regardless of the black hole spin, displaying solid-body precession at rates four times higher than weakly magnetized flows at the same spin magnitude. By deriving torque equations in ideal GRMHD and evaluating them in a frame aligned with instantaneous disk orientation, we demonstrate that electromagnetic (EM) torques always act to align the disk with the BH spin, but are countered by opposing hydrodynamic fluxes in retrograde flows. We further develop a preliminary empirical model to explain the cause of two-stage prograde alignment and discuss the possibility of alignment in the retrograde MAD. Strongly magnetized, retrograde, misaligned accretion disks provide a candidate scenario for the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in black hole X-ray binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XMM-Newton observations of ten high-redshift CAMIRA clusters of galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.16386]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from XMM-Newton observations of ten high-redshift ($0.81 &lt; z &lt; 1.17$) galaxy clusters selected from the CAMIRA catalog based on high richness ($N &gt; 40$). These massive clusters, identified in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program field, provide an ideal sample for probing the dynamical state of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the early Universe. We performed uniform X-ray imaging and spectral analyses to measure the ICM temperature and bolometric luminosity, and investigated cluster morphology through offsets between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the X-ray peak. Extended X-ray emission was detected from all targets, but only one system was classified as dynamically relaxed, indicating a low relaxed fraction ($\sim 10\%$) at high redshift. By combining this high-$z$ sample with a lower-redshift CAMIRA cluster sample, we derived scaling relations among richness, temperature, luminosity, and mass. The results are broadly consistent with predictions from both the self-similar model and the baseline model incorporating the mass–concentration relation. We find no significant redshift evolution, strengthening the view that cluster scaling relations are largely established by $z \sim 1$. We also examined the AGN fraction among member galaxies and found significantly higher AGN activity in high-redshift clusters, particularly in the outskirts, suggesting enhanced AGN triggering during early cluster assembly and a possible connection to the thermodynamic state of dynamically young clusters. These findings provide new insights into the formation and evolution of massive clusters and the thermodynamic history of the ICM, and complement large-area X-ray surveys such as eROSITA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16558" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-wavelength Study of A Superflare on RS CVn-type Star HD22468 Triggered at Hard X-ray by SVOM</a><span class="id">[2601.16558]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detection of stellar flares at hard X-ray is still rare at the current stage. A transient was recently detected by the hard X-ray camera, ECLAIRs onboard the SVOM mission at 11:39:01.2UT on 2025, January 09. Simultaneous monitor in the optical band on the ground by SVOM/GWAC and follow-up spectroscopy enable us to confirm that the transient is caused by a superflare on HD 22468, a RS CVn-type star. The bolometric energy released in the flare is estimated to be $\sim7.2\times10^{37}-1.7\times10^{38}\ \mathrm{erg}$. The hard X-ray spectra of the event at the peak can be reproduced by the “apec” model of a hot plasma with a temperature of $106^{+27}_{-22}$ MK. In the optical range, the H$\alpha$ emission-line profile obtained at $\sim1.7$ hrs after the trigger shows a bulk blueshift of $-96\pm20\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, which can be explained by either a chromospheric evaporation or a prominence eruption. The ejected mass is estimated to be $3.9\times10^{20}$ g for the evaporating plasma, and to be $3.2\times10^{21}\ \mathrm{g}&lt;M_{\mathrm{p}}&lt;8.8\times10^{21}\ \mathrm{g}$ for the erupted prominence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GRBAlpha, VZLUSAT-2 and GRBBeta – GRB observations with CubeSats</a><span class="id">[2601.16609]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Results from GRBAlpha, VZLUSAT-2 and GRBBeta CubeSats and their on-board gamma-ray detectors for monitoring transients are summarised in this article. GRBAlpha was a 1U CubeSat launched in March 2021 to a 550 km altitude polar orbit carrying a CsI(Tl) scintillator gamma-ray burst (GRB) detector with a sensitive range of approximately 30-900 keV. It successfully operated for over four years until June 2025 when it de-orbited. VZLUSAT-2 was a 3U CubeSat launched in January 2022 to a 535 km altitude polar orbit and de-orbited in November 2025 after almost four years of smooth operation. It carried on board two GRB detectors very similar to the one used on GRBAlpha. Both missions have detected about 360 gamma-ray transients, including over 170 long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and including the most intense GRB ever recorded GRB 221009A and the second brightest GRB 230307A. The new family member, GRBBeta 2U CubeSat, integrated at Masaryk University, was launched in July 2024 to a 580 km altitude, 62 degree inclination orbit. It has been detecting GRBs since its launch without any trouble. Gamma-ray detectors on these nanosatellites are based on CsI(Tl) scintillator readout by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). These missions also provide a unique opportunity to study the radiation damage of SiPMs in the low Earth orbit environment and monitor the radiation belts. We have demonstrated that CubeSats can be used in missions lasting beyond three years and routinely detect GRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16641" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological analysis of a viable $f(R)$ gravity model</a><span class="id">[2601.16641]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Since viable $f(R)$ gravity models must reconcile early-universe inflation with late-time acceleration, we specifically study the dynamical behavior of such a theory during the matter-dominated to dark-energy-dominated transition epoch.

We mentioned that their current values are similar to latest observations data and $\Lambda$CDM-model values. Furthermore, we plotted the fitting of the distance modulus about this model using SN Ia observation data. Therefore we find that the $f(R)$ gravity model is consistent with the SN Ia data, meanwhile, explains the late-stage acceleration of the Universe.

We adopt an agnostic approach, using transition energy density, transition pressure, the discontinuity strength, and a constant speed of sound for quark matter as our parameter space to construct a large possibility of hybrid equations of state, and thereby encapsulating a comprehensive picture of the twin star scenario. First, we report the complete conditions on our parameter space imposed by the general relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium solutions. For a fixed transition energy density and speed of sound for quark matter, we define distinct ranges of transition pressures based on the allowed strengths of discontinuity. Below a maximum transition pressure, a range of discontinuity exists that increases as the transition pressure decreases. Thereby, we identify the loci of the limits on discontinuities as the `witch-hat' curves. Based on the causality limit, the witch-hat curves can be punctured or incomplete. Strong constraints on this picture are drawn from the inferences from GW170817 and the NICER measurements. We computed the maximum mass for twin stars to be $2.05~M_\odot$, the allowed strongest discontinuity in rest-mass density to be $7.76\rho_\mathrm{sat}$, and the upper bound on transition rest-mass density to be $4.03\rho_\mathrm{sat}$. Subsequently, we compute the implications of the stiffness of the quark matter equation of state on this picture. Different confidence levels for observational inferences are considered to assess the extent of inclusion (and rejection) of hybrid equations of state and, consequently, their effects on the limits of the maximum mass of twin stars and phase transition properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16714" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pushchino Multibeam Pulsar Search.

By incorporating the effects of thermal absorption, we show that PBHs can undergo significant mass growth, leading to extended lifetimes and substantial deviations from the standard Hawking evaporation scenario. We find a critical collapse efficiency, $\gamma_{\rm c} \simeq 0.395$, above which the PBH mass grows without bound. This correction has profound implications for both PBH-induced reheating and dark matter (DM) production. Specifically, we find that the reheating temperature can be suppressed, and the DM parameter space for the PBH reheating scenario can undergo $\mathcal{O}(10)$-$\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ corrections, depending on the PBH formation mass and collapse efficiency.

With a likely orbital period of 1.164 d or 2.327 d, the origin of the SSS component is controversial, with the two current models being either steady He-burning on the white dwarf surface, or that it is a helium nova in the decaying phase. To help resolve this issue we present extensive new long-term spectroscopy (with SALT) and photometry (at SAAO and with OGLE) of [HP99] 159 which (a) supports 2.327 d as the orbital period, and (b) finds only a small He II radial velocity modulation. The latter is surprising as it implies a very low inclination system, whereas our light curve modelling suggests $i{\sim}50^\circ$, and hence that the He II must be produced in outflowing material further above, or beyond, the disc. We find that the decaying nova model cannot fit our OGLE light curve and the observed SSS flux level. [HP99] 159 has been essentially constant as an SSS over several decades, implying a sustained high level of mass-transfer from its He star donor, making it the only confirmed single-degenerate scenario SN Ia progenitor. We have updated the known SSS binary parameters and find a clear $\sim$1.5 mag difference in their $M_{\rm V}$ when compared to the $M_{\rm V} - \Sigma$ properties of LMXBs, likely due to the larger irradiated areas and more luminous donors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16798" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Superhumps in active dwarf novae.

In this work, we identify six new CBO candidates, designated ZTF-CBO-1 through ZTF-CBO-6, through a systematic search of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) photometry. These systems exhibit deep ($\gtrsim$1 mag) periodic dimming events with orbital periods ranging from $\sim$30 to $\sim$530 days and occultation durations spanning 32%-77% of their orbital periods. Such large duty cycles rule out the interpretation of circum-companion material occultation. Spectral energy distributions of ZTF-CBO-1 and ZTF-CBO-2 reveal infrared excess indicative of a dust component. TESS observations of ZTF-CBO-1 show no hours- to days-timescale variability during ingress and egress, indicating a smooth disk edge.

Cosmography is useful for interpreting data in cosmology without imposing assumptions about the field equations of gravity or the matter content in the Universe. Some cosmography methods, denoted covariant cosmography, go even further and stay agnostic to the underlying space-time metric. Due to their high level of generality, covariant cosmography methods can incorporate the anisotropies and inhomogeneities in the observer's vicinity, and may in turn inform about the associated curvature of the relevant structures in our cosmic neighbourhood. Thus, covariant cosmography is a powerful model-independent tool for analysing cosmological data while also enabling the mapping of our local cosmic neighbourhood. In order to be able to explore the covariant cosmography framework to its fullest, it must be tested in tractable models and simulations. In this paper we derive the cosmography of luminosity distance to fourth order in redshift and investigate it in the special case of axially symmetric Szekeres models. We compare the numerical results for the distance-redshift relations of synthetic observers placed within the Szekeres structures with the predictions from the cosmography, and comment on the found level of approximation of the cosmography in relation to other results in the litterature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A more inclusive effective dark fluid equation of state parameter: constraints from SKA and Euclid like surveys</a><span class="id">[2601.16899]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We forecast constraints on an effective dark fluid equation of state parameter $w_{\rm eff}$ that encapsulates modified gravity theories that modifies both the Universe background expansion as well as its large scale structures growth.

We adopt next stage SKA survey specifications, alone or in combination with concurrently expected DR3 Euclid survey release, paying attention to the modeling and recipe of the implementation of the galaxy clustering and lensing probes obtained from the two surveys. We consider two data mock models: one with deviation of the intermediate parameters at the level of 10 \% (yielding however $w_{\rm eff}=-1.03$) and another sub-percently close to $\Lambda$CDM. We found that the three parameters deviation from $\Lambda$CDM could only be detected at 1 $\sigma$ from SKA alone, while this improves to $\sim$ 2 $\sigma$ when we combine with Euclid. An improvement of the order of 30\% on the bounds is reached after projecting the three parameters into a single $w_{\rm eff}$ parameter. However, this affects both cases and thus it does not change much, though it improves the level of detection with respect to $\Lambda$CDM values. We conclude that synergy from both surveys benefits to tighten our constraints, but also that our highly generalized parameterization, although impacting at both the background and the perturbation level, will be hard to disentangle from $\Lambda$CDM at the level at which our forecast is performed and it still needs, to the least, data from more advanced stages of the adopted surveys to hope reach this target.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drawing the line between explosion and collapse in electron-capture supernovae – I.

Recent work has shown that a thermonuclear explosion is also a possible outcome. The division between the two regimes has not yet been mapped out. In this study, we investigate the conditions under which the transition from thermonuclear explosion to collapse occurs, and what physical mechanisms drive each outcome. We conducted a parameter study of 56 3D hydrodynamic simulations of ECSN in ONe white dwarfs using a level set based flame model implemented in the Leafs code. We varied both the ignition location and the central density at ignition to determine the conditions of the transition regime. Additionally, we explored two different laminar flame parameterizations and how they impact the simulation outcome. From our parameter study, we find a transition density in the range of $\log\rho_c^{ini}=10.0$ and $10.15$ g cm$^{-3}$, depending on the ignition location and utilized laminar flame speed parameterization. Importantly, we find that for sufficiently high central densities, the burned ashes can sink into the core and trap large amounts of neutron-rich material in the bound remnant. In the transition regime between explosion and collapse, we find that the laminar flame speed plays a critical role by suppressing the formation of instabilities and thereby reducing the nuclear energy generation needed to overcome the collapse. We find that a thermonuclear explosion is possible for a wide range of parameters, whereby a more off-center ignition allows for higher central densities to still result in an explosion. Both the conditions at ignition and the flame physics are critical in determining the outcome. Detailed 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the preceding stellar evolution and the ignition process of the thermonuclear flame are necessary to accurately predict the outcome of ECSNe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Magnetoacoustic Wave Behavior with Gravitationally Stratified, Magnetically Inhomogeneous Media</a><span class="id">[2601.16920]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nature of MHD waves within inhomogeneous media is fundamental to understanding and interpreting wave behavior in the solar atmosphere. We investigate fast magnetoacoustic wave behavior within gravitationally stratified, magnetically inhomogeneous media, by studying a magnetic environment containing a simple 2D X-type magnetic null point. The addition of gravitational stratification fundamentally changes the nature of the system, including breaking the symmetry. There are two main governing effects: the stratified density profile acts in combination with the inhomogeneous magnetic field, creating a large gradient in the Alfven speed and hence a system replete with refraction. The system is investigated using both numerical simulations and a semianalytical WKB solution (via Charpit's method and a fourth-order Runge-Kutta solver) and we find strong agreement between both.

However, its value is often determined by considering an asymptotic constant value that works for all redshift, or else following a chosen parameterisation. Here we formulate the growth index as function of three quantities that could be directly related to observables in redshift bins, $f\sigma_8(z_i)$, $f(z_i)$ and $H(z_i)$. We determine its value and its derivative at observed nodal center of redshift bins and use the shape function method, after showing insightful connection with its underlying governing virtual-work conservation principle, to construct a redshift dependence of the $\gamma$ without assuming a specific parameterization. We then use the resulting shape function to test if we can disentangle between different scenarios where there are discrepancies between its three constituent measured components. We also tested whether it can be used to rule out models of modified gravity, or extended parametric models of the growth index that capture more general behaviors with an additional parameter as function of the scale factor or dark energy. Adopting forecasted measurements from next generation surveys on the three quantities used to construct $\gamma$, we find that reported discrepancies between them could be detected with our method, but at the bins where the errors and lost of precision from our addition of degrees of freedom is small with respect to the deviation of $\gamma$. The same could be concluded for first order extensions to $\gamma$ or common modified gravity models, and to a lesser degree for dynamical dark energy models after supposing the latest DESI values. We conclude that this method is a strong tool to investigate cosmology in a model-independent way especially with forthcoming data delivered by further stage-IV surveys with more stringent uncertainties.(Abridged)</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forecast on the generalised dark matter properties from a Euclid-like survey</a><span class="id">[2601.16943]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Stage IV \textit{Euclid} mission will deliver spectroscopic galaxy redshifts together with photometric positions and shapes, enabling cosmological analyses through spectroscopic galaxy clustering (GCsp), photometric galaxy clustering (GCph), weak-lensing cosmic shear (WL), and their cross-correlation (XC).

It measures the 2D angular deviations of the average redshift of a given matter tracer under an input redshift shell. Since it depends on the galaxy bias, it can be used to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity through the scale-dependent bias effect. We analyze a sample of quasars built upon the Gaia satellite and unWISE data, Quaia, to measure the local non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\rm NL}$. This sample is particularly suitable for measuring $f_{\rm NL}$ due to its large volume coverage. We measure the ARF power spectra from the Quaia catalog and combine their information with the 2D (projected) galaxy density and their cross-correlation with the $Planck$ PR4 CMB lensing maps lensing to jointly constrain $f_{\rm NL}$. Assuming the universality relation, we measure $f_{\rm NL} = -3 \pm 14$ at 68% confidence level by combining Quaia quasar angular density and ARF with the CMB lensing. This result is the second tightest constraint on $f_{\rm NL}$ using LSS two-point statistics to date and the best measurement achieved using two-point projected summary statistics, improving by $\sim$25% the previous measurement from Quaia. Our results motivate the inclusion of ARF as an additional cosmological observable in future 2D analysis of upcoming datasets from large surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16962" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calibrating redshift distributions at $z&gt;2$ with Lyman-$α$ forest cross-correlations</a><span class="id">[2601.16962]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the feasibility of using Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forests to calibrate the ensemble redshift distribution of the high-redshift tail ($2&lt;z&lt;3$) of photometric galaxies.

Due to large redshift-space distortions in the Ly$\alpha$ forest, the conventional $n(z)$ estimator for clustering redshifts does not apply, and we develope a theoretical framework to model the angular cross-correlation directly. Using the simulations, we explore effects of instrumental noise, continuum fitting, and contamination in the Ly$\alpha$ forest, cross-correlation angular scales ($\theta$), and redshift bin size ($\Delta z$) on the signal-to-noise (SNR) of the measurements. We find that continuum fitting methods strongly impact the SNR of the measurements. With our baseline continuum fitting method, \texttt{LyCAN}, at angular scales $\theta\sim10$ arcmin and $\Delta z=0.1$, we measure the cross-correlation signal at $24\sigma$. If the shape of the redshift distribution and galaxy bias evolution are known well for $z&lt;2$, the cross-correlation can constrain the mean redshift of the galaxy sample to $\sigma_z/(1+\bar{z}) = 0.006$ at a mean redshift of $\bar{z}=2$.

Experiments performed at altitudes exceeding the dark matter de Broglie wavelength experience the same orbit-averaged field amplitude as in the absence of scattering. Quantum clocks are capable of detecting variations in fundamental parameters due to the dark matter background. If based on the International Space Station, they are therefore well-suited to probe dark matter masses $m_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{-9} \text{\, eV}$. Moreover, when the dark matter de Broglie wavelength is smaller than Earth's radius ($m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 10^{-10}$ eV), the dark matter profile around Earth exhibits a dipole feature. In Low Earth Orbits this dipole temporally modulates potential dark matter signals. This provides a powerful cross-check of the orbit-averaged effect and can enhance the sensitivity of these experiments. We find optical clocks could give rise to world-leading constraints in some cases.

Here, we resolve this long-standing uncertainty by constructing the first high-resolution, structurally realistic model of the lunar GW response. We achieve this by combining high-fidelity spectral-element simulations with the analytical power of normal-mode perturbation theory, thereby resolving topographical effects down to $3.7$ km grid spacing while maintaining the capacity to discern global free-oscillation patterns. This dual-methodology approach not only recovers the expected predominant quadrupole ($l=2$) oscillation mode, but also exposes a systematic signal amplification of $(10-20)\%$ in thick-crust regions. This enhancement is traced by our normal-mode analysis to a mode-coupling process, in which the original quadrupolar oscillation induced by the passing GWs distributes energy into a series of higher-order modes, the hybridized eigenmodes of the laterally heterogeneous Moon. Near certain eigen-frequencies and at specific locations, we observe up to tenfold amplification, highlighting the power of numerical simulations in resolving these structurally fine-tuned features.

The potential near the inflection point is approximately flat, with a local maximum next to a local minimum, prone to eternal inflation. We show that a sufficient condition for eternal inflation is $\lambda_1 \leq 3$, where $\lambda_1$ is the index of the `exponential tail,' the lowest eigenvalue of the Fokker–Planck equation over a bounded region. We write $\lambda_1$ in terms of the model parameters for linear and quadratic regions. Wide quadratic regions inflate eternally if the second slow-roll parameter $\eta_V \geq -6$. We test example models from the literature and show this condition is satisfied; we argue eternal inflation is difficult to avoid in inflection point PBH models. Eternally inflating regions correspond to type II perturbations and form baby universes, hidden behind black hole horizons. These baby universes are inhomogeneous on large scales and dominate the multiverse's total volume. We argue that, if volume weighting is used, eternal inflation makes inflection point primordial black hole models incompatible with large-scale structure observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Constraints on Neutrino Masses in a Second-Order CPL Dark Energy Model</a><span class="id">[2508.16238]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent DESI results indicate a strong preference for dynamical dark energy (DE) when baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. We analyze the exponential (EXP) parameterization, which introduces a second-order correction to CPL. We determine and compare the 95% upper bounds on the sum of neutrino masses for three dark energy (DE) models – $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and EXP – across four neutrino mass hierarchies (1 massive/2 massless, degenerate, normal, inverted) and multiple dataset combinations (CMB$+$BAO, CMB$+$BAO$+$PantheonPlus, CMB$+$BAO$+$DESY5), employing both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks with physical lower limits from oscillation experiments (0.059 eV and 0.11 eV). Our results show that CPL yields tighter ($\lesssim10$%) bounds compared to EXP. We further confirm earlier findings that neutrino mass constraints are only mildly sensitive to the assumed hierarchy and that the frequentist bounds are tighter than Bayesian ones. Furthermore, the imposed oscillation lower limits, the datasets used and the DE parameterizations play a crucial role in the inferred cosmological neutrino mass bounds. For the datasets, hierarchies, and DE parameterizations considered, we find no statistically significant evidence for nonzero neutrino mass consistent with oscillation lower limits.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05705" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">21 cm forest one-dimensional power spectrum as an indirect probe of dark matter particles and primordial black holes</a><span class="id">[2509.05705]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the nature of dark matter (DM) particles remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Current cosmological research on these phenomena primarily utilizes cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and other late-time probes, which predominantly focus on large scales. We introduce a novel probe, the 21 cm forest signal, which can be used to investigate DM properties on small scales during the epoch of reionization, thereby addressing the gap left by other cosmological probes. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from PBHs, can heat the intergalactic medium (IGM). This heating suppresses the amplitude of the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. Therefore, the 1D power spectrum provides an effective method for constraining DM properties. However, astrophysical heating processes in the early universe can also affect the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. In this work, we assess the potential of using the SKA to observe the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum for constraining DM properties, under the assumption that astrophysical heating can be constrained reliably by other independent probes. Under low astrophysical heating conditions, the 1D power spectrum could constrain the DM annihilation cross section and decay lifetime to $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim {10^{-31}}\,{\rm cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim {10^{30}}\,{\rm s}$ for ${10}\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles, and probe PBHs with masses $\sim {10^{15}}\,{\rm\,g}$ at abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-13}$. These constraints represent improvements of 5-6 orders of magnitude over current limits. Furthermore, the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum has the potential to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe PBHs with masses above $10^{18}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04857" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCATTER Common Envelope Formalism for Triples</a><span class="id">[2511.04857]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many stars are components of triple-star systems, or of higher-order multiples. In such systems mass transfer is common, and when the transfer is dynamically unstable, a common envelope forms. As such, it is important to be able to compute the post-common-envelope orbital separations among the various stars comprising the system, and to determine whether the common envelope induces mergers or makes later mergers inevitable. In this paper we compute the results of common-envelope evolution for triples. We employ the SCATTER formalism, a new approach to the computation of post-common-envelope separations. This work has applications to gravitational-wave mergers, Type Ia supernovae, and a broad range of other highly energetic phenomena.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08266" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation: LXXXVII.

Using the COVMOS method, we generate 100 000 mock realisations of dark matter density fields in both real and redshift space across multiple redshifts and cosmological models. We derive an analytical framework linking the non-Gaussianity of the power spectrum distribution to higher-order statistics of the density field, including the trispectrum and pentaspectrum. We explore the effect of redshift-space distortions, the geometry of the survey, the Fourier binning, the integral constraint, and the shot noise on the skewness of the distribution of the power spectrum measurements. Our results demonstrate that the likelihood of the estimated matter power spectrum deviates significantly from a Gaussian assumption on nonlinear scales, particularly at low redshift. This departure is primarily driven by the pentaspectrum contribution, which dominates over the trispectrum at intermediate scales. We also examine the impact of the finiteness of the survey geometry in the context of the Euclid mission and find that both the shape of the survey and the integral constraint amplify the skewness.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photon rest mass from localized fast radio bursts with improved distribution of dispersion measure from extragalactic gas</a><span class="id">[2511.14163]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The assumption that photons are massless is a foundational postulate of modern physics, yet it remains subject to experimental verification. Fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their cosmological distances and precisely measured dispersion, offer an excellent laboratory for testing this hypothesis. In this work, we propose an improved distribution function for the dispersion measure arising from extragalactic gas and demonstrate that it provides an excellent fit to mock data. We then apply this distribution to constrain the photon rest mass under the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM cosmological models, the last of which is favored by recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation observations. The corresponding 1$\sigma$ upper limits on the photon mass are found to be $4.83\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, $4.71\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, and $4.86\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, respectively, which are the most stringent constraints derived from FRBs to date. These results indicate that the choice of cosmological model has only a minor impact on photon-mass bounds, demonstrate that FRBs provide robust and reliable constraints, and offer strong empirical support for the massless nature of the photon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Captured are circularized: A relativistic treatment of extreme mass ratio inspirals crossing accretion disks</a><span class="id">[2601.11925]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A small body orbiting around an accreting massive object and periodically crossing its accretion disk is a common configuration in astrophysics. In this work, we investigate the secular evolution of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass object (SMO), e.g., a star or a stellar-mass black hole (sBH), collides with the accretion disk of a central supermassive black hole (SMBH), within a fully relativistic framework. We find (1) the disk always tends to align the SMO no matter what the initial orbital inclination $\iota$ relative to the disk is, (2) the final orbital eccentricity of the SMO captured by the disk is always low though the orbital eccentricity may temporarily grow when the orbital inclination $\iota$ is large and the SMO is an sBH, and (3) via collisions with the accretion disk only, only a small fraction of sBHs that are initially close to the SMBH and close to the disk can be captured by the disk within typical disk lifetime of active galactic nuclei. Two-body scatterings between SMOs in the nuclear stellar cluster play an essential role in randomly kicking sBHs towards the disk and boosting the capture rate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slow and fast collective neutrino oscillations: Invariants and reciprocity</a><span class="id">[2301.09650]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The flavor evolution of a neutrino gas can show ”slow” or ”fast” collective motion. In terms of the usual Bloch vectors to describe the mean-field density matrices of a homogeneous neutrino gas, the slow two-flavor equations of motion (EOMs) are $\dot{\mathbf{P}}_\omega=(\omega\mathbf{B}+\mu\mathbf{P})\times\mathbf{P}_\omega$, where $\omega=\Delta m^2/2E$, $\mu=\sqrt{2} G_{\mathrm{F}} (n_\nu+n_{\bar\nu})$, $\mathbf{B}$ is a unit vector in the mass direction in flavor space, and $\mathbf{P}=\int d\omega\,\mathbf{P}_\omega$. For an axisymmetric angle distribution, the fast EOMs are $\dot{\mathbf{D}}_v=\mu(\mathbf{D}_0-v\mathbf{D}_1)\times\mathbf{D}_v$, where $\mathbf{D}_v$ is the Bloch vector for lepton number, $v=\cos\theta$ is the velocity along the symmetry axis, $\mathbf{D}_0=\int dv\,\mathbf{D}_v$, and $\mathbf{D}_1=\int dv\,v\mathbf{D}_v$. We discuss similarities and differences between these generic cases. Both systems can have pendulum-like instabilities (soliton solutions), both have similar Gaudin invariants, and both are integrable in the classical and quantum case. Describing fast oscillations in a frame comoving with $\mathbf{D}_1$ (which itself may execute pendulum-like motions) leads to transformed EOMs that are equivalent to an abstract slow system. These conclusions carry over to three flavors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10719" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Model of Dark Matter and Energy</a><span class="id">[2301.10719]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We discuss a model of the universe where dark energy is replaced by electrically-charged extremely-massive dark matter.

We consider the broken degeneracy between the choices of matter Lagrangian for a perfect fluid, $\mathcal{L}_m=-\rho$ and $\mathcal{L}_m=p$, and determine the differences between their effects on the effective gravitational constant. We review the result for $\mathcal{L}_m=-\rho$ in the quasistatic approximation and show how it can lead to unphysical singular behaviour for late-time dominating models. This divergent regime can be avoided when considering the fully non-quasistatic perturbative equations, although the higher-order nature of the nonminimally coupled theory and the requirement of a physically viable effective gravitational constant strongly constrains the magnitude of these modifications to the action. We find that both of these issues can be removed when considering $\mathcal{L}_m=p$ at late times due to the pressureless nature of non-relativistic matter and provide predictions for inverse power-law models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">K-nonizing</a><span class="id">[2509.07715]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We unveil the dynamical equivalence of field theories with non-canonical kinetic terms and canonical theories with a volume element invariant under transverse diffeomorphisms.

In this article, we perform numerical relativity simulations to study the events of dynamical capture of two equal-mass nonspinning black holes. We consider a suite of scenarios within a range of initial linear momenta ($p/M=0.095-0.75$) and incidence angles ($\theta=6.36^\circ-2.83^\circ$), and study the emitted Weyl scalar ($\Psi_4$) of each case, as well as the spins and masses of the black holes before and after they merge. We provide a simple analytical model which accurately fits the gravitational-wave emission. We study the dependence of the time interval between the capture and the merger emissions with respect to the incidence angle, which can be well parametrized by a first-order divergent behavior, allowing us to find the angle that separates a scattering event from a dynamical capture. We also find that, in general, the parameters that model the first emission can be well described by linear or exponentially decaying functions in terms of the incidence angle, while others display more complex behaviors that offer valuable insights into the nature of these events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Potential divergence in tracing $μ$ and $τ$ flavors of astrophysical neutrinos</a><span class="id">[2511.15127]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive general formulas for three flavor fractions $(\eta^{}_e , \eta^{}_\mu , \eta^{}_\tau)$ of the high-energy neutrinos originating from a remote astrophysical source by using their flavor ratios $(f^{}_e , f^{}_\mu , f^{}_\tau)$ observed at a neutrino telescope, and diagnose a potential divergence associated with $\eta^{}_\mu$ and $\eta^{}_\tau$ as an unavoidable consequence of the $\mu$-$\tau$ interchange symmetry exhibiting in the $3\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$.

However, standard numerical solvers and conventional deep learning approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), typically operate as black boxes that output solution fields without disentangling the solution into its interpretable constituent parts. In this work, we propose GlueNN, a physics-informed learning framework that decomposes the global solution into interpretable, patchwise analytic components. Rather than approximating the solution directly, GlueNN promotes the integration constants of local asymptotic expansions to learnable, scale-dependent coefficient functions. By constraining these coefficients with the differential equation, the network effectively performs regime transition, smoothly interpolating between asymptotic limits without requiring ad hoc boundary matching. We demonstrate that this coefficient-centric approach reproduces accurate global solutions in various examples and thus directly extracts physical information that is not explicitly available through standard numerical integration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15226" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exact general solutions for cosmological scalar field evolution in a vacuum-energy dominated expansion</a><span class="id">[2601.15226]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive exact general solutions (as opposed to attractor particular solutions) for the evolution of a scalar field $\phi$ in a universe dominated by a background fluid with equation of state parameter $w_B = -1$, extending earlier work on exact solutions with $w_B &gt; -1$. Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\ln \phi$, $V = V_0 \phi^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/\phi$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B &gt; -1$.
