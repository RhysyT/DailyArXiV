The majority of these targets are classified as Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes). All were monitored at optical wavelengths for at least one 27-day TESS sector, with many having multiple sectors of data. From a custom aperture photometry pipeline, we produced light curves and analyzed the variability therein, as a function of stellar and circumstellar properties. Based on visual and statistical analysis, we find that  95% of HAeBes are variable on timescales of 10 minutes to 1 month, with the most common light curve morphology being stochastic. Approximately 15% of the set display quasi-periodic variability. In comparison to sets of low-mass T Tauri stars monitored with optical space telescopes, the Herbig Ae/Be stars display a much lower incidence of “dipper&quot; behaviors (quasi-periodic or aperiodic fading events), as well as periodic modulations. As posited by previous work, we conclude that magnetic starspots are rare on HAeBes, and that the inner circumstellar dust rims of these objects lie at substantially larger radii than for low-mass young stars. Beyond these differences, the accretion dynamics of young stars less than  7$M_\odot$ appear to be largely consistent based on their time domain properties from data streams of up to three months' duration. We do, however, find tentative evidence for a change in variability amplitude above this mass boundary, particularly for quasi-periodic behavior.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identification of Gamma Ray Pulsar Candidates in the \emph{Fermi}-LAT 4FGL-DR4 Unassociated Sources Using Supervised Machine Learning</a><span class="id">[2510.08654]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the \emph{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope has been continuously providing good quality survey data of the entire sky in the high energy range from 30 MeV to 500 GeV and above since August 2008. A succession of gamma-ray source catalogs is published after a comprehensive analysis of the \emph{Fermi}–LAT data. The most recent release of data in the fourth \emph{Fermi}–LAT catalog of gamma-ray sources (4FGL-DR4), based on the first 14 years of observations in the energy band 50 MeV-1 TeV, contains 7195 sources. A large fraction ($\sim$ 33\%) of this population has no known counterparts in the lower wave bands. Such high energy gamma-ray sources are referred to as unassociated or unidentified. An appropriate classification of these objects into known type of gamma-ray sources such as the active galactic nuclei or pulsars is essential for population studies and pointed multi-wavelength observations to probe the radiative processes. In this work, we perform a detailed classification of the unassociated sources reported in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog using two supervised machine learning techniques-Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting. We mainly focus on the identification of new gamma-ray pulsar candidates by making use of different observational features derived from the long-term observations with the \emph{Fermi}–LAT and reported in the incremental 4FGL-DR4 catalog. We also explore the effects of data balancing approach on the classification of the \emph{Fermi}–LAT unassociated sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08676" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing Planetary Accretion in a 3 Gyr-old Hydrogen-Rich White Dwarf: The Extremely Polluted Atmosphere of LSPM J0207+3331</a><span class="id">[2510.08676]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the detection of 13 heavy elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Sr) in the photosphere of LSPM J0207+3331, a  3 Gyr old hydrogen-rich white dwarf with an effective temperature comparable to that of the Sun. Upper limits on carbon, obtained through the absence of molecular CH, suggest accretion from a carbon-volatile-depleted source. The accreted parent body exhibits slight deficits of Mg and Si relative to Fe but otherwise bulk Earth-like abundance patterns; a reasonable interpretation is that LSPM J0207+3331 is accreting a massive differentiated rocky body that had a core mass fraction higher than the Earth's. The high level of pollution indicates that substantial accretion events can still occur even after 3 Gyr of cooling. We also detect weak Ca II H &amp; K line-core emission, making this only the second known isolated polluted white dwarf to exhibit this phenomenon and suggesting the presence of additional physical processes in or above the upper atmosphere. Our analysis also highlights the critical importance of including heavy elements in the model atmosphere structure calculations for highly polluted hydrogen-rich white dwarfs. Neglecting their contribution significantly impacts the inferred thermodynamic structure, leading to inaccuracies in derived stellar parameters. Finally, we show that the observed 11.3 microns infrared excess can be explained by a single silicate dust disk rather than a two-ring disk model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next-Generation Improvements in Giant Exoplanet Evolutionary and Structural Models</a><span class="id">[2510.08681]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive comparison between legacy and modern evolutionary models for giant exoplanets, using our planetary evolution code, APPLE, to emulate and extend previous studies. Our analysis isolates and quantifies the impact of recent physical advances motivated by detailed modeling of Jupiter and Saturn, including updated hydrogen-helium and heavy-element equations of state, helium rain, &quot;fuzzy&quot; cores, and non-adiabatic, inhomogeneous envelopes, alongside improved atmospheric boundary conditions that incorporate ammonia cloud physics. We first examine the influence of each new physical ingredient individually, then construct combined baseline models for masses between 0.3 to 4 Jupiter masses to assess their collective effect on planetary structure and observable properties. We find that the adoption of modern equations of state and realistic heavy-element distributions leads to systematic, but sometimes subtle, differences ( 5 to 10%) in radius evolution, while helium rain and the treatment of convection can significantly alter thermal histories and atmospheric compositions (by  5 to 20%). These updated physical processes must be incorporated into the next-generation exoplanet evolutionary models to achieve physically consistent interpretations of planetary observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ExoGRAVITY survey: a K-band spectral library of giant exoplanet and brown dwarf companions</a><span class="id">[2510.08691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Direct observations of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions with near-infrared interferometry, first enabled by the dual-field mode of VLTI/GRAVITY, provide unique measurements of the objects' orbital motion and atmospheric composition. Here, we compile a homogeneous library of all exoplanet and brown dwarf K-band spectra observed by GRAVITY thus far. We re-reduce all available GRAVITY dual-field high-contrast data and, where companions are detected, extract their  2.0-2.4 $\mu$m K-band contrast spectra. We then derive stellar model atmospheres for all employed flux references that we use to convert the companion contrast into companion flux spectra. Solely from the resulting GRAVITY spectra, we extract spectral types, spectral indices, and bulk physical properties for all companions. Finally, and with the help of age constraints from the literature, we also derive isochronal masses for most companions using evolutionary models. The resulting library contains R   500 GRAVITY spectra of 39 substellar companions from late M to late T spectral type, including the entire L-T transition. Throughout this transition, a shift from CO-dominated late M- and L-type dwarfs to CH4-dominated T-type dwarfs can be observed in the K-band. The GRAVITY spectra alone constrain the objects' bolometric luminosity to typically within $\pm$0.15 dex. The derived isochronal masses agree with dynamical masses from the literature where available, except for HD 4113 c for which we confirm its previously reported potential underluminosity. Medium resolution spectroscopy of substellar companions with GRAVITY provides insight into the carbon chemistry and the cloudiness of these objects' atmospheres. It also constrains these objects' bolometric luminosity which can yield measurements of their formation entropy if combined with dynamical masses, for instance from Gaia and GRAVITY astrometry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sonora Substellar Atmosphere Models VI. Red Diamondback: Extending Diamondback with SPHINX for Brown Dwarf Early Evolution</a><span class="id">[2510.08694]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extend the Sonora Diamondback brown dwarf evolution models to higher effective temperatures to treat the evolution of younger, higher mass objects. Due to an upper temperature limit of $T_\mathrm{eff}=$2400 K in the original Sonora Diamondback model grid, high mass objects ($M\geq$ 0.05 $M_\mathrm{\odot}=$ 52.4 $M_\mathrm{J}$) were limited to ages of $\gtrsim$ 100 Myr. To include the early evolution of brown dwarfs at $T_\mathrm{eff}&gt;$ 2400 K, we use existing and new SPHINX cloud-free model atmosphere calculations of temperature structures of M-type atmospheres. These atmospheres range from $T_\mathrm{eff}$ 2000–4000 K, log($g$) 3.0–5.5, and metallicity [M/H] $-$0.5 to $+$0.5. This combination of Diamondback and SPHINX atmospheres, with a transition across $T_\mathrm{eff}$ 2000–2400 K, allows us to calculate evolution tracks, and infrared photometry and colors, for ages $&gt;$ 1 Myr and masses from above the hydrogen burning minimum mass down to planetary masses. The Hayashi phase of massive brown dwarf evolution (ages $&lt;$ 10–100 Myr) at low surface gravity leads to nearly constant $T_\mathrm{eff}$ values, at effective temperatures much lower than would be obtained from simply extrapolating backwards from evolution tracks at older ages.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The polar debris disc around 99 Herculis: A potential signpost for polar circumbinary planets</a><span class="id">[2510.08698]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nearby binary star system 99 Herculis (99 Her) is host to the only known polar-aligned circumbinary debris disc. We investigate the hypothesis that the narrow structure of this circumbinary disc is sculpted by the gravitational influence of one or more unseen polar circumbinary planets. We first establish the theoretically viable parameter space for a sculpting planet by considering dynamical stability and clearing mechanisms, including the chaotic zone, Hill radius, diffusion, and polar alignment timescales. We then use $N$-body simulations to test three specific architectures: a single planet interior to the disc, a single planet exterior, and a two-planet system bracketing the disc. Our simulations demonstrate that single-planet models are insufficient to reproduce the observed morphology, as they can only truncate one edge of the disc while leaving the other dynamically extended. In contrast, the two-planet shepherding model successfully carves both the inner and outer edges, confining the debris into a narrow, stable polar ring consistent with observations. We conclude that the structure of the 99 Her debris disc is most plausibly explained by the presence of two shepherding, polar circumbinary planets. We present a specific, testable model for this unique system, which elucidates the pivotal role of planetary bodies in sculpting the architecture of debris discs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inferring cosmological parameters from galaxy and dark sirens cross-correlation</a><span class="id">[2510.08699]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The number of observed gravitational wave (GW) events is growing fast thanks to rapidly improving detector sensitivities. GWs from compact binary coalescences like Black Holes or Neutron Stars behave like standard sirens and can be used as cosmological probes. To this aim, generally, the observation of an electromagnetic counterpart and the measurement of the redshift are needed. However, even when those are not available, it is still possible to exploit these &quot;dark sirens&quot; via statistical methods. In this work, we explore a method that exploits the information contained in the cross-correlation of samples of GW events with matter over-density tracers like galaxy catalogues. Contrary to other currently employed dark-sirens methods, this approach does not suffer from systematic errors related to the incompleteness of the galaxy catalogue. To further enhance the technique, we implement tomography in redshift space for the galaxy catalogue and luminosity distance space for the GWs. We simulate future data collected by the array of currently existing detectors, namely LIGO, Virgo, and Kagra, as well as planned third-generation ones such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorers. We cross-correlate these data with those from upcoming photometric galaxy surveys such as Euclid. We perform a sensitivity forecast employing a full-likelihood approach and explore the parameter space with Monte Carlo Markov Chains. We find that with this method, third-generation detectors will be able to determine the Hubble constant $H_0$ with an error of only 0.7%, which is enough to provide decisive information to shed light on the Hubble tension. Furthermore, for the other cosmological parameters, we find that the GWs and galaxy surveys information are highly complementary, and the use of both significantly improves the ability to constrain the underlying cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutrino signal from the hadron-quark phase transition in the conversion of Neutron Stars into Quark Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.08707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We calculate in a 1D General Relativistic (GR) hydrodynamic simulation the neutrino luminosity in an astrophysical scenario where a neutron star (NS) displays a hadron-quark phase transition (HQPT) into a Quark Star (QS). Deconfinement is triggered once the central density exceeds a critical threshold above $\sim 3n_0$ being $n_0$, saturation density. We use descriptions based on DD2 and the MIT Bag model equations of state (EOSs). We account for neutrinos using a microphysics forward emission model including $e^-e^+$ annihilation, plasmon decay, nucleon (N) modified (or direct) Urca processes, and $NN$ bremsstrahlung, and, for the post transition, the quark direct Urca and an opacity-based leakage scheme with GR redshift. We find that the neutrino light curve generically develops a short $\simeq$10-50 ms, spectrally harder feature near deconfinement, appearing as either a prompt shoulder or a distinct secondary peak. Heavy lepton neutrinos result in a delayed peak with respect to the previous. We identify three diagnostics that are only mildly degenerate with hadronic uncertainties: (i) an enhanced peak-to-plateau ratio $R_{\rm pp}$ sourced by latent-heat release, (ii) a characteristic lag $\Delta t$ between the collapse rise and the HQPT feature that tracks the central density trajectory, and (iii) a flavor hardening $\Delta\!\langle E_\nu\rangle$ driven by quark-matter phase space. After MSW flavor conversion, these signatures remain detectable with current experiments. For a Galactic event ($d\sim 10$ kpc), IceCube and Hyper-K should resolve the HQPT feature and distinguish it from both no transition NS collapse and canonical core-collapse supernova (CCSN) templates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Low-Frequency Gravitational Waves in Three-Dimensional Core-Collapse Supernova Models</a><span class="id">[2510.08764]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We discuss the low-frequency gravitational wave signals from three state-of-the-art three-dimensional core-collapse supernova models produced with the \textsc{Chimera} supernova code.

Observing the atmospheres of these objects provides information on the geological processes that influence their climates and surfaces. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of these planets, including insights into the interaction between the atmosphere and interior based on observations made with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We describe the expected climatic and interior planetary regimes for planets with different density and stellar flux and how those regimes might be observationally distinguished. We also identify the observational, experimental, and theoretical innovations that will be required to characterize Earth-like exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Event Horizon Telescope Pattern Speeds in the Visibility Domain</a><span class="id">[2510.08848]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Event Horizon Telescope is preparing to produce time sequences of black hole images, or movies. In anticipation, we developed an autocorrelation technique to measure apparent rotational motion using the image-domain pattern speed $\Omega_p$. Here, we extend this technique to the visibility domain and introduce the visibility amplitude pattern speed $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$. We show that in the Illinois v3 library of EHT source models, $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ depends on the source inclination, black hole mass, black hole spin, accretion state (MAD or SANE), and baseline length, and then provide approximate fits for this dependence. We show that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ is particularly sensitive to baseline length for MAD (strongly magnetized) models, and that the slope of this dependence can be used to constrain black hole spin. As with $\Omega_p$, models predict that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ is well below the Keplerian frequency in the emission region for all model parameters. This is consistent with the idea that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ measures an angular phase speed for waves propagating through the emission region. Finally, we identify the information that would be provided by space-based millimeter VLBI such as the proposed BHEX mission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on the interacting holographic dark energy models: implications from background and perturbations data</a><span class="id">[2510.08875]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we employ a two-step method to analyze models of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE), incorporating three distinct dark energy (DE)-dark matter (DM) interaction terms. First, using the latest background dataset, we conduct a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain the free parameters of the models. Then, we assess the models against each other using the key background parameters and compare them to the $\Lambda$CDM standard model. Our results show that at high redshifts, the equation of state (EoS) parameter related to the models for both homogeneous and clustered DE cases falls within the quintessence region. However, as we approach the present time, all models except HDE transition into the phantom region, and two models cross the phantom line earlier than others. In the next step, we focus on the evolution of perturbations in DE and DM. Using background and growth rate data, we constrain parameters including $\sigma_8$. We then investigate the evolution of the growth rate of matter perturbations, $f\sigma_8(z)$, and its deviation, $\Delta f \sigma_8$, from the $\Lambda$CDM model. The HDE model shows the best agreement with observational data, while other models predict varying growth rates compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we demonstrate through Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC) analysis that the compatibility of models with observational data depends on the type of data used, the DE-DM interaction term, and the assumptions regarding DE homogeneity and clustering. Our results suggest that homogeneous DE models yield more agreement with observational data than clustered DE models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Influence of Magnetic Complexity of Active Regions on Solar Wind Properties During Solar Cycles 23 and 24</a><span class="id">[2510.08975]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Linking solar wind properties to the activities and characteristics of its source regions can enhance our understanding of its origin and generation mechanisms. Using the Mount Wilson magnetic classification (MWMC), we categorize all active regions (ARs) between 1999 and 2020 into three groups: alpha, beta, and complex ARs. Subsequently, we classify the near-Earth AR solar wind into the corresponding three types based on the magnetic type of ARs. Our results show that alpha, beta, and complex ARs account for 19.99%, 66.67%, and 13.34% of all ARs, respectively, while their corresponding AR solar wind proportions are 16.96%, 45.18%, and 37.86%. The properties of solar wind from different types of ARs vary significantly. As the magnetic complexity of ARs increases, the corresponding AR solar wind exhibits higher magnetic field strength, charge states, helium abundance (A_He), and first ionization potential (FIP) bias. Our results demonstrate that complex ARs are more effective at generating solar wind. Additionally, the strong magnetic fields and frequent magnetic activities in complex ARs can heat the plasma to higher temperatures and effectively transport helium-rich materials from the lower atmosphere to the upper corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D Moving-mesh Hydrodynamical Simulations of Wind/Jet Driven Ultraluminous X-ray Source Bubbles</a><span class="id">[2510.09066]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform 3 dimensional moving-mesh hydrodynamical simulations of bubble nebulae around ultraluminous X-ray sources, using state-of-the-art software AREPO. We use a Monte-Carlo method to inject outflows with uniform mass outflow rate and momentum, in a conical funnel with a specific half opening angle. Simulation results show that the morphology of the bubble is determined by the initial momentum of the outflows, while the mechanical power of the outflows only influences the size of the bubble without changing its shape. Low mechanical power also results in a short cooling timescale of the system, leading to an early collapse of the bubble shell. The half opening angle of the outflows and the viewing angle of the system determine the observed bubble eccentricity together. Compared with the observational morphology of the ULX bubble sources NGC 55 ULX-1 and NGC 1313 X-2, our simulation favors the fact that the high velocity outflows of the accretion disks in these two systems are confined in a narrow funnel region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the $w$CDM Model with Latest DESI BAO Observations</a><span class="id">[2510.09074]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we explore the impact of various combinations of CMB-independent datasets, including the recent DESI BAO measurements, on the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy and other cosmological parameters within the framework of the dynamical dark energy model ($w$CDM).

Our analysis examines the deviations of the $w$CDM model from the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario and assesses its implications for cosmological tensions, particularly the $H_0$ tension [$\text{km} \text{s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$]. We find that the combination of DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ (DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ &amp;SH0ES) datasets provides constraints on $w_{\mathrm{de}0}$, suggesting a possible deviation from the cosmological constant scenario at a significance level of $1.6\sigma$ ($1.4\sigma$), respectively. Furthermore, we observe an inverse correlation between $w_{\text{de0}}$ and $H_0$, which highlights the role of dark energy dynamics in resolving the tension $H_0$ by approximately $2.1\sigma(0.8\sigma)$ from DESI BAO + BBN + OHD (DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ &amp;SH0ES) datasets, respectively. Our findings offer valuable insights into the nature of dark energy and its influence on the cosmic expansion history, with implications for future observational efforts. We utilize the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to evaluate our model's performance. The results indicate that the $w$CDM model demonstrates superior effectiveness.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sub-Threshold Fermi-LAT Sources in the Vicinity of KM3-230312A</a><span class="id">[2510.09101]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The KM3NeT collaboration has recently reported the detection of an extraordinary ultra-high-energy neutrino event with an energy of 220 PeV. Ultrahigh energy neutrinos and gamma-rays are co-produced in ultrahigh energy cosmic-ray interactions. The ultrahigh energy gamma-rays produced alongside the KM3NeT neutrino may quickly cascade down to lower energies due to interactions with intergalactic photons and magnetic fields. Because of this, the KM3NeT neutrino could be accompanied by an observable GeV - TeV gamma-ray signal. We investigate the data collected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the \textit{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope for transient and sub-threshold gamma-ray sources in the vicinity of the KM3NeT neutrino. We find three sub-threshold sources with TS $\gtrsim 16$ within $3.5^{\circ}$ of the neutrino event not included in any existing \textit{Fermi}-LAT catalogs. One of the three, J0616.1-0428, is a transient sub-threshold gamma-ray source that appears only after the neutrino observation, but may be the unrelated flaring of a nearby microquasar. Another sub-threshold source, J0621.1-0610, also exhibits fluctuations in gamma-rays immediately following the neutrino observation, and may be coincident with a radio blazar. We note that the number of sub-threshold sources observed around the KM3NeT neutrino could be expected at another sky region of the same Galactic latitude, and that the fluctuations they exhibit appear to be consistent with background.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in \Euclid (CLOE). 1.

To this end, we have created the Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid (CLOE), which is a novel cosmological parameter inference pipeline developed within the Euclid Consortium to translate measurements and covariances into cosmological parameter constraints. In this first in a series of six papers, we describe the theoretical recipe of this code for the Euclid primary probes. These probes are composed of the photometric 3x2pt observables of cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering, along with spectroscopic galaxy clustering. We provide this description in both Fourier and configuration space for standard and extended summary statistics, including the wide range of systematic uncertainties that affect them. This includes systematic uncertainties such as intrinsic galaxy alignments, baryonic feedback, photometric and spectroscopic redshift uncertainties, shear calibration uncertainties, sample impurities, photometric and spectroscopic galaxy biases, as well as magnification bias. The theoretical descriptions are further able to accommodate both Gaussian and non-Gaussian likelihoods and extended cosmologies with non-zero curvature, massive neutrinos, evolving dark energy, and simple forms of modified gravity. These theoretical descriptions that underpin CLOE will form a crucial component in revealing the true nature of the Universe with next-generation cosmological surveys such as Euclid.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetohydrodynamic shallow water equations with the alpha effect: Rossby-dynamo waves in solar–stellar tachoclines</a><span class="id">[2510.09130]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The activity of Sun-like stars is governed by the magnetic field, which is believed to be generated in a thin layer between convective and radiative envelopes. The dynamo layer, also called the tachocline, permits the existence of Rossby waves (r-modes) described by magnetohydrodynamic shallow water models, which may lead to short-term cycles in stellar activity. Convective cells penetrate into the layer creating an overshoot upper part, where they transport an additional energy for vigorous activity. The aim of this paper is to study the influence of overshooting convection on the dynamics of Rossby waves in the tachoclines of Sun-like stars. Here we write the magnetohydrodynamic shallow water equations with the effect of the penetrative convection and study the dynamics of wave modes in the layer. The formalism leads to the excitation of new oscillation modes connected with the dynamo coefficient, alpha, causing periodic modulations of all parameters in the tachocline. The modes are coupled with the Rossby waves resulting mutual exchange of convective and rotation energies. The timescales of Rossby-dynamo waves, for certain parameters, correspond to Schwabe (11 years) and Rieger (150-170 days) cycles as observed in solar activity. The waves provide a new paradigm for internal magnetism and may drive the dynamos of Sun-like stars. Theoretical properties of the waves and observations can be used for magneto-seismological sounding of stellar interiors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation.

However, the increase in precision places strong requirements on the accuracy of the theoretical modelling for the observables and of the full analysis pipeline. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of the calculations performed by the Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid (CLOE), a software able to handle both the modelling of observables and their fit against observational data for both the photometric and spectroscopic surveys of Euclid, by comparing the output of CLOE with external codes used as benchmark. We perform such a comparison on the quantities entering the calculations of the observables, as well as on the final outputs of these calculations. Our results highlight the high accuracy of CLOE when comparing its calculation against external codes for Euclid observables on an extended range of operative cases. In particular, all the summary statistics of interest always differ less than $0.1\,\sigma$ from the chosen benchmark, and CLOE predictions are statistically compatible with simulated data obtained from benchmark codes. The same holds for the comparison of correlation function in configuration space for spectroscopic and photometric observables.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation.

Specifically, its goal is to shed light on the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Achieving this requires developing and validating advanced statistical tools and theoretical prediction software capable of testing extensions of the LCDM model. In this work, we describe how the Euclid likelihood pipeline, Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid (CLOE), has been extended to accommodate alternative cosmological models and to refine the theoretical modelling of Euclid primary probes. In particular, we detail modifications made to CLOE to incorporate the magnification bias term into the spectroscopic two-point correlation function of galaxy clustering. Additionally, we explain the adaptations made to CLOE's implementation of Euclid primary photometric probes to account for massive neutrinos and modified gravity extensions. Finally, we present the validation of these CLOE modifications through dedicated forecasts on synthetic Euclid-like data by sampling the full posterior distribution and comparing with the results of previous literature. In conclusion, we have identified in this work several functionalities with regards to beyond-LCDM modelling that could be further improved within CLOE, and outline potential research directions to enhance pipeline efficiency and flexibility through novel inference and machine learning techniques.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation.

Achieving this goal requires a continuous reassessment of the mission's scientific performance, particularly in terms of its ability to constrain cosmological parameters, as our understanding of how to model large-scale structure observables improves. In this study, we present the first scientific forecasts using CLOE (Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid), a dedicated Euclid cosmological pipeline developed to support this endeavour. Using advanced Bayesian inference techniques applied to synthetic Euclid-like data, we sample the posterior distribution of cosmological and nuisance parameters across a variety of cosmological models and Euclid primary probes: cosmic shear, angular photometric galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and spectroscopic galaxy clustering. We validate the capability of CLOE to produce reliable cosmological forecasts, showcasing Euclid's potential to achieve a figure of merit for the dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ exceeding 400 when combining all primary probes. Furthermore, we illustrate the behaviour of the posterior probability distribution of the parameters of interest given different priors and scale cuts. Finally, we emphasise the importance of addressing computational challenges, proposing further exploration of innovative data science techniques to efficiently navigate the Euclid high-dimensional parameter space in upcoming cosmological data releases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A systematic search for orbital periods of polars with TESS.

Determining the orbital periods of cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) is essential for confirming candidates and for the understanding of their evolutionary state. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides month-long photometric data across nearly the entire sky that can be used to search for periodic variability in such systems. Aims. This study aims to identify and confirm the orbital periods for members of a recent compilation of magnetic CVs (known as polars) using TESS light curves. In addition, we set out to investigate their reliability, and hence the relevance of TESS for variability studies of CVs. Results. Ninety-five of the 217 polars in our sample have pipeline-produced TESS two-minute cadence light curves available. The results from our period search are overall in good agreement with the previously reported values. Out of the 95 analysed systems, 85 exhibit periods consistent with the literature values. Among the remaining ten objects, four are asynchronous polars, where TESS light curves resolve the orbital period, the white dwarf's spin period, and additional beat frequencies. For four systems, the periods detected from the TESS data differ from those previously reported. For two systems, a period detection was not possible. Our analysis of the flattened TESS light curves reveals a positive correlation between noise levels and TESS magnitude. Our noise level estimates resemble the rmsCDPP, a measure of white noise provided with the TESS pipeline products. However, our values for the noise level are systematically higher than the rmsCDPP indicating red noise and high-frequency signals hidden in the flattened light curves. Additionally, we present a statistical methodology to assess the reliability of period detections in TESS light curves. We find that for TESS magnitudes $\gtrsim$ 17, period detections become increasingly unreliable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light Travel Time Effects in Kilonova Models</a><span class="id">[2510.09261]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The extremely rapid evolution of kilonovae results in spectra that change on an hourly basis. These spectra are key to understanding the processes occurring within the event, but this rapid evolution is an unfamiliar domain compared to other explosive transient events, such as supernovae. In particular, the most obvious P Cygni feature in the spectra of AT2017gfo – commonly attributed to strontium – possesses an emission component that emerges after, and ultimately outlives, its associated absorption dip. This delay is theorised to arise from reverberation effects, wherein photons emitted earlier in the kilonova's evolution are scattered before reaching the observer, causing them to be detected at later times. We aim to examine how the finite speed of light – and therefore the light travel time to an observer – contributes to the shape and evolution of spectral features in kilonovae. Using a simple model, and tracking the length of the journey photons undertake to an observer, we are able to test the necessity of accounting for this time delay effect when modelling kilonovae. In periods where the photospheric temperature is rapidly evolving, we show spectra synthesised using a time independent approach are visually distinct from those where these time delay effects are accounted for. Therefore, in rapidly evolving events such as kilonovae, time dependence must be taken into account.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09303" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effect of stochastic kicks on primordial black hole abundance and mass via the compaction function</a><span class="id">[2510.09303]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study stochastic effects in viable ultra-slow-roll inflation models that produce primordial black holes.

In every patch, we follow $4\times10^4$ momentum shells to construct its spherically symmetric profile from first principles, without introducing a window function. We include the effects of critical collapse and the radiation era transfer function. The resulting compaction function profiles are very spiky due to stochastic kicks. This can enhance the PBH abundance by up to 36 orders of magnitude, depending on the mass range and collapse criterion. The PBH mass function shifts to higher masses and widens significantly. These changes may have a large effect on observational constraints of PBHs and make it possible to generate PBHs with a smaller amplitude of the power spectrum. However, convergence issues for the mass function remain. The results call for redoing collapse simulations to determine the collapse criterion for spiky profiles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the geological setting of exoplanets through atmospheric analysis: using Mars as a test case</a><span class="id">[2510.09305]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the frontier research fields of exoplanetary science is the study of the composition and variability of exoplanetary atmospheres. This field is now moving from the gas giant planets towards the smaller and colder telluric planets, and future instruments like ANDES will focus on the observations of the atmosphere of telluric planets in the habitable zone in reflected light. These future observations will possibly find variable signals due to the view of different hemispheres of the planet. Particularly, the strength of the signal may be linked to the thickness of the atmospheric layer probed, and therefore to the average altitude variations of the planetary surface, that are related to the global geodynamic evolution of the planet. To better prepare for the interpretation and exploitation of these future data, we used Mars as a Solar System analog of a spatially resolved telluric exoplanet. We observed the reflected light of Mars with the high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectrograph GIANO-B (widely used in exoplanetary atmospheric studies) during a 3 month period: we studied the spatial and temporal variations of the Martian CO2 signal using the least-squared deconvolution technique (LSD), to mimic as closely as possible the standard exoplanetary atmospheric analysis. We linked the variations found to the well-known Martian geological surface characteristics: we found a clear dependence of the strength of the CO2 signal with the thickness of the Martian atmospheric layer by comparing the retrieved CO2 signal with the altitudes of our pointings. The proposed strategy is promising: it proved to be effective on Mars and may shed light on the variations in the strength of atmospheric signal of telluric exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Safely simplifying redshift drift computations in inhomogeneous cosmologies: Insights from LTB Swiss-cheese models</a><span class="id">[2510.09377]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the most important discoveries in cosmology is the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Yet, the accelerated expansion has only ever been measured {\em in}directly. Redshift drift offers a direct observational probe of the Universe's expansion history, with its sign revealing whether there has been acceleration or deceleration between source and observer. Its detection will mark a major milestone in cosmology, offering the first direct measurement of an evolving expansion rate. Given its epistemic importance, it is essential to understand how its measurements can be biased. One possibility of bias comes from cosmological structures. However, theoretical estimates of such effects are difficult to obtain because computing redshift drift in general inhomogeneous cosmologies is computationally demanding, requiring the solution of 24 coupled ordinary differential equations. In this work, we use Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Swiss-cheese models to show that only the two dominant contributions are needed to achieve percent-level accuracy up to $z = 1$. This allows the reduction of the full system of 24 ODEs to the standard null geodesic equations, significantly simplifying the calculation. \newline\indent Although our analysis is based on idealized Swiss-cheese models with spherical structures, we expect that similar simplifications apply to more complex scenarios, including cosmological N-body simulations. Our analysis thus underpins a practical and robust framework for efficient redshift drift computations applicable to a wider range of inhomogeneous cosmologies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The choice of Planck CMB likelihood in cosmological analyses</a><span class="id">[2510.09430]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We compare cosmological parameters from different Planck sky maps and likelihood pipelines, assessing robustness of cosmological results with respect to the choice of the latest Planck maps-likelihood combination. We show that, for the Planck multipole range retained in combination with ground-based observations, different products give very similar cosmological solutions; small remaining differences are reduced by the addition of other CMB datasets to Planck. In particular, constraints on extended cosmological models benefit from the addition of small-scale power from ground-based experiments and are completely insensitive to the choice of Planck maps and likelihood. For this work we derive and release a nuisance-marginalized dataset and CamSpec-NPIPE-lite likelihood for the Planck NPIPE data injected into the CamSpec likelihood - which are usually used to obtain the reference Planck PR4 cosmology. Using the extracted CMB spectra we show that the additional constraining power for cosmology is coming from polarization at all scales and from temperature at multipoles above 1500 when going from PR3 to PR4. We also show that full marginalization over the CamSpec foreground nuisance parameters can impact parameter inference and model selections when truncating some scales; our new likelihood enables correct combinations with other CMB datasets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09503" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extending CSST Emulator to post-DESI era</a><span class="id">[2510.09503]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recent DESI BAO measurements have revealed a potential deviation from a cosmological constant, suggesting a dynamic nature of dark energy. To rigorously test this result, complementary probes such as weak gravitational lensing are crucial, demanding highly accurate and efficient predictions of the nonlinear matter power spectrum within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. However, most existing emulators fail to cover the full parameter posterior from DESI DR2+CMB constraints in the $w_0\mbox{-}w_a$ plane. In this work, we extend the spectral equivalence method outlined in Casarini et al. 2016 to use auxiliary $w_0w_a$CDM models for approximating the power spectrum of a target $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, moving beyond the previous use of $w$CDM auxiliaries. Incorporating this enhanced module, the extended CSST Emulator achieves a prediction accuracy of $\leq1\%$ over the $1\sigma$ confidence region from DESI DR2+CMB constraints for $z\leq3$, validated by additional dynamic dark energy simulations. The emulator's applicable parameter space has been generalized to fully encompass the $2\sigma$ region, greatly enhancing its utility for cosmological analysis in the post-DESI era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direct observation of the X-ray counterpart of the Hα filaments and of the sloshing spiral in the Perseus galaxy cluster</a><span class="id">[2510.09559]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Deep Chandra observations of the Perseus galaxy cluster have allowed for the discovery of X-ray counterparts to the H{\alpha} filamentary structures and of a sloshing spiral.

Specifically, we make use of data from the 2MASS photometric survey (\tmpz) and the \wisc galaxy survey, in combination with CMB lensing data from \planck. Using a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) approach to model galaxy bias we obtain constraints on the combination $S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, where $\sigma_8$ is the amplitude of matter fluctuations, and $\Omega_m$ is the non-relativistic matter fraction. Using a prior on $\Omega_m$ based on the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements of DESI, we find $S_8=0.79\pm0.06$, in reasonable agreement with CMB constraints. We also find that, in the absence of this prior, the data favours a value of $\Omega_m=0.245\pm0.024$, that is 2.8$\sigma$ lower than \planck. This result is driven by the broadband shape of the galaxy auto-correlation, and may be affected by theoretical uncertainties in the HEFT power spectrum templates. We further reconstruct the low-redshift growth history, finding it to be compatible with the \planck predictions, as well as existing constraints from lensing tomography. Finally, we study our constraints on the HEFT bias parameters of the galaxy samples studied, finding them to be in reasonable agreement with coevolution predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2021lwz: Another Exotic Luminous and Fast Evolving Optical Type Ic Broad-Lined Supernova ?</a><span class="id">[2510.09569]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Current large-scale, high-cadence surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), provide detections of new and rare types of transients and supernovae whose physical origins are not well understood. Aims. We investigate the nature of SN 2021lwz at a redshift z=0.065, an overluminous supernova (SN) of absolute magnitude, $M_{g} \sim -20.1$ AB, falling in the lower range of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) luminosities, and discovered in a faint dwarf galaxy with an absolute magnitude of $M_{g} \simeq -14.5$ AB. Methods. SN 2021lwz is studied using optical spectroscopy, photometry and imaging linear polarimetry obtained during several follow-up campaigns. All the data are used to analyse and model the evolution of the explosion. Comparisons with other SNe of well known or rarer types are investigated. Results. SN 2021lwz belongs to the rare class of rapidly evolving transients. The bolometric light curve rises in about 7 days to a peak luminosity of about 5 x10^{43} erg/s, at a rate of 0.2 mag/day close to the peak. Spectroscopy modeling reveals more similarities with a normal Type Ic-like SN than with a SLSN before peak, showing broadened lines after peak. Light curve modeling shows that the Arnett model of the bolometric light curve using a radioactive source ($^{56}$ Ni) is not able to reasonably explain the light curve evolution. A magnetar model seems more appropriate, suggesting that the explosion of low ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej} \sim 0.24 ~M_\odot$) took place in a low mass ($M \sim 10^{6.66}~M_\odot$) dwarf galaxy of specific star-formation rate about ten times larger than typical star-forming galaxies. Conclusions. Given its spectroscopic properties and the low ejecta mass needed to model its light-curve, SN 2021lwz does not match with many core-collapse H-poor SNe Types.

While in rest of the gauges viz. the longitudinal (Long.), uniform-expansion (UE), Newtonian-motion (Nm), and N-body (Nb) gauges the late-time energy spectrum converges, and SIGWs behave as radiation. For subhorizon modes ($ k\eta \gg 1 $), the divergence becomes severe, showing that SIGWs are gauge-dependent observables in this regime. We resolve it through a kernel projection that isolates the luminal, freely propagating gravitational wave components (oscillating as $\sin(k\eta)$ and $\cos(k\eta)$), eliminating spurious contributions. The resulting kernel decays as $ (k\eta)^{-1} $ and yields a finite, gauge-independent late-time spectrum, confirming that only luminal modes represent physical SIGWs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07894" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emission of Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the semilocal string network</a><span class="id">[2510.07894]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Semilocal cosmic string is a line-like non-topological soliton associated with the breakdown of the $SU(2)_{\rm global} \times U(1)_{\rm gauge}$ symmetry to the $U(1)_{\rm global}$ symmetry.

Much of the DMSimps parameter space is already constrained by direct and indirect detection, collider searches, and the measured DM relic abundance. We show, however, that the resonant regime $m_{\rm DM}\simeq m_{\rm med}/2$ remains viable under current bounds and will be stringently tested by forthcoming experiments. Using a full Boltzmann treatment that allows for departures from kinetic equilibrium near resonance, we demonstrate that this regime can reproduce the observed relic density with couplings compatible with direct-detection limits.

Recent systematic theoretical studies on $\beta$-decay at finite temperature indicated that under hot conditions ($T\sim10$ GK), a significant acceleration of $\beta$-decay rates is expected, especially for nuclei near stability. This corresponds to the early stage of the $r$-process. In this study, we investigate the effect of the $\beta$-decays in finite temperature using the rates calculated with the finite-temperature proton-neutron relativistic quasiparticle random-phase approximation (FT-PNRQRPA). We explore a variety of astrophysical conditions and find that the effect on the abundance pattern is significant in hot and moderately neutron-rich conditions such as are expected in magnetorotational supernovae. Accelerated $\beta$-decay rates also increase the heating rate in the early phase, resulting in an additional modification of the final abundance pattern.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distinguishing between Black Holes and Neutron Stars within a Population of Weak Tidal Measurements</a><span class="id">[2510.08832]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the ability of tidal signatures within the inspiral of compact binaries observed through gravitational waves (GWs) to distinguish between neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs).

In this work, we investigate both current and vorticity sheets in 3D particle-in-cell simulations of decaying relativistic turbulence in pair plasma by training a self-organizing map to recognize these structures. We subsequently carry out an extensive statistical analysis to reveal their geometric and structural properties. This analysis is systematically applied across a range of magnetizations ($\sigma$) and fluctuating-to-mean magnetic field strengths ($\delta B_0/B_0$) to assess how these parameters influence the resulting structures. We find that the structures' geometric properties form power-law distributions in their probability density functions (PDFs), with the exception of the structure width, which generally exhibits an exponential distribution peaking around 2 electron skin depths. The measurements show weak dependence on $\sigma$ but a strong dependence on $\delta B_0/B_0$. Finally, we investigate the spatial relationship between current sheets and vorticity sheets. We find that most current sheets are directly associated with at least one vorticity sheet neighbor and are often situated between two vorticity sheets. These findings provide a detailed statistical framework for understanding the formation and organization of coherent structures in relativistic magnetized turbulence, allowing for their incorporation into updated theoretical models for structure-based energy dissipation and particle acceleration processes crucial for interpreting high-energy astrophysical observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interactions between syn-rift magmatism and tectonic extension at intermediate rifted margins</a><span class="id">[2510.09366]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Intermediate rifted margins exhibit neither seaward dipping reflectors nor exhumed mantle at the continent-ocean transition (COT). Instead, they transition into normal-thickness, magmatic Penrose-type oceanic crust, and thus diverge from the classic magma-rich and magma-poor end-member models. However, several intermediate margins, such as the South China Sea (SCS), display detachment faulting similar to magma-poor margins and magmatic underplating typical of magma-rich ones. How tectonics and magmatism interact in these intermediate environments is poorly understood. Here we use 2D numerical models to demonstrate that the elevated initial geotherm inherited from prior plate subduction in the SCS explains several key observations: an early phase of wide rifting, subsequent localization onto core complexes with substantial footwall magmatic intrusions, and eventual formation of normal igneous oceanic crust at break-up. Thermal weakening caused by syn-rift footwall magmatic intrusions facilitates lower crustal ductile flow, promoting the development of rolling-hinge type detachment faults and exhumation of core complexes. These structures are associated with accelerated tectonic subsidence, which is later moderated by detachment-related doming, as observed in the SCS. Normal-thickness oceanic crust occurs after break-up, even under ultra-slow extension rates used in our simulations, highlighting the importance of inheritance in determining margin architecture, the spatio-temporal distribution of syn-rift magmatism, and the nature of the COT. This behavior contrasts sharply with magma-poor margins, where a cooler lithosphere and similar ultra-slow extension produce no syn-rift magmatism, leading instead to crustal embrittlement, mantle serpentinization and exhumation at the COT.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01369" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Holes Place the Universe in Stasis</a><span class="id">[2212.01369]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A variety of scenarios for early-universe cosmology give rise to a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with a broad spectrum of masses.

Our calculations predict a fast and faint transient with $\Delta m_{15} \sim 1\texttt{-} 2\,\mathrm{mag}$ and peak bolometric luminosity between $-15.3\,\mathrm{mag}$ and $-16.4\,\mathrm{mag}$. Due to a large-scale unipolar asymmetry in the distribution of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, there is a pronounced viewing-angle dependence with about $1\,\mathrm{mag}$ difference between the directions of highest and lowest luminosity. The predicted spectra for this rare class of explosions do not yet match any observed counterpart. They are dominated by prominent Mg II lines, but features from O, C, Si, and Ca are also found. In particular, the O I line at \wl{7}{774} appears as a blended feature together with Mg II emission. Our model is not only faster and fainter than the observed Ib/c supernova population, but also shows a correlation between higher peak luminosity and larger $\Delta m_{15}$ that is not present in observational samples. A possible explanation is that the unusually small ejecta mass of our model accentuates the viewing-angle dependence of the photometry. We suggest that the viewing-angle dependence of the photometry may be used to constrain asymmetries in explosion models of more typical stripped-envelope supernova progenitors in future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing $f(R)$ Gravity from Cosmic Shear Measurements</a><span class="id">[2412.04807]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we perform a detailed analysis to constrain the Hu-Sawicki \(f(R)\) gravity model, using cosmic shear data from three prominent Stage-III weak lensing surveys: DES-Y3, KiDS-1000, and HSC-Y3.

In Universes with less matter and larger initial density perturbations, clusters form earlier and have more time to accrete material, leading to a more extended infall region. Thus, measuring the mean mass distribution in the infall region provides a novel cosmological test. The infall region is largely insensitive to baryonic physics, and provides a cleaner structural test than other measures of cluster assembly time such as concentration. We consider cluster samples from three publicly available galaxy cluster catalogues: the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) catalogue, the X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect selected clusters in the meta-catalogue M2C, and clusters identified in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Using a preliminary shape catalogue from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), we derive excess surface mass density profiles for each sample. We then compare the mean profile for the DESI Legacy sample, which is the most complete, to predictions from a suite of simulations covering a range of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$, obtaining constraints of $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.34\pm 0.06$ and $\sigma_8=0.77 \pm 0.04$.

Testing their stability versus redshift and scale is a crucial issue, as it can serve as a guide for optimizing ongoing and future searches. Here, we perform such analyses, considering a number of redshift, scale, and redshift-and-scale nodes. Concerning the $k$-space analysis of $\sum m_\nu$, CMB observations are crucial, as they lead the neutrino mass constraints. Interestingly, some data combinations suggest a non-zero value for the neutrino mass with $2\sigma$ significance. The most constraining bound we find is $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.54$ eV at $95\%$ CL in the $[10^{-3}, 10^{-2}]$ $h$/Mpc $k$-bin, a limit that barely depends on the data combination. Regarding the redshift- and scale-dependent neutrino mass constraints, high redshifts ($z&gt;100$) and scales in the range $[10^{-3}, 10^{-1}]$ $h$/Mpc provide the best constraints. The least constraining bounds are obtained at very low redshifts $[0,0.5]$ and also at very small scales ($k&gt;0.1\, h$/Mpc), due to the absence of observations. Highly relevant is the case of the $[100, 1100]$, $[10^{-2}, 10^{-1}]$ $h$/Mpc redshift-scale bin, where a $2$-$3\sigma$ evidence for a non-zero neutrino mass is obtained for all data combinations. The bound from CMB alone at $68\%$ CL is $0.63^{+0.20}_{-0.24}$ eV, and the one for the full dataset is $0.56^{+0.20}_{-0.23}$ eV, clearly suggesting a non-zero neutrino mass at these scales, possibly related to a deviation of the ISW amplitude in this redshift range. Concerning the analysis of $N_{\rm eff}$ in the $k$-space, at intermediate scales ranging from $k=10^{-3}$ $h$/Mpc to $k=10^{-1}$ $h$/Mpc, accurate CMB data provide very strong bounds, the most robust one being $N_{\rm eff}=3.09\pm 0.14$, comparable to the standard expected value without a $k$-bin analysis.

These systems have separations intermediate to predictions from standard binary evolution scenarios, challenging models of binary interaction and mass transfer. Because the selection function of Gaia astrometric catalogs is complex, the underlying population demographics of WD+MS binaries remain imperfectly understood. We present a forward-model of the AU-scale WD+MS binary population probed by Gaia that begins with a realistic binary population and incorporates a full model of Gaia mock observations and astrometric model fitting, as well as cuts employed in producing the Gaia astrometric catalog and selecting WD+MS binary candidates. We model the formation of AU-scale WD+MS binaries as the result of interaction when the WD progenitor is an AGB star. We test several models for the binaries' formation, including stable mass transfer with theoretically predicted stability criteria and two different formalisms for common envelope evolution. None of these models succeed in reproducing the observed component mass distributions or the absolute number of WD+MS binaries. The data are best reproduced by a model in which post-AGB binaries remain wide only if the accretor-to-donor mass ratio exceeds $\sim 0.4$. Our model allows us to constrain the intrinsic population demographics of intermediate-separation WD+MS binaries. The inferred period distribution is close to flat, with ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}P_{\rm orb}\propto P_{\rm orb}^{0.12}$, while the WD mass distribution is sharply peaked at $0.6\,M_{\odot}$. The model implies that $\sim 0.4\%$ of solar-type stars have WD companions with periods of $100 - 1000\,$d.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22369" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Model-independent cosmological inference after the DESI DR2 data with improved inverse distance ladder</a><span class="id">[2505.22369]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda $CDM model.

Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets. For the DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets, we obtain $H_0 = 67.91 \pm 2.33~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$.

Furthermore, by mapping specific cosmological models into PAge approximation parameter space $(p_{\mathrm{age}}, \eta)$, our model-independent analysis reveals a notable deviation from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model, as indicated by the DESY5 and DESI DR2 datasets. Finally, DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets provide nearly decisive evidence favoring the PAge model over the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model.

The magma ocean stage of terrestrial- and sub-Neptune planets permits mass exchange between their interiors and atmospheres, during which the mass and speciation of the atmosphere is dictated by the planet's volatile budget, chemical equilibria, and gas/fluid solubility in molten rock. As the atmosphere cools, it is modified by gas-phase reactions and condensation. We combine these processes into an open-source Python package built using JAX called Atmodeller, and perform calculations for planet sizes and conditions analogous to TRAPPIST-1e and K2-18b. For TRAPPIST-1e-like planets, our simulations indicate that CO-dominated atmospheres are prevalent during the magma ocean stage, which, upon isochemical cooling, predominantly evolve into CO2-rich atmospheres of a few hundred bar at 280 K. Around 40% of our simulations predict the coexistence of liquid water, graphite, sulfur, and ammonium chloride-key ingredients for surface habitability. For sub-Neptune gas dwarfs, pressures are sufficiently high (few GPa) that gas fugacities deviate from ideality, thereby drastically enhancing solubilities. This buffers the total atmospheric pressure to lower values than for the ideal case. These effects conspire to produce CH4-rich sub-Neptune atmospheres for total pressures exceeding around 3.5 GPa, provided H/C is approximately 100x solar and fO2 moderately reducing (3 log10 units below the iron-wustite buffer). Otherwise, molecular hydrogen remains the predominant species at lower total pressures and/or higher H/C. For all planets at high temperature, solubility enriches C/H in the atmosphere relative to the initial composition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luminous Late-time Radio Emission from Supernovae Interacting with Circumbinary Material</a><span class="id">[2507.19613]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Numerous core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) exhibit signatures of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). Bright radio emission years after the SN is one such indication of dense CSM at large distances from the star, which may be generated via binary interactions. In this work, we use forward modeling to study the radio emission produced by interaction between the SN ejecta and CSM formed by non-conservative stable mass transfer from stripped-envelope stars in short-period binaries. The donors are among the likely progenitors of hydrogen-poor CCSNe that significantly expand $10^3$-$10^4$ years before core-collapse, with companions that best represent low-mass compact objects. We identify that non-conservative stable mass transfer from lower-mass stripped stars can create a detached shell-like CSM, whereas for our higher-mass stars the CSM is wind-like. In our models, mass transfer rates of $\sim 10^{-4} M_\odot$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ lead to dense CSM extending to $\sim 10^{18}$ $\mathrm{cm}$. The predicted radio emission is luminous at late times, reaching $L_{\nu}\sim10^{26}$-$10^{29}\mathrm{erg}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at years to decades after core-collapse, which is as bright as late-time radio emission observed for a sample of hydrogen-poor SNe. However, the light curves of events with early-time data show more complex behavior in the weeks to months after core-collapse. We qualitatively demonstrate that similar early-time emission can manifest for CSM that is accelerated to speeds of $\sim10^3$ $\mathrm{km}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ upon ejection, as well as for different viewing angles in case of an asymmetric CSM distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital decay candidates reconsidered: WASP-4 b is not decaying and Kepler-1658 b is not a planet</a><span class="id">[2510.05229]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fate of hot Jupiters is thought to be engulfment by their host stars, the outcome of tidal orbital decay.

The evolution of structure formation is modeled using U-Net, a widely employed convolutional image translation framework. Because of the lack of a controlled methodology, validation of these learned mappings requires multiple benchmarks beyond simple visual comparisons and summary statistics. A comprehensive list of metrics is considered, including higher-order correlation functions, conservation laws, topological indicators, and statistical independence of density fields. We find that the U-Net approach performs well only for some of these physical metrics, and accuracy is worse at increasingly smaller scales, where the dynamic range in density is large. By introducing a custom density-weighted loss function during training, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the U-Net results at smaller scales. This study provides an example of how a family of physically motivated benchmarks can, in turn, be used to fine-tune optimization schemes – such as the density-weighted loss used here – to significantly enhance the accuracy of scientific machine learning approaches by focusing attention on relevant features.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hard X-ray view of two $γ$-ray detected low-luminosity active galactic nuclei: NGC 315 and NGC 4261</a><span class="id">[2510.06810]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aims. The accretion disk of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) is a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Our goal is to find evidence of RIAF radiation from LLAGNs with jets and analyze their radiation properties, which also adds samples to future research on LLAGNs. Methods. Weconducted an analysis of the X-ray data obtained from NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of NGC 315 and NGC 4261, encompassing both timing and spectral investigations. The joint X-ray spectra of the two LLAGNs were fitted using various functional forms and radiative models in XSPEC. Results. No significant variability on timescales of days is observed for both NGC 315 and NGC 4261. The X-ray continuum emission of NGC 315 is suitable for cutoff power-law (PL) fitting, yielding a cutoff energy of Ecut = 18.45 keV, which is the lowest value found in LLAGNssofar. In contrast, the X-ray continuum of NGC 4261 is composed of two PL components, with no signs of a cutoff energy. A prominent neutral Fe K{\alpha} line is observed in NGC 315, while an ionized Fe XXV line is seen in NGC 4261. The derived reflection fractions are R = 0.61 for NGC 315 and R = 0.18 for NGC 4579. Neither NGC 315 nor NGC 4261 shows evidence of a Compton reflection bump. Conclusions. The X-ray spectral characteristics support the RIAF emission as the dominant origin of the X-rays in both sources, although an additional soft PL component originating from the inner jet is observed in NGC 4261. The higher reflection fraction compared to other LLAGNs, along with the detection of a neutral Fe K{\alpha} line, suggests the existence of a truncated accretion disk with a relatively small radius in NGC 315. Bremsstrahlung radiation appears to be the dominant cooling mechanism for the plasma in NGC315, while Comptonization within the RIAF is more likely responsible for the X-ray emission in NGC 4261.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-spherical effects on the mass function of Primordial Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2410.03451]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this letter, we investigate the impact of non-spherical effects on the Primordial Black Hole mass function, based on the ellipticity-dependent threshold calculated by performing $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations. We consider an equation of state of radiation $w:=P/\rho=1/3$ and a softer one $w=1/10$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and energy density, respectively. We suppose that the curvature perturbations obey Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum and examine the most probable ellipsoidal configurations utilizing peak theory. We also suppose the critical scaling law of the PBH mass near the threshold following the known results. The simulations arXiv:2410.03452 show that the non-sphericity can easily prevent the system from black hole formation when the initial fluctuation amplitude is near the threshold (critical scaling regime). Nevertheless, we show that the non-spherical effects make the mass function just a few times smaller and are insignificant on the mass function distribution, including the power-law scaling in the small mass region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03452" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulations of Ellipsoidal Primordial Black Hole Formation</a><span class="id">[2410.03452]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations to study primordial black hole (PBH) formation from the collapse of adiabatic super-horizon non-spherical perturbations generated from curvature fluctuations obeying random Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum. The matter field is assumed to be a perfect fluid of an equation of state $w:=P/\rho={\rm const.}$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial spatial profile of the curvature perturbation is modeled with the amplitude $\mu$ and non-spherical parameters $e$ (ellipticity) and $p$ (prolateness) according to peak theory. We focus on the dynamics and the threshold for PBH formation in terms of the non-spherical parameters $e$ and $p$. We find that the critical values ($e_c, p_c$) with a fixed value of $\mu$ closely follow a superellipse curve. With $p=0$, for the range of amplitudes considered, we find that the critical ellipticity for non-spherical collapse follows a decaying power law as a function of $(\mu-\mu_{\rm c,sp})$ with $\mu_{\rm c,sp}$ being the threshold for the spherical case. Our results also indicate that, for both cases of $w = 1/3$ and $w = 1/10$, small deviations from sphericity can avoid collapsing to a black hole when the amplitude is near its critical threshold. Finally we discuss the significance of the ellipticity on the rate of the PBH production.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eastward Transients in the Dayside Ionosphere II: A Parallel-plate Capacitor-Like Effect</a><span class="id">[2501.03174]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During the 23 April 2023 geospace storm, we observed chorus wave-driven, energetic particle precipitation on closed magnetic field lines in the dayside magnetosphere. Simultaneously and in the ionosphere's bottom-side, we observed signatures of impact ionization and strong enhancements in the ionospheric electric field, via radar-detection of meter-scale turbulence, and with matching temporal characteristics as that of the magnetospheric observations. We detailed this in a companion paper. In the present article, we place those observations into context with the dayside ionosphere, and describe a remarkably similar event that took place during the May 2024 geospace superstorm. In both cases, fast, eastward-moving electric field structures were excited equatorward of the ionospheric cusp, on closed magnetic field-lines – observations that challenge existing modes of explanation for electrodynamics in the cusp-region, where most such observations are interpreted in the context of poleward-moving auroral forms. Instead, primarily eastward-moving electric field structures were associated with turbulent Hall currents that are perhaps characteristically excited during geospace storms by wave-particle interactions near magnetospheric equator or by proton precipitation characteristics in the cusp, forming a `parallel-plate capacitor-like effect'. We propose that transient eastward electrodynamic bursts in the dayside ionosphere might be a common, albeit previously unresolved, feature of geomagnetic storms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Characteristic Signature of Magnetospheric Wave-Particle Interactions Found in the Turbulent E-region</a><span class="id">[2501.04107]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Plasma waves in the magnetosphere scatter electrons, causing them to precipitate into Earth's atmosphere, imparting their temporal characteristics to diffuse auroras.

Considering the black hole to be part of a binary system, the tidal potential of the companion periodically perturbs the GA such that an “atomic” transition occurs between two of its energy eigenstates. The resonant transition is modeled by the Landau-Zener system, where the orbital frequency of the companion determines the relevant transition. In this work, we study a novel quasi-monochromatic gravitational wave signal originating directly from the level transition of the GA in a binary system. We derive the analytical formulae of both the strain waveform and frequency spectrum of the signal. We further investigate the GA-binary systems that can have a large signal-to-noise ratio in the milli-Hz to deci-Hz frequency band. Using the future space-based gravitational wave observatory DECIGO, we find the signal-to-noise ratio is $\mathcal{O}(10-200)$ for the fine-structure constant $\alpha\simeq 0.3$, host black hole mass $M= 150M_\odot$ and boson mass $\mu \simeq 10^{-13} \rm eV$ at a distance within 100 kpc. Given astrophysical uncertainties about the black hole's initial spin, the degeneracy with other monochromatic signals and the small merger rate at those distances, we conclude that the detection of the signal would be challenging.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18992" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological perturbations for smooth sign-switching dark energy models</a><span class="id">[2506.18992]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we carry out a comprehensive perturbative analysis of four cosmological models featuring a sign-switching cosmological constant.
