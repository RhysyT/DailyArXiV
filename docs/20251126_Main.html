In light of current and upcoming all-sky radio surveys, PMFs have drawn attention not only as major candidates for explaining the large-scale magnetisation of the Universe, but also as potential probes of early-Universe physics. In this paper, using cosmological simulations coupled with light-cone analysis, we study for the first time the imprints of the PMF structure on the mean rotation measure (RM) originating in the intergalactic medium (IGM), $\langle \mathrm{RM_{IGM}}\rangle$. We introduce a new method for producing full-sky $\mathrm{RM_{IGM}}$ distributions and analyse the autocorrelation of $\mathrm{RM_{IGM}}$ on small and large angular scales; we find that PMF structures indeed show distinct signatures. The large-scale uniform model (characterised by an initially unlimited coherence scale) leads to correlations up to 90 degrees, while correlations for small-scale stochastic PMF models drop by factor of $100$ at $ 0.17, 0.13$ and 0.11 degrees angular scales, corresponding to $5.24, 4.03$ and $3.52$ Mpc scales (at $z=2$ redshift) for magnetic fields with comoving $3.49, 1.81, 1.00 $ Mpc/h coherence scales, respectively; the correlation amplitude of the PMF model with comoving $\sim 19$ Mpc/h coherence scale drops only by factor of $10$ at 1 degree (30.6 Mpc). These results suggests that improvements in the modelling of Galactic RM will be necessary to investigate the signature of large-scale correlated PMFs. A comparison of $\langle \mathrm{RM_{IGM}}\rangle$ redshift dependence obtained from our simulations with that from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey shows agreement with our previous upper limits' estimates on the PMF strength derived from RM-rms analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolutionary Processes in the Centaur Region</a><span class="id">[2511.19554]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Centaurs populate relatively short-lived and rapidly evolving orbits in the giant-planet region and are believed to be one of the solar system's most complex and diverse populations. Most Centaurs are linked to origins in the dynamically excited component of the trans-Neptunian region, and are often considered an intermediate phase in the evolution of Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). Additionally, the Centaur region hosts objects from varied source populations and having different dynamical histories. In this chapter, we focus on the physical processes responsible for the evolution of this heterogeneous population in the giant-planet region. The chapter begins with a brief review on the origin and early evolution that determine Centaurs' properties prior to entering the giant-planet region. Next, we discuss the thermal, collisional, and tidal processes believed to drive the changes Centaurs undergo. We provide a comprehensive review of the evidence for evolutionary changes derived from studies of the activity, physical properties, and surface characteristics of Centaurs and related populations, such as trans-Neptunian objects, JFCs, and Trojans. This chapter reveals a multitude of gaps in the current understanding of the evolution mechanisms acting in the giant-planet region. In light of these open questions, we conclude with an outlook on future telescope and spacecraft observations, detailing how they are expected to elucidate Centaur evolution processes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19588" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chemical and Isotopic Homogeneity Between the L Dwarf CD-35 2722 B and its Early M Host Star</a><span class="id">[2511.19588]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>CD-35 2722 B is an L dwarf companion to the nearby, $\sim 50-200$ Myr old M1 dwarf CD-35 2722 A. We present a detailed analysis of both objects using high-resolution ($R \sim 35,000$) $K$ band spectroscopy from the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) combined with archival photometry. With a mass of $30^{+5}_{-4} M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ (planet-to-host mass ratio 0.05) and projected separation of $67\pm4$ AU from its host, CD-35 2722 B likely formed via gravitational instability. We explore whether the chemical composition of the system tells a similar story. Accounting for systematic uncertainties, we find $\mathrm{[M/H]}=-0.16^{+0.03}_{-0.02} \mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.25 \mathrm{(sys)}$ dex and $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}=132^{+20}_{-14}$ for the host, and $\mathrm{[M/H]}=0.27^{+0.07}_{-0.06} (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.12 (\mathrm{sys})$ dex, $^{12}\mathrm{CO}/^{13}\mathrm{CO}=159^{+33}_{-24} \mathrm{(stat)}^{+40}_{-33} \mathrm{(sys)}$, and $\mathrm{C/O} = 0.55 \pm 0.01 (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.04 (\mathrm{sys})$ for the companion. The chemical compositions for the brown dwarf and host star agree within the $1.5\sigma$ level, supporting a scenario where CD-35 2722 B formed via gravitational instability. We do not find evidence for clouds on CD-35 2722 B despite it being a photometrically red mid-L dwarf and thus expected to be quite cloudy. We retrieve a temperature structure which is more isothermal than models and investigate its impact on our measurements, finding that constraining the temperature structure to self-consistent models does not significantly impact our retrieved chemical properties. Our observations highlight the need for data from complementary wavelength ranges to verify the presence of aerosols in likely cloudy L dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray, optical, and radio follow-up of five thermally emitting isolated neutron star candidates</a><span class="id">[2511.19591]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on follow-up observations with XMM-Newton, the FORS2 instrument at the ESO-VLT, and FAST, aiming to characterise the nature of five thermally emitting isolated neutron star (INS) candidates recently discovered from searches in the footprint of the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG)/eROSITA All-sky Survey. We find that the X-ray spectra are predominantly thermal and can be described by low-absorbed blackbody models with effective temperatures ranging from 50 to 210 eV. In two sources, the spectra also show narrow absorption features at $300 - 400$ eV. Additional non-thermal emission components are not detected in any of the five candidates. The soft X-ray emission, the absence of optical counterparts in four sources, and the consequent large X-ray-to-optical flux ratios $&gt;3000 - 5400$ confirm their INS nature. For the remaining source, eRASSU J144516.0-374428, the available data do not allow a confident exclusion of an active galactic nucleus nature. However, if the source is Galactic, the small inferred X-ray emitting region is reminiscent of a heated pulsar polar cap, possibly pointing to a binary pulsar nature. X-ray timing searches do not detect significant modulations in all candidates, implying pulsed fraction upper limits of 13 - 19% ($0.001-13.5$ Hz). The absence of pulsations in the FAST observations targeting eRASSU J081952.1-131930 and eRASSU J084046.2-115222 excludes periodic magnetospheric emission at 1 - 1.5 GHz with an $8\sigma$ significance down to 4.08 $\mu$Jy and 2.72 $\mu$Jy, respectively. The long-term X-ray emission of all sources does not imply significant variability. Additional observations are warranted to establish exact neutron star types. At the same time, the confirmation of the predominantly thermal neutron star nature in four additional sources highlights the power of SRG/eROSITA to complement the Galactic INS population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Role of magnetic reconnection in blazar variability using numerical simulation</a><span class="id">[2511.19605]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast $\gamma$-ray variability in blazars remains a central puzzle in high-energy astrophysics, challenging standard shock acceleration models. Blazars, a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets pointed close to our line of sight, offer a unique view into jet dynamics. Blazar $\gamma$-ray light curves exhibit rapid, high-amplitude flares that point to promising alternative dissipation mechanisms such as magnetic reconnection. This study uses three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) and resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (ResRMHD) simulations with the PLUTO code to explore magnetic reconnection in turbulent, magnetized plasma columns. Focusing on current-driven kink instabilities, we identify the formation of current sheets due to magnetic reconnection, leading to plasmoid formation. We develop a novel technique combining hierarchical structure analysis and reconnection diagnostics to identify reconnecting current sheets. A statistical analysis of their geometry and orientation reveals a smaller subset that aligns closely with the jet axis, consistent with the jet-in-jet model. These structures can generate relativistically moving plasmoids with significant Doppler boosting, offering a plausible mechanism for the fast flares superimposed on slowly varying blazar light curves. These findings provide new insights into the plasma dynamics of relativistic jets and strengthen the case for magnetic reconnection as a key mechanism in blazar $\gamma$-ray variability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecting clustering and the cosmic web:Observational constraints on secondary halo bias</a><span class="id">[2511.19607]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmological simulations predict significant secondary dependencies of halo clustering on internal properties and environment. Detecting these subtle signals in observational data remains challenging, with important ramifications for galaxy evolution and cosmology. We probe secondary halo bias in observational survey data, using galaxy groups as dark matter halo proxies. We quantify secondary bias using central galaxy colour and environmental diagnostics. We use an extended, refined galaxy group catalogue from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Secondary bias is defined as any deviation in group clustering strength at fixed mass, quantified through the projected two-point correlation function. Our environmental analysis uses DisPerSE to compute distances to critical points of the density field, incorporating local group overdensity measurements on multiple scales. We robustly detect several forms of secondary bias in the clustering of galaxy groups. At fixed mass, groups hosting red central galaxies are more strongly clustered than those with blue centrals, with $b_{\rm relative}$ ranging from $\sim 1.2$ for the 15\% reddest centrals to $\sim 0.8$ for the bluest ones. Environmental dependencies based on cosmic-web distances are also present, though significantly weaker and largely mass-independent. The strongest signal arises from local overdensity: groups in the densest 15\% of environments reach $b_{\rm relative} \sim 1.4$, while those in the least dense regions fall to $b_{\rm relative} \sim 0.7$. These results establish a clear observational hierarchy for secondary halo bias. The colour of central galaxies correlates with the local group overdensity, which, in turn, correlates with the bias at fixed group mass. Assuming that central galaxy colour traces halo assembly history, this three-stage picture offers a conceptual link between our results and halo assembly bias.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planetary Habitability Under the Light of a Rapidly Changing Star</a><span class="id">[2511.19646]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planetary atmospheric energy budgets primarily depend on stellar incident flux. However, stellar variability can have major consequences for the evolution of planetary climates. In this work, we evaluate how stellar variability influences the equilibrium temperature and water retention of planets within the Habitable Zone (HZ). We present a sample of 9 stars that are known to host at least one planet within the HZ and that were identified to have a variability amplitude exceeding 100 ppm based on photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We investigate the effect that the variability of these stars have on the insolation flux of their HZ planets and the resulting changes in the induced planetary equilibrium temperature. Our results show that for the stars in our sample, the stellar variability has an insignificant effect on the equilibrium temperature of HZ planets. However, we also emphasize that these stars are not representative of more extreme variable stars, since exoplanets are more difficult to detect and characterize in the presence of extreme variability. We also investigate the equilibrium temperature and long-term evolution of a hypothetical Earth-like planet placed at the inner edge of the HZ around a highly variable star. We found that the water loss rates are comparable between both variable and quiet host stars for Earth-like planets in the inner HZ. Overall, these results broaden our knowledge on the impact of stellar variability on planetary habitability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optical and cm follow-ups of the Changing-Look event in Mkn 590</a><span class="id">[2511.19660]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Changing-Look active galactic nucleus Mkn 590 is currently in a rejuvenated state, exhibiting a contemporaneous flux rise across X-rays, UV, optical and cm wavelengths. In this study, we present three new optical spectra obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope, alongside three 1.4 GHz continuum measurements from the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, acquired since Nov. 2024. We identified a clear increase in the broad hydrogen Balmer line emission in the most recent observational epochs. Additionally, the core radio flux densities appear to track the overall X-ray variability, suggesting a possible connection between the accretion flow and jet activity. Based on these data, we aim to explore the evolution of the circumnuclear gas in this source and potential links between accretion and ejection activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19685" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIC 5623923: A Faint Eclipsing Binary Consisting of $δ$ Scuti pulsations</a><span class="id">[2511.19685]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the light variation of KIC 5623923 using high-precision time-series data from the $Kepler$ mission. The analysis reveals this target is an eclipsing binary system with $\delta$ Scuti type pulsations from the primary component, rather than from the secondary as previously reported. The frequency analysis of three short-cadence data reveals 41 significant frequencies, including the orbital frequency ($f_{orb}$ = 0.827198 d$^{-1}$) due to orbital motion from binary system and the pulsational frequencies. Most of the pulsational signal lies in the frequency range of 20 - 32 d$^{-1}$, with amplitude between 0.3 and 8.8 mmag, in which seven peaks are identified as `independent' modes. The strongest one ($f_{3}$ = 28.499399 d$^{-1}$) likely corresponds to a high-order radial mode. In other peaks ($f_{7}$, $f_{10}$, and $f_{18}$), several pairs of multiplet structures centered on them are found. The fitting of spectral energy distribution (SED) using the collected photometry measurement of multiple bands reveals the effective temperatures of the primary and secondary components as $8348^{+230}_{-225}$ K and $4753^{+237}_{-229}$ K, respectively, which place the primary star in the classical pulsating instability zone. The characteristic light curve morphology and short orbital period are consistent with a tidally locked system. Based on the characteristics of amplitude spectra of pulsating stars in close binaries, the analysis of the multiplet structures reveals that three independent frequencies (i.e. $f_{7}$, $f_{10}$, and $f_{18}$) correspond to non-radial modes with $l = 2$, while the associated sidelobes are produced by the orbital motion. We highlight the potential of this method in future studies of pulsating binary stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19695" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alignment of radio jets in the microquasar V4641 Sagittarii with its high-energy structures</a><span class="id">[2511.19695]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>V4641 Sagittarii (V4641 Sgr) is a unique Galactic microquasar system featuring a stellar-mass black hole accreting matter from a massive companion. One of its intriguing features is the presence of relativistic radio jets almost perpendicular to the observed extended gamma-ray emission, implying significant propagation effects or interactions with the Galactic magnetic field. Here we report observational evidence that the radio jet and the very high-energy (VHE) and ultra high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray emission could be aligned along a common axis, indicating a co-spatial or co-directional origin. This alignment supports a model where synchrotron radio emission, VHE and UHE gamma rays are produced within a single, highly collimated relativistic outflow. Our findings favor scenarios of in-situ particle acceleration up to hundreds of TeV, challenge previous interpretations involving large-scale particle diffusion, and simplify the geometric modeling of the source. This case highlights the potential of V4641 Sgr as a PeVatron candidate within our Galaxy and provides a benchmark for understanding jet composition and magnetic structure in microquasars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sequential Fragmentation of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) After Its Near-Sun Passage</a><span class="id">[2511.19707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) reached perihelion at 0.33 au on 2025 October 8. Daily monitoring by the LCO Outbursting Objects Key Project revealed a major activity increase between November 2 and 4, accompanied by rapid changes in coma morphology. Serendipitous HST/STIS acquisition images obtained on November 8-10 captured the comet only days after this event and resolved five fragments, providing an early high-resolution view of a nucleus in the process of disruption. Fragment motions and morphologies indicate a hierarchical fragmentation sequence, including a slow secondary split of fragment II. Back-extrapolation shows that both the primary and secondary breakups preceded their associated photometric outbursts by roughly one to three days. This consistent lag, together with the appearance of thin, short-lived arclets around fragment A in the first HST epoch, suggests that freshly exposed interior material warms rapidly but requires time before dust can be released efficiently. These combined ground- and space-based observations provide rare, time-resolved constraints on the thermal and structural evolution of a fragmented comet near perihelion and highlight the scientific value of capturing a nucleus within days of disruption.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19737" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observations of [O I] emission in Comets C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) and C/2007 N3 (Lulin): Possible Influence of Solar Activity on Oxygen Line Ratios</a><span class="id">[2511.19737]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observing [O I] emission to calculate an &quot;oxygen line ratio&quot; has been proposed as a potential proxy for direct CO$_2$ measurement in comets. However, the photochemistry governing [O I] release into the coma is not well understood, and using theoretical release rates often yields different results than using empirical release rates determined in conjunction with direct space-based measurements of CO$_2$. We hypothesize that the accuracy of the release rates could depend on the level of solar activity at the time the comet is observed, which will be influenced by the solar cycle. We present observations and analysis of [O I] emission in one comet observed near solar maximum, C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy), and one near solar minimum, C/2007 N3 (Lulin). Our [O I] measurements were obtained using two high spectral resolution optical spectrographs: the Tull Coudè spectrometer at McDonald Observatory and the ARCES spectrometer at Apache Point Observatory. We use empirical and theoretical models for [O I] emission from the literature to derive multiple sets of inferred CO$_2$ abundances for these comets and compare to contemporaneous space-based measurements of CO$_2$. We find that the empirical model, which was developed based on comet observations obtained near solar maximum, reproduces the directly measured CO$_2$ abundances better for Lovejoy. Neither model accurately reproduces the direct measurement for Lulin. We discuss the implications of our findings for the accuracy and dependencies of the oxygen line ratio method for inferring CO$_2$ abundances in cometary comae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Speed of Gravity and the Fate of Dark Energy</a><span class="id">[2511.19762]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>On August 17$^{\rm th}$ 2017, observatories worldwide made a landmark detection: gravitational waves and light from a binary neutron star merger.

Through a second-order phase transition, fermion - antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes towards zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the non-relativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario – a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure.

In this study, we comparatively examine the seasonal behaviour of vertical distribution of meteor occurrence height and decay time height at two identical radars of conjugate polar latitudes, Esrange (68$^\circ$N) and Rothera (68$^\circ$S). In order to understand the nature of meteor trail variations, the received signal power is categorised into two groups as weak and strong echoes, and their seasonal mean vertical profiles are constructed. It has been noticed that the meteor occurrence height shown a seasonal symmetry, however, decay time vertical profiles shows an asymmetric pattern at conjugate polar latitudes, particularly for strong echoes. Seasonally, there is about 1 km difference in occurrence height and decay time height of weak and strong echoes. From the decay time vertical profiles, it has been noticed that the decay time turning altitude (i.e., inflection point) varies seasonally in the altitudes range of 80-86 km for weak and strong echoes. The maximum turning altitude of about 85 km is observed in Northern winter at Esrange (68$^\circ$N) and in Southern summer at Rothera (68$^\circ$S), similarly minimum turning altitude of about 80 km is observed in Northern winter at Esrange (68$^\circ$N) and in Southern summer at Rothera (68$^\circ$S). The probable reasons for such behaviour of meteor trails at opposite polar latitudes are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19946" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal Heating of the Lunar Magma Ocean</a><span class="id">[2511.19946]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The timing of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) solidification is governed by its thermal evolution. A key geochronological observation is that all analyzed products of LMO solidification have ages (or age peaks) near 4.35 +/- 0.05 billion years ago (Ga), suggesting rapid solidification of the last  40% of the LMO at that time. The ages raise two questions: (1) how was the final solidification of the LMO delayed for over 100 Myr (million years) from the Moon's formation, and (2) after such a delay, how did it solidify so quickly? These two aspects of the ages are inconsistent with models of early-fast solidification or slow-prolonged solidification, controlled by radiogenic heat production and convective cooling (even if slowed by a conductive lithosphere). We propose that both aspects can not only be explained by tidal heating of the LMO but are in fact robust and expected thermal evolution features of a magma ocean cooling while being tidally heated and, in the Moon's case, receding from the Earth. The delay in solidification is due to the LMO being trapped at a stable equilibrium between the enhanced tidal heating rate and the decreasing cooling rate. The rapid solidification at  4.35 Ga occurs when the Moon retreats to the point where an unstable equilibrium is reached, where tidal heating is drastically reduced, rapidly cooling the Moon. Moreover, an unanticipated outcome of our modeling is that the farside of the Moon is predicted to be 20-60 deg C cooler than the nearside for  10-100 Myr during the final solidification stage. This is consistent with previous studies indicating asymmetric crystallization of the LMO from the farside to the nearside, which leads to an older and less evolved farside crust than the nearside, consistent with the observed higher Mg# of farside anorthositic crust and the nearside concentration of H2O, KREEP, and high Fe-Ti components.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic simulation of global solar corona including solar wind effects within 2.5 $R_\odot$</a><span class="id">[2511.19975]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Total solar eclipses (TSEs) provide a unique opportunity to observe the large-scale solar corona. The solar wind plays an important role in forming the large-scale coronal structure and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are used to reproduce it for further studying coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We conduct a data-constrained MHD simulation of the global solar corona including solar wind effects of the 2024 April 8 TSE with observed magnetograms using the Message Passing Interface Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code (MPI-AMRVAC) within 2.5 $R_\odot$. This TSE happened within the solar maximum, hence the global corona was highly structured. Our MHD simulation includes the energy equation with a reduced polytropic index $\gamma=1.05$. We compare the global magnetic field for multiple magnetograms and use synchronic frames from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager to initialize the magnetic field configuration from a magneto-frictionally equilibrium solution, called the Outflow field. We detail the initial and boundary conditions employed to time-advance the full set of ideal MHD equations such that the global corona is relaxed to a steady state. The magnetic field, the velocity field, and distributions of the density and thermal pressure are successfully reproduced. We demonstrate direct comparisons with TSE images in white-light and Fe XIV emission augmented with quasi-separatrix layers, the integrated current density, and the synthetic white-light radiation, and find a good agreement between simulations and observations. This provides a fundamental background for future simulations to study the triggering and acceleration mechanisms of CMEs under solar wind effects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Focused Review of Quintom Cosmology: From Quintom Dark Energy to Quintom Bounce</a><span class="id">[2511.19994]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recently released data of DESI DR2 favors a dynamical dark energy theory, with the equation of state crossing the cosmological constant boundary $w=-1$.

The system was recently identified as a candidate two-planet system in a machine-learning search of the TESS light curves. Using TESS data and photometric follow-up observations with ASTEP, CHEOPS, and EulerCam, we show that one transit was initially misattributed and that the system consists of three transiting giant planets with orbital periods of 11.5, 22.6, and 48.9 days. The planets have radii of 0.65, 0.96, and 0.94 R_J, making them the largest known trio of transiting planets. The system architecture lies near a 4:2:1 mean motion resonant chain, inducing large transit timing variations for all three planets. Photodynamical modeling gives mass estimates of 0.057, 0.41, and 0.60 M_J and favors low eccentricities and mutual inclinations. TOI-7510 is an interesting system for investigating the dynamical interactions and formation histories of compact systems of giant planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20091" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exomoon search with VLTI/GRAVITY around the substellar companion HD 206893 B</a><span class="id">[2511.20091]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Direct astrometric detection of exomoons remains unexplored. This study presents the first application of high-precision astrometry to search for exomoons around substellar companions. We investigate whether the orbital motion of the companion HD 206893 B exhibits astrometric residuals consistent with the gravitational influence of an exomoon or binary planet. Using the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument, we monitored the astrometric positions of HD 206893 B and c across both short (days to months) and long (yearly) timescales. This enabled us to isolate potential residual wobbles in the motion of component B attributable to an orbiting moon. Our analysis reveals tentative astrometric residuals in the HD 206893 B orbit. If interpreted as an exomoon signature, these residuals correspond to a candidate (HD 206893 B I) with an orbital period of approximately 0.76 years and a mass of $\sim$0.4 Jupiter masses. However, the origin of these residuals remains ambiguous and could be due to systematics. Complementing the astrometry, our analysis of GRAVITY $R=4000$ spectroscopy for HD 206893 B confirms a clear detection of water, but no CO is found using cross-correlation. We also find that AF Lep b, and $\beta$ Pic b are the best short-term candidates to look for moons with GRAVITY+. Our observations demonstrate the transformative potential of high-precision astrometry in the search for exomoons, and proves the feasibility of the technique to detect moons with masses lower than Jupiter and potentially down to less than Neptune in optimistic cases. Crucially, further high-precision astrometric observations with VLTI/GRAVITY are essential to verify the reality and nature of this signal and attempt this technique on a variety of planetary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spatially Resolved Plasma Diagnostics of the Supernova Remnant DEM L71 using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer</a><span class="id">[2511.20112]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a spatially resolved high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the supernova remnant DEM L71 using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) aboard XMM-Newton.

These planets have orbital periods of 6–15 days and radii of 2.5–4.1 R$_\oplus$, probing regions where planet formation and atmospheric evolution remain poorly understood. We combine TESS transit photometry with ground-based radial velocities to determine precise masses, radii, and orbital properties. TOI-1472b has a mass of $18.0^{+0.84}_{-0.85}$ M$_\oplus$ and a radius of $4.06 \pm 0.10$ R$_\oplus$, TOI-1472c has a mass of $21.1^{+0.96}_{-0.99}$ M$_\oplus$ and a radius of $3.33 \pm 0.08$ R$_\oplus$, and TOI-1648b has a mass of $7.4^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$ M$_\oplus$ and a radius of $2.54^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$ R$_\oplus$. The planets exhibit a range of eccentricities (0.041–0.178), indicating diverse evolutionary histories. TOI-1648b, with a high Transmission Spectroscopy Metric (TSM $\sim$59), is a promising target for atmospheric characterization.

At the end of stable mass transfer, there is a well-known relation between the He WD mass and orbital period. Although this relation has been widely investigated, the influence of different types of opacity at low temperatures is ignored. In this work, we modeled the evolution of WD binaries with stellar evolution code MESA and two types of opacity at low temperatures from Ferguson et al. (2005) and Freedman et al. (2008, 2014). We investigated the relation between the WD mass and orbital period and compared these results with observations. We find that the relation derived from the opacity of Freedman et al. (2008, 2014) is below that from the opacity of Ferguson et al. (2005) and the relation derived from the opacity of Freedman et al. (2008, 2014) can better explain the observations. In addition, we provided fitting formulae for the relations derived from the opacity of Freedman et al.

Solar filaments often exhibit rotation and deflection during eruptions, which would significantly affect the geoeffectiveness of the coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that lead to such lateral displacement of filaments is a great concern to space weather forecasting. Two case studies are discussed. Firstly, the events of September 8 and September 10 2014, were analyzed from the Sun to the Earth. The numerical heliospheric simulation EUHFORIA shows that the handedness of the EUV sigmoid deduced from coronagraph observations was different from the tilt of the ICME at 1 au, suggesting a rotation of the CME in the low corona. A potential undetected low coronal rotation led to erroneous space weather prediction. The second event concerns a filament observed on August 20 2021, which underwent a rotation of 73 degrees during its eruption, implying a significant lateral drifting of the filament material. A data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation confirms such a rotation. These two studies reinforce the idea that CMEs are subjected to more significant rotation and deflection in the low corona than during their journey in the heliosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20310" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Empirical to Physical Model: Direct Fits of Optically Thin Inverse Compton Scattering to Prompt GRB Spectra</a><span class="id">[2511.20310]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission is commonly attributed to non-thermal radiation processes operating in the optically thin regions of a relativistic outflow. Among these, optically thin inverse-Compton (IC) scattering remains an important yet under-tested mechanism. From an initial set of 41 bursts selected using empirical Band-function criteria that highlight quasi-thermal low-energy slopes ($\alpha &gt; -0.5$) and constrained high-energy indices ($-1.7 &gt; \beta &gt; -3.3$), only four events satisfy these conditions consistently in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectra. The IC fits yield self-consistent constraints on the seed-photon field and the electron population at the dissipation site. For bulk Lorentz factors $\Gamma \sim 170$-$550$, we infer seed thermal peaks of $\sim 0.05$-$0.2$ keV and electron thermal energies of $\sim 20$-$300$ keV in the co-moving frame. A fraction of only $0.1\%$-$20\%$ of electrons are accelerated into a non-thermal tail with an average index value of $\delta \sim 1.8$. The derived Comptonisation parameters indicate moderate $y$ values ($\sim 1$-$3$), optical depths $\tau \sim 0.2$-$0.6$, and dissipation radii just above the photosphere, consistent with mildly relativistic ($\gamma_{\min} \sim 1.2$-$2.6$), photon-dominated, low-magnetic-field dissipation environments. Furthermore, the framework allows us to constrain even sub-dominant thermal components that lie below the detector's low-energy threshold. Taken together, our results show that optically thin IC scattering offers a physically consistent and observationally viable explanation for the prompt emission in a subset of bright GRBs, motivating the application of IC models in future GRB studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Burst Phenomenology of AD Leonis and Associated Signatures of Propagation Effects</a><span class="id">[2511.20396]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the high-resolution radio dynamic spectra of AD Leonis (AD Leo) between 1.0 and 1.5 GHz taken by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) on Dec. 1st, 2023. Over a 15-minute period, we identify complex, superimposed spectro-temporal structures, including: (1) broadband, second-long modulation lanes with downward frequency drifts, (2) narrowband ($\approx$ 50 MHz), short-duration S-burst envelopes with upward drifts, and (3) even narrower ($\approx$ 10 MHz), millisecond-scale S-burst striae within these envelopes. Using the discrete Fourier transform and auto-correlation function, we identify two dominant periodic emission patterns, corresponding to the periodicities of the S-bursts ($\approx0.1$ s) and the striae ($\approx0.01$ s). The complex superposition of diverse time-frequency structures poses a challenge to interpreting all the emission variability as intrinsic to the source. We propose that the modulation lanes could be a propagation effect as the radio waves traverse an inhomogeneous, regularly structured plasma region in the AD Leo's magnetosphere. By modelling a plasma screen with sinusoidal phase variation in one dimension, we show that we could qualitatively reconstruct the observed modulation lanes. The origin of the finest structures, the striae, remains unclear. Our work highlights that propagation effects in the stellar magnetosphere can potentially probe kilometre-scale structures in the emission regions and provide novel constraints on density inhomogeneities caused by magnetohydrodynamic waves that are difficult to access by other means.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Simulation Box Size for Weak Lensing: Replication and Super-Sample Effects</a><span class="id">[2511.20423]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We quantify the bias caused by small simulation box size on weak lensing observables and covariances, considering both replication and super-sample effects for a range of higher-order statistics. Using two simulation suites – one comprising large boxes ($3750\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$) and another constructed by tiling small boxes ($625\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$) – we generate full-sky convergence maps and extract $10^\circ \times 10^\circ$ patches via a Fibonacci grid. We consider biases in the mean and covariance of the angular power spectrum, bispectrum (up to $\ell=3000$), PDF, peak/minima counts, and Minkowski functionals. By first identifying lines of sight that are impacted by replications, we find that replication causes a O$(10\%)$ bias in the PDF and Minkowski functionals, and a O$(1\%)$ bias in other summary statistics. Replication also causes a O$(10\%)$ bias in the covariances, increasing with source redshift and $\ell$, reaching $\sim25\%$ for $z_s=2.5$. We additionally show that replication leads to heavy biases (up to O$(100\%)$ at high redshift) when performing gnomonic projection on a patch that is centered along a direction of replication. We then identify the lines of sight that are minimally affected by replication, and use the corresponding patches to isolate and study super-sample effects, finding that, while the mean values agree to within $1\%$, the variances differ by O$(10\%)$ for $z_s\leq2.5$. We show that these effects remain in the presence of noise and smoothing scales typical of the DES, KiDS, HSC, LSST, Euclid, and Roman surveys. We also discuss how these effects scale as a function of box size. Our results highlight the importance of large simulation volumes for accurate lensing statistics and covariance estimation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jet reorientation revealed by intermittent jet activity in radio galaxy 0954+556</a><span class="id">[2511.20434]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Intermittent jet activity of AGNs is a common phenomenon, whereas significant jet reorientation during episodic jet activity in relatively young radio galaxies are rarely reported. The quasar 0954+556 at redshift of 0.903 is an intriguing source exhibiting an unusual radio jet structure with significantly different jet directions at kpc and pc scales. At kpc scales, images from the VLA exhibit a bright core, a linear jet extending 24 kpc to the northwest, and a discrete jet component 16 kpc to the northeast. At pc scales, images from the VLBA show a two-component structure with a projected separation of 360 pc in the north-south direction. The peculiar structure of 0954+556 might result from jet reorientation. Here, our aim was to investigate the possible mechanism via multiscale and multifrequency deep radio images. We performed VLA and VLBA observations of 0954+556. Together with some existing data in the NRAO data archive, we made multiple VLA images at 1.4-22 GHz and VLBA images at 1.7-43 GHz for various image analyses of the jet structure. We identified the location of the radio core at pc scales, detected the faint counter-jets at both pc and kpc scales for the first time, and revealed a diffuse emission region connecting pc and kpc scale forward jets. Our spectral index distribution and spectral aging analysis indicate that 0954+556 might undergo at least two episodes of jet activity during the current AGN phase. Moreover, pc scale polarization maps display a well-resolved spine-sheath polarization structure. It seems that the jet direction of 0954+556 changed significantly during intermittent jet activity. This may explain the different jet orientations and spectral ages observed from kpc to pc scales. The research provides a strong case that AGN jet direction might change rapidly on timescales of one million years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The effect of sound speed on the gravitational wave spectrum of first order phase transitions in the early universe</a><span class="id">[2511.20436]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions are a promising probe of physics beyond the Standard Model, as many extensions of the standard model result in first-order phase transitions in the early universe, from which the resulting gravitational waves could be detectable with the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The properties of the phase transition and the resulting gravitational wave spectrum are determined by five key parameters: the nucleation temperature $T_n$, phase transition strength at the nucleation temperature $\alpha_n$, bubble wall speed $v_\text{wall}$, transition rate $\beta$ and the sound speed $c_s$. Of these, the sound speed $c_s$ is determined by the equation of state $p(T,\phi)$. In most studies, the plasma of the early universe has been assumed to be ultrarelativistic and therefore following the bag equation of state with $c_s = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. In this thesis, the PTtools simulation framework for first-order phase transitions, based on the Sound Shell Model, has been extended to include support for arbitrary equations of state and therefore for a temperature- and phase-dependent sound speed $c_s(T,\phi)$. The thesis also functions as a reference manual for PTtools. The framework has been tested with the constant sound speed model, in which the sound speed is a different constant in each phase. The sound speed has been shown to have a significant effect on the resulting gravitational wave spectrum, especially when changing the sound speed results in a change in the type of the solution. This has laid the groundwork for simulating cosmological phase transitions with realistic equations of state. This will result in in gravitational wave spectra that can be used in the LISA data analysis pipeline to search for the existence and parameters of a first-order phase transition in the early universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20452" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Self-Consistent Model of the Ultra High-Energy Gamma-Ray Emission of Pulsar Wind Nebulae: Insights from LHAASO and ATNF Catalogs</a><span class="id">[2511.20452]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are the dominant Ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray sources in the LHAASO catalog suggesting that they are the dominant leptonic PeVatrons in our Galaxy. Despite this, still very little is known about their UHE gamma-ray emission, their number in the Galaxy, or their contribution to the gamma-ray emission of our Galaxy. In this work, we propose a self-consistent data-driven model of the UHE gamma-ray emission of PWNe based on the ATNF and LHAASO catalogs. More specifically, we build a model of the UHE gamma-ray emission of PWNe that preserves the statistical relationships in the ATNF catalog and reproduces the number of PWNe detected in the LHAASO catalog. To cope with the limited data available in the LHAASO catalog when performing fits on gamma-ray data, we introduce the concept of censored regression that allows to also use the information provided by unresolved sources. Using our model, we find that reproducing the number of PWNe detected by LHAASO requires either fractions of misaligned pulsars smaller ($\lesssim60\%$) than usually found in the literature, or that some of the associations of PWNe to ATNF pulsars made by LHAASO may not be true. In both cases, we find that in order to reach self-consistency between radio and gamma-ray data, it is necessary that the majority of the unidentified sources in the LHAASO catalog are PWNe associated to an unseen pulsar. Moreover, using our model we also find that the contribution of unresolved PWNe to the total (diffuse) gamma-ray background measured by LHAASO in the $1-1000\,\rm{TeV}$ range is always smaller than $\lesssim10\%$ ($\lesssim30\%$). We conclude that PWNe mostly contribute to the source component of the UHE gamma-ray sky, while having almost no imprint on its diffuse component.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20465" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advances and Challenges in Solar Flare Prediction: A Review</a><span class="id">[2511.20465]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar flares, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, have a profound impact on both the Earth's space environment and human activities.

Through general-relativistic calculations of uniformly rotating sequences, we analyze their mass–radius relations, moments of inertia, quadrupole moments, surface redshifts, Keplerian frequencies, and energy components. A central result of this work is the full decomposition of the stellar energy budget in rotating strange stars, separating gravitational, internal, rotational, and binding energy contributions. Rotation amplifies the intrinsic EOS differences: the MIT model supports more massive ($M_{\max} \gtrsim 3.3\,M_\odot$) compact stars with larger moments of inertia and greater resistance to deformation, while the DDQM model produces larger radii, less massive stars limited by mass-shedding at lower frequencies. Combined measurements of mass, radius, and frequency can thus break the EOS degeneracy; massive, rapidly rotating pulsars favors MIT-like EOS, whereas larger radii in canonical stars point to a DDQM-like model. These rotational observables, soon to be tightly constrained by NICER and next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, offer a means to test the existence and composition of self-bound quark matter in compact stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A mysterious feature in the NICER spectrum of 4U 1820-30: A gravitationally redshifted absorption line?</a><span class="id">[2511.20499]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A mysterious absorption feature at approximately 3.8 keV has been identified in the NICER spectrum of the low-mass X-ray binary system 4U 1820-30.

This interpretation is supported by the temporal proximity of the NICER observation to the detection of a carbon superburst by the X-ray monitor MAXI, suggesting that the presence of the line is associated with this rare and extreme event. From the inferred redshift of the absorption line, the compactness of the neutron star can be derived. Using a photoionization absorption model, we measure a gravitational redshift of about 1.72, which corresponds to a compactness R/M of 4.46 \pm 0.13 km per solar mass, or 3.02 \pm 0.09 in dimensionless units.

A small portion of the ATCA data was previously used to determine a time delay and our result is consistent with the previous value, but with an uncertainty that is smaller by more than a factor of two. The long time-baseline of the monitoring reveals that the flux density ratio is smoothly varying on a time-scale of years, an effect which we attribute to millilensing by massive objects (&gt;&gt;1 M_sun) in the lensing galaxy. Image A is unpolarized in the VLA monitoring, but VLBI observations show that this is partly due to beam dilution by an unpolarized counter-jet that is only present in that image.

However, recent studies using hydrodynamical simulations have identified a promising correlation between the gas content of halos and changes to the matter power spectrum from feedback. Building on these findings, we create the first fully data-driven power spectrum emulator. We utilize the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect, a secondary anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background, as a tracer of free electrons in and around halos. We train a neural network to learn the mapping between the suppression of the matter power spectrum and the shape of the kSZ power spectrum extracted with a radial velocity template. We train and validate our algorithm using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which encompasses a wide range of feedback models. Our emulator can reconstruct the matter power spectrum at the sub-percent level for scales $k\leq 5\;h/$Mpc and $0.2\leq z \leq 1.25$ directly from the data. Our model is robust and retains percent-level accuracy even for feedback models and cosmological parameter values not seen during training (except in a few extreme cases drastically different from the fiducial model). Due to its robustness, our algorithm offers a new way to identify the sources of suppression in the matter power spectrum, breaking the degeneracies between baryonic feedback and new physics. Finally, we present a forecast for reconstruction of the matter power spectrum combining maps of the microwave background anisotropies from a Simons Observatory-like experiment and galaxy catalogs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relativistic excitation of compact stars</a><span class="id">[2506.23176]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we study the excitation of a compact star under the influence of external gravitational driving in the relativistic regime. Using a model setup in which a wave with constant frequency is injected from past null infinity and scattered by the star to future null infinity, we show that the scattering coefficient encodes rich information of the star. For example, the analytical structure of the scattering coefficient implies that the decay rate of a mode generally plays the role of “star excitation factor”, similar to the “black hole excitation factor” previously defined for describing black hole mode excitations. With this star excitation factor we derive the transient mode excitation as a binary system crosses a generic mode resonance of a companion star during the inspiral stage. This application is useful because previous description of resonant mode excitation of stars still relies on the mode and driving force decomposition based on the Newtonian formalism. In addition, we show that the scattering phase is intimately related to the total energy of spacetime and matter under the driving of a steady input wave from infinity. We also derive the relevant tidal energy of a star under steady driving and compare that with the dynamic tide formula. We estimate that the difference may lead to $\mathcal{O}(0.5)$ radian phase modulation in the late stage of the binary neutron star inspiral waveform.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GREA and Dark Energy: A holographic dual</a><span class="id">[2511.19546]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nature of the cosmological constant is a mystery. We don't understand its quantum origin but we associate it with the actual acceleration of the universe because it is the simplest description we had until recently of the present cosmological observations. However, this may change with the next generation of experiments. If we can convince ourselves that the cosmic acceleration is not due to a constant, this would open up new fascinating avenues. By exploring the simplest cosmological model in the bulk, that of an empty and flat space with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, we find that its holographic dual makes sense as a theory of fundamental quantum degrees of freedom at the boundary. Moreover, we find that an observer in the bulk, making long-range (electromagnetic and gravitational) observations, cannot distinguish the acceleration induced by the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ from that induced by the thermodynamic properties of the boundary, the de Sitter horizon. By including matter in the bulk we extend this holographic principle to GREA, where the quantum d.o.f. associated with the evolving boundary of the causal horizon induces an entropic acceleration that varies in time. Future observations will determine whether our causal horizon is responsible for the present acceleration and whether our universe will end in de Sitter or Minkowski.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background Landscape Across Frequency Bands</a><span class="id">[2511.19590]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave (GW) astrophysics is entering a multi-band era with upcoming GW detectors, enabling detailed mapping of the stochastic GW background across vast frequencies.

If black holes form and evaporate within the cooling timescale of the neutron star, periodic episodes of black hole evaporation could impart a steady-state stellar luminosity, providing a source of heat additional to the kinetic energy of dark matter during capture.

In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data \cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim} and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\lesssim r\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $\alpha^{\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective-one-body modelling of eccentric supermassive black hole binaries for Pulsar Timing Array</a><span class="id">[2511.19611]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) observations will detect gravitational waves (GWs) from the early inspiral phase of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) with orbital periods of weeks to years. Current PTA analyses generally assume circular binaries; however, dynamical interactions with the surrounding environment can prevent complete circularisation, allowing SMBHBs to retain appreciable eccentricities. In this work, we present a gravitational waveform model for eccentric binaries based on the Effective-One-Body (EOB) formalism, designed for continuous GW searches in PTA data. The model is accurate up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order for the conservative dynamics and up to post-leading order for the radiation-reaction terms. We provide both a numerically precise and a computationally efficient approximate implementation and evaluate the latter's accuracy against the full model over a broad range of eccentricities and initial orbital frequencies. Our results show that a substantial region of the parameter space exhibits pronounced orbital evolution, much stronger than in the circular case. We demonstrate the rich harmonic structure of timing residuals induced by eccentric GWs. Properly characterising eccentric binaries is an essential step toward detecting GWs in PTA data and interpreting the results, ultimately improving our understanding of the supermassive black hole population in the local Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19621" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing High Reheating Temperatures by Direct Detection Experiments</a><span class="id">[2511.19621]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We argue that the benchmark freeze in dark matter (DM) scenario for direct detection experiments, in which a DM candidate interacts with the Standard Model (SM) through an ultralight dark photon, becomes sensitive to the visible sector reheating temperature if it is sufficiently high.

As long as gravitationally produced DM does not equilibrate through annihilation into dark photons and the subsequent formation of a dark thermal bath, it retains information about the reheating phase. Including this gravitational contribution relaxes the required DM and SM portal coupling and allows smaller values than those that would match the observed relic abundance through IR freeze in alone.

The model contains a Dirac DM particle $\chi$, three heavy neutrinos $N_I$ with masses $M_{N,I}$, and a singlet scalar $R$ that mixes with the Standard Model Higgs doublet $\Phi$ by an angle $\alpha$. A symmetry forbids the $\Phi$-$R$ portal at tree level; the leading portal then arises at one loop from the same Yukawa structures that generate active neutrino masses $m_{\nu,I}$, implying $\tan(2\alpha) \propto \sum_I m_{\nu,I} M^2_{N,I}/(v_h m_H^2)$, where $v_h$ and $m_H$ are the SM Higgs VEV and mass. For heavy-neutrino masses in the multi-TeV range, this yields a naturally tiny mixing, $\tan(2\alpha)\sim 5\times 10^{-11}\left(M_N/10~\mathrm{TeV}\right)^2$, which strongly suppresses DM signals in direct, indirect, and collider searches. For PeV-scale heavy neutrinos the DM-nucleon cross section can instead enter the reach of direct-detection experiments. The visible and dark sectors thermalize at temperatures of order a few times the mass of the lightest heavy neutrino, then subsequently decouple, and typically evolve with a slightly hotter dark bath. In the secluded regime, with $\tan(2\alpha)\ll 1$ and $m_\chi&gt;m_{H_p}$, the relic density is set by $p$-wave annihilation $\chi\bar\chi \to H_p H_p$ (with $H_p$ the Higgs-like particle of the dark sector), and the dark-sector Yukawa couplings required to reproduce the observed abundance are $\sim(0.1\text{-}1)$, as in the standard WIMP case. For heavy-neutrino masses $\gtrsim 10~\mathrm{TeV}$, the mediator decays before nucleosynthesis without spoiling BBN observables, while the tiny portal suppresses present-day signals below current and near-future sensitivities. This links two long-standing puzzles, the absence of DM signals and the smallness of neutrino masses, within a predictive thermal framework.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19736" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General relativity, early galaxy formation and the JWST observations</a><span class="id">[2511.19736]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The James Webb Space Telescope has recently detected massive, fully formed, galaxies at redshifts corresponding to few hundred million years after the Big-Bang.

We investigated these at selected AERONET sites, including Bahrain, IASBS, Karachi, KAUST Campus, Kuwait University, Lahore, Mezaira, Solar Village, in Southwest Asia, and Dushanbe in Central Asia, using available data from 1998 to 2024. The aerosol optical depth at 870 nm and the temperature recorded at each site are taken as measures of dust outbreak strength and atmospheric surface temperature, respectively. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and the aerosol optical depths recorded by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) on board the Aqua and Terra satellites are used to specify the sources of the dust outbreaks. Our investigations show that in most cases, the temperature decreases during a dust outbreak, but in a considerable number of cases, the temperature rises. Temperature changes are mostly less than 5 °C. We found that a dust outbreak may affect the temperature even up to two days after its highest intensity time. This effect is more profound at sites far from large dust sources, such as IASBS in northwest Iran. For sites that are located on either a dust source or very close to it, the temperature and dust optical depth vary almost synchronously.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New constraints on axion with gamma-ray observations of the Crab Nebula</a><span class="id">[2511.19848]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we derive the upper bounds on the coupling of axion-like particles (ALPs) with photon as a function of the mass by considering axion-photon conversion in the Crab Nebula.

Our results show that the proton anisotropic flows are strongly sensitive to the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potential as well as the incompressibility coefficient $K_0$ of SNM. In addition, the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_2$ exhibits a modest sensitivity to the higher-order skewness coefficient $J_0$ and kurtosis coefficient $I_0$ of SNM as well as the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential, while the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_1$ is shown to modestly depend on the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections. Moreover, the high-density symmetry energy seems to have limited effects on the proton anisotropic flows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials including the symmetry potential, the higher-order characteristic parameters of SNM EOS beyond $K_0$, and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections, in future Bayesian transport model analyses on proton anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES energies, thereby to extract information on nuclear matter EOS as well as the associated underlying nuclear effective interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20461" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chiral phonons in metal-organic frameworks as quantum sensors for the direct detection of dark matter</a><span class="id">[2511.20461]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a new quantum sensor for dark matter direct detection with sub-eV sensitivity, focusing on several candidate materials that potentially host chiral phonons with large magnetic moments that can be directly read out with an external magnetometer.

Two competing ideas prevail: one attributes jet energy to accretion power of the black hole (BH), the other, more interestingly, to magnetic extraction of rotational energy from the BH. A decisive observational distinction between them is still elusive. We propose that BHs remnant from their natal GRB activity can serve as a critical testbed to discriminate between these two scenarios. Via analytical approaches, we demonstrate that extraction of rotational energy to power jets during the GRB phase drives the remnant BH to a universal equilibrium spin, independent of accretion history, initial spin, and mass. This model predicts a stellar-mass BH population with this universal spin, a hallmark of BH spin energy extraction. Testing against the 4th gravitational wave (GW) catalogue (GWTC-4.0), we find a statistically robust dominant population where secondary BH spins are narrowly centered at $\sim0.05$.

However, new results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) suggest a preference for higher values of $n_s$, introducing tension with the simplest realizations of these models. In this work, being agnostic about the nature of the inflaton, we show that incorporating one-loop corrections to a quartic NMC inflationary scenario leads to a shift in the predicted value of $n_s$, which brings NMC inflation into better agreement with ACT observations. The effect is even more significant when the model is formulated in the Palatini approach, where the modified field-space structure naturally enhances deviations from the metric case. These findings highlight the importance of quantum corrections and gravitational degrees of freedom in refining inflationary predictions in light of new data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diversity of low-mass planet atmospheres in the C-H-O-N-S-Cl system with interior dissolution, nonideality, and condensation: Application to TRAPPIST-1e and sub-Neptunes</a><span class="id">[2507.00499]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A quantitative understanding of the nature and composition of low-mass rocky (exo)planet atmospheres during their evolution is needed to interpret observations. The magma ocean stage of terrestrial- and sub-Neptune planets permits mass exchange between their interiors and atmospheres, during which the mass and speciation of the atmosphere is dictated by the planet's volatile budget, chemical equilibria, and gas/fluid solubility in molten rock. As the atmosphere cools, it is modified by gas-phase reactions and condensation. We combine these processes into an open-source Python package built using JAX called Atmodeller, and perform calculations for planet sizes and conditions analogous to TRAPPIST-1e and K2-18b. For TRAPPIST-1e-like planets, our simulations indicate that CO-dominated atmospheres are prevalent during the magma ocean stage, which, upon isochemical cooling, predominantly evolve into CO2-rich atmospheres of a few hundred bar at 280 K. Around 40% of our simulations predict the coexistence of liquid water, graphite, alpha-sulfur, and ammonium chloride, which are key ingredients for surface habitability. For sub-Neptune gas dwarfs, pressures are sufficiently high (a few GPa) that gas fugacities deviate from ideality, thereby drastically enhancing solubilities. This buffers the total atmospheric pressure to lower values than for the ideal case. These effects conspire to produce CH4-rich sub-Neptune atmospheres for total pressures exceeding around 3.5 GPa, provided H/C is approximately 100x solar and fO2 moderately reducing (3 log10 units below the iron-wustite buffer). Otherwise, molecular hydrogen remains the predominant species at lower total pressures and/or higher H/C. For all planets at high temperature, solubility enriches C/H in the atmosphere relative to the initial composition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22285" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Power Spectrum and Bispectrum from Lattice Simulations of Axion-U(1) Inflation</a><span class="id">[2507.22285]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present primordial non-Gaussianity predictions from a new high-precision code for simulating axion-U(1) inflation on a discrete lattice.

Both the gauge-sourced power spectrum and the bispectrum exhibit a strong blue tilt due to our choice of an $\alpha$-attractor inflaton potential. We provide fitting functions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that accurately reproduce these statistics across a wide range of scales and coupling strengths. While our fitting function for the bispectrum has a separable form, results from high-resolution simulations demonstrate that the full shape is not separable. Thus, our simulations generate realizations of primordial curvature perturbations with nontrivial correlators that cannot be generated using standard techniques for primordial non-Gaussianity. We derive bounds on the axion-gauge coupling strength based on the bispectrum constraints from the cosmic microwave background, demonstrating a new method for constraining inflationary primordial non-Gaussianity by simulating the nonlinear dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22618" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LiteBIRD science goals and forecasts: improved full-sky reconstruction of the gravitational lensing potential through the combination of Planck and LiteBIRD data</a><span class="id">[2507.22618]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons are deflected by large-scale structure through gravitational lensing.

Gravitational lensing has been measured by previous CMB experiments, with $\textit{Planck}$'s $42\,\sigma$ detection being the current best full-sky lensing map. We present an enhanced $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ lensing map by extending the CMB multipole range and including the minimum-variance estimation, leading to a $49$ to $58\,\sigma$ detection over $80\,\%$ of the sky, depending on the final complexity of polarized Galactic emission. The combination of $\textit{Planck}$ and $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ will be the best full-sky lensing map in the 2030s, providing a $72$ to $78\,\sigma$ detection over $80\,\%$ of the sky, almost doubling $\textit{Planck}$'s sensitivity.

Using a semi-analytical relation that connects inflationary dynamics to reheating, we solve for the horizon-crossing field value and calculate the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the reheating temperature $T_{re}$. We consider three perturbative decay channels of the inflaton: gravitational, Yukawa (fermionic), and scalar. The parameter space spanned by $(\alpha,p,\omega_{re})$ for the first model and $(\alpha,\omega_{re})$ for the second is explored and compared with recent measurements from Planck and ACT DR6, as well as BAO from DESI DR2. For clarity, we emphasize that ACT DR6 alone is fully compatible with Planck regarding $n_s$. The upward shift toward $n_s \simeq 0.975$ appears only when DESI DR2 BAO are combined with CMB datasets (Planck+DESI, ACT+DESI, SPT-3G+DESI), and is likewise seen in the P–ACT–LB2+DESI combination. CMB-only combinations (e.g., Planck+ACT or Planck+ACT+SPT-3G) primarily refine constraints and do not by themselves raise $n_s$. Our comparisons and model assessments are therefore made with this distinction in mind: CMB-only constraints versus CMB+DESI combinations. We conclude that both models remain consistent with current CMB-only data in restricted regions of parameter space, and that residual tension with the higher $n_s$ favored by CMB+DESI persists.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preferential Positron Acceleration in Relativistic Magnetized Electron-Positron-Ion Shocks</a><span class="id">[2508.06120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Relativistic shocks are considered efficient accelerators of charged particles and play crucial roles in high-energy astrophysical phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts and pulsar winds.

Our analysis reveals fundamental insights into the physics governing state transitions in stellar-mass black holes. We discover distinct bimodal flux distributions in the 8-79 keV band with well-separated peaks, contrasting with overlapping distributions in the 3-8 keV band. This energy-dependent bimodality establishes hard X-rays as the optimal diagnostic for state classification, directly tracing the geometric transformation between corona-dominated and disk-dominated configurations. Power spectral analysis uncovers state-dependent characteristic frequencies shifting from 0.050 Hz (hard) to 0.074 Hz (intermediate), with featureless red noise in soft states. These frequencies correspond to disk truncation radii evolving from $\sim$5.5 $R_g$ to $\sim$2 $R_g$, providing direct observational evidence for the inward progression of the accretion disk during state transitions. Frequency-dependent time lags evolve systematically from $\sim$50 ms hard lags at 0.1 Hz in hard states to near-zero in soft states, quantifying the collapse of the Comptonizing corona. Linear rms-flux relations persist across all states with parameters that precisely track the relative contributions of thermal versus non-thermal emission components. Most remarkably, we identify a failed state transition (observation 30302019006) exhibiting anticorrelated band behavior, suppressed variability ($F_{var}$ &lt; 1.38\%), and apparent sub-ISCO truncation. This discovery challenges standard transition models and suggests new pathways for accretion flow evolution in wind-fed systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strategy for identifying Vera C.

Overlapping observations between the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the international gravitational-wave detector network are expected soon. Wide-field survey facilities, such as Rubin, can serve dual roles in gravitational-wave astronomy: conducting dedicated optical counterpart searches following gravitational-wave triggers and, through surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), providing opportunities for fortuitous kilonova discoveries during routine operations. We use simulations to develop a strategy for identifying kilonova candidates observed by Rubin and processed by the Fink broker. These candidates can be used as astrophysical triggers for a targeted gravitational-wave search. We simulate kilonovae light-curves for the first year of Rubin with the latest observing strategy for the Wide-Fast-Deep and the Deep Drilling Fields. Assuming a kilonova rate of 250 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, we find that Rubin brokers should observe $\sim 4$ kilonovae per year with at least one alert above a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 within the gravitational-wave detector horizon ($\sim 350$ Mpc). Most of these will be faint, and detected 1-2 days following the neutron star merger. Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up will be limited to large telescopes. Using archival data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and our proposed selection criteria, we estimate a minimum contamination of at least 30 events per month from other transients and variables, even under our strictest selection criteria. A deep gravitational-wave search targeting Rubin kilonova candidates may lead to the next multi-messenger discovery.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultraviolet Spectral Evidence for Ansky as a Slowly Evolving Featureless Tidal Disruption Event with Quasiperiodic Eruptions</a><span class="id">[2510.22211]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are rare and enigmatic phenomena that increasingly show a connection to tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, the recently discovered QPEs in ZTF19acnskyy (&quot;Ansky&quot;) appear to be linked to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) rather than a TDE, as their slow decay and AGN-like variability differ markedly from that of typical TDEs. This finding may imply broader formation channels for QPEs. To further investigate Ansky's nature, we obtained a timely ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which reveals a featureless, TDE-like spectrum devoid of broad optical or UV emission lines. Additionally, the steep UV continuum, fitted by a power law with an index of -2.6, aligns more closely with TDEs than with AGNs. Compared to other featureless TDEs, Ansky exhibits a significantly lower blackbody luminosity (10^43 erg s^-1) and much longer rise and decay timescales, suggesting a distinct TDE subclass. An offset TDE involving an intermediate-mass black hole is unlikely, given its position consistent with the galactic center with a 3 sigma upper limit of 54 pc. Instead, we propose that Ansky may result from the tidal disruption of a post-main-sequence star by a typical supermassive black hole. Our findings strengthen the growing evidence for TDE-QPE associations, although other formation channels for QPEs remain plausible and await future observational efforts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-inclination Centaur reservoirs beyond Neptune</a><span class="id">[2511.03021]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>(Abridged) Numerical simulations of the past evolution of high-inclination Centaurs showed they originated from orbits beyond Neptune that were perpendicular to the Solar System's invariable plane in a region called the polar corridor. Recently, a study of Centaur injection in the three-body problem showed that Neptune-crossing TNOs in the polar corridor in the range [40:160] au have dynamical times that exceed the Solar System's age suggesting the presence of long-lived Centaur-producing reservoirs. We demonstrate the existence of such reservoirs in the Solar System by simulating the TNOs' time-forward evolution in the presence of the giant planets, the Galactic tide and passing stars using the IAS15 integrator of the REBOUND and REBOUNDx packages. We also assess the efficiency of Centaur injection as a function of the initial inclination and determine if high-inclination Centaurs may be produced by low inclination reservoirs. We find that TNO reservoirs in the semi-major axis range [50:140] au are long-lived and their populations peak at the Tisserand parameters T=0.5 and T=-1.5. Saturn is found to induce secondary structures in the polar corridor by holding the perihelia of a fraction of high-inclination reservoir material. We find that the Centaur inclination at minimum semi-major axis depends linearly on the Tisserand parameter regardless of the initial semi-major axis. Its amplitude shows that low inclination reservoirs such as the early protoplanetary disk are unlikely to produce high-inclination Centaurs in contrast to reservoirs in the polar corridor. We identified the likely location of the closest reservoirs to Neptune populated by TNOs captured in the early Solar System that produce high-inclination Centaurs.

The long-term MAXI light curve, along with the hardness-intensity diagram (HID) derived from NICER data, indicates that the source remained in the hard state and did not switch to the soft state. Spectral modeling using two different model combinations reveals that the broadband spectrum is best described by two distinct Comptonizing regions, associated reflection components, and thermal emission from the disk. The harder Comptonizing region dominates ($\gtrsim88\%$) the total flux and is primarily responsible for the observed reflection features from the distant part of the disk. We find that the accretion disk is truncated at a radius of $\sim16-56~r_{\rm{g}}$, while the luminosity is $\sim1.9\%$ of the Eddington limit. Our spectral results also show consistency in the estimated inner disk radius obtained through two independent methods: modeling the disk continuum and the reflection spectrum. The variability studies imply the presence of intrinsic disk variability, likely originating from an instability in the disk. We also detect hard time lags at low frequencies, possibly arising from the inward propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations from the outer to the inner regions of the accretion disk. Moreover, an observed deviation of the lag-energy spectrum from the log-linear trend at $\lesssim 0.7$ keV is most likely attributed to thermal reverberation, arising from the reprocessing of hard coronal photons in the accretion disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13866" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large Scale White Noise and Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2511.13866]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The generation of white noise on large scales is a generic property of the dynamics of physical systems described by local non-linear partial differential equations. Non-linearities prevent the small scale dynamics from being erased by smoothing. Unresolved small scale dynamics act as an uncorrelated (white or Poissonian) noise (seemingly stochastic but actually deterministic) contribution to large scale dynamics. This white noise exists even when the dynamics is very nearly linear. In cases where the power spectrum is sub-Poissonian on large scales, this noise will dominate on the largest scale power no matter the amplitude of the inhomogeneities. Such is the case in the standard model of cosmology, where the primordial density power spectrum is expected to have an almost Harrison-Zel'dovich, $P[k]\sim k$, spectrum on a much broader range of scales than can be observed. Even though linear gravitational evolution dominates non-linear corrections by a factor $\sim10^5$, the non-observation of white noise on the Hubble scale precludes the extrapolation of this power law below the comoving $1\,$pc scale. More generally, observation or non-observation of large scale white noise provides a powerful probe of the universe on very small scales in the early early universe. Gravitational radiation, phase transitions, vorticity, and running of the spectral index are all phenomena that can be probed with large scale white noise. Large scale white noise is a non-optional feature of all cosmological models but one which has not heretofore been appreciated.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaping the Mantle: The Role of the Superheated Core After Giant Impacts</a><span class="id">[2511.14041]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Moon-forming giant impact significantly influenced the initial thermal state of Earth's mantle by generating a global magma ocean, marking the onset of mantle evolution. Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277–5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15701" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Cross-correlation of kSZ and continuity equation velocity reconstruction with photometric DESI LRGs</a><span class="id">[2511.15701]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the last year, kinematic Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (kSZ) velocity reconstruction – the measurement of the large-scale velocity field using the anisotropic statistics of the small-scale kSZ-galaxy overdensity correlation – has emerged as a statistically significant probe of the large-scale Universe.

The model is constrained by the requirement that its deceleration parameter coincides with the one predicted by the {\Lambda}CDM model. Then, we construct the effective running Hubble constant, a theoretical function that corresponds to the ratio of the Hubble parameter in our model to the {\Lambda}CDM expansion rate. The model's theoretical predictions for the effective running Hubble constant are compared with the binned data of the Supernovae Ia Master Sample. The comparison is performed by a MCMC procedure for each bin, with three parameters left free to vary, while the particle creation rate is taken from a grid of values, each of which is fixed in the given MCMC run. The most important result emerging from this analysis is that the created dark energy constituent corresponds to an equation of state parameter with phantom character. Only if particle creation is removed do the dark energy constituents acquire a quintessence character. No matter the intrinsic nature of the constituents, their effective z-dependent equation of state parameter is, both with and without considering particle creation, entirely of phantom nature across the considered redshift range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16719" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General relativity and the bulk-flow puzzle</a><span class="id">[2404.16719]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bulk peculiar flows are commonplace in the universe, with many surveys reporting their presence on scales spanning between few hundred and several hundred Mpc.

Having said that, essentially all the available theoretical studies are Newtonian, or quasi-Newtonian, in nature and both bypass a key feature of peculiar motions, namely the gravitational contribution of the \textit{peculiar flux}. To begin with, recall that bulk flows are matter in motion and that moving matter means nonzero energy flux. In relativity energy fluxes gravitate, but the gravitational input of the peculiar flux has been largely bypassed. As we will show here, when the flux contribution to the gravitational field is accounted for, linear peculiar velocities grow considerably faster than in the Newtonian/quasi-Newtonian studies.

In this article, we point out that the pulsation structures in both the intensity and polarization of X-rays from NS's could provide us additional information about axions and their couplings. We develop new analytical formalisms of pulsation-polarization structure applicable to a wide range of NS's in the axion scenario and argue that they hold in complicated astrophysical environments. As a case study, we apply our formalism to a representative X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron Star, RX J1856.6-3754, with an unexpected hard X-ray excess which might be axion-induced. We show with an updated fit that the axion explanation is compatible with both the intensity and pulsation data available, and combining the pulsation data does not shift the posterior by more than $1\,\sigma$. Yet, the preferred parameter space is close to being excluded by other astrophysical constraints. With a 75% reduction of the uncertainties in the pulsation data, we could potentially draw a definite conclusion on the axion-induced X-rays at more than $3\,\sigma$ level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optical Images of Mini Boson Stars in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity</a><span class="id">[2501.13764]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the optical properties of mini boson stars within the framework of Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, adopting a quadratic form $f(R) = R + \xi R^2$, where $\xi$ is the gravitational coupling constant. By deriving the modified scalar Lagrangian and solving the field equations numerically, we explore photon trajectories and the resulting optical images under spherical light sources and thin accretion disks. Unlike Schwarzschild black holes (BHs), boson stars lack stable photon rings due to the positive second derivative of their effective potential. Consequently, their images are dominated by direct emissions from photons completing a single orbit. The study examines the dependence of the optical characteristics on the initial scalar field $\psi_0$ and the coupling parameter $\xi$. Numerical results include effective potentials, redshift maps, and detailed imaging of boson stars, providing insights into distinguishing boson stars from black holes using high-resolution astronomical observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05835" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scalar-assisted magnetogenesis during the radiation-dominated epoch</a><span class="id">[2504.05835]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a novel mechanism to generate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) strong enough to explain the observed cosmic magnetic fields. We employ a scalar field charged under U(1) gauge symmetry with a non-trivial VEV to provide an effective mass term to the EM field and thus break its conformal invariance. The primordial magneto-genesis takes place in the radiation dominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) phase. As a result, our mechanism is naturally free from the over-production of electric fields due to high conductivity in the RD epoch, and the baryon isocurvature problem which takes place only if magneto-genesis happens before the ESWB phase. In addition, we find that a significant amount of PMFs can be generated when the scalar field experiences a tachyonic phase. In this case, the scalar field is light and weakly coupled and has negligible energy density compared to the cold dark matter, hence the strong coupling problem and the back-reaction problem are also absent. Therefore, our model is free from the above-mentioned problems that frequently appear in other primordial magneto-genesis scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chronology Protection of Rotating Black Holes in a Viable Lorentz-Violating Gravity</a><span class="id">[2509.19744]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study causal properties of the recently found rotating black-hole solution in the low-energy sector of Horava gravity as a viable Lorentz-violating (LV) gravity in four dimensions with the LV Maxwell field and a cosmological constant $\Lambda (&gt;-3/a^2)$ for an arbitrary rotation parameter $a$. The region of non-trivial causality violation containing closed timelike curves is exactly the same as in the Kerr-Newman or the Kerr-Newman-(Anti-)de Sitter solution. Nevertheless, chronology is protected in the new rotating black hole because the causality violating region becomes physically inaccessible by exterior observers due to the new three-curvature singularity at its boundary that is topologically two-torus including the usual ring singularity at $(r,\theta)=(0,\pi/2)$. As a consequence, the physically accessible region outside the torus singularity is causal everywhere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMB observables and reheat temperature as a window to models of inflation and freeze-in dark matter production</a><span class="id">[2510.27587]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A systematic approach is presented for using CMB observables and reheating temperature for discriminating between various models of inflation and certain freeze-in dark matter scenarios. It is applied to several classes of $\alpha$-attractor models as an illustrative example. In the first step, all independent parameters of the inflationary potential are expressed in terms of the CMB observables (the three parameters - by the scalar spectral index $n_s$, scalar amplitude $A_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio $r$). For a standard reheating mechanism characterized by the inflaton equation of state parameter $w$ and its effective dissipation rate $\Gamma$ the reheating temperature is uniquely fixed in terms of the CMB observables measured for some pivot scale $k_*$. There are striking consequences of this fact. The model independent bounds on the reheating temperature, the BBN lower bound and the upper bound of the order of the GUT/Planck scale, translate themselves for each class of models into very narrow ranges of the allowed values of the spectral index $n_s(k_*)$, providing their strong tests by the present and future CMB data. The recent tension between Planck and DESI-ACT results has strong impact on our conclusions. Furthermore, given a class of inflaton models satisfying those tests, the reheating temperature is an interesting portal to link the CMB observables to the particle physics scenarios that are sensitive to it. As an example, non-thermal dark matter (DM) production mechanisms are discussed. One obtains then a consistency check between theories of inflation and DM production. If the future precision of the CMB data will constrain the reheating temperature beyond the model independent bounds, further constraints on the DM production will follow.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13642" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coupling between gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations on Kerr Spacetime</a><span class="id">[2511.13642]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extend our previous Schwarzschild metric-based studies of gravitational–electromagnetic (GEM) coupling to rotating black holes by working directly in a curvature-based Newman–Penrose/Teukolsky framework on Kerr spacetime.

Moreover, we give order-of-magnitude arguments showing that GEM quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs) can become relevant in a range of charged and magnetized astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we show through a brief dilaton-theory example that the GEM QQNM spectrum is sensitive to how gravity couples to electromagnetism, thereby providing a model-based way to test minimal coupling and to constrain hidden $U(1)$ sectors with gravitational-wave observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15049" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The effects of dark energy on the matter-gravity coupling</a><span class="id">[2511.15049]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark energy perturbations are expected to modify the evolution of cosmological perturbations, producing different observational effects.

For adiabatic perturbations the effective gravitational coupling for scalar perturbations can be negative for phantom dark energy, providing an explanation for the observed structure suppression at low redshift, consistent with other independent evidences of evolving dark energy.</p></div></details></article></body>
