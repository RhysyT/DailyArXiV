To enhance sensitivity to this targeted population, we incorporate a redshift-corrected population model based on radio observations of Galactic double neutron star systems. The search identifies a significant trigger with a false-alarm rate of about one per 50 years and a network signal-to-noise ratio of 9.7, which was first reported by the LVK in low-latency processing as S231109ci and subsequently in the GWTC-4.0 catalog as GW231109_235456, a sub-threshold candidate. Accounting for a trials factor of five from the four LVK searches in GWTC-4.0 and this new search, the false-alarm rate of the reported candidate is approximately one per 10 years. If this event is of astrophysical origin, the inferred source properties indicate component masses of 1.40 to 2.24 solar masses for the primary and 0.97 to 1.49 solar masses for the secondary, yielding a total mass of 2.95 (+0.38, -0.07) solar masses. The event was localized to a region of 450 square degrees (90 percent probability) at a luminosity distance of 165 (+70, -69) megaparsecs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Precise Constraints on the Energy Budget of WASP-121 b from its JWST NIRISS/SOSS Phase Curve</a><span class="id">[2509.09760]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-hot Jupiters exhibit day-to-night temperature contrasts upwards of 1000 K due to competing effects of strong winds, short radiative timescales, magnetic drag, and H2 dissociation/recombination. Spectroscopic phase curves provide critical insights into these processes by mapping temperature distributions and constraining the planet's energy budget across different pressure levels. Here, we present the first NIRISS/SOSS phase curve of an ultra-hot Jupiter, WASP-121 b. The instrument's bandpass [0.6 - 2.85 micron] captures an estimated 50-83% of the planet's bolometric flux, depending on orbital phase, allowing for unprecedented constraints on the planet's global energy budget; previous measurements with HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec/G395H captured roughly 20% of the planetary flux. Accounting for the unobserved regions of the spectrum, we estimate effective day and nightside temperatures of T_day = 2717 +/- 17 K and T_night = 1562 +/- 19 K corresponding to a Bond albedo of A_B = 0.277 +/- 0.016 and a heat recirculation efficiency of epsilon = 0.246 +/- 0.014. Matching the phase-dependent effective temperature with energy balance models yields a similar Bond albedo of 0.3 and a mixed layer pressure of 1 bar consistent with photospheric pressures, but unexpectedly slow winds of 0.2 km/s, indicative of inefficient heat redistribution. The shorter optical wavelengths of the NIRISS/SOSS Order 2 yield a geometric albedo of A_g = 0.093 +/- 0.029 (3 sigma upper limit of 0.175), reinforcing the unexplained trend of hot Jupiters exhibiting larger Bond albedos than geometric albedos. We also detect near-zero phase curve offsets for wavelengths above 1.5 micron, consistent with inefficient heat transport, while shorter wavelengths potentially sensitive to reflected light show eastward offsets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New Generation Planetary Population Synthesis (NGPPS). VII. Statistical comparison with the HARPS/Coralie survey</a><span class="id">[2509.09762]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We seek to quantify the fidelity with which modern population syntheses reproduce observations in view of their use as predictive tools. We compared synthetic populations from the Generation 3 Bern Model of Planet Formation and Evolution (core accretion, solar-type host stars) and the HARPS/Coralie radial velocity sample. We biased the synthetic planet population according to the completeness of the observed data and performed quantitative statistical comparisons and systematically identified agreements and differences. Our nominal population reproduces many of the main features of the HARPS planets: two main groups of planets (close-in sub-Neptunes and distant giants), a bimodal mass function with a less populated `desert', an observed mean multiplicity of about 1.6, and several key correlations. The remaining discrepancies point to areas that are not fully captured in the model. For instance, we find that the synthetic population has 1) in absolute terms too many planets by  70%, 2) a `desert' that is too deep by  60%, 3) a relative excess of giant planets by  40%, 4) planet eccentricities that are on average too low by a factor of about two (median of 0.07 versus 0.15), and 5) a metallicity effect that is too weak. Finally, the synthetic planets are overall too close to the star compared to the HARPS sample. The differences allowed us to find model parameters that better reproduce the observed planet masses, for which we computed additional synthetic populations. We find that physical processes appear to be missing and that planets may originate on wider orbits than our model predicts. Mechanisms leading to higher eccentricities and slower disc-limited gas accretion also seem necessary. We advocate that theoretical models should make a quantitative comparison between the many current and future large surveys to better understand the origins of planetary systems.

Granulation is particularly challenging, as it affects even the most inactive stars introducing substantial signals, with amplitudes up to 1 m/s. Disentangling granulation-induced RV jitter from signal caused by planetary reflex motion requires reliable models of stellar granulation. In this study, we present a new approach for calculating sensitivities of spectral lines to granulation. We simulate near-surface convection with 3D radiative MHD code MURaM and calculate high-resolution emergent spectra with the radiative transfer code MPS-ATLAS. We then introduce a novel methodology that uses spatial variability of spectral lines across the granulation pattern at a single moment in time to compute their temporal variability. This approach significantly reduces computational costs. We apply our approach to analyze the response of lines from neutral and singly ionized elemental species to solar this http URL find a clear distinction between the two groups of lines: those from neutral elements tend to show stronger variations in line strength, whereas those from singly ionized elements exhibit larger variations in central wavelength. These results enable the development of spectral line masks tailored to granulation sensitivity, offering a promising strategy to reduce granulation-induced RV noise and improve exoplanet detection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery and Analysis of Afterglows from Poorly Localised GRBs with the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) All-sky Survey</a><span class="id">[2509.09827]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), particularly those detected by wide-field instruments such as the Fermi/GBM, pose a challenge for optical follow-up due to their large initial localisation regions, leaving many GRBs without identified afterglows. The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO), with its wide field of view, dual-site coverage, and robotic rapid-response capability, bridges this gap by rapidly identifying and localising afterglows from alerts issued by space-based facilities including Fermi, SVOM, Swift, and the EP, providing early optical positions for coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up. In this paper, we present optical afterglow localisation and multi-band follow-up of seven Fermi/GBM and MAXI/GSC triggered long GRBs (240122A, 240225B, 240619A, 240910A, 240916A, 241002B, and 241228B) discovered by GOTO in 2024. Spectroscopy for six GRBs (no spectroscopic data for GRB 241002B) with VLT/X-shooter and GTC/OSIRIS yields precise redshifts spanning $z\approx0.40-$3.16 and absorption-line diagnostics of host and intervening systems. Radio detections for four events confirm the presence of long-lived synchrotron emission. Prompt-emission analysis with Fermi and MAXI data reveals a spectrally hard population, with two bursts lying $&gt;3\sigma$ above the Amati relation. Although their optical afterglows resemble those of typical long GRBs, the prompt spectra are consistently harder than the long-GRB average. Consistent modelling of six GOTO-discovered GRB afterglows yields jet half-opening angles of a few degrees and beaming-corrected kinetic energies ($E_{jet}\sim10^{51-52}$) erg, consistent with the canonical long-GRB population. These findings suggest that optical discovery of poorly localised GRBs may be subject to observational biases favouring luminous events with high spectral peak energy, while also providing insight into jet microphysics and central engine diversity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamically New Comet C/2025 D1 (Groeller) with Record Perihelion Distance</a><span class="id">[2509.09829]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We studied C/2025 D1 (Groeller), a long-period comet with an unprecedented perihelion distance of 14.1 au, using archival observations. The data reveals that it had been active at inbound heliocentric distances $r_{\rm H} \gtrsim 20$ au. Initially, the comet intrinsically brightened at $r_{\rm H} \gtrsim 16$ au, with brightening parameters comparable to those of other long-period comets. However, observations after late 2023 showed a gradual decay, despite the inbound trajectory of the comet. To our knowledge, such behaviours have not been observed for other long-period comets at similar heliocentric distances. We speculate that this might be linked to the onset of CO$_{2}$ sublimation and/or crystallisation processes. The surface brightness profile of the coma indicates a steady-state mass loss, implying supervolatile sublimation as the primary driver of the observed activity. Despite changes in the orbital plane angle, the circularly symmetric coma persisted throughout the observed period, indicative of the dominance of large grains in the coma. Assuming the activity trend is independent of bandpass, we found that comet was redder than many other solar system comets. Our model-dependent constraint estimates the nucleus radius to be $\gtrsim\!0.4$ km. We performed astrometric measurements, refined the orbital solution, and derived the original and future orbits of the comet. Our N-body integration, accounting for the Galactic tide, strongly favours that the comet is dynamically new, with its previous perihelion at $\gtrsim\!60$ au from the Sun $\gtrsim\!6$ Myr ago. It is highly likely that the comet will be lost from our solar system after the current apparition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09858" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Initial conditions for tidal synchronisation of a planet by its moon</a><span class="id">[2509.09858]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Moons tidally interact with their host planets and stars. A close moon is quickly synchronised by the planet, or becomes captured in a higher spin-orbit resonance. However, the planet requires much more time to significantly alter its rotation rate under the influence of moon-generated tides. The situation becomes more complex for close-in planets, as star-generated tides come into play and compete with the moon-generated tides. Synchronisation of the planet by its moon changes the tidal dynamics of the entire star-planet-moon system and can lead to long-term stable configurations. In this paper, we demonstrate that a certain initial condition must be met for this to occur. Based on the angular-momentum conservation, the derived condition is universal and bears no dependence upon the planet's internal structure or tidal dissipation model. It is applicable to dwindling systems as well as tidally expanding orbits, and to the cases of initially retrograde motion. We present calculations for specific planet-moon systems (Earth and the Moon; Neptune and Triton; Venus and its hypothetical presently-extinct moon Neith; Mars, Phobos, and Deimos; Pluto and Charon), to constrain the dynamically plausible formation and evolution scenarios. Among other things, our analysis prompts the question of whether Pluto and Charon evolved into their current state from an initially more compact configuration (as is commonly assumed) or from a wider orbit – a topic to be discussed at length elsewhere. Our results are equally applicable to exoplanets. For example, if asynchronous close-in exoplanets are detected, the possibility of tidal synchronisation by an exomoon should be considered.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Propeller effect in action: unveiling quenched accretion in the transient X-ray pulsar 4U 0115+63</a><span class="id">[2509.09860]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Be/X-ray pulsar 4U 0115+63 underwent a type II outburst in 2023. After the outburst, similar to the outbursts in 2015 and 2017, the source decayed into a quiescent state. Two out of three XMM-Newton observations conducted after the 2023 outburst confirmed the source to be in a low-luminosity state at a level of $L_{\rm X} \sim 10^{33}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. X-ray pulsations were detected at $\approx$0.277 Hz in both observations with a pulsed fraction exceeding 50%. The power density spectra show no significant low-frequency red noise in both observations, suggesting that the radiation is not driven by accretion. The energy spectra in this state can be described by a single blackbody component, with an emitting area smaller than the typical size of the polar caps during the accretion phase. Based on the timing and spectral properties, we suggest that the propeller effect is active during the quiescent state, resulting in a total quenching of accretion. We discuss possible mechanisms for the generation of pulsations in this regime and consider the scenario of neutron star crust cooling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09876" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trends in the Population of Binary Black Holes Following the Fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog: a Data-Driven Analysis</a><span class="id">[2509.09876]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current population models of binary black hole distributions are difficult to interpret because standard population inferences hinge on modeling choices, which can mask or mimic real structure. The maximum population likelihood “$\pistroke$ formalism” provides a means to investigate and interpret features in the distribution of binary black holes using only data – without specifying a population model. It tells us if features inferred from current population models are truly present in the data or if they arise from model misspecification. It also provides guidance for developing new models by highlighting previously unnoticed features. In this study, we utilize the $\pistroke$ formalism to examine the binary black hole population in the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA (LVK) fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4). Our analysis supports the existence of a gap around $45\,M_\odot$ in the secondary black hole mass distribution and identifies a widening in the distribution of the effective inspiral spin parameter $\chi_\text{eff}$ near this mass as recently reported by Tong et al. (2025). Similar to earlier studies, we find support for an anti-correlation between $\chi_\text{eff}$ and mass ratio. However, we argue that this may be a spurious correlation arising from misspecification of the joint distribution of black hole masses. Furthermore, we identify support for dimensionless black hole spin magnitudes at approximately $\chi \approx 0.2$ and $\chi\approx0.7$. The data support the existence of a correlation between the spin magnitudes $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, though subsequent study is required to determine if this feature is statistically significant. The accompanying data release includes $\pistroke$ samples, which can be used to compare theoretical predictions to LVK data and to assess assumptions in parameterised models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laplace-Fourier linear stability analysis of non-relativistic magnetized rotational jets: mode identification by Hamiltonian analysis and the occurrence of mode transitions</a><span class="id">[2509.09929]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we conduct a linear stability analysis of magnetized and/or rotating jets propagating in ambient matter that is also magnetized and/or rotating, having in mind the application to the jet penetrating the core/envelope of a massive star. We solve the linearized magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the non-relativistic regime by Laplace transform in time and Fourier transform in space. In this formulation all unstable modes with the same translational and azimuthal wave numbers can be obtained simultaneously by searching for pole singularities in the complex plane. In order to determine unambiguously their driving mechanisms, we evaluate the second-order perturbation of the MHD Hamiltonian for individual eigenfunctions derived at these singular points. We identify in our non-rotating models the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) as one of the shear-driven modes and the current-driven instability such as the kink instability (KKI). In rotational models we also find the magnetorotational instability (MRI) as another shear-driven mode. In some cases, we find that a mode changes its character continuously from KKI to KHI (and vice versa) or from MRI to KHI as the jet velocity is increased.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supra-arcade downflows in an extensive fan associated with a giant quiescent solar filament eruption</a><span class="id">[2509.09944]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the aftermath of a giant quiescent solar filament eruption on December 24, 2023. One feature of the eruption is an extensive fan above the filament channel that is about three times as wide as similar structures that appear above active regions (ARs) during solar flares. The fan contains numerous supra-arcade downflows (SADs), and we investigate the largest SADs with continuous Hinode X-ray Telescope (XRT) observations. The measured maximum width of the SADs in this event is at least three times the maximum width of SADs observed in AR flares, whereas the velocities of the largest SADs are similar to the typical values of AR SADs. The kinetic characteristics of the largest SADs observed in this event align with previous model predictions, where SADs originate from the non-linear development of Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities. In this scenario, the larger system size allows the existence of larger-scale instabilities, while the development of the velocities of these instabilities is expected to be independent of the system size. Compared to AR flares, the temperature and emission measure in this event are lower, and there is less overall radiation, resulting in no evident Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) signature. Similar to those in AR flares, SADs show lower temperatures compared to the surrounding fan plasma. Our observations show that SADs are present in a wide variety of eruptions. The reconnection mechanisms present in quiescent filament eruptions are similar to those driving more compact eruptions originating from ARs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Encyclopedia of Astrophysics: The Expanding Universe</a><span class="id">[2509.09954]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The expansion of the Universe is the basis of modern cosmology.

The network cells have an average lifetime of 24 hr, a size of about 30 Mm, and a lane width of about 6 Mm. We have obtained the lane widths and intensities at different latitudes from the Ca {\sc ii} K spectroheliograms from the 100 yr Kodaikanal archival data. We have then calculated the cross correlation function of lane widths and intensities with sunspot number at every latitude from 60$^{\circ}$ N to 60$^{\circ}$ S. The correlation coefficients of the quantities show an approximate North-South symmetry with broad peaks around $\pm$(11–22)$^{\circ}$ latitude with values of about 0.8. The results imply that these latitudes follow the sunspot cycle strongly. The maximum correlation for the lane widths occurs (18$\pm$2)$^{\circ}$ N and (20$\pm$2)$^{\circ}$ S with no phase difference. For intensities, this happens at (13$\pm$2)$^{\circ}$ N and (14$\pm$2)$^{\circ}$ S with a phase difference of 1.25 to 1.5 yr. It is interesting to note that the lane width correlations peak during the solar maximum whereas the intensitiy correlations peak 1.25–1.5 yr after the solar maximum. The results, generally show that no unique latitude exactly follows the solar cycle for all quantities. The results are important in flux transport on the solar surface and have implications for the quiet Sun UV irradiance variations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hubble constant from the improved lens modeling of cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal with new spectroscopic redshifts and the Jackknife method</a><span class="id">[2509.09979]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Time-delay cosmology offers an alternative approach to measuring the Hubble constant ($H_0$), which is distinct from the cosmic distance ladder and cosmic microwave background radiation methods.

During the quiescent state, the white dwarf (WD) photosphere may be observable. Some of these systems show periodic variability consistent with a non-radial oscillation. Asteroseismology has become a unique tool for the measurement of internal structure of the WDs, such as their masses, radii, temperatures and rotation profiles. A few stable periodicities have been observed for accreting WDs, but the lack of complete and accurate theoretical models has hindered the real diagnosis of the observed pulsations. Though the associated pulsations in accreting WDs are thought to be $g$-modes, some work in the literature suggests that these pulsations could be Rossby modes ($r$-modes). Here, to elucidate this, we present a first simultaneous analysis of $g$- and $r$-mode pulsations in accreting white dwarfs including a full computation of visibility accounting for the distribution of variation over the WD surface. We show that, up to the second lowest degree ($\ell =2$), neither $g-$ nor $r$-modes have a clear advantage in visibility. Although a few retrograde $r$-mode orders exhibit a larger visibility, the low-order $g$ modes possess higher frequency in the star's frame, making them more likely to be driven within the convective driving scenario commonly applied to isolated WDs. Therefore, we favor a $g$-mode origin for the observed periods in accreting WDs, though $r$-modes will be important for stars with more observed modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effects of harmonic magnetic field boundary conditions in mean-field solar dynamo</a><span class="id">[2509.09985]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider effects of the harmonic magnetic field boundary conditions at the top of the dynamo domain on the dynamo stability inside the solar convection zone.

The effect depends on the companion mass, metallicity, the amount of mass it accreted, orbital parameters and other parameters. We simulate individual companion stars assuming they undergo such accretion events. We study the envelope properties of 20 $\rm M_\odot$ and 30 $\rm M_\odot$ single massive stars at different matallicities ($Z= 0.02$, $Z=0.008$ and $Z=0.004$) during accretion at different rates, from $\rm 10^{-5}$ to $\rm 10^{-2}~M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$. For the lower accretion rates we simulate, the stars remains hot, while at higher accretion rates, it becomes cooler and inflates. This behavior is observed in both stars but occurs at different accretion rates. Higher metallicity stars exhibit greater variations in accretion luminosity for the same accretion rate and stellar mass compared to lower metallicity stars.

Under this approximation, it is found that: (1) The Y-point radius decreases with the increase of twist of the magnetic field. (2) The polar cap is larger for larger twist. (3) The particle outflow luminosity is larger for larger twist. (4) The maximum acceleration potential, pulse width of magnetar radio emission etc all increase with the twist. (5) For an untwisting magnetosphere, the physical properties general evolves towards that of the normal pulsars. The above findings are consistent with previous analytical and numerical results. The larger polar cap may corresponds to the hot spot during magnetar outburst. In general, a rotating twisted magnetosphere has larger open field line regions. The radio emission of magnetars and fast radio burst may both originates in the larger and evolving open field line regions of magnetars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10037" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-GeV Fermi-LAT Detection of PSR B1259-63</a><span class="id">[2509.10037]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>PSR B1259-63 is a classical gamma-ray binary detected from radio to TeV energies near periastron. In the GeV band, it had previously been detected only up to a few GeV, with the extrapolation of the TeV spectrum overestimating the measured GeV flux. Using over 17 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we report the first detection of PSR B1259-63 in the 10 GeV to $\gtrsim 100$ GeV range, from -400 to +100 days relative to periastron. The Fermi-LAT spectrum is well described by a hard power law with index $\Gamma = 1.9 \pm 0.1$, and has a flux level consistent with that measured at TeV energies by H.E.S.S. The apparent transition from the hard Fermi-LAT spectrum to the softer TeV spectrum suggests that the detected GeV emission traces the rising tail of the inverse-Compton component extending into the TeV regime. We note that the detection of PSR B1259-63 as early as -400 days before periastron is difficult to reconcile with existing theoretical models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A massive primordial atmosphere on early Mars</a><span class="id">[2509.10060]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mars finished forming while the solar nebula was still present, and acquired its primordial atmosphere from this reservoir. The absence of a detectable cometary xenon signature in the present-day Martian atmosphere suggests that the capture of solar nebular gas was significant enough to dilute later cometary contributions. By quantifying the mass of cometary material efficiently retained on Mars, we place a lower bound on the mass of the primordial Martian atmosphere. To test the robustness of our conclusions, we use cometary bombardment data from two independent studies conducted within a solar system evolutionary model consistent with its current structure. Our calculations show that, even under the most conservative scenario, the minimal mass of the primordial martian atmospheres would yield a surface pressure of no less than 2.9 bar. Such a massive nebular envelope is consistent with recent models in which atmospheric capture is strongly enhanced by the presence of heavier species on Mars - due to outgassing or redox buffering with a magma ocean.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An intense geomagnetic storm originated from stealth Coronal Mass Ejection: remote and $in situ$ observations by near radially aligned spacecraft</a><span class="id">[2509.10090]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the solar origin and heliospheric evolution of an intense geomagnetic storm that occurred on March 23-24, 2023. Despite multiple candidate CMEs observed between March 19-21, a weak CME detected on March 19 at 18:00 UT was identified as the cause, originating from the eruption of a longitudinal-filament channel near center of the sun. The channel underwent a smooth transition to eruption phase without detectable low coronal signatures. Wide-angle heliospheric imaging revealed asymmetric expansion and acceleration by solar wind drag, achieving an average CME velocity of $\approx$640 km/s. The radial evolution of the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) was analyzed by three spacecraft in close radial alignment. Arrival times and propagation speeds were consistent across spacecraft, with a 21 hour delay between STEREO-A and WIND attributed to solar rotation and longitudinal separation. The ICME exhibits magnetic cloud (MC) signatures characterized by right-handed helicity, enhanced density at all three spacecraft. The MC underwent expansion (radial-size increases from 0.08AU at SolO to 0.18AU at STEREO-A), decrease in magnetic field strength with distance; $B_{av}\propto R_H^{-1.97}$ (SolO-STA) and $B_{av}\propto R_H^{-1.53}$ (SolO-WIND). The MC axis is inclined with the ecliptic at $-69^o$ at SolO, $-25^o$ at STA and $-34^o$ at WIND, indicating rotation during heliospheric transit. Importantly, the storm's main phase leads to a peak intensity ($SYM-H=-169$nT) occurring at 24/02:40UT followed by a second peak ($SYM-H=-170$nT) at 24/05:20UT due to density enhancement towards MC's tail. The study emphasizes the significant geoeffectiveness of weak, stealth CMEs with southward Bz and density enhancements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10115" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An ultraviolet burst oscillation candidate from the low-mass X-ray binary EXO 0748-676</a><span class="id">[2509.10115]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray burst oscillations are quasi-coherent periodic signals at frequencies close to the neutron star spin frequency. They are observed during thermonuclear Type I X-ray bursts from a number of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) hosting a fast-spinning, weakly magnetic neutron star. Besides measuring the spin frequencies, burst oscillations hold the potential to accurately measure neutron star mass and radius, thus providing constraints on the equation of state of matter at nuclear densities. Based on far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations of the X-ray binary EXO 0748-676 taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2003, we report a possible indication of ultraviolet burst oscillations at the neutron star spin frequency ($\sim$552 Hz), potentially the first such case for an LMXB. The candidate signal is observed during an $\sim$8 s interval in the rising phase of an FUV burst, which occurred $\sim$4 s after a Type I X-ray burst. Through simulations, we estimated that the probability of detecting the observed signal power from pure random noise is 3.7$\%$, decreasing to 0.3$\%$ if only the burst rise interval is considered, during which X-ray burst oscillations had already been observed in this source. The background-subtracted folded pulse profile of the candidate FUV oscillations in the (120-160 nm) band is nearly sinusoidal with a $\sim$16$\%$ pulsed fraction, corresponding to a pulsed luminosity of $\sim$8$\times$10$^{33}$ erg/s. Interpreting the properties of this candidate FUV burst oscillations in the light of current models for optical-ultraviolet emission from neutron star LMXBs faces severe problems. If signals of this kind are confirmed in future observations, they might point to an unknown coherent emission process as the origin of the FUV burst oscillations observed in EXO 0748-676.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A four-planet system orbiting the old thick disk star TOI-1203</a><span class="id">[2509.10136]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>TOI-1203 is a bright (V=8.6) G3 V star known to host a transiting warm sub-Neptune on a 25.5 d orbit.

We found that TOI-1203 has an enhancement of $\alpha$ elements relative to iron of [$\alpha$/Fe]=$0.21\pm0.04$. With an age of $\sim$12.5 Gyr, TOI-1203 belongs to the old, $\alpha$-element enhanced stellar population of the galactic thick disk. We spectroscopically confirmed the planetary nature of the 25.5 d sub-Neptune TOI-1203 d, measured its mass ($M_{d}=7.39\pm0.62~M_{\oplus}$) and refined its radius ($R_{d}=2.918_{-0.045}^{+0.046}~R_{\oplus}$). We discovered the presence of an additional transiting super-Earth on a 4.2 d orbit (TOI-1203 b) with a mass of $M_{b}=3.51_{-0.32}^{+0.33}~M_{\oplus}$ and a radius of $R_{b}=1.520_{-0.046}^{+0.045}~R_{\oplus}$.

We found that the outer planet TOI-1203 e lies on an eccentric orbit with $e_{e}=0.152\pm0.029$. We performed a stability analysis of the system confirming that there are configurations consistent with the observed parameters that are dynamically stable over billion-year timescales. While analyzing the HARPS time series, we discovered that the FWHM of the HARPS cross-correlation function shows a significant long-period signal ($\sim$615 d) that has no counterpart in the radial velocity data or in the remaining HARPS ancillary time series. We significantly detected the same signal in the FWHM of the Th-Ar calibration lines used to compute the nightly wavelength solution, and attributed this systematic effect to a long-term variation of the HARPS instrumental profile.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calculating Occultation Light Curves using Wavelets: Exponential Atmospheres and the Constraints of Static Stability</a><span class="id">[2509.10145]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The signatures of waves are seen during many high-quality ground-based refractive stellar occultations by solar system atmospheres.

Determining these properties is essential to interpret such signals, but current measurements are limited: rotation estimates rely on electromagnetic detections and assume uniform rotation, while inferring interior magnetic fields remains ambiguous due to a lack of direct observations. Measuring the excited fundamental modes of neutron stars in gravitational-wave signals offers a promising solution, as these modes encode information about stellar composition, structure, and dynamics. Previous studies have examined the individual effects of rotation and magnetic fields on these modes, identifying magnetic suppression and establishing linear relations for the frequencies of the fundamental $l=0$ quasi-radial mode $f_F$ and $l=2$ quadrupolar mode $f_{^2f}$. However, few have investigated the combined influence of rotation and magnetic fields. Here, for the first time, we consider both rotation and a toroidal magnetic field to construct linear relations for quantifying $f_F$ and $f_{^2f}$, showing that their combined effects can be constrained by detecting these modes. Using 2D axisymmetric simulations, we demonstrate that quasi-linear relations between $f_F$, $f_{^2f}$, stellar compactness $M/R$, and kinetic-to-binding energy ratio $T/|W|$ persist even with a toroidal magnetic field. The slope of these relations depends on the toroidal magnetization constant $K_\mathrm{m}$. Additionally, measuring the frequency ratio $f_{^2f}/f_F$ enables inference of $T/|W|$ and the maximum magnetic field strength $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{max}$. Lastly, we show that differential rotation causes only minor deviations from predictions for uniform rotation. Thus, this work demonstrates that rotational and magnetic properties of neutron stars can be inferred from their fundamental modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interaction between disk and extended corona in general relativistic framework.

A slab corona may not explain the hard state observations of X-ray binaries (XRBs). We incorporate energy feedback to the accretion disk resulting from illumination by an extended corona, and vice versa. The interaction between these two components allows for the possibility of finding an energetically self-consistent equilibrium solution for a given disk-corona system. We have upgraded the existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MONK, to incorporate the interaction between the disk and the extended corona within the general relativistic framework. We introduce an albedo parameter to specify the fraction of the incident flux that is reflected by the disk, while the remainder is absorbed and added to the intrinsic dissipation. Reflection is modeled assuming a semi-infinite electron atmosphere. We find global equilibrium solutions by iterating interaction between disk and extended slab corona. A higher black hole spin, higher coronal temperature, and higher albedo all lead to harder spectra. For typical coronal temperatures and disk albedo, the lowest achievable photon index with a static slab corona fully covering the disk is approximately 1.7-1.8. With the upgraded version of MONK, we are now able to achieve global energy equilibrium for a given disk-corona system. This approach holds significant potential for constraining the coronal geometry using not only the observed flux but also polarization. A static slab does not appear to be a favorable coronal geometry for the hard state of XRBs, even when global energy balance is taken into account. In future work, we will explore truncated disk geometries and outflowing coronae as potential alternatives.

HMXBs are expected to have experienced a supernova in their evolution. The impulsive kick associated with this event should affect the space velocity of the system in a way that depends on the nature and state of the progenitor binary. Here, we test whether the different evolutionary histories of HMXBs have left a detectable imprint on their peculiar velocities ($V_{\rm pec}$). Using data from Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3), we first calculate the $V_{\rm pec}$ values for 63 well-known HMXBs hosting a black hole or neutron star and estimate the associated uncertainties via Monte Carlo re-sampling. We then analyse their distribution and check for differences between classes. Overall, $V_{\rm pec}$ estimates extend up to 100 km s$^{-1}$, but with Be/X-ray binaries (BeXRBs) favouring $V_{\rm pec}$ $\lesssim 40$ km s$^{-1}$ and supergiant X-ray binaries (SgXRBs) favouring $V_{\rm pec}$ $\gtrsim 40$ km s$^{-1}$. Based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, the null hypothesis that the peculiar velocities of both classes are drawn from the same parent distribution can be robustly rejected, irrespective of the background stellar velocity dispersion. Tests with binary population synthesis demonstrate that SgXRBs typically have shorter orbital periods and higher fractional mass loss than BeXRBs at supernova. We argue that the magnitude of $V_{\rm pec}$ could be used as a complementary feature to distinguish between Be and supergiant systems. These findings extend previous inferences based on two-dimensional kinematics from Hipparcos, and may be explained by the differing nature of the respective progenitors systems between the source classes at the instant of supernova.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A MeerKAT view of the parsec-scale jets in the black-hole X-ray binary GRS 1758-258</a><span class="id">[2509.10275]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Jets from accreting black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRBs) are powerful outflows that release a large fraction of the accretion energy to the surrounding environment, providing a feedback mechanism that may alter the interstellar medium (ISM) properties. Studying accretion and feedback together enables estimates of matter and energy input/output around accreting BHs. We focus on the extended jet structures of the BH-XRB GRS1758-258. First seen in VLA data, these parsec-scale jets arise from jet-ISM interaction and show a Z-shaped morphology. Using the MeerKAT telescope we observed GRS1758-258 in L-band for a total exposure of 7 hr. Applying a calorimetry-based method developed for AGN and later used for XRBs, we estimated the properties of the jets and of the surrounding ISM. We detect a jet and counter-jet terminating in bow-shocks. Within the northern jet lobe we identify synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission, while the southern lobe is dominated by thermal emission. We measure ISM densities between 10-40 cm-3 across both jets, slightly lower in the northern region. The estimated ages of the two lobes range from 6-51 kyr. The time-averaged jet power lies between 4.4x10^33 and 3.3x10^36 erg/s, with differences between north and south likely due to different local ISM conditions. Comparing new MeerKAT with archival VLA data, we measured a proper motion of 130 mas/yr in a portion of the northern jet. Jet-ISM interaction structures on both sides of GRS1758-258 reveal different ISM properties. The comparison between these structures and those from other XRBs suggests that the lobes in GRS1758-258 are younger and may result from different jet activity phases. The time-averaged energy transferred to the environment is slightly lower than in other XRBs, consistent with the younger age of the lobes in GRS1758-258 relative to those of other systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The merger of spinning, accreting supermassive black hole binaries</a><span class="id">[2509.10319]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets.

The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The electron temperature distribution and the high ionization just behind the shock in the Cygnus Loop</a><span class="id">[2509.10346]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The physical processes behind astrophysical collisionless shocks, such as thermal relaxation and ionization after shock passage, remain poorly understood.

We investigate the effectiveness of spin-induced multipole moments (SIQM) and tidal deformability measurements in distinguishing lower mass-gap black hole (BH) binaries from non-BH binaries with different mass and spin configurations. We perform model-agnostic tests on binary BH (BBH) simulations using full Bayesian inference, evaluating the independent and joint measurability of SIQM and tidal parameters across the parameter space. We extend the analysis to simulations of self-interacting spinning boson stars, using synthetic signals that exhibit (a) both SIQM and tidal effects and (b) each effect individually. For case (a), recovery is performed using (i) a BBH model, (ii) a model incorporating both SIQM and tidal effects, and (iii) models including either SIQM or tidal effects. For case (b), we employ (i) a BBH model and (ii) models incorporating either SIQM or tidal effects, consistent with the injection. Simulations employ TaylorF2 waveform model and consider binaries in the low mass gap with varying spin magnitudes. We find that employing an incorrect model to analyze the signal can lead to biases in parameter inference. Notably, when analyzing a simulated binary boson star-like signal with component masses $\rm{(4, 4) \, M_{\odot}}$ using a BBH model, the system is incorrectly identified as having masses $\rm{(8, 2) \, M_{\odot}}$. In contrast, using the correct recovery model that includes both SIQM and tidal deformability effects successfully recovers the true masses, highlighting the significance of waveform model accuracy in performing reliable distinguishability tests for compact objects in the low-mass gap.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Hole Formation in a Scalar Field Dominated Universe: Investigation of the Critical nature of the Collapse</a><span class="id">[2509.10431]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we investigate the critical collapse leading to primordial black hole (PBH) formation in a universe dominated by a self-interacting scalar field with a quartic potential, comparing it to the well-known radiation-dominated case.

Our results confirm that both the scalar field and radiation cases exhibit type II critical behavior with similar – though not identical – critical exponents, differing by about $2\sigma$. This suggests that, while a quartic scalar field effectively mimics a radiation fluid even in the nonlinear collapse regime, small differences in the critical exponent persist.

Within this framework we derive a compact, general expression for the non-geodesicity (turning-rate) parameter evaluated at fixed points, valid for arbitrary couplings. This provides a transparent way of diagnosing non-geodesic dynamics, with direct applications to both dark energy and multifield inflation. We first consider exponential coupling functions to establish analytic control and facilitate comparison with previous literature. In this case, we uncover a pair of genuinely non-geodesic fixed points, which act as attractors within a submanifold of the full system. In contrast, when the axion shift symmetry remains unbroken, our analysis shows that the apparent non-geodesic fixed point reported previously does not persist once the full dynamics are taken into account.

We particularly focus on the scenario where PBH, with mass ranges between 1g and $10^9$g, evaporates before big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Addition to that, we consider the case where PBH abundance is scarce and there is no early PBH domination taking place. On the DM side, we assume a fraction of the population is produced from PBH evaporation, while the remaining part is the regular cold dark matters (CDMs) which is produced by some genesis processes that decouples later on. Therefore, in the rest of the cosmological history, DM interacts solely through gravity. Under this condition, there is no thermal equilibrium ever established between DM and SM plasma. An important feature in our analysis is that, for the light PBH we consider, its temperature is much larger than the mass of DM which is consequently produced ultra-relativistically and require a protracted time to become matter-like. In this context, even though PBH evaporates in the very early Universe, PBH-produced DM could still be energetic and smooth out the small scale structure at much later time. By the precision measurement on the matter power spectrum from cosmic surveys, we are able to set joint constraint on light PBHs and the non-cold DMs it produced.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extraction of neutron-capture cross sections on $^{92}$Zr using the charge-exchange Oslo method</a><span class="id">[2509.09776]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $^{93}$Nb($t$,$^{3}$He) reaction at 115 MeV/u was studied to demonstrate that nuclear level densities and $\gamma$-ray strength functions can be extracted from charge-exchange reactions at intermediate energies using the Oslo technique. The matrix of excitation energy in $^{93}$Zr, reconstructed from the ($t$,$^{3}$He) reaction, versus the energy of $\gamma$ rays emitted by the excited $^{93}$Zr nuclei, was obtained in an experiment with the S800 Spectrograph operated in coincidence with the GRETINA $\gamma$-ray detector. The extracted level density and $\gamma$-ray strength function obtained by applying the Oslo method to this matrix were used to estimate the $^{92}$Zr($n$,$\gamma$)$^{93}$Zr cross section by combining the new results with other experimental data and theoretical calculations for $E$1 and $M$1 strength functions at higher energies. Good agreement with direct measurements of the $^{92}$Zr($n$,$\gamma$)$^{93}$Zr cross section was found. The contribution from the upbend in the extracted $\gamma$-ray strength function was important to achieve the consistency as the neutron-capture cross section without this contribution is significantly below the direct measurements otherwise. Since charge-exchange reactions at intermediate energies have long been used for extracting Gamow-Teller strengths, the successful demonstration of the charge-exchange Oslo method enables experiments in which ($n$,$\gamma$) cross sections and Gamow-Teller strengths can be measured simultaneously, which is of benefit for astrophysical studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09892" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What do the fundamental constants of physics tell us about life?</a><span class="id">[2509.09892]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the 1970s, the renowned physicist Victor Weisskopf famously developed a research program to qualitatively explain properties of matter in terms of the fundamental constants of physics.

The numerical and analytic results are found to be in excellent agreement, confirming the robustness of both approaches. We then investigate the sensitivity of M^* to different parameter sets, highlighting its strong influence on nuclear saturation, compressibility, and the resulting equation of state (EoS). The analysis shows that variations in meson-nucleon couplings propagate directly into differences in pressure and energy density, affecting the stiffness of the EoS. While QHD-I produces characteristically stiff EoS, the effective mass evaluation provides a transparent framework for connecting microscopic meson dynamics to macroscopic neutron star properties.

We investigate whether distinctive gravitational-wave (GW) signatures can illuminate the nature of neutrino masses and their underlying symmetries, particularly in scenarios where Yukawa couplings are not unnaturally small. To this end, we consider the minimal $B-L$ gauge extension of the Standard Model, where quantum numbers of beyond-SM states determine the neutrino nature and the scale of spontaneous $B-L$ breaking governs mass generation. In this framework, we show that neutrinos yield characteristic GW spectra: Majorana neutrinos with high-scale breaking ($\sim 10^{14}$ GeV) produce local cosmic strings and a flat spectrum across broad frequencies, Dirac neutrinos with low-scale breaking ($\sim 10^{7}$ GeV) generate peaked spectra from first-order phase transitions, and pseudo-Dirac scenarios give kink-like features from domain wall annihilation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational wave signatures from the phase-transition-induced collapse of a magnetized neutron star</a><span class="id">[2305.15181]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strong magnetic fields make neutron stars potential sources of detectable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals. Hence, inferring these magnetic fields is critical to understand the emissions of neutron stars. However, due to the lack of direct observational evidence, the interior magnetic field configuration remains ambiguous. Here, for the first time, we show that the internal magnetic field strength along with the composition of a neutron star can be directly constrained by detecting the gravitational waves from the \emph{phase-transition-induced collapse} of a magnetized neutron star. By dynamically simulating this collapsing event, we first find that the dominant peaks in the gravitational waveform are the fundamental $l=0$ quasi-radial $F$ mode and the fundamental $l=2$ quadrupolar $^2f$ mode. We next show that the maximum gravitational wave amplitude $|h|_\mathrm{max}$ increases with the maximum magnetic field strength of the interior toroidal field $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{max}$ until the maximum rest-mass density at bounce $\rho_\mathrm{max,b}$ decreases due to the increasing $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{max}$. We then demonstrated that the magnetic suppression of fundamental modes found in our previous work remains valid for the hybrid stars formed after the phase-transition-induced collapses. We finally show that measuring the frequency ratio between the two fundamental modes $f_{^2f}/f_{F}$ allows one to infer $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{max}$ and the baryonic mass fraction of matter in the mixed phase $M_\mathrm{mp} / M_{0}$ of the resulting hybrid star. Consequently, taking $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{max}$ and $M_\mathrm{mp} / M_{0}$ as examples, this work has demonstrated that much information inside neutron stars could be extracted similarly through measuring the oscillation modes of the stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Removal of interloper contamination to line-intensity maps using correlations with ancillary tracers of the large-scale structure</a><span class="id">[2406.12979]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Line-intensity mapping (LIM) offers an approach to obtain three-dimensional maps of the large-scale structure by collecting the aggregate emission from all emitters along the line of sight. The procedure hinges on reconstructing the radial positions of sources by relating the observed frequency to the rest-frame frequency of a target emission line. However, this step is hindered by `interloper-line' emission from different cosmological volumes that redshifts into the same observed frequency. In this work, we propose a model-independent technique to remove the contamination of line interlopers using their statistical correlation with external tracers of the large-scale structure, and identify the weights that minimize the variance of the cleaned field. Furthermore, we derive expressions for the resulting power spectra after applying our cleaning procedure, and validate them against simulations. We find that the cleaning performance improves as the correlation between the line interlopers and the external tracer increases, resulting in a gain in the signal-to-noise ratio of up to a factor 6 (2) for the auto- (cross-)power spectrum in idealized scenarios. This approach has the advantage of being model-independent, and is highly complementary to other techniques, as it removes large-scale clustering modes instead of individually masking the brightest sources of contamination.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02131" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decoding Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars: From Static Structure to Rotational Deformation</a><span class="id">[2409.02131]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we investigate the impacts of dark matter (DM) on the properties of both static and rotating neutron stars utilizing a self-interacting DM model, motivated by the neutron decay anomaly.

By treating the DM interaction strength ($G$) as a free parameter, we explore its influence on NS properties, considering a broad range of equations of state (EoSs). Using the mass-radius constraints from NICER pulsar measurements, we constrain the DM interaction strength for each EoS via a likelihood analysis. Extending this model to rotating NSs, we analyze how centrifugal forces associated with increasing angular velocity ($\Omega$) enhance both mass and radius, causing deformation. We assess the impact of DM on rotational deformation by calculating the eccentricity, highlighting the interplay between DM and rotational forces. Since both DM and rotation simultaneously influence NS properties, we compute the relative changes in mass and radius across varying $G$ and $\Omega$ values to quantify their combined effects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization evidence for dark energy dynamics partially caused by the excess smoothing of Planck CMB anisotropy data?</a><span class="id">[2410.13627]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the performance of the spatially-flat dynamical dark energy (DE) $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, with redshift-dependent DE fluid equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$, with and without a varying CMB lensing consistency parameter $A_L$, against Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (P18 and lensing) and a combination of non-CMB data composed of baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements that do not include DESI BAO data, Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) data points. From our most restrictive data set, P18+lensing+non-CMB, for the $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ parameterization, we obtain $w_0=-0.879\pm 0.060$, $w_a=-0.39^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, the asymptotic limit $w(z\to\infty) = w_0+w_a=-1.27^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $A_L=1.078^{+0.036}_{-0.040}$ (all $1\sigma$ errors).

For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$ the evidence in favor of DE dynamics is larger, $\sim 2\sigma$, suggesting that at least part of the evidence for DE dynamics comes from the excess smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data.

We calculate the resultant dipole and quadrupole amplitudes for the arriving UHECRs detected by an observer in the Galactic plane region. We find that, regardless of the injection scenario considered, when the scattering length of the particles is comparable to the size of the halo, the UHECRs skymap resembles a dipole.

We consider the disk is primarily threaded by the toroidal component of the magnetic field and an effective potential satisfactorily mimicked the spacetime geometry around the rotating black hole. With this, we self-consistently solve the coupled governing equations for inflow and outflow and compute the mass outflow rate $R_{\dot m}$ (ratio of mass flux of inflow to outflow) in terms of the inflow parameters, namely energy ($\mathcal{E}$), angular momentum ($\lambda$), plasma-$\beta$ and conduction parameter ($\Upsilon_{\rm s}$) around weakly rotating ($a_{\rm k} \rightarrow 0$) as well as rapidly rotating ($a_{\rm k} =0.99$) black holes. Our findings reveal that the present formalism admits coupled inflow-outflow solutions across a wide range of inflow parameters yielding substantial mass loss. We observe that $R_{\dot m}$ monotonically increases with $\Upsilon_{\rm s}$, irrespective of black hole spin. We also find that for a fixed $\Upsilon_{\rm s}$, when energy, angular momentum, and magnetic field strength of the inflowing matter is increased, $R_{\dot{\rm m}}$ is enhanced resulting the outflows even more pronounced. We further estimate the maximum outflow rate ($R^{\rm max}_{\dot{\rm m}}$) by varying the inflow parameters and find that thermal conduction leads to maximum mass outflow rate $R^{\rm max}_{\dot{\rm m}} \sim 25\%$ for rapidly rotating black hole of spin $a_{\rm k} = 0.99$.

For a class of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), it is widely believed that their centre engines are just these stellar-mass BHs, which accrete the collapsing matter in hyper-accretion mode. In such systems, a popular scenario is that the magnetic field supported in the accretion disk extracts the rotational energy of the spinning BH and launches a jet on one hand, and the accretion of the infalling matter of the collapse will increase the BH's rotational energy on the other hand. Here we report that when the accretion process is dominated by a Magnetically-Arrested-Disk (MAD), the above-mentioned two competing processes link to each other, so that the spin evolution of the BH can be written in a simple form. Most interestingly, when the total accreted mass is enough, the BH spin will always reach an equilibrium value. This value does not depend on the initial mass and spin of the BH, as well as the history of accretion but is a function of the accretion physics near the event horizon. This model predicts that there is a population of stellar-mass BH that possess a universal spin at the end of the collapsing accretion. We test this prediction against the 4th gravitational wave (GW) catalogue (GWTC-4.0) and found that there is a dominating population with high significance, in which the distribution of the spin of the secondary BH is centred narrowly around a single value  0.017. The above-mentioned scenario is supported and the parameters of the accretion physics near the event horizon can be thus constrained. The result is also consistent with previous numerical simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03942" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variability of X-ray polarization of Cyg X-1</a><span class="id">[2505.03942]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the results of a three-year X-ray, optical, and radio polarimetric monitoring campaign of the prototypical black hole X-ray binary Cyg X-1, conducted from 2022 to 2024.

The X-ray polarization degree (PD) in the hard state was found to be $\approx4.0\%$, roughly twice as high as in the soft state, where it was around $2.2\%$. In both states, a statistically significant increase of PD with the energy was found. Moreover, a linear relation between PD and spectral hardness suggests a gradual and continuous evolution of the polarization properties, rather than an abrupt change of polarization production mechanism between states. The polarization angle (PA) was independent of the spectral state and showed no trend with the photon energy. The X-ray PA is well aligned with the orientation of the radio jet, as well as the optical and radio PAs. We find significant orbital changes of PA in the hard state, which we attribute to scattering of X-ray emission at intrabinary structure.

We explore the conditions necessary for lunar ejecta to evolve into Earth's co-orbital bodies, with particular attention to the formation of quasi-satellite orbits. We systematically investigate the parameter space of ejection velocity and geographic launch location across the entire lunar surface. The study employs numerical simulations of the four-body problem (Sun-Earth-Moon-particle) with automated classification methodology for identifying all co-orbital states. Particles are ejected from randomly distributed points covering the entire lunar surface with velocities ranging from 1.0 to 2.6 times the Moon's escape velocity. Trajectories co-orbital to Earth are found to be a common outcome, with approximately 6.15% of all simulated particles evolving into Earth co-orbital motion and 1.92% specifically exhibiting quasi-satellite behavior. We identify an optimal ejection velocity (1.2 times escape velocity) for quasi-satellite production, yielding over 6% conversion efficiency at this specific velocity. The spatial distribution of successful ejections shows a strong preference for the equatorial regions of the trailing hemisphere. Collisions with Earth or the Moon occur for only 4% of the sample.

In this work, we investigate the potential use of the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) power spectrum in controlling systematics, leveraging its capability of disentangling angular and radial scales. We first clarify how the discrete SFB basis describes radial scales via the index $n$ and demonstrate that the SFB power spectrum reduces to the clustering wedge $P(k,\mu)$ in the plane-parallel limit, enabling it to inherit results from past literature based on the clustering wedge. While the parallel and perpendicular Fourier mode $(k_{||}, k_\perp)$ decomposition underlying the wedge is only valid for surveys of small angular coverage with a well-defined global line-of-sight, the SFB basis provides a natural generalization that can be applied to the full sky. Crucially, the separation of angular and radial scales allows systematics to be localized in SFB space. In particular, systematics with broad and smooth radial distributions primarily concentrate in the $n=0$ modes corresponding to the largest radial scales. This localization behavior enables one to selectively remove only particular angular and radial modes contaminated by systematics. This is in contrast to standard 3D clustering analyses of wide-field surveys based on power spectrum multipoles, where systematic effects necessitate the removal of all modes below a given $k_{\rm min}$. Our findings advocate for adopting the SFB basis in 3D clustering analyses where systematics have become a limiting factor.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General-relativistic magnetar magnetospheres in 3D with physics-informed neural networks</a><span class="id">[2506.13519]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetar phenomena are likely intertwined with the location and structure of magnetospheric currents. General-relativistic effects are important in shaping the force-free equilibria describing static configurations, though most studies have quantified their impact only in cases of axial symmetry. Using a novel methodology based on physics-informed neural networks, fully three-dimensional configurations of varying stellar compactness are constructed. Realistic profiles for surface currents, qualitatively capturing the geometry of observed hotspots, are applied as boundary conditions to deduce the amount of free energy available to fuel outburst activity. It is found that the lowest-energy solution branches permit only a $\approx 30\%$ excess relative to current-starved solutions in axisymmetric cases with global twists, regardless of compactness, reducing to $\approx 5\%$ in 3D models with localised spots. Accounting for redshift reductions to their inferred dipole moments from timing data, explaining magnetar burst energetics therefore becomes more difficult unless the field hosts non-negligible multipoles.

Recent work has advanced a global, linear, modal approach for calculating the excited wake and the resulting feedback on the perturber's orbital evolution. In this work we perform a complementary suite of targeted hydrodynamic simulations to test this linear framework across a range of disc temperature and density profiles. In particular, we push from circular orbits to highly eccentric trajectories for which the perturber moves supersonically with respect to the background gas. We find remarkable agreement between our simulations and the linear methodology across a range of diagnostics – lending support to the predicted wake morphologies, complex radial torque density profiles, and torque reversal phenomena, which occur when the eccentricity exceeds the local aspect ratio. In contrast, comparison with previous fitting functions exposes noticeable discrepancies, cautioning against their indiscriminate use in studies which explore a wide range of perturber eccentricities, in varied disc structures. Our simulations also probe the fundamentally nonlinear effects of shock induced angular momentum deposition and coorbital horseshoe drags, which exhibit clear variations with eccentricity. Finally, this careful comparison between linear theory and numerics provides a detailed benchmark for planet-disc interaction problems and therefore we have provided a repository of our linear calculations for use as a rigorous test of future numerical investigations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23704" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The NEID Earth Twin Survey.

Here, we describe the status of the survey after three years on sky and we present the full set of RV measurements and accompanying stellar activity indicators. We discuss intermediate survey diagnostics, including calibration of the known RV zero point offset introduced following the Contreras fire in 2022 and the identification of an undiagnosed and previously unknown zero point offset in 2021. An analysis of our data set using RVSearch demonstrates that for these target stars, NEID is independently sensitive to nearly all known planets with periods shorter than the NETS observing baseline. We also highlight a number of newly detected RV signals, which present exciting opportunities for future investigations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A double-degenerate scenario with a merger to explosion delay time to explain type Ia supernova SN 2020aeuh</a><span class="id">[2507.16757]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I suggest the double-degenerate (DD) scenario with a merger-to-explosion delay (MED) time (the DD-MED scenario) of about 1-2 years to explain the rare properties of the recently analyzed type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2020aeuh. The rare properties are the SN Ia ejecta interacting with a carbon-oxygen (CO)-rich circumstellar material (CSM) at approximately 50 days post-explosion. In this DD-MED scenario, two massive CO white dwarfs (WDs), masses of M1=1.1Mo and M2=1Mo, merge to leave a rapidly rotating lonely WD of about the Chandrasekhar mass. The merger process ejects  0.7Mo to form a nonspherical CO-rich CSM. At the explosion, there is a lonely WD and a detached hydrogen- and helium-deficient CSM. Studies proposed the other lonely WD scenario, the core-degenerate (CD) scenario, to explain several specific SNe Ia and SN Ia remnants. SN 2020aeuh is the first particular SN Ia that is attributed to the DD-MED scenario. Besides being slightly brighter than typical SNe Ia and the CSM interaction, SN 2020aeuh is a normal SN Ia. Therefore, this study strengthens the claim of earlier studies, which are based on other arguments, like the properties of SN Ia remnants, that the lonely WD scenarios, i.e., the DD-MED and CD scenarios, might account for most, if not all, normal SNe Ia. These earlier studies also argue that all SN Ia scenarios, whether lonely WD or not, might contribute to peculiar SNe Ia.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine learning classification of black holes in the mass–spin diagram</a><span class="id">[2508.14316]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the mass–spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass–spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass–spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass–spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass–spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20393" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The frequency-independent radio luminosity – orbital/rotational period relation of RS CVn stars</a><span class="id">[2508.20393]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radio emissions from RS CVn objects exhibit distinct characteristics at low and high frequencies, widely attributed to differing radiation mechanisms. The disparate processes of high-frequency gyrosynchrotron and low-frequency electron cyclotron maser emissions have traditionally suggested an absence of correlation in their radio luminosities. Our study presents a frequency-independent linear correlation between radio luminosity ($L_R$) and orbital/rotational periods ($P$) in RS CVn binaries. Analyzing the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue (SRSC) data, we derived orbital periods for 42 of 60 RS CVn sources using TESS light curves, revealing a strong positive correlation (PCC = 0.698, $P$ = 3.95e-7) between $\log_{10}L_R$ and $\log_{10}P$. This correlation remains across frequencies from 144-3000 MHz, showing uniform luminosity behavior. By combining light curve analysis with stellar mass-radius-luminosity relationships, we calculated parameters like binary mass, primary/secondary mass, Rossby number, and binary separation for eight RS CVn systems. The results show a notable correlation between radio luminosity and binary mass, primary mass, and separation (PCC = 0.663, 0.663, 0.719), with separation showing the strongest correlation. This suggests the radio emission may largely originate from the binary components' interaction, challenging existing models of RS CVn radio emission mechanisms and offering insights into the individual versus collective origins of these emissions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Impact of Spectroscopic Redshift Errors on Cosmological Measurements</a><span class="id">[2508.21182]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spectroscopic redshift errors, including redshift uncertainty and catastrophic failures, can bias cosmological measurements from galaxy redshift surveys at sub-percent level. In this work, we investigate their impact on full-shape clustering analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift uncertainty introduces a scale-dependent damping effect on the power spectrum, which is absorbed by counterterms in clustering model, keeping parameter biases below $5\%$. Catastrophic failures suppress the power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor that scales with the catastrophic rate $f_c$. While this effect is negligible for DESI galaxy populations ($f_c=1\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift uncertainty with $f_c=5\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in cosmological constraints. In this case, we observe $6\%$ to $16\%$ shifts ($\sim2.2\sigma$ level) in estimating the fractional growth rate $df\equiv f/f^{\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\ln(10^{10} A_{s})$. Applying a correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum mitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new degeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value during fitting successfully restores the unbiased posterior without loss of constraint. Our results indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \textit{Euclid}, at minimum accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model are essential to get unbiased cosmological inference. Extending to evolving dark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, redshift errors do not bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but can degrade constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$ by up to $80\%$ in the worst case.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lepton collider as a window to reheating via freezing in dark matter detection.

This channel arises at tree-level from a shift-symmetry-breaking operator constructed at next-to-leading order in Chiral Perturbation Theory. In scenarios where model-dependent derivative couplings to nucleons are absent, this sets the strongest model-independent constraint on the axion mass, improving on existing bounds by two orders of magnitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17303" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inner crust of neutron stars: Polymorphism and superconductivity in the liquid drop model</a><span class="id">[2411.17303]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Within the liquid drop model built up with the nuclear interaction parametrization Sk$\chi$450, which is based on the chiral effective field theory, we calculate numerically the internal energy density for each of nuclear pasta phases and for the uniform nuclear matter. We provide quantitative arguments in favor of coexistence of various nuclear matter phases at a significant range of total pressure within the inner crust of neutron stars, a concept known as crystal polymorphism. Specifically, we find that differences of the internal energy per baryon for various phases are typically less than the thermal energy per a freedom degree at temperature about $10^8$–$10^9$ K, which sets the energetic scale for thermal fluctuations of state of Fermi liquid from the ground state. The nuclear energy contributions are described using the same parametrization Sk$\chi$450 for the bulk, plain surface and curvature terms. We find that the introduction of the curvature correction changes the ground state in a relevant way. This may be understood as a consequence of the corresponding change in size of the nucleus, which significantly modifies the phase transition densities. Using the calculated structural parameters from liquid drop model, we explore the physical consequences of the expected Cooper pairing of protons in lasagna phase. In this case, we find a crossover between the discreet layered and the three-dimensional anisotropic regimes of superconductivity. Additionally, we study the magnetic stress in lasagna accounting for a rotational lag between superfluid neutrons and the crystal lattice, which is believed to develop naturally in pulsars and magnetars. Our results offer a preliminary insight into rich magnetic properties of the inner crust of neutron stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulk Viscosity of Two-Flavor Color Superconducting Quark Matter in Neutron Star Mergers</a><span class="id">[2506.08144]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work investigates the bulk viscosity of warm, dense, neutrino-transparent, color-superconducting quark matter, where damping of density oscillations in the kHz frequency range arises from weak-interaction-driven direct Urca processes involving quarks. We study the two-flavor red-green paired color-superconducting (2SC) phase, while allowing for the presence of unpaired strange quarks and blue color light quarks of all flavors. Our calculations are based on the SU(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, extended to include both vector interactions and the `t Hooft determinant term. The primary focus is on how variations in the NJL Lagrangian parameters – specifically, the diquark and vector coupling strengths – affect both the static properties of quark matter, such as its equation of state and composition, and its dynamical behavior, including bulk viscosity and associated damping timescales. We find that the bulk viscosity and corresponding damping timescale can change by more than an order of magnitude upon varying the vector coupling by a factor of two at high densities and by a lesser degree at lower densities. This sensitivity primarily arises from the susceptibility of 2SC matter, with a smaller contribution from modifications to the weak interaction rates. In comparison, changes in the diquark coupling have a more limited impact. The damping of density oscillations in 2SC matter is similar quantitatively to nucleonic matter and can be a leading mechanism of dissipation in merging hybrid stars containing color superconducting cores. -</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09643" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultralight Boson Ionization from Comparable-Mass Binary Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2509.09643]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultralight bosons around comparable-mass binaries can form gravitationally bound states analogous to molecules once the binary separation decreases below the boson's Bohr radius, with the inner region co-moving with the binary. We simulate the formation of these gravitational molecules, determine their co-moving regions, and compute ionization fluxes induced by orbital motion for various binary eccentricities. We develop semi-analytic formalisms to describe the ionization dynamics of both the co-moving and non-co-moving regions, demonstrating consistency with numerical simulation results. From ionization fluxes, we estimate their backreaction on binary orbital evolution. At early stages, molecule ionization can dominate over gravitational wave emission, producing a spectral turnover in the gravitational wave background. Additionally, ionization of the co-moving component occurs solely due to binary eccentricity, causing orbital circularization.</p></div></details></article></body>
