We also developed a ballistic toy model of the gas ejected laterally from a jet to interpret the data. $Results.$ In agreement with previous observations, the ALMA data show that the slow outflow component is distributed in two opposed conical lobes and has a shear-flow pattern with velocity increasing toward the axis. The EHV gas consists of a series of arc-like condensations that span the full width of the conical lobes and merge with their walls, suggesting that the fast and slow outflow components are physically connected. In addition, position–velocity diagrams along the outflow axis show finger-like extensions that connect the EHV emission with the origin of the diagram, as if part of the EHV gas had been decelerated by its interaction with the low-velocity outflow. A ballistic model can reproduce these finger-like extensions assuming that the EHV gas consists of jet material that has been ejected laterally over a short period of time and has transferred part of its momentum to the surrounding shear flow. $Conclusions.$ The EHV gas in the IRAS 04166 outflow seems to play a role in the acceleration of the slower gas component. The presence of similar finger-like extensions in the position-velocity diagrams of other outflows suggests that this process may be occurring in other systems, even if the EHV component is not seen because it has an atomic composition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling the Milky Way wind: Supernova-driven outflows accelerate HI clouds near the Galactic center</a><span class="id">[2601.05314]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Multiwavelength observations, from radio to X-rays, have revealed the presence of multiphase high-velocity gas near the center of the Milky Way likely associated with powerful galactic outflows. This region offers a unique laboratory to study the physics of feedback and the nature of multiphase winds in detail. To this end, we have developed physically motivated semi-analytical models of a multiphase outflow consisting of a hot gas phase ($T \gg 10^6$ K) that embeds colder clouds ($T \sim 5000$ K). Our models include the gravitational potential of the Milky Way; the drag force exerted by the hot phase onto the cold clouds; and the exchange of mass, momentum, and energy between gas phases. Using Bayesian inference, we compared the predictions of our models with observations of a population of HI high-velocity clouds detected up to $\sim$1.5 kpc above the Galactic plane near the Galactic center. We find that a class of supernova-driven winds launched by star formation in the central molecular zone can successfully reproduce the observed velocities, spatial distribution, and masses of the clouds. In our two-phase models, the mass and energy loading factors of both phases are consistent with recent theoretical expectations. The cold clouds are accelerated by the hot wind via ram pressure drag and via accretion of high-velocity material, resulting from the turbulent mixing and subsequent cooling. However, this interaction also leads to gradual cloud disruption, with smaller clouds losing over 70\% of their initial mass by the time they reach $\sim$2 kpc.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revised AGN Spectral Model Reveals a More Significant Role in Cosmic Reionization</a><span class="id">[2601.05316]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reionization marks one of the most important phase transitions in the history of the Universe, during which neutral baryonic matter was transformed into ionized plasma. While star-forming galaxies are widely regarded as the primary drivers of this process, the extent to which active galactic nuclei (AGNs) contribute remains a subject of ongoing investigation. In this study, we integrate a physically motivated AGN spectral energy distribution (SED) model with state-of-the-art observations to reassess the contribution of AGNs to cosmic reionization. Our findings indicate that adopting a more sophisticated AGN SED model could substantially increase the predicted ionizing photon output by a factor of 3$\sim$4, elevating AGNs to a more significant role ($\approx$20\%) in maintaining reionization than previously estimated. The inclusion of abundant faint AGNs further amplifies this contribution by a factor of a few. These conclusions remain robust across a wide range of accretion rates and ionizing photon escape fractions. Collectively, our results suggest that AGNs may have played a more prominent and previously underestimated role in the reionization of the Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic wallflowers: the circumgalactic origins of isolated ultra-compact star clusters at $z&gt;7$</a><span class="id">[2601.05333]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of gravitationally lensed stellar clusters at high redshift with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed extremely compact, massive star-forming systems in galaxies at $z &gt; 6$, providing a new window into early cluster formation. In this work, we investigate star cluster formation in the circumgalactic environments of gas-rich galaxies with stellar masses spanning between $\sim$$10^{8}$ - $10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ at $z &gt; 7$, using the MassiveBlackPS cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with 2 pc resolution. We identify 55 baryon-dominated clusters forming outside galactic discs but within the virial radius of the primary halo. Star formation in these systems proceeds rapidly, reaching peak stellar surface densities above $10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$, closely matching the compact clusters recently discovered by JWST in the lensed Cosmic Gems Arc at $z \approx 9.6$. Such extreme densities are a key pre-requisite to trigger runaway stellar collisions, indicating that a subset of our clusters would be a likely host of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We find that massive star clusters can form efficiently in the circumgalactic medium at early times through filament fragmentation, whereby high gas densities lead to rapid local collapse via a combination of thermal and gravitational instabilities. This formation pathway implies that some compact clusters formed in the quiet outskirts of forming galaxies rather than within their discs. Small variations in filament properties, including metallicity, density, and dark-matter content, influence the likelihood of a star cluster being able to form an IMBH seed. The formation of clusters in circumgalactic environments points to a potential evolutionary pathway connecting early off-disc clusters, present-day globular clusters, and the seeds of massive BHs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Featureless stars: Flux Calibration for Extremely Large Telescopes</a><span class="id">[2601.05343]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The spectrophotometric flux calibration of recent spectroscopic surveys has reached a limiting systematic precision of approximately 1-3 percent, and is often biased near the wavelengths associated with H I Balmer absorption. As we prepare for the next generation of imaging and spectroscopic surveys, and high-precision cosmology experiments, we must find a way to address this systematic. Towards this goal, we have identified a global network of 29 bright (G &lt; 17.5) featureless white dwarf stars that have a spectral energy distribution consistent with an almost pure blackbody form over the entire optical and near-infrared wavelength range. Based on this sample, we have computed the systematic uncertainty and AB magnitude offsets associated with Gaia, SDSS, SMSS, PanSTARRS, DES, and 2MASS, and we have also checked the consistency of our objects with both GALEX and WISE. The magnitude range of the featureless stars reported here are ideally suited to observations taken with the forthcoming generation of extremely large telescopes, as well as calibrating the survey data acquired by the Rubin, Euclid and Roman observatories. Finally, all of the high-precision spectrophotometric standard stars reported here have been included in the latest release of the PypeIt data reduction pipeline.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Column Density Probability Density Function of Cygnus-X</a><span class="id">[2601.05359]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The density distribution within molecular clouds offers critical insights into their underlying physical processes, which are essential for understanding star formation. As a statistical measure of column density on the cloud scale, the shape and evolution of the column density probability density function (N-PDF) serve as important tools for understanding the dynamics between turbulence and gravity. Here we investigate the N-PDFs of Cygnus-X using the column density map obtained from Herschel, supplemented by HI and Young Stellar Objects (YSO) data. We find that the N-PDFs of Cygnus-X and four sub-regions display log-normal + power-law shapes, indicating the combined effects of turbulence and gravity in sculpting the density structure. We find evidence that the power-law segment of the N-PDFs flattens over time, and the transitional column density can be seen as a unique and stable star formation threshold specific to each molecular cloud. These results not only clarify the physical state of Cygnus-X but also emphasize the utility of the N-PDF as a statistical diagnostic tool, as it is an accessible indicator of evolutionary stages and star formation thresholds in molecular clouds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotational Kinematics in the Globular Cluster System of M31: Insights from Bayesian Inference</a><span class="id">[2601.05380]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As ancient stellar systems, globular clusters (GCs) offer valuable insights into the dynamical histories of large galaxies. Previous studies of GC populations in the inner and outer regions of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) have revealed intriguing subpopulations with distinct kinematic properties. Here, we build upon earlier studies by employing Bayesian modelling to investigate the kinematics of the combined inner and outer GC populations of M31. Given the heterogeneous nature of the data, we examine subpopulations defined by GCs' metallicity and by associations with substructure, in order to characterise possible relationships between the inner and outer GC populations. We find that lower-metallicity GCs and those linked to substructures exhibit a common, more rapid rotation, whose alignment is distinct from that of higher-metallicity and non-substructure GCs. Furthermore, the higher-metallicity GCs rotate in alignment with Andromeda's stellar disk. These pronounced kinematic differences reinforce the idea that different subgroups of GCs were accreted to M31 at distinct epochs, shedding light on the complex assembly history of the galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Nucleated Atomistic Grain Growth Simulator (NAGGS): application to the size-dependent structural and physical properties of nanosilicate dust</a><span class="id">[2601.05430]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the Nucleated Atomistic Grain Growth Simulator (NAGGS) as a new tool to model the growth of realistic nanosized dust grains through the progressive accretion of monomers onto a nucleated seed. NAGGS can be used with open source molecular dynamics codes, allowing for the modelling of grains that have different chemical compositions and are grown under a range of astrophysical conditions. To demonstrate how NAGGS works, we use it to produce 40 nanosilicate grain models with diameters of approx. 3.5 nm and consisting of approx. 1500 atoms. We consider Mg-rich olivinic and pyroxenic grains, and growth under two circumstellar dust-producing conditions. We calculate properties from the atomistically detailed nanograin structures (e.g. morphology, surface area, density, dipole moments) with respect to the size, chemical composition, and growth temperature of the grains. Our simulations reveal detailed new insights into the complex interacting degrees of freedom during grain growth and how they affect the resultant physicochemical properties. For example, we find that surface roughness depends on the Mg:Si ratio during this http URL also find that nanosilicates have very high dipole moments, which depend on the growth temperature. Such findings could have important consequences (e.g. astrochemistry, microwave emission). In summary, our bottom-up physically motivated approach offers a detailed understanding of nanograins that could help in both interpreting observations and improving dust models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05496" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I can see your halo: Constraining the Milky Way halo DM with FRB population studies</a><span class="id">[2601.05496]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) probe the electron column density along the line of sight and hence can be used to probe foreground structures. One such structure is the Galactic halo. In this work, we use a total of 98 high Galactic latitude ($|b| &gt; 20^\circ$) FRBs detected by ASKAP, Parkes, DSA and FAST with 32 associated redshifts to constrain the dispersion measure (DM) contribution from the Galactic halo. We simultaneously fit unknown FRB population parameters, which show correlations with the Galactic halo but are not completely degenerate. We primarily use an isotropic model for the halo, but find no evidence favouring a particular halo model. We find DM$_{\rm MW,halo}$=$68^{+27}_{-24}$pc/cm$^3$, which is in agreement with other results within the literature. Previous constraints on DM$_{\rm MW,halo}$ with FRBs have used a few, low-DM FRBs. However, this is highly subject to fluctuations between different lines of sight, and hence using a larger number of sightlines as we do is more likely to be representative of the true average contribution. Nevertheless, we show that individual FRBs can still skew the data significantly and hence will be important in the future for more precise results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backlighting young stellar objects in the Central Molecular Zone: an ensemble-averaged abundance structure of methanol ices</a><span class="id">[2601.05507]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) contains a substantial reservoir of dense molecular gas, where numerous young stellar objects (YSOs) and dense cloud cores have been identified. However, the large distance and severe foreground extinction complicate interpretation of infrared ice absorption features tracing chemical and evolutionary properties of these embedded objects. To better characterise YSOs and dense cores in this region, we combined spectra from multiple YSOs, each likely backlit by a giant star, allowing us to probe their outer layers and derive an ensemble-averaged ice abundance profile. We obtained L-band spectra of 15 point-like sources with extremely red colours using Gemini/GNIRS, enabling measurements of the CH3OH absorption feature at 3.535 micron. To better constrain the foreground extinction and H$_2$O ice column densities, we combined these data with K-band and mid-infrared spectra using NASA/IRTF and Spitzer/IRS. We found that the CH$_3$OH abundance in the CH$_3$OH-CO$_2$ ice mixture is 2 to 5 percent, confirming that it is systematically lower than those typically observed in the Galactic disk. Furthermore, by using the local excess of foreground extinction as a proxy for the projected distance between a backlit source and the centre of a YSO, we found that the CH$_3$OH abundance relative to solid CO$_2$ remains near 10 percent in the inner regions of the envelope, but increases sharply to about 30 percent in the outer regions. The relatively low methanol ice abundance may reflect the unique chemical environment of the CMZ. However, our results offer an alternative interpretation: since our sample is biased towards massive and luminous YSOs, intense heating from the central protostar may have caused substantial sublimation of methanol ice in the inner regions of their envelopes, thereby systematically lowering the observed CH$_3$OH/H$_2$O ice ratios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05710" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of newly measured 26Al(n, p)26Mg and 26Al(n, α)23Na reaction rates on the nucleosynthesis of 26Al in stars</a><span class="id">[2601.05710]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmic production of the short-lived radioactive nuclide 26Al is crucial for our understanding of the evolution of stars and galaxies. However, simulations of the stellar sites producing 26Al are still weakened by significant nuclear uncertainties. We re-evaluate the 26Al(n, p)26Mg, and 26Al(n, {\alpha})23Na ground state reactivities from 0.01 GK to 10 GK, based on the recent n TOF measurement combined with theoretical predictions and a previous measurement at higher energies, and test their impact on stellar nucleosynthesis. We computed the nucleosynthesis of low- and high-mass stars using the Monash nucleosynthesis code, the NuGrid mppnp code, and the FUNS stellar evolutionary code. Our low-mass stellar models cover the 2-3 Msun mass range with metallicities between Z = 0.01 and 0.02, their predicted 26Al/27Al ratios are compared to 62 meteoritic SiC grains. For high-mass stars, we test our reactivities on two 15 Msun models with Z = 0.006 and 0.02. The new reactivities allow low-mass AGB stars to reproduce the full range of 26Al/27Al ratios measured in SiC grains. The final 26Al abundance in high-mass stars, at the point of highest production, varies by a factor of 2.4 when adopting the upper, or lower limit of our rates. However, stellar uncertainties still play an important role in both mass regimes. The new reactivities visibly impact both low- and high-mass stars nucleosynthesis and allow a general improvement in the comparison between stardust SiC grains and low-mass star models. Concerning explosive nucleosynthesis, an improvement of the current uncertainties between T9 0.3 and 2.5 is needed for future studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05736" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milliarcsecond-resolution Radio-imaging Survey of Blazar Candidates at 4 &lt; z &lt; 5.4</a><span class="id">[2601.05736]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a milliarcsecond-resolution radio survey of 17 high-redshift (4 &lt; z &lt; 5.4) blazar candidates observed with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Network at 5 GHz. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the nature of these distant active galactic nuclei (AGN) and to confirm their blazar nature. Utilizing the technique of VLBI, we obtained high-resolution radio images of compact core and core-jet structures. To confirm the classification of these sources, we collected multi-band archival data, including total radio flux densities from single-dish and low-resolution interferometric surveys, optical astrometric positions from Gaia, and X-ray data. These diagnostics collectively help distinguish between blazars and misaligned jetted AGN. We were able to measure the core brightness temperatures and found that 11 objects show the Doppler-boosted emission expected from blazars. For five additional sources, we do not see evidence of Doppler boosting even if X-ray data suggest that the source is a blazar. These could be either borderline objects or variability may have affected the classifications, considering that VLBI and X-ray data are not simultaneous. Finally, for the two remaining objects the data suggest a non-blazar classification. Our findings confirm that a significant fraction of these high-redshift radio-loud quasars are blazars and mainly characterized by compact core structures. Overall, the VLBI classifcations are consistent with the X-ray classes. This study further increases the sample of VLBI-imaged radio quasars at z &gt; 4 by  10%, offering valuable on the population of AGN in the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Methanol Formation via the Radical-radical Reaction of OH and CH3 Radicals Undergoing Transient Diffusion on Ice at 10 to 60 K</a><span class="id">[2601.05757]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Methanol (CH3OH) is thought to form on interstellar ice dust via successive hydrogenation reactions. The reaction between CH3 and OH radicals could also conceivably generate methanol at temperatures above approximately 20 K, at which temperature hydrogen atoms will not adhere to the ice surface. However, this process has not been verified by well-controlled experiments. Using a newly-developed Cs+ ion pickup technique, the authors investigated the reaction between CH3 and OH radicals on the surface of amorphous solid water, an ice dust analogue, at temperatures from 10 to 60 K. In the present experiments, OH radicals were generated by UV photolysis of water molecules, following which methane (CH4) gas was deposited on the ice substrate. The results show that CH3OH was formed on the ice surface through the sequential reactions CH4 + OH -&gt; CH3 + H2O and CH3 + OH -&gt; CH3OH even at 10 K. Considering the very low surface coverage of reactants in the experimental condition, the second reaction was found to occur as a result of transient diffusion of CH3 due to the heat of the first reaction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fading into darkness: A weak mass ejection and low-efficiency fallback accompanying black hole formation in M31-2014-DS1</a><span class="id">[2601.05774]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can form from the near-complete collapse of massive stars, causing them to abruptly disappear. The star M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda galaxy was reported to exhibit such a disappearance between 2014 and 2022, with properties consistent with the failed explosion of a $\approx 12 - 13$ M$_\odot$ yellow supergiant leading to the formation of a $\approx 5$ M$_\odot$ BH. We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the remnant obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2024. The JWST MIRI/NIRSpec data reveal an extremely red source, showing strong blueshifted absorption from molecular gas (CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, SO$_2$) and deep silicate dust features. Modeling the dust continuum confirms continued bolometric fading of the central source to $\log(L/L_\odot)\approx3.88$ ($\approx7-8$% of the progenitor luminosity), surrounded by a dust shell spanning $\approx40-200$ au. Modeling of the molecular gas indicates $\sim 0.1$ M$_\odot$ of gas expanding at $\approx 100$ km s$^{-1}$ near the inner edge of the dust shell. No X-ray source is detected down to a luminosity limit of $L_X\lesssim1.5\times10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We show that the panchromatic observations are explained by (i) a low-energy ($\approx10^{46}$ erg) ejection of the outer H-rich progenitor envelope and (ii) a fading central BH powered by inefficient ($\sim0.1$% in mass) accretion of loosely bound fallback material. The analysis robustly establishes the bolometric fading of M31-2014-DS1 and provides the first cohesive insights into BH formation via low-energy explosions and long-term fallback.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the morphology of the Gum Nebula through pulsar observables and a novel distance estimation method</a><span class="id">[2601.05791]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Various existing models of the Gum Nebula differ significantly in their parameters and suggested origins, which can be independently tested for consistency with data on some key observables of pulsars in the direction of the nebula. Our analysis of such data on the Vela pulsar, assuming a dominant scattering region in its foreground, suggests that the fractional distance of the scatterer is $0.89 \pm 0.01$, and for the given distance of the Vela pulsar, it translates to $254 \pm 16$ pc. Using independent distances of ten pulsars, we suggest a refined description of the Gum Nebula electron density model with its basic morphology similar to that used in the YMW16 model, which now provides better estimates of pulsar distances in these directions. In our new Gum Nebula model, as expected, the Vela pulsar would be behind the frontal edge of the Gum shell, which was intriguingly located in front of the nebula in the YMW16 model. We also present a new technique to better constrain the pulsar distances using their dispersion measure and temporal broadening simultaneously, and find that it is less affected by the uncertainties in the Galactic electron density distribution models. Notably, the new approach shows that the expected temporal broadening as a function of trial distance does not follow a monotonic increasing trend, but instead exhibits oscillations at regions of enhanced electron density. This behaviour is expected, as the method employs the integral form of temporal broadening with the appropriate weighting kernel, leading to more reliable estimates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Minimalist Merger Interpretation of XRISM's Gas Velocity Measurements in the Coma Cluster</a><span class="id">[2601.05803]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recent microcalorimetric X-ray observations of the Coma cluster by XRISM have sparked active discussion regarding the physical origin of its gas velocity features.

Here we examine the accretion disk in the super-Eddington AGN I Zw 1 using reverberation mapping of the optical continuum. We use three years of optical monitoring with Las Cumbres Observatory at sub-day cadence in $uBgVriz_s$. The lag-wavelength spectrum, calculated using the cross correlation method and PyROA, shows a $u$-band excess. PyROA lags are equally well fitted with a thin and slim disk profile. The UV/optical AGN spectral energy distribution is consistent with a thin disk. The disk size at 4495 Å for a thin disk model is $4.23\pm0.24\:\mathrm{ld}$ and for a slim disk model is $1.71\pm0.09\:\mathrm{ld}$, larger by a factor of $2-4$ than the fiducial disk size of $1.07\pm0.15\:\mathrm{ld}$ as determined using the Eddington ratio. We find evidence of different size scales probed with different variability timescales. Lags evaluated at longer variability timescales increase as do frequency-resolved lags at low frequencies, which we interpret as an additional secondary reprocessor at large radii consistent with the broad-line region (BLR) in I Zw 1. The high frequency lags, predicted well with just a disk, are fit with a thin disk profile and a size of $0.61\pm0.37\:\mathrm{ld}$. This indicates that the actual disk size may be on the order of the fiducial size. We also collate the most extensive set of directly measured internal sizes of an AGN, from optical to mid-infrared with reverberation mapping and optical interferometry. Assuming that the disk is indeed the fiducial size, these show little evidence that the accretion disk extends into the BLR significantly, tentatively disfavouring the failed radiatively accelerated dust driven outflow BLR formation model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05849" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extragalactic archaeology through high-resolution integrated-light spectroscopy of globular clusters</a><span class="id">[2601.05849]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose to radically expand the use of extragalactic globular clusters as tools for extragalactic archaeology.

We utilize two state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations NewHorizon and NewCluster, post-processed with the radiative transfer code Skirt, to investigate the systematic uncertainties and biases in the inferred SFRs for z=5 galaxies; an epoch where galaxies build-up their stellar mass. We create synthetic observables for widely-used tracers: Halpha nebular line, [CII] 158 micron fine-structure line, total infrared (IR) continuum luminosity, and hybrid (IR + UV). We find that Halpha-inferred SFRs, time-averaged over 10 Myr, are sensitive to the choice of calibration and exhibit substantial scatter driven by dust attenuation, viewing angle, and dust-to-metal ratio. Adopting a steeper attenuation curve reduces this scatter significantly but does not fully eliminate systematic uncertainties. IR continuum-based SFRs trace intrinsic SFRs time-averaged over 100 Myr timescales when a well-sampled continuum emission between restframe 8 and 1000 micron is available and underestimate them with typical approaches when IR data are limited. Nevertheless, IR SFRs display a considerable scatter, largely due to UV photon leakage and strong variations in the star formation history. When UV data are available, hybrid (IR + UV) SFRs provide a more robust estimate, reducing scatter compared to IR-based SFRs while avoiding explicit attenuation corrections. Finally, we derive a [CII]-SFR relation finding a steeper relation than previous studies, however with significant scatter linked to gas density and metallicity. Overall, IR-, hybrid-, and [CII]-based tracers remain more robust than Halpha against variations in optical depth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the orbital evolution of binaries with polar circumbinary disks</a><span class="id">[2601.05932]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binaries occur in many astrophysical systems, from young protostellar binaries in star forming regions to supermassive black hole binaries in galaxy centers. In many cases, a circumbinary disk of gas forms around the binary with an orbit that may be misaligned to the binary plane. Misaligned disks around nearly circular binaries evolve into disks that are either aligned or counteraligned with the binary orbit. However, if the binary is sufficiently eccentric, then it can be more likely that the disk ends up in a polar-aligned configuration in which the disk angular momentum vector aligns with the binary eccentricity vector. We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations, evolved to an approximate steady state under mass injection, to determine the orbital evolution of a binary with a polar-aligned disk for a range of binary-disk parameters. We find that, in all of the cases we have simulated, the binary shrinks with time. The decay rate is larger than for binaries surrounded by aligned or retrograde disks with matched disk parameters. The rate of shrinkage is largely unaltered by the size of the sink radii employed for the binary stars, but for small enough sink radii some of the models exhibit long-lived polar circumprimary disks, which are continually fed mass from the circumbinary disk. We discuss our results in the contexts of planet formation in young polar-aligned disks and merging supermassive black holes in galaxy centers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra Diffuse Galaxies in clusters : the peculiar gas loss of VCC 1964</a><span class="id">[2601.05948]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context : Ultra Diffuse Galaxies are low surface brightness systems which have been detected in HI in the field, where their line widths sometimes indicate significant dark matter deficits. They are rarely detected in HI in clusters, making their dynamical properties difficult to assess. The relation between field and cluster populations is unclear. Aims : Detecting UDGs entering a cluster could give important clues to their evolution, both in terms of their dynamics but also as to whether they are structurally similar - i.e. if cluster UDGs are generally the same as field UDGs except with less gas and an older stellar population. Methods : We use data from two deep Arecibo surveys, the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey and the Widefield Arecibo Virgo Environment Survey, to measure the gas content of the UDG-candidate VCC 1964. Optical properties are quantified from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and DESI Legacy Surveys. Results : We find a significant 9 kpc offset between the HI and optical components of VCC 1964, no evidence of asymmetry in the HI, and only a modest deficiency level. This suggests a wholesale displacement of the gas content. The line width is 4-5 sigma deviant from the baryonic and over 6 sigma deviant from the optical forms of the Tully-Fisher relation. The optical component is blue and smooth. Conclusions : VCC 1964 is consistent with a UDG experiencing gas displacement due to ram pressure as it enters the cluster for the first time. Intriguingly, its dynamics imply a significant dark matter deficit, however we cannot rule out that this may be due to the gas being displaced out of equilibrium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05992" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Improved UV-Optical Diagnostic for Rejuvenating Galaxies in the Local Universe and Implications for Galaxy Evolution</a><span class="id">[2601.05992]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rejuvenating galaxies are important probes of galaxy evolution, yet identifying them observationally is challenging as constraining recent star formation histories requires both photometric and spectroscopic data. We present a method for identifying rejuvenating galaxies in the local Universe using ultraviolet (UV) imaging and optical spectroscopy, building on a recent selection that identifies a system as rejuvenating if it is quenched in the near-UV (NUV; tracing $\sim\!100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ timescales) but star-forming in H$\alpha$ (tracing $\sim\!10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ timescales). Shortly after a star formation episode, however, the NUV is dominated by the same massive stars that power H$\alpha$, so these indicators do not always trace distinct timescales. To address this, we derive a relation that predicts the NUV emission associated with the ionizing O-star population traced by H$\alpha$, enabling us to isolate the NUV contribution from longer-lived stars (primarily B/A stars with $M\lesssim\!20\,M_\odot$). Subtracting the predicted O-star NUV from the dust-corrected NUV yields a more reliable rejuvenation diagnostic. Using this method, we identify $\sim\!10^{4}$ rejuvenating galaxies in a sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies ($\sim\!4.5\%$). These galaxies have intermediate stellar masses and are found primarily in lower-density environments, becoming increasingly rare toward the centers of groups and clusters. Rejuvenating galaxies also exhibit systematically lower gas-phase metallicities, consistent with fueling by the accretion of metal-poor gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulations of collision and sloshing in the galaxy group NGC 5098/5096</a><span class="id">[2601.06011]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The study of galaxy groups is essential to understanding the evolutionary history of large-scale structures in the Universe.

We performed hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations of a galaxy group collision aimed at reproducing the gas sloshing and surface brightness distribution observed in X-ray data. We conducted a detailed X-ray analysis and generated mock image \textit{Chandra} observations from our simulations. The resulting corrected mock image surface brightness profiles show good agreement with the observed data. The relative line-of-sight velocity between NGC 5098 and NGC 5096 is $v_{\mathrm{los}} = 700$ km s$^{-1}$, with a projected separation of $d_{\mathrm{proj}} = 155$ kpc, suggesting that the collision occurs nearly in the line-of-sight. Our simulations were performed with an inclination angle of $80^\circ$ in order to reproduce the dynamical constraints. We also find a correlation between the dark matter and intragroup light distributions when comparing the residual dark matter map with the intragroup light morphology. Our best-fitting model is consistent with these observational constraints and provides a plausible dynamical scenario for the current state of the NGC 5098 group interaction with NGC 5096.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VENUS: Two Faint Little Red Dots Separated by $\sim70\,\mathrm{pc}$ Hidden in a Single Lensed Galaxy at $z\sim7$</a><span class="id">[2601.06015]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the identification of a pair of faint little red dots (LRDs), dubbed Red Eyes, in a strongly-lensed galaxy at $z\sim7$ behind the PLCKG004.5-10.5 cluster, identified from the JWST Treasury program VENUS. Red Eyes are spatially resolved on the image plane with distinct colors, while the critical curve lies far north of Red Eyes, clearly requiring two different LRDs rather than a single LRD. Red Eyes is an extremely close pair of LRDs separated by $\sim70\,\mathrm{pc}$ in the source plane with a magnification of $\mu\sim20$, which consistently explains another counter-image detected to the north-west. Red Eyes is hosted in a typical star-forming galaxy with $M_{\mathrm{UV,int}}\sim -19$, but its own UV emission is very faint ($M_{\mathrm{UV,int}} \gtrsim -16$). Moreover, Red Eyes does not reside at the galaxy center but lies at an offset position of approximately one effective radius $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ away from the galaxy center. If observed without lensing, Red Eyes would appear as a typical star-forming galaxy at $z\sim 7$ with $M_{\mathrm{UV}}\sim -19$, showing no apparent LRD signatures in either morphology or SED. These results suggest that multiple off-center LRDs, similar to Red Eyes, may be commonly hidden in a typical high-$z$ star-forming galaxy. In this case, various plausible scenarios may emerge, one of which is that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with $M_\mathrm{BH}\sim10^{4\text{--}6}\,M_\odot$ may form in star clusters on a stellar disk and contribute to the growth of the central supermassive black hole via mergers, with some IMBHs detectable as luminous LRDs in a sufficiently active and massive phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Information-theoretic astrophysical uncertainties in the effective theory of dark matter direct detection</a><span class="id">[2601.05332]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The impact of astrophysical uncertainties in direct detection searches can vary significantly across particle dark matter models and detector targets, due to the different velocity and momentum dependencies of the scattering cross section. We address these uncertainties for all operators of the non-relativistic effective field theory of dark matter-nucleon interactions, making use of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information divergence to measure the deviation of the true dark matter velocity distribution from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form. This approach quantifies how astrophysical uncertainties affect each operator in the effective theory, without assuming any specific functional form for the velocity distribution. While for some operators the uncertainties are smaller than one order of magnitude for entropically-motivated deviations from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form, for other operators these uncertainties can be as large as three orders of magnitude near threshold. Furthermore, we identify the dependence of the scattering rate for various operators of the effective theory with different velocity-weighted moments of the velocity distribution, functionally analogous to the mean, variance, or skewness. This provides new analytic insight into which features of the velocity distribution are most relevant to detect a given particle dark matter model. Our technique is general and could be applied to a broader class of physics problems where a physical observable depends on the statistical moments of an uncertain theoretical distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05689" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross Correlation between the Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect and Projected Galaxy Density Field</a><span class="id">[2206.05689]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a joint analysis of the power spectra of the Planck Compton $y$-parameter map and the projected galaxy density field using the Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) all-sky survey.

One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test the shock-cooling emission model from star-disk collisions by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_\star$. We find that, except for two sources (eRo-QPE3 and eRo-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_\star$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_\star$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the two exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\ R_{\rm{\odot}}$ is necessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest version of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\rm{p}} \sim 10\ \rm{eV}$, one order of magnitude lower than the observed value.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESI Data Release 1: Stellar Catalogue</a><span class="id">[2505.14787]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper we present the stellar Value-Added Catalogue (VAC) based on the DESI Data Release 1.

The main contribution to the catalogue comes from the bright program of the main survey, which includes $\sim $2.5 million stars, and the backup program, which includes $\sim $ 1 million stars. The combined magnitude range for the stars in the catalogue extends from ${\it Gaia}$ G $\sim 12$ to G $\sim 21$. For the magnitude range $17.5&lt;G&lt;21$ this catalogue represents a factor of 10 increase in the number of stars with radial velocity and abundance measurements compared to existing surveys. Despite DESI's resolution (R $\sim 2500-5000$), the median radial velocity uncertainty for stars in the catalogue is better than 1 km s$^{-1}$. The stellar parameters and abundances of stars in DESI are measured by two independent pipelines, and after applying a temperature-dependent calibration, [Fe/H] abundances of high signal-to-noise stars are accurate to better than $\sim$ 0.1 dex when compared to high-resolution surveys. The catalogue probes different Galactic components including a particularly large number of distant stars: tens of thousands of stars further than 10 kpc, and thousands further than 50 kpc. The catalogue also contains several thousand extremely metal-poor stars with ${\rm [Fe/H]}&lt;-3$. The released sample of stars includes measurements for thousands of stars that are members of dwarf galaxies, open and globular clusters as well as members of several dozen stellar streams.

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has begun to provide vital insights on their gas and dust content, but so far only for extreme 'blue monsters'. Here we present new, deep ALMA observations of JADES-GS-z11-0, a more typical (sub-$L^*$) $z &gt; 11$ galaxy that bridges the discovery space of JWST and the Hubble Space Telescope. These data confirm the presence of the [O III] 88 $\mu$m line at $4.5\sigma$ significance, precisely at the redshift of several faint emission lines previously seen with JWST/NIRSpec, while the underlying dust continuum remains undetected ($F_\nu &lt; 9.0 \, \mathrm{\mu Jy}$), implying an obscured star formation rate (SFR) of $\text{SFR}_\text{IR} \lesssim 6 \, \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}$ and dust mass of $M_\text{dust} \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^{6} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ (all $3\sigma$). The accurate ALMA redshift of $z_\text{[O III]} = 11.1221 \pm 0.0006$ ($\gtrsim \! 5\times$ refined over NIRSpec) helps confirm that redshifts measured purely from the Lyman-$\alpha$ break, even spectroscopically, should properly take into account the effects of potential damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption (DLA) systems to avoid systematic overestimates of up to $\Delta z \approx 0.5$. The [O III] 88 $\mu$m luminosity of $L_\text{[O III]} = (1.1 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{8} \, \mathrm{L_\odot}$, meanwhile, agrees well with the scaling relation for local metal-poor dwarfs given the SFR measured by NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI. The spatially resolved MIRI and ALMA emission also underscores that JADES-GS-z11-0 is likely to consist of two low-mass components that are undergoing strong bursts of star formation yet are already pre-enriched in oxygen ( 20-30% solar), only 400 Myr after the Big Bang.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cascading from the winds to the disk: the universality of supernovae-driven turbulence in different galactic interstellar media</a><span class="id">[2509.01653]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Star-forming galaxies are in a state of turbulence, with one of the principle components of the turbulence sourced by the constant injection of momentum from supernovae (SNe) explosions. Utilizing high-resolution stratified, gravito-hydrodynamical models of SNe-driven turbulence with interstellar medium (ISM) cooling and heating, we explore how SNe-driven turbulence changes across different galactic conditions, parameterized by the galactic mass and potential, SNe-driving rate, and seeding functions. We show that even though the underlying ISM changes between starburst and Milky Way analogue models, the velocity fluctuations in the turbulence of both models, but not the kinetic energy fluctuations, can be normalized into a universal, single cascade, $du^2(k)/dk \propto k^{-3/2}$, where $u$ is the velocity and $k$ is the wavemode, indicating that the structure of the turbulence is robust to significant changes in the ISM and SNe seeding. Moreover, the cascades connect smoothly from the winds into the galactic disk, pushing the outer-scale of the turbulence, $\ell_{\rm cor}$, to over $\ell_{\rm cor} \approx 6 \ell_0$, where $\ell_0$ is the gaseous scale-height. By providing an analytical model for the sound speed spectrum, $dc_s^2(k)/dk$, in the weak-cooling, adiabatic limit, we show that it is the compressible turbulent modes, $u_c$, that control the volume-filling phase structure of the galactic disks in our models, with $dc_s^2(k)/dk \propto k^{-2} \propto du_c^2(k)/dk$. This may indicate that galactic turbulence does not only have highly-universal features across different galaxies, but also directly sets the volume-filling hot and warm phase structure of the underlying galactic ISM through turbulent compressible modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20637" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merger-induced disturbance and temporal signatures in galaxy clusters: a combined phase space and photometric analysis</a><span class="id">[2509.20637]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a physically interpretable framework to quantify dynamical disturbances in galaxy clusters using projected two-dimensional phase-space information.

All features are derived from observable quantities and are intended to be measurable in future surveys. To enable observational application, we adopt a simplified estimator using aperture mass map statistics as a mass ratio proxy in TNG300-1, and validate its performance with weak lensing data from The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). While phase-space diagnostics reveal merger-driven asymmetries, they are not sensitive to whether the secondary progenitor is infalling or receding, and thus cannot distinguish future mergers from past mergers. To address this, we incorporate the star formation rate (SFR) from TNG-Cluster and propose the blue galaxy fraction as a promising observational tracer of merger timing. Finally, we construct mock Chandra X-ray images of TNG-Cluster halos at redshift $z=0.2$, and find that the offset between the X-ray peak and the position of the most massive black hole (used as a proxy for the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, BCG) correlates with our disturbance score, serving as a consistency check.

We use \verb|astrodendro|, a dendrogram-based algorithm, on a uniform linear resolution (2000 au) version of the data to extract 5160 continuum structures with effective radii spanning $800-42000$ au and estimated masses between $~0.05-670~M_{\odot}$. With our large sample, we statistically examine differences in clump properties for regions with varying levels of hierarchical complexity. We find that clumps exhibiting the richest hierarchical morphology have distributions with higher dust temperatures, surface densities, luminosity-to-mass (\textit{L/M}) ratios, and most massive core (MMC) masses, indicating that these regions tend to be at later evolutionary stages. We find a positive correlation between the mass of cores from the ALMAGAL core catalog and the surface density of their surrounding structures identified in this work. However, this correlation is weaker for cores in more evolved clumps, where lower mass cores can be found at higher local surface densities. This could indicate that some cores accrete mass less efficiently from the intra-clump reservoir than others, despite the total available mass increasing over time, a scenario that is congruent with a clump-fed core accretion model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11501" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Looking at infrared background radiation anisotropies with Spitzer II.

The modeled CIB fluctuations from known galaxies produce the majority of the observed small-scale signal down to statistical uncertainties of $&lt; 10\%$ and we constrain the evolution of the halo mass regime hosting such galaxies. Thus the large-scale CIB fluctuations from new populations are produced by sources with negligible small-scale power. This appears to conflict with the presented Intra-halo light (IHL) models, but is accounted for if the new sources are at high $z$. Our analysis spanning several Spitzer datasets allows us to narrow the estimated contributions of remaining known galaxies to the CIB anisotropies to be probed potentially from surveys by new and upcoming space missions such as Euclid, SPHEREx, and Roman. Of these, the Roman surveys have the best prospects for measuring the source-subtracted CIB and probing the nature of the underlying new populations at $\lambda &lt;2\ \mu$m, followed by Euclid's surveys, while for SPHEREx the source-subtracted CIB signal from them appears significantly overwhelmed by the CIB from remaining known galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-energy astrochemistry in the molecular interstellar medium</a><span class="id">[2512.10060]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a “high-energy astrochemistry”, defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predicting dust temperature from molecular line data using machine learning</a><span class="id">[2601.03680]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We conducted experiments with machine learning techniques to construct dust temperature maps from the CO isotopologue molecular line data in the Orion A molecular cloud. In the classical astrophysical methodology, multi-band continuum data are required to derive the dust temperature. The present study aims to investigate the capability and limitations of machine learning techniques to derive dust temperatures in regions without multi-band dust continuum data. We investigated how the number of pixels used for training influences prediction accuracy, and how the dust temperatures sampled in the training area influence prediction accuracy. We found that $\sim$5\% of the total number of pixels in the observational region is sufficient for training to obtain accurate predictions. Furthermore, a dust temperature sample within the training area should cover the whole temperature range and have a similar sample distribution to that of the entire observing region for an accurate prediction. The $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is often found to be the most important feature in predicting the dust temperature. As the $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is a tracer of PDR, the machine learning technique could connect the dust temperatures to the PDRs. We also found that the condition of thermal gas-dust coupling is not required for accurate prediction of the dust temperature from the molecular line data, and that machine learning is capable of capturing information more than classical astrophysical concepts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dual AGNs on 100 kpc Scales from the Million Quasar Catalog</a><span class="id">[2601.04627]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Research on dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is crucial for understanding the coevolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. However, the current number of dual AGNs remains scarce. In this work, we selected 173 new dual AGNs, 4 AGN triplets, and 1 AGN quadruplet from the Million Quasars Catalog, all with low redshift ($z &lt; 0.5$), a projected distance ($r_p$) of no more than 100 kpc, and a line-of-sight velocity difference ($|\Delta v|$) of less than 600 km s$^{-1}$, thus supplementing existing low-redshift dual AGNs demographics. Visual inspection of the optical images from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Survey was performed for each pair, revealing that $\sim$16\% of pairs exhibit tidal features. Statistical analyses show an increasing number of dual AGNs with decreasing redshift, with velocity difference primarily at $|\Delta v| &lt; $ 300 km s$^{-1}$, which is likely an artifact of our selection strategy. The tidal sample peaks as having 13 pairs at 5-20$h^{-1}_{70}$ kpc, but drops to 1 pair $&gt; 55\,h^{-1}_{70}$ kpc. Our study also explores thewide separation ($r_p&gt;10$ kpc) dual AGNs, finding 165 such systems, with 25 displaying clear tidal features. Furthermore, some extra galaxies, AGNs, and/or their candidates were found in the same regions of the pairs or multiplets forming interacting systems with these pairs or multiplets.</p></div></details></article>

This process often involves fitting mathematical models to galaxy images to extract properties such as size, brightness, components, and shape. GALFIT is a widely used tool for this purpose, but it requires careful preparation of input files and interpretation of results, which can be a barrier to efficient use. GALFITools is a Python library that streamlines this workflow by automating many of the tasks surrounding the use of GALFIT. These include generating image masks, estimating sky background, modeling the telescope's point spread function (PSF), and extracting physical parameters from GALFIT outputs. The software is designed for researchers and students who work with galaxy image modeling and aims to make the process more reproducible, accessible, and scalable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05387" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paving the Road to the Habitable Worlds Observatory with High-Resolution Imaging I: New and Archival Speckle Observations of Potential HWO Target Stars</a><span class="id">[2601.05387]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the key goals of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to directly image about 25 potentially habitable exoplanets and determine their properties. This challenge will require a large survey of nearby, bright stars –  100 according to the Astro2020 Decadel Survey. To ensure the success of the mission and to help guide design decisions, the stellar multiplicity of the target stars must be well-understood. To this end, we present optical speckle imaging of stars in the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) provisional HWO star list, which is currently the Tier 1 target list for the HWO Target Stars and Systems Sub-Working Group. We obtained new observations using `Alopeke and Zorro at Gemini Observatory and queried the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program Archive for archival observations, resulting in speckle imaging data for 80 of the 164 stars. We confirmed one candidate companion detected previously by Gaia (HD 90089) and obtained an ambiguous detection of a known companion (HD 212330). To examine our sensitivity to companions, we simulated stellar companions down to  0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for each target and found that 75%-85% would be detected in our speckle images; the remaining simulated companions are either too faint or too close-in, and will require follow-up using other methods such as long-term spectroscopic measurements and space-based techniques. This work represents a first step towards surveying potential HWO targets for close-in stellar companions and helping to inform the target selection process for the HWO direct-imaging survey, bringing us closer towards the discovery of potential habitable worlds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Large and Precise All-Sky Photometric Standard Star Dataset Across More Than 200 Passbands</a><span class="id">[2601.05486]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-precision photometric standard stars play a key role in enabling accurate photometric calibration and advancing various fields of astronomy. However, due to limitations in calibration methods and the limited availability and underuse of high-precision reference data, existing photometric standard stars may suffer from insufficient numbers, systematic errors exceeding 10 milli-magnitude (mmag), limited photometric band coverage, or incomplete sky coverage, among other issues. To overcome these limitations, we have constructed the largest (over 200 million stars, 1000 times the widely recognized Landolt standards in the same magnitude range), most precise (better than 10 mmag), and most comprehensive (over 200 bands, nearly 40 times the coverage of traditional standards) all-sky standard stars. Based on standards, we have calibrated multiple survey datasets to mmag precision, and subsequently developed a complete sky distribution of stars for the Pan-STARRS system. This database, the BEst STars Database (BEST), is expected to pave the way for achieving mmag-level - or even higher - photometric precision in large-scale surveys, and to play a central role in shaping a high-precision astronomical measurement framework.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05598" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data post-processing gain resulting from the patchy nature of speckles</a><span class="id">[2601.05598]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The data post-processing gain is an important parameter for exposure time calculations used to inform the design of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Assuming azimuthally symmetric noise properties is a common simplifying assumption for such simulations, which neglects the patchy nature of the residual diffracted starlight; i.e., speckles. Fortunately, patchiness might prove to be an opportunity that improves the overall sensitivity of observatory assuming photon-noise limited speckle subtraction. We illustrate this effect in the context of angular differential imaging (ADI), which is one of the possible observing strategies being considered for the detection and characterization of exo-Earth with HWO. We show that combining observations of two observatory roll angles leads to a gain in signal-to-noise greater than $\sqrt{2}$ when the patchy starlight dominates other noise sources. The gain can be closer to x2 when the starlight dominates the noise budget by more than an order of magnitude. In other words, combining good and bad observations is better than combining two average ones. This statement is very general as it is a direct consequence of combining data with a weighted mean. It applies more broadly to any combination of observations with varying noise level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05447" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robust Bilinear-Noise-Optimal Control for Gravitational-Wave Detectors: A Mixed LQG/$H_\infty$ Approach</a><span class="id">[2601.05447]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>At its lowest frequencies, LIGO is limited by noise in its many degrees of freedom of suspended optics, which, in turn, introduce noise in the interferometer through their feedback control systems. Nonlinear interactions are a dominant source of low-frequency noise, mixing noise from multiple degrees of freedom. The lowest-order form is bilinear noise, in which the noise from two feedback-controlled subsystems multiplies to mask gravitational waves. Bilinear couplings require control trade-offs that simultaneously balance high- and low-frequency noise. Currently, there is no known lower limit to bilinear control noise. Here, we develop benchmark cost functions for bilinear noise and associated figures of merit. Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control then establishes aggressive feedback that saturates the lower bounds on the cost functions. We then develop a mixed LQG and $H_\infty$ approach to directly compute stable, robust, and optimal feedback, using the LIGO's alignment control system as an example. Direct computations are fast while ensuring a global optimum. By calculating optimal robust control, it is possible to construct the lower bound on controls noise along the Pareto front of practical controllers for LIGO. This method can be used to drastically improve controls noise in existing observatories as well as to set subsystem control noise requirements for next-generation detectors with parameterized design.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05754" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational waves and small-field astrometry</a><span class="id">[2601.05754]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Astrometric observations can, in principle, be used to detect gravitational waves.

We also present several general findings that are not restricted to the small-field case. A detailed theoretical derivation of the general astrometric effect of a plane gravitational wave is provided. Numerical simulations, which underline our theoretical findings, are presented.

We present an updated version of the parametrized framework with the state-of-art IMRPhenomX waveform family. Our new framework incorporates deviations in the dominant mode as well as in the higher-order modes of the waveform. We demonstrate that the missing physics of either higher-order modes or precession in the parametrized model can lead to a biased conclusion of false deviation from GR. Our new implementation mitigates this issue and enables us to perform the tests for highly asymmetric and precessing binaries without being subject to systematic biases due to missing physics. Finally, we apply the improved test to analyze events observed during the second half of the third observing run of LIGO and Virgo (O3b). We provide constraints on GR deviations by combining O3b results with those from previous observation runs. Our findings show no evidence for violations of GR.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adaptive Online Emulation for Accelerating Complex Physical Simulations</a><span class="id">[2508.08012]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Complex physical simulations often require trade-offs between model fidelity and computational feasibility. We introduce Adaptive Online Emulation (AOE), which dynamically learns neural network surrogates during simulation execution to accelerate expensive components. Unlike existing methods requiring extensive offline training, AOE uses Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machines (OS-ELMs) to continuously adapt emulators along the actual simulation trajectory. We employ a numerically stable variant of the OS-ELM using cumulative sufficient statistics to avoid matrix inversion instabilities. AOE integrates with time-stepping frameworks through a three-phase strategy balancing data collection, updates, and surrogate usage, while requiring orders of magnitude less training data than conventional surrogate approaches. Demonstrated on a 1D atmospheric model of exoplanet GJ1214b, AOE achieves 11.1 times speedup (91% time reduction) across 200,000 timesteps while maintaining accuracy, potentially making previously intractable high-fidelity time-stepping simulations computationally feasible.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</a><span class="id">[2508.10855]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a time-dependent, end-to-end framework for laser power beaming from cislunar orbits to the lunar surface. The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target Wh day$^{-1}$ and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2 m-class phased array at 1064 nm the reference geometry yields $\sim$0.6–0.8 kWh day$^{-1}$ to a 1 m$^2$ receiver (about 28 W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\rm eff}^{2}$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10 m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\rm tx}=100$ kW delivers $\sim$30–50 kWh day$^{-1}$ at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pivot-Only Azimuthal Control and Attitude Estimation of Balloon-borne Payloads</a><span class="id">[2512.11987]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents an attitude estimation and yaw-rate control framework for balloon-borne payloads using pivot-only actuation, motivated by the Taurus experiment. Taurus is a long-duration balloon instrument designed for rapid azimuthal scanning at approximately 30 deg/s using a motorized pivot at the flight-train connection, without a reaction wheel. We model the gondola as a rigid body subject to realistic disturbances and sensing limitations, and implement a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) that estimates attitude and gyroscope bias by fusing inertial and vector-camera measurements. A simple PI controller uses the estimated states to regulate yaw rate. Numerical simulations incorporating representative disturbance and measurement noise levels are used to evaluate closed-loop control performance and MEKF behavior under flight-like conditions. Experimental tests on the Taurus gondola validate the pivot-only approach, demonstrating stable high-rate tracking under realistic hardware constraints. The close agreement between simulation and experiment indicates that the simplified rigid-body model captures the dominant dynamics relevant for controller design and integrated estimation-and-control development.</p></div></details></article></body>
