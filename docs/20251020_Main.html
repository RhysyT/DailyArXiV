In both long-lived and short-lived remnant scenarios, neutrino flavor conversions modify species-dependent neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and drive the matter towards more neutron rich conditions. They produce up to $300\%$ more neutron rich ejecta and significantly boost the r-process yields, especially in low-density, near-equatorial outflows. We identify regions unstable to fast flavor instabilities and find that these instabilities persist despite flavor conversions. We further test the sensitivity to the equilibration timescale of the flavor conversions, finding that slower flavor conversions can interact with thermodynamic equilibration, and increase the neutron richness of the ejecta. Flavor conversions may also contribute to stronger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions, pointing to a correlation between neutrino transport and merger dynamics. These results highlight the potential impact of flavor conversions while motivating future work to improve on theoretical understanding of flavor instabilities in global simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-species Dark Matter with Warmth and Randomness</a><span class="id">[2510.15046]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a general analytic framework for the evolution of cosmic structure in multi-species dark matter models that simultaneously incorporates finite velocity dispersion and Poisson fluctuations. Our approach accommodates arbitrary numbers of dark matter components with distinct mass fractions, velocity distributions, and number densities – ranging from cold particles to warm species and sparse populations such as primordial black holes or solitons. The framework is based on solving a truncated BBGKY hierarchy, whose solution is obtained by solving Volterra integral equations. We provide an efficient algorithm to solve for the total, as well as inter- and intra-species power spectra. Worked examples with two-component mixtures illustrate how isocurvature (initially Poisson) and adiabatic spectra evolve differently depending on the properties of the warm or sparse fraction. This evolution is controlled by the free-streaming and Jeans scales, and the results match analytic estimates and $N$-body simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15049" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gradus.jl: spacetime-agnostic general relativistic ray-tracing for X-ray spectral modelling</a><span class="id">[2510.15049]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce this http URL , an open-source and publicly available general relativistic ray-tracing toolkit for spectral modelling in arbitrary spacetimes. Our software is written in the Julia programming language, making use of forward-mode automatic differentiation for computing the Christoffel symbols during geodesic integration, and for propagating derivatives through the entire ray-tracer. Relevant numerical methods are detailed, and our models are validated using a number of tests and comparisons to other codes. The differentiability is used to optimally calculate Cunningham transfer functions – used to efficiently pre-compute relativistic effects in spectral models. A method is described for calculating such transfer functions for disc with non-zero vertical height, including the treatment of self-obscuration. An extension of the transfer function formalism that includes timing information is described, and used to calculate high-resolution reverberation lag spectra for a lamppost corona. The lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra for a Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disc with various lamppost heights and Eddington ratios are calculated, and the general impact of disc thickness in reflection models is discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implications of a high growth index on the variation of $G$</a><span class="id">[2510.15054]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A recent determination of the growth index indicates a value significantly higher than the $\Lambda$CDM prediction, suggesting that alternative scenarios to $\Lambda$CDM may be required. In this work, we investigate whether a time-varying Newton's constant, $G_N$, can account for such a high growth index, $\gamma=0.063\pm0.025$. Adopting a phenomenological approach, we study two parameterizations of the effective gravitational coupling, $G_{\rm eff}$, one based on a Taylor expansion and another linked to the energy density parameter of Dark Energy. We constrain the models with Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument baryon acoustic oscillations (data release 2), CMB priors, and a gaussian likelihood for the growth index. We show that the constant $\gamma$ approximation is accurate for the parametrization linked to the energy density parameter of dark energy, but presents a non-negligible error for the other case, which we treat as a systematic error in the analysis. We find a $2.4\sigma-3.4\sigma$ tension level with constant $G_{\rm eff}$, depending on the parametrization. The results indicate that $G_{\rm eff}&lt;G_N$ around the period of accelerated expansion, corresponding to a weaker effective gravitational interaction on cosmological scales, which leads to a suppression of the growth of cosmological structures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15064" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wave-Mediated Boundary Layers of Accretion Discs: Role of Internal Structure of the Accretor</a><span class="id">[2510.15064]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Disc accretion onto astrophysical objects with a material surface proceeds through the boundary layer (BL) – a radially narrow region in the inner disc where the incoming gas must slow down its rotation before settling onto the surface of the accretor. Here we numerically study a BL in which the angular momentum transport in the layer is accomplished via the excitation of global acoustic waves. While the earlier studies of such wave-mediated BLs typically modeled the internal structure of the central object as a globally isothermal sphere with sharply rising density profile, here we explore the effect of other internal density and temperature profiles on the mode operation. We model the inner structure of an accretor as a polytropic sphere, allowing a shallower increase of density and a non-trivial temperature profile inside the object. While the mix of acoustic modes observed in our long-duration (1000 inner orbits long) 2D hydrodynamic simulations is a weak function of the polytropic index $n$ of the accretor's structure, the mass accretion rate and the angular momentum flux across the BL show a clear dependence on $n$, both decreasing in amplitude as $n$ is lowered. Interestingly, in 2D these transport metrics are better correlated not with $n$ but with a total mass inside the central object contained within the simulation domain. These results improve our understanding of the wave-mediated BL accretion by quantifying the effect of the inner structure of the accretor on the excitation and propagation of acoustic modes mediating the BL transport.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOI-283 b: A transiting mini-Neptune in a 17.6-day orbit discovered with TESS and ESPRESSO</a><span class="id">[2510.15084]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are missing from our Solar System, yet they appear to be the most abundant planetary types in our Galaxy. A detailed characterization of key planets within this population is important for understanding the formation mechanisms of rocky and gas giant planets and the diversity of planetary interior structures. In 2019, NASA's TESS satellite found a transiting planet candidate in a 17.6-day orbit around the star TOI-283. We started radial velocity (RV) follow-up observations with ESPRESSO to obtain a mass measurement. Mass and radius are measurements critical for planetary classification and internal composition modeling. We used ESPRESSO spectra to derive the stellar parameters of the planet candidate host star TOI-283. We then performed a joint analysis of the photometric and RV data of this star, using Gaussian processes to model the systematic noise present in both datasets. We find that the host is a bright K-type star ($d = 82.4$ pc, $\mathrm{T}_\mathrm{eff} = 5213 \pm 70$ K, $V = 10.4$ mag) with a mass and radius of $\mathrm{M}_\star = 0.80 \pm 0.01\; \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $\mathrm{R}_\star = 0.85 \pm 0.03\; \mathrm{R}_\odot$. The planet has an orbital period of $P = 17.617$ days, a size of $\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{p} = 2.34 \pm 0.09\; \mathrm{R}_\oplus$, and a mass of $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{p} = 6.54 \pm 2.04\; \mathrm{M}_\oplus$. With an equilibrium temperature of $\sim$600 K and a bulk density of $\rho_\mathrm{p} = 2.81 \pm 0.93$ g cm$^{-3}$, this planet is positioned in the mass-radius diagram where planetary models predict H$_2$O- and H/He-rich envelopes. The ESPRESSO RV data also reveal a long-term trend that is probably related to the star's activity cycle. Further RV observations are required to confirm whether this signal originates from stellar activity or another planetary body in the system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15088" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Improved Atlas of Full-Scan Spectra from ISO/SWS</a><span class="id">[2510.15088]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an atlas of full-scan spectra from the Short-Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) aboard the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) after reprocessing and improving an earlier version published 22 years ago. The SWS spectra cover the wavelength range from 2.35 to 45.3 {\mu}m. They include scans in 12 separate bands, and we have updated the methods used to combine those bands into a single continuous spectrum. The main improvement comes from applying multiple constraints, including new photometry and spectra from the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope that have become available since the release of the original products, and individualized attention to each spectrum, to renormalize the separate bands into a more consistent single spectrum. In particular this removed unphysical negative fluxes that were common in the original data products. The new database, with 1035 reprocessed spectra, will be available to the community at IRSA, which also hosts the original processing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15102" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assessing the Distance for Probing the Nuclear Equation of State with Supernova Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2510.15102]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae provide a unique probe of the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter. In this work, we focus on the bounce signal from numerical simulations of rotating supernovae and explore its potential for EOS inference. We employ a support vector machine, previously shown to perform best among tested methods, to classify GW signals simulated for 18 EOS models. For optimally oriented sources, we estimate that the Advanced LIGO A+ detector can probe the EOS for Galactic events, while third-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer can reach substantially farther. For randomly oriented sources, only these next-generation detectors are expected to have sufficient sensitivity. These results represent the potential observational range for probing the nuclear EOS, although, due to the simplifying assumptions adopted, they should be regarded as approximate upper limits.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Relations for Elastic Hybrid Stars and Quark Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.15149]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Some compact stars may contain deconfined quark matter, forming hybrid stars or quark stars. If the quark matter forms an inhomogeneous condensate in the crystalline color superconducting phase, its rigidity may be high enough to noticeably alter the stellar properties. In this paper, we investigate whether these elastic stars follow the universal relations, i.e., relations insensitive to equations of state, that have been well established for fluid stars. We improve upon previous studies by allowing quark matter in the background, static, and spherically symmetric configuration to be sheared. Such background shear can be treated in the form of an effective pressure anisotropy. We then calculate the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability ${\lambda}_2$, and spin-induced quadrupole moment $Q$ of these models with pressure anisotropy. The $I$-${\lambda}_2$-$Q$ universal relations for the elastic hybrid (quark) star models are valid up to a variation of $\approx2\,(3)\%$, larger than that for typical fluid star models, when the maximal magnitude of quark matter shear modulus is considered in the crystalline color superconducting phase from realistic calculations. The uncertainty in universal relations related to the stellar compactness for these elastic star models, on the other hand, remain comparable to those for typical fluid star models. Our results demonstrate the validity of universal relations for hybrid stars and quark stars with a realistic degree of pressure anisotropy due to the crystalline color superconducting quark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetohydrodynamic-guiding-center-particle-in-cell Method for Multiscale Plasma Kinetic Simulations</a><span class="id">[2510.15156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the formulation, algorithm and numerical tests of the magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-cell (MHD-PIC) method with particles treated under the guiding center approximation, which we term the MHD-gPIC method, and it is implemented in the Athena++ MHD code. The new MHD-gPIC model consists of thermal (cold) fluid and high-energy particles whose dynamics are integrated through guiding center equations including drift motion, with carefully evaluated source terms as particle backreaction. The code is validated with a series of tests, and it is expected to be primarily applicable to study particle acceleration and transport in systems where gyro-resonance is considered insignificant. We also present preliminary studies of particle acceleration during non-relativistic magnetic reconnection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15393" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A family of binaries with an extreme mass ratio</a><span class="id">[2510.15393]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Multiplicity is ubiquitous among massive stars. While the stellar components usually display similar masses, some binaries with extremely low mass ratios were also observed. Some of them are primordial, while others arise from binary interactions. The identification of systems with extreme mass ratios brings valuable information, notably on the origin of fast rotation in massive stars. We identify new short-period systems with extreme mass ratios through the detection of eclipses and reflection effects. The physical properties of a dozen newly identified cases were precisely evaluated through high-quality photometry and spectroscopy. In addition to characterizing these binaries, we found a clear signature of apsidal motion in one system, and three other systems display long-term shifts in eclipse times. All systems we reported here are composed of a massive star and a cool low-mass companion. They are therefore primordial cases. This doubles the known number of these systems in the Galaxy. In this context, it is important to note that most massive stars in these systems, as well as in previous systems reported in the literature, rotate fast (supersynchronous compared to the orbital motion). The high incidence of fast rotation in these nascent binaries provides strong constraints for star formation models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sensitivity of Nuclear Reaction Rates in X-ray Burst Models</a><span class="id">[2510.15441]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type I X-ray bursts (XRBs) are thermonuclear runaways on the surface of accreting neutron stars, powered by rapid proton-capture and alpha-capture processes on neutron-deficient nuclei. Uncertainties in the corresponding reaction rates remain a major limitation in modeling burst light curves and ashes. We present a systematic study of the sensitivity of XRB models to uncertainties in charged-particle-induced reaction rates across a broad parameter space of accretion rates and fuel compositions in low-mass X-ray binaries. The study proceeds in two stages: ignition conditions are first determined with a semi-analytic framework coupled to a full reaction network, followed by a sensitivity analysis using the ONEZONE model with individual rate variations. We identify 41 reactions that alter the burst light curve and 187 that significantly impact final abundances. Reactions on bottleneck isotopes in the alpha-p- and rp-process paths strongly affect both observables, while most (p, gamma) reactions on medium-mass (A &gt; 32) and heavy-mass (A &gt; 55) nuclei influence only the final composition. Medium-mass cases dominate in He-rich bursts, where the reaction flow terminates earlier, while heavy-mass cases appear in mixed H and He bursts with extended rp-process paths reaching A   110. We identify a subset of reactions whose rate uncertainties exert influence on the final 12C yield in helium-rich bursts, which could have important consequences for the mechanism of ignition of carbon superbursts. Our results identify key targets for nuclear reaction experiments to reduce nuclear physics uncertainties in XRB models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extending TESS Flare Frequency Distributions with CHEOPS: power-law or lognormal?</a><span class="id">[2510.15453]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar flares are intense bursts of radiation caused by magnetic reconnection events on active stars. They are especially frequent on M dwarfs, where they can strongly influence planetary habitability. Flare frequency distributions (FFDs) are usually modeled as power laws, but recent studies have proposed alternatives such as lognormal distributions, implying different flare mechanisms and planetary impacts. This work investigates which statistical distribution best describes flare occurrences on M dwarfs, considering both equivalent duration (ED), the quantity directly measured from photometry, and bolometric energy, which is more relevant for habitability assesments. We analyzed 110 M dwarfs observed with TESS and CHEOPS, detecting 5,620 flares. Complex events were decomposed, detection biases corrected, and FFDs from both missions scaled to build a combined distribution spanning nearly 10 orders of magnitude in bolometric energy. ED-based FFDs follow a power law, reflecting intrinsic photometric flare occurrence. However, bolometric energy-based FFDs deviate from a pure power law, being better described by a lognormal distribution or, more accurately, by a truncated power law with a break near $10^{33}$ erg, the typical superflare threshold. This truncation suggests a change in flare-generation physics between regular flares and superflares, with implications for the cumulative impact on exoplanetary atmospheres. The apparent low-energy flattening previously attributed to lognormal behavior arises from observational biases, while the drop in flare frequency above $10^{35}$ erg remains unexplained, possibly reflecting an intrinsic cutoff or current observational limits. The upcoming PLATO mission will be well suited to probe both regimes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15460" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation in Composite Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson Models: Implications for Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2510.15460]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study inflation driven by a scalar potential arising from composite-sector dynamics, inspired by generalized composite Higgs models. The introduction of a non-minimal coupling, possessing the same functional form as the potential, induces a flattening at large field values that enables successful inflation. We analyze the conditions for ultra-slow-roll inflation, which leads to enhanced curvature perturbations, by combining analytical criteria near the inflection point with comprehensive numerical scans of the parameter space. The region consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background constraints and yielding approximately $N_e \approx 55\text{-}60$ e-folds also predicts primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^3\text{-}10^5\,\mathrm{g}$. Although such ultra-light primordial black holes are typically expected to have evaporated, recent proposals invoking evaporation suppression via memory-burden effects could allow their survival as viable dark matter candidates. Under this assumption, the induced gravitational wave signal peaks in a frequency gap between standard interferometers and resonant-cavity experiments, motivating exploration of this observational frontier.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong gravitational-wave lensing posterior odds</a><span class="id">[2510.15463]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Like light, gravitational waves are gravitationally lensed by intervening massive astrophysical objects, such as galaxies, clusters, black holes, and stars, resulting in a variety of potentially observable gravitational-wave lensing signatures. Searches for gravitational-wave lensing by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration have begun. One common method focuses on strong gravitational-wave lensing, which produces multiple &quot;images&quot;: repeated copies of the same gravitational wave that differ only in amplitude, arrival time, and overall &quot;Morse phase.&quot; The literature identifies two separate approaches to identifying such repeated gravitational-wave events based on frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Several works have discussed selection effects and identified challenges similar to the well-known &quot;birthday problem&quot;, namely, the rapidly increasing likelihood of false alarms in an ever-growing catalogue of event pairs. Here, we discuss these problems, unify the different approaches in Bayesian language, and derive the posterior odds for strong lensing. In particular, the Bayes factor and prior odds are sensitive to the number of gravitational-wave events in the data, but the posterior odds are insensitive to it once strong lensing time delays are accounted for. We confirm Lo et al.'s (2020) finding that selection effects enter the Bayes factor as an overall normalisation constant. However, this factor cancels out in the posterior odds and does not affect frequentist approaches to strong lensing detection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15465" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disentangling two spectral components in the X-ray emission of the blazar 1ES 0229+200</a><span class="id">[2510.15465]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray observations are essential to achieve a deeper understanding of the broadband emission mechanism in blazars. Here, we present a long-term spectral and temporal analysis of X-ray and optical observations of 1E 0229+200 collected with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from 2008 to 2024, complemented by hard X-ray observations from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array NuSTAR. The blazar 1ES 0229+200 is a high-frequency, peaked BL Lac object, known for its exceptionally hard very high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray spectrum extending up to 10 TeV. In August 2021, NuSTAR observed the source in a low X-ray state, revealing a concave spectral shape with a distinct upturn around 25 keV. This feature contrasts with previous observations performed with NuSTAR and Swift-BAT, which showed no such spectral upturn. Previous observations of 1ES 0229+200 and broadband SED (spectral energy distribution) modelling suggest that its X-ray emission extends beyond 100 keV without a significant cutoff. The newly detected spectral upturn may indicate a transition between the synchrotron and inverse Compton components or could be linked to photohadronic processes involving high-energy neutrinos. We discuss the implications of this finding in the context of blazar spectral energy distributions, particularly the potential existence of a third SED bump in the kiloelectronvolt to megaelectronvolt range. The observed spectral features support the hypothesis that 1ES 0229+200 could be a source of high-energy neutrino emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15477" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The effect of near-surface winds on surface temperature and dust transport on Venus</a><span class="id">[2510.15477]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The knowledge of the Venus near-surface atmosphere is sparse. Few spacecrafts landed on the surface and measured winds with amplitudes below 1 m/s. The diurnal cycle of the wind amplitude and orientation is not known. Recent numerical simulations showed that slope winds along topographic structures could strongly impact the direction of winds. This study presents the first mesoscale modelling of such winds on Venus. A change of direction is occurring during the day in the main slopes, with upslope winds at noon due to solar heating and downslope winds at night. This is due to efficient IR cooling of the surface during the night, being colder than its surroundings slope atmospheric environment and leading to displacement of air. The temperature is impacted by the adiabatic cooling/warming induced by those winds. A strong heating effect is occurring for the downslope winds, leading to an anti-correlation between the surface temperature diurnal amplitude and the topography. This diurnal amplitude reaches 4 K in the plains and below 1 K in the mountains. The saltation of sediment by those winds was also quantified, with a higher probability at night along the slopes on the western flanks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eruption column modelling of explosive volcanism on Venus</a><span class="id">[2510.15492]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Volcanism on Venus has never been directly observed, but several measurements indicate present-day activity. Volcanism could potentially play a role in climatic processes on Venus, especially in the sulfur cycle like on Earth. Observation of volcanic activity is the primary objective of future Venus spacecraft. However, there are many unknowns regarding its Venusian characteristics, like the condition at the vent, the volatile content and composition. Past modelling efforts have only studied explosive volcanic plume propagation over a limited range of flow parameters at the vent and in an idealised Venus atmospheric configuration. We propose to use the 1D FPLUME volcanic plume model in a realistic Venusian environment. In similar Venusian conditions, the height of the plume is consistent with past modelling. The present study shows that explosive volcanism would preferably reach 15 km of altitude. Under certain conditions, plumes are able to reach the VenSpec-H tropospheric altitude range of observations and even the 45 km cloud floor. For the first time, the impact of wind was quantified, and the super-rotating winds have a substantial impact by plume-bending of reducing the height of plumes. Contrary to the Earth, the atmospheric heat capacity depends greatly on temperature, and will disadvantage lower plumes and allow larger plumes to propagate at higher altitudes. The high latitude atmospheric environment, due to the thermal profile and weaker winds, is favorable to plumes reaching higher altitudes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The lack of fast rotators in Cyg OB2. I. Insights from spectral reclassification of its B0 population</a><span class="id">[2510.15540]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Cygnus OB2, in the Cygnus X complex – one of the most active star-forming regions of the Galaxy – hosts hundreds of O- and B-type stars at different evolutionary stages. This association provides a unique laboratory to study massive star evolution and dynamics. However, despite extensive studies, the absence of a fast-rotating group ($v\sin{i}&gt;200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) among the O-type population of Cygnus OB2 challenges current models of massive star evolution. Aims. Stellar rotation strongly impacts spectral line shapes of O-type stars, and high rotation can potentially lead to misclassifications. We investigate whether some stars in Cygnus OB2, classified at low spectral resolution as B0, are actually rapidly rotating late-O types. Such cases could explain the observed lack of fast rotators in Cygnus OB2. Methods. Accounting for rotation, we reclassify the known B0 population in Cygnus OB2, using the MGB tool and both new and pre-existing optical spectroscopy. Finally, we compute projected rotational velocities using iacob-broad. Results. About $19\,\%$ of the initial B0 population in Cygnus OB2 are, in fact, late-O types. Only 6 stars in the entire dataset show $v\sin{i}&gt;200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, with just 1 new O-type star exceeding this threshold. Conclusions. In our study of Cygnus OB2, we continue to find a notable lack of fast rotators among its O-type population. We propose a combination of three factors as the most likely explanation: (i) the young age of Cygnus OB2 may imply that fast rotators has not been produced yet due to binary interactions; (ii) fast rotators may have been dynamically ejected from the core as runaway stars; (iii) local star formation conditions may hinder binary formation (reducing spin-up interactions) or result in slower rotational velocities at birth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15571" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic fields in planetary nebulae detected through non-thermal radio continuum emission</a><span class="id">[2510.15571]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Planetary nebulae are shells ejected by low- and intermediate-mass stars. The slow wind ejected by the asymptotic giant branch star is compressed by a fast stellar wind to produce an expanding gaseous shell surrounding a hot bubble. The shell is a source of thermal radio emission which shows a spectral index between -0.1 and 2. Only two planetary nebulae are known to show non-thermal radio emission indicating magnetic fields and non-thermal electrons. Aims. The aim of this paper is verification of presence of magnetic fields of planetary nebulae. Magnetic fields can have a significant influence on shaping planetary nebulae. Methods. We observed a sample of northern planetary nebulae in radio continuum at 144 MHz with the Low Frequency Array. We combined our observations with archival observations at higher frequencies. Results. The spectral indices in 30 planetary nebulae were below -0.1, indicating non-thermal radio emission. The majority of this sample consists of bipolar planetary nebulae, which are known to originate from binary central stars. Most of the nebulae have sizes larger than 20 arcsec. Magnetic fields and nonthermal emission may be common in smaller planetary nebulae, but can be suppressed by thermal emission. Our results suggest that different mechanisms can be responsible for the origin of magnetic fields and non-thermal emission in planetary nebulae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15634" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulating the LOcal Web (SLOW) - VI: $γ$-ray Emission in the Local Universe</a><span class="id">[2510.15634]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: Diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from cosmic ray (CR) protons scattering off the gas in the intracluster and intergalactic medium (ICM and IGM) remains out of reach for current observations. Detecting this emission would provide constraints on intergalactic magnetic fields as well as dark matter interaction models. Aims: We aim to provide estimates for diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the Fermi-LAT band from galaxy clusters and the cosmic web in the local Universe. Methods: In this work we show results from the first cosmological MHD simulation with an on-the-fly spectral CR model. We model CR injection at shocks, account for adiabatic energy changes and advection of CR protons, and obtain their $\gamma$-ray emissivity directly from the simulated CR energy density and spectra. For this we use constrained initial conditions, which evolve in a field closely resembling that of the local Universe, allowing direct comparison to Fermi-LAT data on massive clusters. Results: We find CR proton acceleration at all structure formation and accretion shocks in galaxy clusters and cosmic web filaments. These protons provide the basis for diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in these regimes. The absolute value of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in our simulation lies a few orders of magnitude below the current upper limits found by Fermi-LAT. Under the assumption of our model, a sensitivity of $F_\gamma &lt; 10^{-11} \: \gamma~ \text{s}^{-1}~\text{cm}^{-2}$ is required for a detection of diffuse emission in Coma.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transverse BAO scale measurement at $z_{\rm eff} = 1.725$ with the SDSS quasars catalog</a><span class="id">[2510.15650]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Studying the SDSS-DR16 quasar catalog, we detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal in the two-point angular correlation function with a statistical significance of $3\sigma$, at an effective redshift of $z_{\rm eff}=1.725$. Using a simple parameterization-comprising a polynomial plus a Gaussian function-we measure the transverse BAO scale as $\theta_{\rm BAO}=1.928^{\circ}\pm0.094^{\circ}$. This measurement is obtained from a narrow redshift shell, $z \in [1.72, 1.73]$ (i.e., $\Delta z=0.01$), thin enough that projection-effect corrections are negligible, making it only weakly dependent on the assumed fiducial cosmology. The only assumption adopted is isotropy in the computation of the correlation function, further ensuring that the result depends only weakly on specific cosmological-model hypotheses. We also investigate possible systematics that could affect the detection or significance of the BAO signal and find them to be subdominant or implausible. When combined with other transverse BAO measurements from the literature, our result shows good concordance-within the $1\sigma$ confidence level-with the cosmological parameter values reported by the Planck and DESI collaborations. This new measurement of the transverse BAO scale, obtained from the SDSS quasar sample with minimal cosmological-model assumptions, provides an additional independent constraint for updated statistical studies aimed at probing the nature of dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glycolaldehyde and ethanol toward the L1157 outflow: resolved images and constraints on glycolaldehyde formation</a><span class="id">[2510.15657]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Two main formation routes have been proposed for interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs): on dust grain surfaces and in the gas phase. Observing such molecules in protostellar outflow shock regions - provided that their ages are well-constrained - can help distinguish between these pathways by probing chemical evolution over time. This study focuses on the potential daughter-mother relationship of glycolaldehyde (CH$_2$OHCHO) and ethanol (C$_2$H$_5$OH), previously proposed in the literature. We test whether gas-phase reactions converting ethanol into glycolaldehyde derived in these works can explain the observed abundance of the latter in star-forming regions. We target the southern outflow of L1157, which hosts three shock regions, B0, B1 and B2, of increasing ages: about 900, 1500 and 2300 yr. We obtained high-resolution IRAM NOEMA maps of three lines of glycolaldehyde and one line of ethanol. We derived their abundances in the three shocks and used a pseudo time-dependent astrochemical model to simulate gas-phase and grain-surface formation scenarios for glycolaldehyde. Ethanol is assumed to form on grains and be released in the gas by shocks, where it is gradually converted into glycolaldehyde via the ethanol-tree reaction network. We present the first spatially resolved maps of glycolaldehyde and ethanol in the L1157 southern outflow, and more generally toward solar-like star forming regions. The abundance ratio [CH$_2$OHCHO]/[C$_2$H$_5$OH] increases from B1 to B2, consistent with model predictions. However, the model cannot reproduce all three shocked regions simultaneously, suggesting that one of the assumptions of our model, such as the same excitation temperature and grain composition in B0, B1 and B2, or gas temperature evolution, is wrong. Nonetheless, our modeling rules out the possibility that all the observed gaseous glycolaldehyde is a grain-surface product.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15661" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Born to be recycled: a comprehensive population synthesis of the Galactic millisecond pulsars</a><span class="id">[2510.15661]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are the oldest but fastest pulsars known to date. To explain how these pulsars could be formed, a new hypothesis was formulated: the recycling of pulsars, i.e the fact that a pulsar could accrete matter from a companion and been spun up. In this paper, we developed a population synthesis algorithm for pulsars which belong to a binary, in order to check whether most of the observed recycled pulsars were formed via an accretion mechanism and derive statistics about their properties, that are difficult to obtain through observations. We also make predictions for future surveys. Toward the presented objectives, we use the code Stellar EVolution for N-body (SEVN) to take into account all the binary processes and our own code to evolve each pulsar self-consistently by taking into account the secular evolution of a force-free magnetosphere, the magnetic field decay, gravitational braking and spatial evolution. Each pulsar is born in binary with a main sequence companion, and evolve to present time. The radio and $\gamma$-ray emission locations were modeled by the polar cap geometry and striped wind model, respectively. Our simulations seem to reproduce well the population of radio and $\gamma$-ray pulsars observed in the selected surveys. We also found that there should be less than $330$ unidentified pulsars in the Fourth Fermi-LAT catalogue of $\gamma$-ray sources (4FGL). High values of the viewing angle $\zeta$ seem to be needed to be able to observe the recycled pulsars, and it also seems difficult to observe recycled pulsars with an aligned rotation axis and magnetic axis (i.e., $\chi \leq 10$°). We find that only a small fraction, approximately $\sim 7.5\times10^{-3}$ %, of oxygen-neon white dwarfs (ONeWDs) in binary systems appear to contribute to the population of mildly recycled pulsars through accretion-induced collapse.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rare Find: Discovery and chemo-dynamical properties of two s-process enhanced RR Lyrae stars</a><span class="id">[2510.15723]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the serendipitous discovery of two RR Lyrae stars exhibiting significant s-process element enrichment, a rare class previously represented solely by TY Gruis. Our goal is to characterise these objects chemically and dynamically, exploring their origins and evolutionary histories. Using high-resolution spectroscopy from HERMES@AAT and UVES@VLT, we derived detailed chemical abundances of key s-process elements, carbon along with $\alpha$-elements. We also employed Gaia DR3 astrometric data to analyse their kinematics, orbital properties, and classify their Galactic population membership. We compared observational results with theoretical asymptotic giant branch nucleosynthesis models to interpret their enrichment patterns. Both stars exhibit clear signatures of s-process enrichment, with significant overabundances in second-peak elements such as Ba and La compared to first-peak Y and Zr. Comparison with AGB nucleosynthesis models suggests their progenitors experienced pollution of s-process-rich material, consistent with early binary interactions. However, notable discrepancies in dilution factors highlight the need for more refined low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models. We also explore and discuss alternative scenarios, including sub-luminous post-AGB-like evolution or double episodes of mass this http URL findings confirm the existence of s-process-enhanced RR Lyrae stars and demonstrate the importance of combining chemical and dynamical diagnostics to unveil their complex evolutionary pathways.

For this purpose, we perform the first implementation of such a late-time neutrino decay scenario within a linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver, and compute the C$\nu$B angular power spectra from the Boltzmann hierarchy solutions for a range of lifetimes and decay channels. We find that neutrino decays leave very strong signatures on the C$\nu$B angular spectra, about two orders of magnitude larger than on the CMB angular spectra, particularly for lifetimes comparable to the age of the Universe.

We combined high-contrast imaging data of the reflected light from 0.55 to 2.2 $\mu m$ using the $V$, $I'$, $J$, and $Ks$ band data of ZIMPOL and IRDIS at VLT/SPHERE. For each observational epoch, we corrected for the smearing effect to derive the intrinsic disk-integrated polarized flux. We derived a steady increase with wavelengths from $\hat{Q}_{\varphi}/I_{\star}(V)=0.3\%$ to $\hat{Q}_{\varphi}/I_{\star}(K)=1.2\%$. We applied reference differential imaging to extract the disk intensity for the $V$ and $Ks$ bands using star hopping observations. We obtained the first $V$-band total intensity for HD 100453 with ZIMPOL star hopping. The integrated total flux $I_{\rm disk}/I_{\star}(V)=1.5\%$ increases to $I_{\rm disk}/I_{\star}(K)=4.8\%$. Both the total intensity and the polarization fraction show red colors, and the intrinsic maximum degree of polarization increases moderately from $40\%$ to $55\%$. We then used RADMC-3D radiative transfer modeling with a parametrized Henyey-Greenstein phase function to constrain the dust properties. From the $V$ to $Ks$ band, the dominating dust in the outer disk has an increasing scattering albedo and degree of polarization, while the asymmetry parameter slightly decreases. The outer disk of HD 100453 contains sub-micron-sized low porosity grains/aggregates. The cavity in scattered light is not empty and is replenished with optically thin dust with a maximum size of $\leq 0.1\mu m$.

In this context, it is interesting to investigate constraints on neutrino masses, dark energy and the Hubble parameter that are agnostic to some aspects of the cosmological model. Here we choose to be agnostic to the value of the sound horizon at recombination, while sticking to standard assumptions regarding the time of recombination and the growth of structures. To be consistent, we also disregard information on the full shape of the CMB temperature and polarization spectrum on sub-degree scale. With such agnostic and conservative assumptions, we find that: (i) the dark energy evolution is well constrained by uncalibrated data on angular and luminosity distances, with a mild preference for dynamical dark energy, independently of the value of the sound horizon; (ii) large values of the Hubble rate are favored, $H_0=76.0^{+4.5}_{-4.3}$ km/s/Mpc (68\%CL), together with low values of the sound horizon, $r_{\rm s}=129.2^{+6.7}_{-8.1}$ Mpc (68\%CL); the SH0ES value of $H_0$ is thus marginally preferred over the low value returned by the standard inverse distance ladder analysis; (iii) the cosmological neutrino mass bound relaxes to $\sum m_\nu &lt;1.6$ eV (95\%CL) and becomes well compatible with the normal and inverted neutrino mass schemes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15836" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Localization to Discovery: Bayesian Ranking of Electromagnetic Counterparts to Gravitational-Wave Events</a><span class="id">[2510.15836]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The robust association of electromagnetic candidates discovered during follow-up of gravitational-wave alerts is challenging, not only due to the large sky areas and broad distance uncertainties, but also due to the tens to hundreds of unrelated optical transients that are observed per event.

The inflaton self-interactions are found to be of higher order in the Hubble expansion rate during inflation, and hence unimportant for CMB observations. In contrast, matter couplings to the Starobinsky inflaton can have significant effects on the spectral index of scalar CMB perturbations, $n_s$, and on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. Using a renormalization-group improved analysis of the effective inflationary potential, we find that the Planck measurement of $n_s$ constrains the inflaton coupling to light fermions in the Einstein frame: $y &lt; 4.5 \times 10^{-4}$, corresponding to an upper limit on the reheating temperature $T_{\rm RH} &lt; 2 \times 10^{11}~{\rm GeV}$, whereas the ACT DR6 measurement of $n_s$ corresponds to $3.8 \times 10^{-4} &lt; y &lt; 5.6 \times 10^{-4}$ and $1.7 \times 10^{11} ~{\rm GeV} &lt; T_{\rm RH} &lt; 2.8 \times 10^{11}~{\rm GeV}$, while the upper limits on $r$ provide weaker constraints.

These results are robust to HI foreground removal because they derive from small-scale HI modes. The HI-CMB lensing cross-bispectrum thus provides a novel way to recover HI correlations with CMB lensing and constrain cosmological parameters at a level that is competitive with next-generation galaxy redshift surveys. As a striking example of this, we find a tight constraint of 12.1 meV (15.8 meV) on the sum of neutrino masses, while varying all redshift and standard cosmological parameters within a flat $\Lambda$CDM ($w_0w_a$CDM) model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the sign-changeable interaction between dark energy and dark matter with DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data</a><span class="id">[2501.07361]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There is a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and this interaction may also undergo a sign change during the evolution of the universe. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain models of a sign-changeable interaction. The data we employ, in addition to the cosmic microwave background data, also encompass the first-year baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI and the type Ia supernova data of the full 5-year observation from DES. To achieve high generality, we investigate four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$: (i) IDE1 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm de}$; (ii) IDE2 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm c}$; (iii) IDE3 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm de}$; (iv) IDE4 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm c}$. From the analysis, we observe that $\beta(z) &gt; 0$ at early times and $\beta(z) &lt; 0$ at late times, with the coupling $\beta(z)$ crossing the non-interacting line $\beta(z) = 0$ during cosmic evolution at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level for the IDE1, IDE3, and IDE4 models. However, for the IDE2 model, $\beta(z)$ remains consistently negative and does not cross $\beta(z) = 0$ at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level. Our findings indicate that the energy transfer is from dark matter to dark energy when dark matter dominates the universe, and from dark energy to dark matter when dark energy dominates, for the IDE1 and IDE3 models. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the IDE1 and IDE3 models are moderately preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. The overall outcomes of this study clearly indicate that, based on current observational data, the sign-changeable IDE models are quite compelling and merit further attention.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning Identification of Gravitationally Microlensed Gamma-Ray Bursts</a><span class="id">[2504.19958]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational microlensing of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provides a unique opportunity to probe compact dark matter and small-scale structures in the Universe.

A comprehensive data set is generated, comprising labeled light curves for both categories. Features are extracted using the Cesium package, capturing critical temporal properties of the light curves. Multiple ML models are trained on the extracted features, with Random Forest achieving the best performance, delivering an accuracy of 86% and an F1 score of 0.86 (0.87) for the nonlensed (lensed) class.

JWST observations provide unprecedented MIR spectroscopy of SN Iax, spanning from $+$11 to $+$42 days past maximum light. We detect forbidden emission lines in the MIR at these early times while the optical and NIR are dominated by permitted lines with an absorption component. Panchromatic spectra at early times can thus simultaneously show nebular and photospheric lines, probing both inner and outer layers of the ejecta. We identify spectral lines not seen before in SN Iax, including [Mg II] 4.76 $\mu$m, [Mg II] 9.71 $\mu$m, [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m, and isolated O I 2.76 $\mu$m that traces unburned material. Forbidden emission lines of all species are centrally peaked with similar kinematic distributions, indicating that the ejecta are well mixed in both SN 2024pxl and SN 2024vjm, a hallmark of pure deflagration explosion models. Radiative transfer modeling of SN 2024pxl shows good agreement with a weak deflagration of a near-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, but additional IR flux is needed to match the observations, potentially attributable to a surviving remnant. Similarly, we find SN 2024vjm is also best explained by a weak deflagration model, despite the large difference in luminosity between the two supernovae. Future modeling should push to even weaker explosions and include the contribution of a bound remnant. Our observations demonstrate the diagnostic power of panchromatic spectroscopy for unveiling explosion physics in thermonuclear supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04537" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational waves from low-scale cosmic strings without scaling</a><span class="id">[2505.04537]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic strings are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model and constitute a plausible source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe.

In this paper, we study the effect of particle decay due to kink-kink collisions and cusps on the GW spectrum in the nonscaling scenario introduced in Ref. arXiv:1911.12066 . We find analytical conditions for the existence of a cutoff frequency in the fundamental spectrum and provide expressions for this frequency. In large regions of parameter space, our results in the nonscaling model turn out to be identical to those in the scaling model. Finally, we demonstrate how the spectrum changes when transitioning from the regime with a cutoff frequency to the regime without a cutoff frequency. Our analytical estimates are validated at qualitatively different benchmark points by comparing them with numerical spectra.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00623" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spins of Black Holes in X-ray Binaries and the Tension with the Gravitational Wave Measurements</a><span class="id">[2506.00623]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We review current challenges in understanding the values and origin of the spins of black holes in binaries. Thanks to recent advances in astrophysical instrumentation, the spins can now be measured using both gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes and electromagnetic radiation from accreting X-ray binaries containing black holes. A key finding of the gravitational-wave observatories is that premerger black holes in binaries have low spin values, with an average dimensionless spin parameter of $a_*\sim$0.1–0.2, with 90\% having $a_*\lesssim 0.6$. This implies that the natal spins of black holes are generally low, and the angular momentum transport in massive stars is efficient. On the other hand, most of the published spins in X-ray binaries are very high. In particular, this is the case for binaries with high-mass donors (potential progenitors of mergers), where their published spins range from 0.8 to 1.0. At the same time, their short lifetimes prevent significant spin-up by accretion. Those with low-mass donors could be spun-up to $a_*\gtrsim 0.7$ by accretion only if the donor initial masses were more than several solar masses, which remains unproven. However, the existing methods of spin measurements suffer from significant systematic errors. The method relying on relativistic X-ray line broadening is based on the separation of the observed spectra into incident and reflected ones, which is highly uncertain. The method relying on spectral fitting of accretion disk continua uses models that predict the disk to be highly unstable, while stability is observed. Improved stable models predict lower spins. The published spin measurements in X-ray binaries are uncertain. The spins of the binaries with high-mass donors may be low, while those with low-mass donors have a broader spin distribution, ranging from low to high.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surrogate models for lightcurves and photosphere properties of Type II supernovae</a><span class="id">[2506.02107]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inferences on the properties Type II supernovae (SNe) can provide significant insights into the lives and deaths of the astrophysical population of massive stars and potentially provide measurements of luminosity distance, independent of the distance ladder. Here, we introduce surrogate models for the photospheric properties and lightcurves of Type II SNe trained on a large grid of simulations from the radiation hydrodynamics code, {\sc stella}. The trained model can accurately and efficiently ($\sim 30$ms) predict the lightcurves and properties of Type II SNe within a large parameter space of progenitor ($10-18 M_{\odot}$ at ZAMS) and nickel masses ($0.001-0.3M_{\odot}$), progenitor mass-loss rate ($10^{-5}-10^{-1}~M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), CSM radius ($1-10\times10^{14}$cm), and SN explosion energies ($0.5-5 \times 10^{51}$erg). We validate this model through inference on lightcurves and photosphere properties drawn directly from the original {\sc stella} simulations not included in training. In particular, for a synthetic Type II SNe observed within the 10-year LSST survey, we find we can measure the progenitor and nickel masses with $\approx 9\%$ and $\approx 25\%$ precision, respectively, when fitting the photometric data while accounting for the uncertainty in the surrogate model itself. Meanwhile, from real observations of SN 2004et, SN 2012aw, and SN 2017gmr we infer a progenitor ZAMS mass of $12.15_{-1.06}^{+1.03} M_{\odot}$, $10.61_{-0.32}^{+0.37} M_{\odot}$, $10.4 \pm 0.3 M_{\odot}$, respectively. We discuss systematic uncertainties from our surrogate modelling approach and likelihood approaches to account for these uncertainties. We further discuss future extensions to the model to enable stronger constraints on properties of Type II SNe and their progenitors, and applications of our surrogate modelling approach to other transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing Dark Matter's Role in Neutron Stars Anisotropy: A Bayesian Approach Using Multi-messenger Observations</a><span class="id">[2506.08376]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter (DM) continues to evade direct detection, but neutron stars (NSs) serve as natural laboratories where even a modest DM component can alter their structure. While many studies have examined DM effects on NSs, they often rely on specific choices of equations of state (EOS) models, assume isotropy, and lack a Bayesian statistical framework, limiting their predictive power. In this work, we present a Bayesian framework that couples pressure-anisotropic nuclear EOS to a self-interacting fermionic DM component, constrained by NICER and GW170817 data. Our results show that DM mass fractions up to $\sim10\%$ remain consistent with current data, which softens the high-density EOS, leading to reduced stellar radii and tidal deformabilities while requiring negligible pressure anisotropy. Bayesian model comparison reveals no statistically significant preference between pure baryonic and DM-admixed NSs, indicating that DM inclusion enhances physical realism without complexity penalties. However, existing data cannot tightly constrain the DM parameters, and our empirical radius definition introduces a systematic bias toward the DM core configurations. To address this, we therefore introduce the DM radius span $\Delta R_\chi \equiv R_{\chi,\mathrm{max}} - R_{\chi,\mathrm{min}}$ as a unified diagnostic for DM distributions. This parameter simultaneously characterizes core-halo transition features while exhibiting strong linear correlations ($\Delta R_\chi &lt; 4\,\mathrm{km}$) with both DM and BM parameters, providing a clear avenue for future constraints. Our approach bridges current limitations and future potential in probing DM through compact star observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimizing Gaussian Process Kernels Using Nested Sampling and ABC Rejection for H(z) Reconstruction</a><span class="id">[2506.21238]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent cosmological observations have achieved high-precision measurements of the Universe's expansion history, prompting the use of nonparametric methods such as Gaussian processes (GP) regression.

By comparing reconstructions in redshift space $z$ and transformed space $\log(z+1)$ , we evaluate six kernel functions using nested sampling (NS) and approximate Bayesian computation rejection (ABC rejection) methods and analyze the construction of Hubble constant $H_0$ in different models. Our analysis demonstrates that reconstructions in $\log(z+1)$ space remain physically reasonable, offering a viable alternative to conventional $z$ space approaches, while the introduction of nondiagonal covariance matrices leads to degraded reconstruction quality, suggesting that simplified diagonal forms may be preferable for reconstruction. These findings underscore the importance of task-specific kernel selection in GP-based cosmological inference. In particular, our findings suggest that careful preliminary screening of kernel functions, based on the physical quantities of interest, is essential for reliable inference in cosmological research using GP.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00237" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signals of Bursts from the Very Early Universe</a><span class="id">[2509.00237]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider possible observable signals from explosive events in the very early universe, “bursts&quot;.

These are vast regions of the observable universe, typically spanning scales of several hundred Mpc, that move coherently with speeds of the order of several hundred km/sec. While there is a general consensus on the direction of these motions, discrepancies persist in their reported sizes and velocities, with some of them exceeding the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The observed large-scale peculiar-velocity fields are believed to have originated as weak peculiar-velocity perturbations soon after equipartition, which have subsequently grown by structure formation and by the increasing inhomogeneity of the post-recombination universe. However, the evolution and the implications of these bulk velocity fields remain poorly understood and they are still a matter of debate. For instance, it remains a challenge for the theoreticians to explain the high velocities measured by several bulk-flow surveys, like those recently reported using the CosmicFlows-4 data. Such extensive and fast velocity fields could have played a non-negligible role during structure formation and they might have also “contaminated” our observations.

Zolenskyite was structurally indexed as the monoclinic C2/m CrNb2Se4 - Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 12.84(1) Å, b = 3.44(1) Å, c = 5.94(1) Å and \b{eta} = 117(1)°. Zolenskyite was reported as high-pressure phase formed from Daubréelite at high pressures and temperatures in highly shocked regions of the EH parent asteroid. Although this discovery provides valuable information about the origin of meteoritic mineral assemblages, the results and conclusions raise controversies with those reported in previous articles where the synthetic FeCr2S4 was described. In this review, an alternative analysis of the supplementary X-ray data from Zolenskyite was made and yields to the monoclinic I2/m Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 5.940 Å, b = 3.440 Å, c = 11.441 Å and \b{eta} = 90.55°, in agreement with previous results in the literature and differ from those reported above. Regarding the genesis of Zolenskyite and according to solid-state laboratory synthesis, the transformation of cubic FeCr2S4 phase (ideal composition of Daubréelite) to monoclinic FeCr2S4 (ideal composition of Zolenskyite) requires a process whose replication in Shock metamorphism stages is not well established and remains an open issue to address, together with another open issue related to the real composition of meteoritic minerals, with minor and trace metals, which is often overlooked when compared with synthetic ideal compositions. Whatever the results to be obtained by addressing the above open issues, they will shed more light on the genesis of Zolenskyite. In this context, it is worth to promote an open debate about the hypothesis of artificial origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing evolution of Dark Energy density from observations</a><span class="id">[2510.12881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a model–independent reconstruction of the normalized dark energy density function, $X(z) \equiv \rho_{\mathrm{de}}(z)/\rho_{\mathrm{de}}(0)$, derived directly from the DES-SN5YR Type Ia supernova sample. The analysis employs an inversion formalism that relates the derivative of the distance modulus, $\mu^{\prime}(z)$, to the expansion history, allowing the data to determine the shape of $X(z)$ without assuming a specific equation–of–state or dark energy density parameterization. A statistically optimized binning of the supernova sample (using 17 intervals following the Freedman–Diaconis criterion and 34 following Scott's rule) ensures a stable estimation of $\mu^{\prime}(z)$ and a controlled propagation of uncertainties throughout the inversion process. The resulting $X(z)$ remains statistically consistent with a constant value within one standard deviation across the entire redshift range, showing no significant evidence for an evolving dark energy component at present. In a direct comparison among $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and the quadratic $X^2(z)$ parameterization – where CPL and $X^2(z)$ each introduce two additional free parameters relative to $\Lambda$CDM – the CPL model attains the best statistical agreement with the data, albeit only marginally and strictly within this restricted model set. These outcomes indicate that current observations are compatible with an almost constant dark energy density ($w \simeq -1$), while the inversion framework remains sensitive to subtle departures that forthcoming high–precision surveys could resolve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for GeV Gamma-Ray Polarization and Axion-Like Particles with AMS-02</a><span class="id">[2411.10531]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the detectability of GeV-band gamma-ray polarization with the AMS-02 experiment and its proposed successor AMS-100, from Galactic and extragalactic sources. Characterizing gamma-ray polarization in this energy range could shed light on gamma-ray emission mechanisms in the sources; physics beyond the Standard Model, such as the presence of axion-like particles (ALPs), could also induce a distinctive energy-dependent polarization signal due to propagation effects in magnetic fields. We present estimates for the minimum detectable polarization from bright sources and the forecast reach for axion-like particles (ALPs). We show that AMS-02 will have sensitivity to gamma-ray polarization only for the brightest steady-state Galactic sources, such as the Vela and Geminga pulsars; it is not expected to be capable of detecting polarization in Galactic or extragalactic sources that have been previously proposed as good targets for ALP searches with gamma-ray intensity measurements. However, AMS-100 observing the extragalactic source NGC1275 would be expected to probe new parameter space even for unfavorable B-field models, with prospects to measure the energy-dependence of such a signal. For Galactic sources, polarization measurements could provide a unique test of scenarios where ALPs induce energy-dependent features in the photon intensity. However, in the absence of a bright transient source (such as a Galactic supernova), the parameter space that would be probed by this approach with ten years of AMS-100 data is already nominally excluded by other experiments, although this conflict may be avoided in specific ALP models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slowly rotating covariant anisotropic objects</a><span class="id">[2505.00139]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The equilibrium configurations of slowly rotating anisotropic self-gravitating fluids are computed using the extended Hartle structure equations, including anisotropic effects, derived in our previous paper.

Feebly interacting massive particles (FIMPs) are alternatives to WIMPs. This paper shows that a small memory burden is preferable if the thermal production of WIMPs or FIMPs is much larger than the effect of PBH particle production via Hawking radiation.

These include five linear IDE models, namely $Q=3H(\delta_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm dm} + \delta_{\rm de} \rho_{\rm de})$ and four special cases: $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}-\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm dm}$, and $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm de}$, together with three non-linear IDE models: $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm de}}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, and $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$. For these eight models, we present conditions to avoid imaginary, undefined, and negative energy densities. In seven of the eight cases, negative densities arise if energy flows from DM to DE, implying a strong theoretical preference for energy transfer from DE to DM. We also provide conditions to avoid future big rip singularities and evaluate how each model addresses the coincidence problem in both the past and the future. Finally, we propose a set of approaches and simplifying assumptions that can be used when constraining IDE models, by defining regimes that restrict the parameter space according to the behavior researchers are willing to tolerate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toward a unified view of agnostic parametrizations for deformed black holes</a><span class="id">[2510.14707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A variety of robust and effective descriptions have been devised to extract model-independent information about the fundamental properties of black holes from observational data when searching for deviations from general relativity. In this work, we construct explicit transformation maps establishing the equivalence among three relevant parametrizations for different spacetime patches: Johannsen-Psaltis, Rezzolla-Zhidenko, and Effective Metric Description. We then select representative black hole geometries to determine the minimal number of parameters required within each scheme to reproduce the associated quasi-normal mode spectra with a prescribed degree of accuracy. Our analysis shows that, for the given observables, a finite set of coefficients suffices to attain the desired precision in the three frameworks. Finally, we emphasize how the individual strengths of these effective descriptions can be exploited to probe complementary aspects of black hole physics.</p></div></details></article></body>
