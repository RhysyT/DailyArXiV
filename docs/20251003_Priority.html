Although the class is rather unified from an optical perspective, their radio characteristics are diverse. One of the biggest curiosities found in these sources is their ability to form and maintain powerful relativistic jets. We studied the radio properties of a sample of 3998 NLS1 galaxies which is the largest clean sample available, thus allowing us to study the population-wide characteristics. We used both historical and ongoing surveys: the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS; 144 MHz), the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST; 1.4 GHz), the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS; 1.4 GHz), and the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS; 3 GHz). We were able to obtain a radio detection for $\sim40\%$ of our sources, with the most detections by LoTSS. The majority of the detected NLS1 galaxies are faint ($\sim1-2$ mJy) and non-variable, suggesting considerable contributions from star formation activities, especially at 144 MHz. However, we identified samples of extreme sources, for example, in fractional variability and radio luminosity, indicating significant AGN activity. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the NLS1 galaxy population in radio and lays the foundation for targeted future studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Observations of Starbursts: PAHs Closely Trace the Cool Phase of M82's Galactic Wind</a><span class="id">[2510.01314]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar feedback drives multiphase gas outflows from starburst galaxies, but the interpretation of dust emission in these winds remains uncertain. To investigate this, we analyze new JWST mid-infrared images tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 7.7 and 11.3 $\mu$m from the outflow of the prototypical starburst M82 out to $3.2$ kpc. We find that PAH emission shows significant correlations with CO, H$\alpha$, and X-ray emission within the outflow, though the strengths and behaviors of these correlations vary with gas phase and distance from the starburst. PAH emission correlates strongly with cold molecular gas, with PAH–CO scaling relations in the wind nearly identical to those in galaxy disks despite the very different conditions. The H$\alpha$–PAH correlation indicates that H$\alpha$ traces the surfaces of PAH-bearing clouds, consistent with arising from ionized layers produced by shocks. Meanwhile the PAH–X-ray correlation disappears once distance effects are controlled for past 2 kpc, suggesting that PAHs are decoupled from the hot gas and the global correlation merely reflects the large-scale structure of the outflow. The PAH-to-neutral gas ratio remains nearly flat to 2 kpc, with variations following changes in the radiation field. This implies that the product of PAH abundance and dust-to-gas ratio does not change significantly over the inner portion of the outflow. Together, these results demonstrate that PAHs robustly trace the cold phase of M82's wind, surviving well beyond the starburst and providing a powerful, high-resolution proxy for mapping the life cycle of entrained cold material in galactic outflows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutral hydrogen in and around galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization</a><span class="id">[2510.01315]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST spectra revealing Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) absorption in $z\sim 5-14$ galaxies offer a unique probe of reionization's earliest stages. However, disentangling absorption by the increasingly neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) from that in galaxies' interstellar and circumgalactic medium (ISM, CGM) remains challenging due to the poorly constrained nature of neutral hydrogen (HI) in and around galaxies at these redshifts. We use the SERRA high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to characterize the HI distribution and its evolution along sightlines to star-forming regions during reionization, to interpret the contribution of local HI (ISM+CGM) to Ly$\alpha$ absorption in $z&gt;5$ spectra. We analyze $\sim 100$ $z=6-9.5$ galaxies, generating mock sightlines from each galaxy's star formation peak. We study the sightline distribution of HI column densities ($N_{\rm HI}$) and its variation with radius, halo mass and redshift. We find broad sightline variation in $N_{\rm HI}$ (0.5-1.5dex) due to complex ISM morphology driven by bursty star formation, with median $\log(N_{\rm HI}/{\rm cm}^{-2}) \simeq 21-22$. Dense ISM gas is the dominant origin of damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption (DLA) systems along sightlines towards star-forming regions, outweighing gas in the CGM, filaments and proximate absorbers. Median $N_{\rm HI}$ increases with halo mass, scaling roughly with the virial radius, as expected due to larger potentials and more extended CGM, but shows negligible redshift evolution at fixed halo mass. This suggests post-reionization $N_{\rm HI}$ distributions may provide useful priors to interpret IGM damping wings at higher redshifts. To interpret strong $z&gt;5$ DLA candidates found by JWST, we investigate $N_{\rm HI}&gt;10^{22}{\rm cm}^{-2}$ sightlines. These trace dense, metal-enriched ISM within &lt;1 kpc of massive halos, a scenario testable with higher-resolution spectroscopy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planes of satellites, at once transient and persistent</a><span class="id">[2510.01318]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The appearance of highly anisotropic planes of satellites around the Milky Way and other galaxies was long considered a challenge to the standard cosmological model. Recent simulations have shown such planes to be common, but they have been described as either &quot;transient&quot;, short-lived alignments, or &quot;persistent&quot;, long-lived structures. Here we analyse Milky Way analogue systems in the cosmological simulation TNG-50 to resolve this apparent contradiction. We show that, as the satellite populations of individual hosts rapidly change, the observed anisotropies of their satellite systems are invariably short-lived, with lifetimes of no more than a few hundred million years. However, when the progenitors of the same satellites are traced backwards, we find examples where those identified to form a plane at the present day have retained spatial coherence over several Gyr. The two ostensibly conflicting predictions for the lifetimes of satellite planes can be reconciled as two perspectives on the same phenomenon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Spatially Resolved Hot Gas Properties of NGC 1266's AGN-Driven Outflow</a><span class="id">[2510.01321]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galactic winds play a critical role in galaxy evolution, yet their structure and driving mechanisms remain poorly understood, especially in low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) systems. NGC 1266 hosts one such LLAGN, embedded in a massive molecular gas reservoir that is not forming stars, likely due to AGN feedback. We analyze deep archival \textit{Chandra} data to constrain the properties of its hot gas and compare them to other wind systems. We find temperatures of $0.24$–$1.85$ keV and notably high electron densities of $0.33$–$4.2$ cm$^{-3}$, suggesting significant mass loading, further supported by charge exchange emission in the southern lobe, one of the few AGN systems where it has been detected. We measure pressures and thermal energies of $10^6$–$10^8$ K cm$^{-3}$ and $10^{54}$–$10^{56}$ erg, exceeding the minimum energy needed for the radio jet to power the outflow and implying the hot phase comprises a large fraction of the energy budget. Archival MUSE data reveal a cavity-like feature in the southern outflow, potentially associated with the far side of the outflow cone. At the maximum outflow extent, the warm and hot phases appear to be in pressure equilibrium. Coupled with short cooling timescales of $\sim$1 Myr, comparable to the advection time, this suggests the outflow is undergoing radiative cooling and may have stalled. Finally, we compare NGC 1266 to other local AGN and starburst galaxies, finding NGC 1266 to be the densest wind in the sample.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heavy seeds and the first black holes: Insights from the BRAHMA simulations</a><span class="id">[2510.01322]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>From the luminous quasars at $z \sim 6$ to the recent $z \sim 9-11$ AGNs revealed by JWST, observations of the earliest black hole (BH) populations can provide unique constraints on BH formation and growth models. We use the BRAHMA simulations with constrained initial conditions to investigate BH assembly in extreme overdense regions. The simulations implement heavy seeds ($\sim 10^4-10^5 M_{\odot})$ forming in dense, metal-poor gas exposed to sufficient Lyman-Werner flux. With gas accretion modeled via Bondi-Hoyle formalism and BH dynamics and mergers using a subgrid dynamical friction scheme, we isolate the impact of seeding, dynamics, accretion, and feedback on early BH growth. With fiducial stellar and AGN feedback inherited from IllustrisTNG, accretion is strongly suppressed at $z \gtrsim 9$, leaving mergers as the dominant growth channel. Gas accretion dominates at $z \lesssim 9$, where permissive models (super-Eddington or low radiative efficiency) build $\sim 10^9\ M_{\odot}$ BHs powering quasars by $z \sim 6$, while stricter IllustrisTNG-based prescriptions yield much lower BH masses ($\sim 10^6-10^8\ M_{\odot}$). Our seed models strongly affect merger-driven growth at $z \gtrsim 9$: only the most lenient models (with $\sim 10^5\ M_{\odot}$ seeds) produce enough BH mergers to reach $\gtrsim 10^6\ M_{\odot}$ by $z \sim 10$, consistent with current estimates for GN-z11. Our dynamical friction model gives low merger efficiencies, hindering the buildup of $\gtrsim 10^7\ M_{\odot}$ BHs by $z \sim 9-10$, as currently inferred for GHZ9, UHZ1, and CAPERS-LRD-z9. If the BH-to-stellar mass ratios of these sources are indeed as extreme as currently inferred, they would require either very short BH merger timescales or reduced AGN thermal feedback. Weaker stellar feedback boosts both star formation and BH accretion and cannot raise these ratios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiphase gas offsets in the atmospheres of central galaxies and their consequences for SMBH activation I. The hot and warm ionized gas phases</a><span class="id">[2510.01323]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the spatial relationships between multi-phase gas components and supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity in a sample of 25 cool core galaxy groups and clusters. Using high angular resolution observations from \textit{Chandra}, VLT/MUSE, and VLBA, we robustly locate the position, respectively, of the X-ray peak of the intracluster medium (ICM), of the H$\alpha$ peak of the warm ionized gas, and of the SMBH radio core on parsec scales. We identify spatial offsets between the X-ray peak of the hot gas and the SMBH in 80% of the systems, with an average displacement of $\langle\Delta^{\text{SMBH}}_{\text{X-ray}}\rangle = 4.8$ kpc (dispersion of $3.8$ kpc). In contrast, the peak of warm ionized gas traced by H$\alpha$ exhibits much smaller offsets ($\langle\Delta^{\text{SMBH}}_{\text{H}\alpha}\rangle = 0.6$ kpc; dispersion of $1.4$ kpc) and a lower incidence of displacement (15%). Our findings suggest that hot gas sloshing primarily drives the observed spatial offsets, with AGN-driven uplift contributing in some this http URL , systems with H$\alpha$ - SMBH offsets of $\geq$1 kpc uniformly lack detectable radio cores on VLBA scales, with upper limits on the 5 GHz power of $P_{5\,\text{GHz}} \leq 10^{21-22}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, while those without such offsets exhibit radio powerful AGN with pc-scale radio emission up to $P_{5\,\text{GHz}} \sim 10^{24-25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. This correlation indicates that centrally concentrated warm gas is critical for sustaining radio-loud SMBH activity, possibly supporting scenarios of cold-mode accretion. Overall, our results highlight the importance of high-angular-resolution, multi-wavelength observations for understanding the interplay between multiphase gas cooling and AGN fueling in central galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lessons Learned from Studying H$α$ Galaxy Kinematics with Mock JWST/NIRSpec IFU Observations at $z &gt; 6$</a><span class="id">[2510.01327]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxies with a disk morphology have been established at $z &gt; 9$ with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). However, confirming their disky nature requires studying their gas kinematics, which can be challenging when relying solely on the warm gas observed by JWST. Unlike the cold gas traced by the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA), warm gas is sensitive to outflows, complicating the interpretation of the disk dynamics. This elicits the question of how to compare information obtained from varied tracers, as well as how to physically interpret the low angular and spectral resolution observations generally available at high redshift. We address these challenges through comparative kinematic analysis of idealised and realistic NIRSpec/IFU mock observations derived from two galaxies in the SERRA suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. With these synthetic data, we determine the robustness of dynamical information recovered from typical IFU observations, and test widely-used criteria for identifying disks and gaseous outflows at high redshift. We find that at the typical NIRSpec/IFU spectral and angular resolution ($\sim$ 0.05&quot;/pixel), non-circular motions due to inflows or outflows can mimic the smooth velocity gradient indicative of a disk, and bias measured velocity dispersion upwards by a factor of $2-3\times$. As a result, the level of rotational support may be underestimated in the NIRSpec/IFU observations. However, the recovered dynamical mass appears to be relatively robust despite biases in $v_\text{rot}$ and $\sigma$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01373" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of OH maser emission in the 71-year periodic comet 12P/Pons-Brooks using the 40-m Thai National Radio Telescope (TNRT)</a><span class="id">[2510.01373]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although the optical cometary database is extensive, the radio database is limited. The 18-cm OH maser observations of comets allow us to determine (i) the production rate of OH ($Q_{\rm{OH}}$) and (ii) the water expansion velocity, for each comet. To reveal the physical properties of the periodic comet 12P/Pons-Brooks, we conducted the OH maser observations of the comet using the 40-m TNRT (Thai National Radio Telescope) on March 22nd, 27th and 29th, 2024 before the perihelion passage on April 21st, 2024. We successfully detected 1665 and 1667 MHz OH maser emissions from the comet. The average OH production rates of 12P/Pons-Brooks were determined as 4.28$\pm$0.30 $\times$ 10$^{29}$ sec$^{-1}$, 5.21$\pm$0.42 $\times$ 10$^{29}$ sec$^{-1}$, and 3.36$\pm$0.43 $\times$ 10$^{29}$ sec$^{-1}$ for March 22nd, 27th and 29th, respectively. Combining our results with previous estimates, we find that the OH production rate of 12P/Pons-Brooks shows some fluctuations on timescales of a few days, but gradually increases on longer timescales as the comet approaches the last perihelion. The water expansion velocities of the comet were determined to be 1.55$\pm$0.14 km s$^{-1}$, 1.55$\pm$0.35 km s$^{-1}$, and 2.02$^{+0.47}_{-0.45}$ km s$^{-1}$ for the observations on March 22nd, 27th and 29th, respectively. The reason why the errors are different is because the signal to noise ratio is different for each OH maser emission. All expansion velocities are consistent with the individual results of the heuristic law (Tseng et al. 2007) within errors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01403" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Compact Symmetric Object Discovered by the VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment</a><span class="id">[2510.01403]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) imaging of a MHz-peaked spectrum (MPS) source that was found using commensal low-frequency data taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The source, J0330-2730, was identified in multi-epoch data from the VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE). VLITE continuously collects low-frequency data at 340 MHz during regular VLA observations. Our analysis of the VLITE light curve demonstrates that J0330-2730 has significant 340 MHz flux variability at the  20% level over a timescale of approximately one year. Our VLBA images reveal a resolved, double-lobed morphology with a projected linear size of 64 pc. We consider plausible mechanisms that could explain the observed 340 MHz variability and the source properties on milliarcsecond scales. We rule-out variable Doppler boosting and conclude that refractive interstellar scintillation or variable free-free absorption are the most likely explanations. We argue that the properties of J0330-2730 are consistent with the class of compact symmetric objects (CSOs) and consider the evolutionary stage of the source. The extent of the resolved lobes revealed by the VLBA is significantly smaller than predictions based on the turnover-size relation for a standard synchrotron self-absorbed jet model. We discuss possible explanations for the departure from the turnover-size relation, including jet formation by a transient phenomenon such as a tidal disruption event or a &quot;frustrated jet&quot; impeded by the presence of dense gas or a high-pressure environment. This study highlights the potential of VLITE for the identification of compact and young radio sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advancing Interstellar Science: A Global Framework for Comprehensive Study of Interstellar Objects</a><span class="id">[2510.01405]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The operation of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) marks a transformative moment in humanity's capacity to detect and characterize interstellar objects (ISOs). With projections indicating an increase from a few detections per decade to potentially one every few months, humanity stands at the threshold of unprecedented scientific opportunity offering revolutionary insights into the nature of rocky materials, building blocks of life and technological products from other star systems. This white paper proposes the establishment of the United Nations Committee on Interstellar Objects (UNCIO), a specialized body designed to coordinate global scientific research, maximize observational coverage, and ensure optimal scientific return from these extraordinary objects from outside the solar system through systematic investigation in cosmochemistry, astrobiology, planetary sciences, fundamental physics, advanced technologies and materials science. The proposed framework addresses critical gaps in our current international infrastructure: the absence of coordinated detection, classification and intercept capabilities, insufficient protocols for rapid scientific response and international policy decisions to time-sensitive observations, and the need for effective science communication to maintain government and public support for these ambitious investigations and global threats to Earth. Drawing from successful international collaborations in areas such as the International Space Station (ISS) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), UNCIO would operate through a dual structure: an executive board for time-critical scientific decisions and an expanded committee for comprehensive stakeholder representation. This initiative is not merely aspirational but urgently practical.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulating Spectral Confusion in SPHEREx Photometry and Redshifts</a><span class="id">[2510.01410]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We model the impact of source confusion on photometry and the resulting spectrophotometric redshifts for SPHEREx, a NASA Medium-Class Explorer that is carrying out an all-sky near-infrared spectral survey. Spectral confusion from untargeted background galaxies degrades sensitivity and introduces a spectral bias. Using interpolated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the COSMOS2020 catalog, we construct a Monte Carlo library of confusion spectra that captures the cumulative impact from faint galaxies. By injecting confusion realizations into galaxy SEDs and performing forced photometry at known source positions, we quantify photometric and redshift error and bias. For our current expected selection of sources for the cosmology analysis, we find typical 1-$\sigma$ confusion levels range from $0.8-3.8\ \mu\mathrm{Jy}$ across $0.75-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}$. While negligible at full-sky survey depth, spectral confusion becomes significant in the SPHEREx deep fields, reducing the number of intermediate-precision redshifts and inducing a small systematic overestimation in redshift. In parallel, we also model targeted source blending from beam overlaps, which contributes additional photometric noise without systematic redshift bias, provided that positions are known exactly. Together, confusion and blending vary with the depth of the selected reference sample, revealing a trade-off, where deeper selections reduce confusion but increase blending-induced noise. Our methodology informs optimization of the SPHEREx deep-field selection strategy and future treatments of stellar source blending and confusion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ly-alpha emission reveals two satellite halos around massive groups at z   3: the puzzling case of a quiescent central galaxy</a><span class="id">[2510.01421]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the discovery and characterisation of two Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (LANs), RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat, as satellite structures of two giant LANs at $z=2.920$ and 3.092. They are found neighbouring two out of four known giant LANs at $z\sim3$ in our MUSE follow-up observations, reinforcing the idea that Ly$\alpha$ emission can be used to trace massive dark matter halos at high-$z$. This high occurrence of massive satellite halos agrees with simulations. With sizes of $\simeq80\times160$ and $80\times100~\mathrm{pkpc}^2$, the two nebulae are both $\sim$300pkpc from the main LANs. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is only shifted by $\simeq100-300$ km s$^{-1}$ between each of the two pairs, suggesting connections via large-scale structure. RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat are estimated to have log$(M_\mathrm{h}/M_\odot)\simeq13.2\pm0.3$ and $12.8\pm0.3$, putting them potentially close to the regime of cold-mode accretion. The central brightest galaxies in the two halos are morphologically distinct despite having similar stellar mass $\sim10^{11}M_\odot$, one being an elliptical quiescent galaxy in RO-1001-Sat and the other being a dusty star-forming spiral in RO-0959-Sat. Intriguingly, the quiescent galaxy aligns well with the peak of the LAN as well as the potential well of the host halo, making it the first clear-cut case where the cold gas ought to be accreting onto the galaxy but with no observable star formation, either due to morphological quenching or, more likely, radio-mode feedback from an active galactic nucleus. Finally, we show a tentative detection of a Ly$\alpha$ filament connecting RO-1001 and RO-1001-Sat. This work shows how panoramic MUSE (and in the future, BlueMUSE) observations of massive halo seeds can be used to efficiently search for additional halos, unveiling their large-scale structure and enabling the study of Ly$\alpha$-selected galaxy groups.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Billion Years of MgII Absorber Evolution</a><span class="id">[2510.01430]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Applying &quot;apportioned integrals,&quot; we use dN/dX measurements to determine the MgII absorber equivalent width distribution function for Wr &gt; 0.03 [angstroms] and 0 &lt; z &lt; 7.

Measurements of dN/dX are robust for z &lt; 4 but less so at z &gt; 4 for weaker absorbers (Wr &lt; 0.3 [angstroms]). We bracketed two data-driven scenarios: from z   7 to z   4, dN/dX of weak absorbers is (1) constant, or (2) decreasing. For scenario #1, the evolution of Phi*(z), W*(z), and alpha(z) show that in the post-reionization universe, weak systems are nonevolving while the incidence of the strongest systems increases until Cosmic Noon; following Cosmic Noon, the strongest absorbers slowly evolve away while the incidence of weak absorbers rapidly increases. For scenario #2, the parameter evolution is such that, in the post-reionization universe, weak systems evolve away while the incidence of the strongest systems increases until Cosmic Noon; following Cosmic Noon, the behavior tracks the same as scenario #1. We argue in favor of scenario #2 based on corroborating OI, CII, and SiII measurements at z &gt; 4. Our results provide a unified, quantitative description for MgII absorber evolution spanning 13 billion years of cosmic time and offer deeper insights into galactic baryon cycle physics. They also highlight the need for deep z &gt; 5 MgII surveys and have implications for detectability of a MgII forest at z &gt; 7.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feeding frenzy in the mighty black holes: what we could learn from them?</a><span class="id">[2510.01486]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Eddington ratio is a paramount parameter governing the accretion history and life cycles of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This short review presents a multi-faceted view of the importance of the Eddington ratio spanning varied AGN studies. We find that the Eddington ratio is crucial for standardizing the Radius-Luminosity (R-L) relation - a necessary step for employing quasars (QSOs) as standardizable cosmological probes to help clarify the standing of the Hubble tension. In this data-driven era, we consolidated disparate aspects by developing novel relations borne out of large datasets, such as the robust, nearly universal anti-correlation between fractional variability and Eddington ratio derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, which is vital for interpreting forthcoming high-cadence surveys like Rubin Observatory's LSST. Addressing the conundrum where JWST results suggest an overabundance of massive high-redshift black holes, we demonstrate that local AGNs offer clarification: Changing-Look AGNs (CLAGNs), driven by rapid Eddington ratio shifts, cluster in the low-accretion regime, a rate independently confirmed by our integral field spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of a well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy, rich in high-ionization, forbidden, coronal lines. Conversely, for the high-redshift, high-luminosity population where traditional reverberation mapping (RM) is highly impractical, photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) offers a rapid alternative to constrain accretion disk sizes, enabling efficient estimates of black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Finally, we developed tailored semi-empirical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for extremely high-accretion quasars, successfully validating their characteristic extreme physical conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong Lensing Perturbers from the SIDM Concerto Suite</a><span class="id">[2510.01491]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Motivated by recent detections of low-mass perturbers in strong gravitational lensing systems, we investigate analogs of these objects in the Concerto suite, a set of cosmological N-body zoom-in simulations of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with high-amplitude, velocity-dependent cross sections. We investigate characteristic halo properties relevant to gravitational imaging measurements, focusing on the projected enclosed mass and the central density slope. In SIDM, these quantities evolve continuously through gravothermal processes, spanning core-expansion and core-collapse phases, in sharp contrast to cold dark matter, where they remain nearly static after halo formation. This SIDM evolution further depends on tidal environment and merger history, which can be probed through strong lensing. We also identify simulated SIDM halos whose properties are consistent with the properties of low-mass perturbers inferred from recent observations, and we demonstrate that the core-collapse mechanism offers a compelling explanation for their observed high densities. Our results highlight the potential of strong gravitational lensing as a powerful probe of dark matter self-interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of an Accretion Burst in a Free-Floating Planetary-Mass Object</a><span class="id">[2510.01747]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of a long-lasting burst of disk accretion in Cha J11070768-7626326 (Cha 1107-7626), a young, isolated, 5-10 M$_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$ object. In spectra taken with XSHOOTER at ESO's Very Large Telescope as well as NIRSPEC and MIRI on the James Webb Space Telescope, the object transitions from quiescence in April-May 2025 to a strongly enhanced accretion phase in June-August 2025. The line flux changes correspond to a 6-8-fold increase in the mass accretion rate, reaching $10^{-7}$ M$_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$yr$^{-1}$, the highest measured in a planetary-mass object. During the burst, the H$\alpha$ line develops a double-peaked profile with red-shifted absorption, as observed in stars and brown dwarfs undergoing magnetospheric accretion. The optical continuum increases by a factor of 3-6; the object is $\sim$1.5-2 mag brighter in the R-band during the burst. Mid-infrared continuum fluxes rise by 10-20%, with clear changes in the hydrocarbon emission lines from the disk. We detect water vapour emission at 6.5-7 $\mu m$, which were absent in quiescence. By the end of our observing campaign, the burst was still ongoing, implying a duration of at least two months. A 2016 spectrum also shows high accretion levels, suggesting that this object may undergo recurring bursts. The observed event is inconsistent with typical variability in accreting young stars and instead matches the duration, amplitude and line spectrum of an EXor-type burst, making Cha1107-7626 the first substellar object with evidence of a potentially recurring EXor burst.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01773" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identifying tidal disruption events among radio transient galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.01773]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the optical and infrared properties of a sample of 24 radio transient sources discovered in the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). Previous studies of their radio emission showed that these sources resemble young gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources, but are less powerful and characterized by low-power jets. The bursts of radio activity in most cases are likely due to intrinsic changes in the accretion processes. However, for a few sources in this sample, we cannot rule out the possibility that their radio variability results from a tidal disruption event (TDE). In this work, we extend our analysis to the optical and infrared regimes, confirming that our sample of radio transients is not homogeneous in terms of their optical and infrared properties either. The host galaxies of most of these sources are massive ellipticals with emission dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses typical of radio-loud AGNs ($\rm &gt;10^7\,M_{\odot}$), but exhibit very low accretion activity. In contrast, the sources for which a TDE origin is suspected are either pure star-forming galaxies or show significant ongoing star formation, similar to radio-selected optically-detected TDEs. Additionally, two of them exhibit infrared flares characteristic of TDEs, while the remaining sources do not display significant variability outside the radio regime. Moreover, the evolution of their radio brightness in the W3/radio diagnostic diagram, which we employ in our analysis, also sets our TDE candidates apart from the rest of the sample and resembles the radio variability seen in optically discovered TDEs with radio emission. Finally, based on our findings, we hypothesize that the mid-IR/radio relation can serve as a tool to distinguish between radio transients caused by TDEs and those originating from intrinsic AGN variability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Low- and high-velocity `water fountains': different evolutionary stages</a><span class="id">[2510.01856]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>`Water fountains' (WFs) are optically obscured evolved stars, most of them thought to be in the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) phase, characterized by H$_{2}$O maser emission tracing molecular jets. Interestingly, four WFs (IRAS 15445$-$5449, IRAS 18019$-$2216, IRAS 18443$-$0231, and IRAS 18464$-$0140) and one WF candidate (IRAS 18480+0008) are potential planetary nebulae (PNe) because they exhibit radio continuum emission, suggesting the presence of a photoionized region characteristic of PNe. To classify these objects, we obtained K-band (2.0-2.3 $\mu$m) spectra of these WFs, including the only WF PN known (IRAS 15103$-$5754) for comparison. Our spectra reveal two group of sources: (i) `low-velocity' WFs with H$_2$O maser velocity spread of $\lesssim$50 km s$^{-1}$ (IRAS 18019$-$2216, IRAS 18464$-$0140, and IRAS 18480+0008) showing the CO band at 2.29 $\mu$m in absorption, typical of cool giant stars, and no emission lines; and (ii) `high-velocity' WFs, velocity spread of $\gtrsim$50 km s$^{-1}$ (IRAS 15103$-$5754, IRAS 15445$-$5449, and IRAS 18443$-$0231), exhibiting emission lines of Br$\gamma$, He I, and H$_2$, consistent with hotter central stars and/or shock-excited emission. The emission line ratios of these lines in IRAS 18443$-$0231 indicates that it may be a nascent PN. The spectrum of IRAS 15445$-$5449 also shows a CO band and Na I doublet in emission, suggesting the presence of a compact circumstellar disk and/or active mass loss. These results favor the previously suggested notion that the difference between low- and high-velocity WFs is not simply a projection effect but reflects intrinsically different evolutionary stages. Moreover, the results are also consistent with the idea of an increase in the jet ejection velocity as the post-AGB evolution proceeds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of AGB stars on the chemical evolution of neutron-capture elements</a><span class="id">[2510.01904]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper we discuss the impact of the s-process nucleosynthesis in Asymptotic Giant Branch stars on the enrichment of heavy elements.

However, observed emission line profiles most often deviate from those expected from a rotating disk. This report examines the role of accretion disks in broad-line emission of Population B AGN characterized by relatively low accretion rates in which broad lines show large redward asymmetry both in H$\beta$ and Mg II$\lambda$ 2800. An unbiased comparison matching black hole mass and Eddington ratio suggests that the most powerful radio-loud quasars show the highest red-ward asymmetries in H$\beta$. These shifts can be accounted for by gravitational and transverse redshift effects, especially for black hole masses larger than $\approx$10$^{8.7}$ M$_\odot$. The analysis of the extremely jetted quasar 3C 47 adds another piece to the puzzle: not only are the low ionization profiles of 3C 47 well-described by a relativistic Keplerian accretion disk model, with line emission in the range 100 - 1,000 gravitational radii, but also the high-ionization line profiles can be understood as a combination of disk plus a failed wind contribution that is in turn hiding the disk emission. Constraints on radio properties and line profile variability suggest that 3C 47 might involve the presence of a second black hole with secondary-to-primary mass ratio $\sim$ 0.5. We conjecture that the double peakers - type-1 AGN with Balmer line profiles consistent with accretion disk emission - might have their emission truncated by the sweeping effect of a second black hole. In non-starving systems, the disk signal is plausibly masked by additional line emission, rendering the disk contribution harder to detect.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RAD@home discovery of extragalactic radio rings and odd radio circles: clues to their origins</a><span class="id">[2510.01999]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present three rare and striking extragalactic radio sources discovered through visual inspection of low-frequency continuum maps from LoTSS DR2 and TGSS by the RAD@home citizen-science collaboratory.

At photometric $z \sim$ 0.94, it hosts a pair of intersecting rings of  300 kpc diameter, embedded in diffuse emission extending over  800 kpc, making it both the most distant and most powerful ORC reported to date. Its steep spectrum $\alpha_{54}^{144}=1.22\pm0.15$) points to a relic synchrotron origin. The second object, RAD J122622.6+640622, is a  865 kpc giant radio galaxy whose southern jet is abruptly deflected, inflating a  100 kpc limb-brightened ring, while the northern jet terminates in a compact hotspot-like feature. The third, RAD J142004.0+621715 ( 440 kpc), shows a comparable ring at the end of its northern filamentary jet, along with a secondary filament parallel to its southern jet. All three systems lie in $\sim10^{14}M_\odot$ clusters or group-scale haloes, suggesting that environmental density gradients and possible jet-galaxy interactions play a central role in shaping these ring morphologies. These discoveries expand the zoo of extragalactic radio morphologies, highlight the diversity of pathways that can generate ring-like synchrotron structures, and demonstrate the continuing importance of human pattern recognition in identifying rare sources that escape current automated pipelines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Improved Radiative Transfer Corrections in Helium Emission Lines</a><span class="id">[2510.02045]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new detailed model of the He I collisional-recombination spectrum based on the most up-to-date atomic data. The model accounts for radiative transfer effects and the influence of a non-zero optical depth in He I lines arising from transitions to the metastable 2^3S state. The model reveals substantial deviations in the emissivities of the lambda3889 and lambda7065 lines in the case of a non-zero optical depth, with previous models systematically underestimating and overestimating them by 5 to 20 percent, respectively. In the optically thin case, however, our results show good agreement with previous studies. Using the new model, we compute optically thin emissivities for a wide set of UV, optical, and IR He I recombination lines over a fine grid of electron densities and temperatures typical for H II regions and planetary nebulae (1 &lt;= ne &lt;= 10^4 cm^-3, 8000 &lt;= Te &lt;= 22000 K). In addition, we present new fitting formulae for radiative transfer corrections for several He I lines relevant to optical and near-infrared observations, covering 0 &lt;= tau_3889 &lt;= 10 within the same density and temperature ranges. The accuracy of the obtained approximations is &lt;= 0.1 percent within the specified parameter range.

The Habitable Worlds Observatory is one of two upcoming missions with the possibility of significant UV capabilities, and the only one early enough in development to consider suggestions to its design. In this paper, we conduct an initial study of how current common UV filter sets affect the results of spectral energy distribution fitting for the estimation of galaxy parameter. This initial look is intended to motivate the need for future, more robust, SED fitting of mock galaxies. We compare the broad near UV and far UV filters used by the GALEX mission to the three more narrow Swift UVOT filters. We find that the GALEX filters result in larger errors when calculating the UV beta parameter compared to UVOT, and provide little constraint on the star formation age of a galaxy. We further note the ability of the UVOT filters to investigate the 2175Å attenuation bump; GALEX has a reduced capacity to trace this same feature. Ultimately, we recommend that in order to optimize the effectiveness of HWO's ultraviolet capacity for transformative astrophysics, a minimum of a FUV filter with three medium band NUV filters should be adopted. This will combine the power of GALEX's wavelength range with the finer sampling of UVOT around an important dust feature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In-situ globular clusters in alternative dark matter Milky Way galaxies: a first approach to fuzzy and core-like dark matter theories</a><span class="id">[2510.02130]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a first analysis of the dynamics of in-situ globular clusters (GCs) in Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies embedded in fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos, combining cosmological assembly histories from the TNG50 simulation with dedicated orbital integrations and analytical models. GC populations are initialized with identical distributions in normalized $E$-$L_{z}$ in matched CDM and FDM halos. In a universe dominated by FDM, we identify three distinct regimes for the in-situ GC population depending on the particle mass $m_{22} \equiv m_{\chi}/ 10^{-22}~\mathrm{eV}$. For $m_{22} &lt; 7$, baryons dominate the inner potential, which remains steep and centrally concentrated, confining GC orbits to a narrow region and producing less massive, more compact systems than in CDM. For $m_{22} \sim 7$, GC properties resemble those in CDM, with similar mass and spatial distributions. For $m_{22} &gt; 7$, the dark matter becomes both compact and globally dominant, generating a deeper and more extended gravitational potential that supports a wider range of stable GC orbits, resulting in more massive and spatially extended GC systems. Finally, we extend our framework to make predictions for GC populations in alternative DM models, including warm dark matter and self-interacting dark matter, in both MW-like and dwarf galaxies. Our findings demonstrate that in-situ GC systems offer a sensitive and independent probe of the underlying DM physics, opening new avenues for observational constraints with upcoming Euclid.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02179" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Near-infrared photometry of the central stars of planetary nebulae with the VVVX survey</a><span class="id">[2510.02179]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Achieving accurate photometric characterizations of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) toward the galactic plane is significantly hindered by the high levels of interstellar extinction in these regions.

By mitigating the effects of interstellar extinction via NIR observations of the Galactic disk and bulge, we seek to improve the identification and characterization of CSPNe in these regions, enabling a deeper understanding of their properties and evolutionary status. We used NIR photometry from the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea (VVV) survey and its extension VVVX to define the NIR photometry of a large sample of CSPNe recently identified with Gaia EDR3 data. We explored the optical and NIR properties of all CSPNe in our sample and searched for eclipsing binary candidates among them by employing relevant catalogs. We present a homogeneous catalog of 1274 CSPNe, including their Z, Y, H, J, and K NIR magnitudes and errors. We also include our findings on the photometric properties of our sample. We report 14 CSPNe with a large IR excess indicating cool companions and/or surrounding discs and 56 eclipsing binary candidates. Based on the present VVVX CSPN catalog, we conclude that NIR photometry can prove valuable for further and in-depth studies of CSPNe. Subsequent studies ought to focus on exploring the true nature of the CSPNe that present IR excess as well as eclipsing-binary CSPNe candidates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The role of environment in triggering AGN – evidence for a change at $z\sim$1</a><span class="id">[2510.02193]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>What triggers AGN in some galaxies and what role does this brief period of activity play in the overall evolution of galaxies are still open questions. This paper explores whether or not the local, on scales of $\approx$1 Mpc, galaxy density plays a role in triggering AGN when controlling for stellar mass. We consider this question as a function of redshift and AGN selection in the X-ray vs. in the IR. We use available density maps within the 4.8 this http URL . XMM-LSS field in the redshift range $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.6$. Our key result is that the environment may play a role in triggering IR AGN. In particular, at $z &gt; 1.2$ the incidence of AGN increases in higher density environments, controlling for stellar mass. However, this dependence reverses at $z &lt; 1.2$ where the incidence of IR AGN is higher in lower density environments. By contrast, among X-ray selected AGN there is no significant local density dependence. Bootstraping analysis confirms these conclusions. While these results agree with previous work on both obscured and unobscured AGN this is the first study to use a consistent methodology across IR and X-ray samples, as well as study IR dependence in this full redshift range. Upcoming large spectroscopic surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) galaxy evolution survey will be critical in further elucidating how the environment affects AGN triggering across different cosmic epochs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chronology of our Galaxy from Gaia colour-magnitude diagram fitting (ChronoGal): IV. On the inner Milky Way stellar age distribution</a><span class="id">[2510.02238]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Milky Way's inner region is dominated by a stellar bar and a boxy-peanut shaped bulge. However, which stellar populations inhabit the inner Galaxy or how star formation proceeded there is still unknown. The difficulty in studying these stars stems from their location in dense regions that are strongly impacted by extinction and crowding effects. In this work, we use star formation histories computed in the solar neighbourhood using Gaia Colour-Magnitude Diagram fitting to shed light onto the evolution of the central regions of our Galaxy. For that, we have obtained precise age distributions for the non-negligible amount of super metal-rich stars ([M/H] $\sim$ 0.5) in the solar neighbourhood (more than 5$\%$ of the total stars within 400 pc of the plane). Assuming that these stars were born in the inner Galaxy and migrated outwards, those distributions should be indicative of the true stellar age distribution in the inner Galaxy. Surprisingly, we find that these age distributions are not continuous but show clear signs of episodic star formation ($\sim$ 13.5, 10.0, 7.0, 4.0, 2.0 and less than 1 Gyr ago). Interestingly, with the exception of the 4 Gyr event, the timings of the detected events coincide with the formation of the primitive Milky Way and with known merging events or satellite encounters (Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and the Magellanic Clouds), suggesting that these could have induced enhanced and global star-forming episodes. These results are compatible with a scenario in which Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage is responsible for the formation of the bar 10 Gyr ago. However, we cannot associate any accretion counterpart with the 4-Gyr-ago event, leaving room for a late formation of the bar, as previously proposed.

In this work, we connect the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the GD-1 stream to the number density and internal structure of dark matter subhalos in the mass range $10^5$-$10^9\ M_\odot$. We measure the radial velocity dispersion of GD-1 based on 160 identified member stars across four different spectroscopic catalogs. We use repeat observations of the same stars to constrain binarity. We find that the stream's intrinsic radial velocity dispersion ranges from approximately 2-5 km/s across its length. The region of GD-1 with the highest velocity dispersion represents a $4\sigma$ deviation from unperturbed stream models formed in a smooth Milky Way potential, which are substantially colder. We use perturbation theory to model the stream's velocity dispersion as a function of dark matter subhalo population parameters, including the number of low-mass subhalos in the Milky Way, the dark matter half-mode mass, and the mass-concentration relation of subhalos. We find that the observed velocity dispersion can be explained by numerous impacts with low-mass dark matter subhalos, or by a single impact with a very compact subhalo with $M \gtrsim 10^8\ M_\odot$. Our constraint on the fraction of mass in subhalos is $f_{\mathrm{sub}} = 0.05^{+0.08}_{-0.03}$ (68\% confidence). In both scenarios, our model prefers subhalos that are more compact compared to CDM mass-size expectations. These results suggest a possible deviation from CDM at low subhalo masses, which may be accounted for by dark matter self-interactions that predict higher concentrations in lower-mass subhalos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photometric stellar masses for galaxies in DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys</a><span class="id">[2510.02257]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In many areas of extragalactic astrophysics, we need to convert the luminosity of a galaxy into its stellar mass.

This survey provides an unsurpassed combination of a deep imaging with an extensive sky coverage in up to four photometric bands. We calibrated the sought formula against a sample of local galaxies observed by the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G) that was directly dedicated to measure the stellar masses. For the absolute magnitudes $M_g$ and $M_r$ of a galaxy in the Legacy Surveys $g$ and $r$ bands, we find that the stellar masses can be estimated as $0.673M_g - 1.108M_r + 0.996$ with the scatter of 25\%. Employing more complex functions does not improve the estimate appreciably, even after including the galaxy ellipticity, Sérsic index, or the magnitudes in different Legacy Surveys bands. Generally, measurements in $r$ band were the most helpful ones, while adding $z$-band measurements did not improve the mass estimate much. We provide a Python-based script \texttt{photomass\ this http URL } to automatically download images of any galaxy from the Legacy Surveys database, create image masks, generate GALFIT input files with well-assessed initial values, perform the GALFIT photometry, and calculate the stellar mass estimate. Additionally, we tuned another version of the formula to the magnitudes provided by the Siena Galaxy Atlas 2020 (SGA-2020) with a scatter of 29\%. For both – our default and SGA-2020 formula, we offer two alternatives derived from different calibrations of S$^4$G masses that were based on different methods and assumptions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02301" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relativistic Jets and Winds in Radio-Identified Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidates</a><span class="id">[2510.02301]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supermassive black hole binary systems (SMBHBs) are thought to emit the recently discovered nHz gravitational wave background; however, not a single individual nHz source has been confirmed to date. Long-term radio-monitoring at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates: blazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux density variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence of a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model, where a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel, along which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation from the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency arises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed. Our model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be applied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio polarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested with forthcoming observations.

We investigate the detectability of far-infrared emitters in ALMA deep fields using mock observations by injecting artificial line-emitting sources into the visibility planes. We also discuss our investigation, conducted together with the ALMA operations team, of a possible technical problem in the original observations. Finally, we devise a method to estimate the [CII] luminosity function (LF) at $z \sim 6$, including a full analysis of signal contamination and sample completeness. The comparison of pixel distributions between the real and mock datacubes does not show significant differences, confirming that the effect of non-Gaussian noise is negligible for the ADF22 datacube. Using 100 blank mock-mosaic datasets, we show 0.43 $\pm$ 0.67 false detections per datacube with the previous source-finding method. We argue that the underestimation of the contamination rate in the previous work is caused by the smaller number of datacubes, using only 4 real ADF22 datacubes. We compare the results of clump-finding between the time division mode and frequency division mode correlator datacubes and confirm that the velocity widths of the clumps in the TDM case are up to 3 times wider than in the FDM case.

Our strongest limit sets a lower bound of O(1000 TeV) on the decay constant of the hypothesized pseudo-scalar. We also briefly discuss whether $\eta_w$ could be a dark matter candidate, or the origin of dark energy, but conclude that those identifications appear unlikely.

We examine the morphology of 30 LRDs, while the remaining 69 appear predominantly compact, with sizes $\leq 400$ pc and no extended components even in stacked SW images. However, their unresolved nature may partly reflect current depth limitations, which could prevent the detection of faint diffuse components. Among the 30 morphologically analyzed LRDs, 50% show multiple associated components, while the rest exhibit highly asymmetric structures, despite appearing as single sources. This diversity in rest-frame UV morphologies may point to interactions or strong internal feedback. We find median stellar masses of $\log_{10}(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) = 9.07_{-0.08}^{+0.11}$ for pure stellar models with $A_{V} \approx 1.16^{+0.11}{-0.21}$ mag, and $\log{10}(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) = 9.67^{+0.17}{-0.27}$ for models including AGNs with $A{V} \approx 2.74^{+0.55}_{-0.71}$ mag, in line with recent studies suggesting higher masses and dust content for AGN-fitted LRDs. NIRSpec spectra are available for 15 sources, six of which are also in the morphological sample. Broad H$\alpha$ is detected in 40% (FWHM = 1200-2900 km/s), and one source shows broad H$\beta$ emission. Emission line ratios indicate a composite nature, consistent with both AGN and stellar processes. Altogether, these results suggest that LRDs are a mixed population, and their rest-frame UV morphology reflects this complexity. Morphological studies of larger samples could provide a new way to understand what drives their properties and evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The brightest X-ray AGNs at redshift $3\lesssim z \lesssim 6$</a><span class="id">[2503.02090]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Given recent X-ray observations of high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we consider whether the extreme luminosities of these AGNs are consistent with current semi-analytical models.

With stellar light-to-mass ratios similar to those in well-studied lower redshift galaxies, our simple model can account for the observed extreme ultra-high redshift populations with star formation efficiencies that peak at values of 20-65 percent. Bursty star formation, or higher light-to-mass ratios such as are expected for lower metallicity stellar populations or a top-heavy Initial Mass Function, would result in even lower required star formation efficiencies, comparable to values predicted by high resolution numerical simulations of high-surface density star forming clouds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19570" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Determines the Maximum Mass of AGN-assisted Black Hole Mergers?</a><span class="id">[2504.19570]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of merging binary black holes detected through gravitational waves remains a fundamental question in astrophysics.

Here we investigate the maximum masses attainable by black hole mergers within active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks. Using a comprehensive semi-analytic model incorporating 27 binary and environmental parameters, we explore the role of AGN disk conditions in shaping the upper end of the black hole mass spectrum. We find that AGN disk lifetime is the dominant factor, with high-mass mergers (&gt;200 solar mass) only possible if disks persist for  40 Myr.

In three of the participating codes, a distinct, rotation-dominated inner core emerges with a formation timescale of $\lesssim 300$ Myr, largely driven by a major merger event, while two other codes exhibit similar signs of wet compaction – gaseous shrinkage into a compact starburst phase – at earlier epochs. The remaining three codes show only weak evidence of wet compaction. Consequently, we divide the simulated galaxies into two groups: those with strong compaction signatures and those with weaker ones. Galaxies in these two groups differ in size, stellar age gradients, and disk-to-total mass ratios. Specifically, codes with strong wet compaction build their outer disks in an inside-out fashion, leading to negative age gradients, whereas codes with weaker compaction feature flat or positive age gradients caused primarily by outward stellar migration. Although the stellar half-mass radii of these two groups diverge at $z \sim 3$, the inclusion of dust extinction brings their sizes and shapes in mock observations closer to each other and to observed galaxies. We attribute the observed morphological differences primarily to variations in the stellar feedback implementations – such as delayed cooling timescales, and feedback strengths – that regulate both the onset and duration of compaction. Overall, our results suggest that disk assembly at high redshifts is highly sensitive to the details of the stellar feedback prescriptions in simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From FFB Starbursts at Cosmic Dawn to Quenching at Cosmic Morning: Hi-z Galaxy Bimodality</a><span class="id">[2506.11664]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a mass-dependent bimodality in the early evolution of galaxies. The massive track connects the super-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn ($z &gt; 8$) to the super-massive quiescent galaxies and black holes (BHs) at cosmic morning ($z \sim 4 - 7$). The dark-matter halos $&gt; 10^{10.5} {\rm M}_\odot$ at $z = 10$ are expected to undergo feedback-free starbursts (FFB) with high star-formation efficiency in dense star clusters within compact galaxies. The less massive halos avoid FFB and form stars gradually under stellar feedback, possibly leading to the peak star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon ($z \sim 1-3$). The FFB and non-FFB halos originate from $&gt;4\sigma$ and $2-3\sigma$ density peaks, respectively. The post-FFB galaxies quench their star formation soon after the FFB phase and remain quiescent due to (a) gas depletion by the FFB starbursts and outflows, (b) compaction events driven by angular-momentum loss in colliding streams within the high-sigma-peak FFB halos, (c) turbulent circum-galactic medium (CGM) that suppresses feeding by cold streams, and (d) BH feedback, being a key for complete quenching. BH feedback is enhanced by FFB-driven BH seeding and growth. It seems capable of disrupting the streams by generating CGM turbulence or photo-heating, but this remains an open challenge. The cosmic-morning quiescent galaxies are expected to be massive, compact, showing signatures of compaction, outflows and AGN, with a comoving number density $\sim 10^{-5} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$, comparable to the super-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn and the AGN at cosmic morning. Their UV luminosity function is predicted to peak about $M_ {\rm uv} \sim -22$ and contribute $\sim 10\%$ of the galaxies there.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The dark matter content of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies: Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor</a><span class="id">[2507.02284]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has so far observed three classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs): Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor.

In particular, both the traditional single-population Jeans model and the multiple population chemodynamical model are adopted. With the chemodynamical model, we divide member stars of each dSph into metal-rich and metal-poor populations. The metal-rich populations are more centrally concentrated and dynamically colder, featuring lower velocity dispersion profiles than the metal-poor populations. We find a diversity of the inner density slopes $\gamma$ of dark matter halos, with the best constraints by single-population or chemodynamical models consistent with each other.

Such work crucially relies on robust theoretical modelling to understand when and where we expect pristine star formation to have occurred and survived. To that end, here we introduce an analytic bathtub for cosmic dawn, the abcd model, to efficiently trace the formation of the first stars from their birth through the first billion years of our universe's history, jointly following star formation out of pristine and metal-enriched gas over time. Informed by the latest theoretical developments in our understanding of star formation in molecular cooling halos, metal mixing, and early galaxies, we expand pre-existing minimal models for galaxy formation to include Population III stars and many of the processes - both internal and environmental - affecting their evolution, while remaining fast and interpretable. With this framework, we can bridge the gap between numerical simulations and previous semi-analytic models, as we self-consistently follow star formation in dark matter halos from the minihalo era through the epoch of reionization, finding that, under plausible physical conditions, pristine star formation can persist at a high level in the presence of Pop II star formation down to $z\sim 5$, but is limited to the most massive halos. We highlight areas of theoretical uncertainty in the physics underpinning Pop III star formation and demonstrate the effects of this uncertainty first on individual star formation histories and subsequently bracketing the range of global star formation levels we expect. Finally, we leverage this model to make preliminary observable predictions, generating forecasts for high-$z$ luminosity functions, transient rates, and the 21-cm global signal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22863" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of over-massive black holes in high-redshift disk galaxies via globular cluster accretion</a><span class="id">[2507.22863]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have suggested the existence of over-massive black holes (OMBHs) in high-redshift galaxies. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism for the formation of OMBHs, based on the accretion of globular clusters (GCs) in compact disk galaxies. We derive the conditions under which OMBHs can form, focusing on key parameters such as halo mass, redshift, and halo spin parameter. Our results show that at redshift $z = 10$, a halo with mass $10^{11}~M_{\odot}$ and a spin parameter of $\sim 0.02$ can form a black hole of $2.3 \times 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$ through GC migration and accretion via tidal disruption events (TDEs). The resulting black hole-to-stellar mass ratio can reach $\sim 0.1$, corresponding to the fraction of GC mass accreted onto the black hole. This mechanism thus provides a plausible explanation for the OMBHs observed by JWST. Furthermore, by combining our model with the halo mass function and the spin-parameter distribution, we construct black hole mass functions that reproduce the number densities of the massive BH candidates UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \approx 10$, as well as the abundances of BHs with masses $\gtrsim 10^{8}~\rm{M_\odot}$ at $z \approx 5$ inferred from JWST observations. However, our model overpredicts the abundance of BHs with masses $ &lt; 10^{8}~\rm{M_\odot}$, suggesting that moderately massive, inactive BHs are more frequent.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: Revealing Less Massive Black Holes in High-Redshift Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.02027]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a systematic search for broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST sample of 18 star-forming galaxies ($M_\star&gt;10^{9.5}~M_{\odot}$) at redshifts $z=4.4-5.7$. Using JWST/NIRSpec IFU, we identify 7 AGN candidates through the detection of broad \Ha\ emission lines from 33 aperture spectra centred on photometric peaks. These candidates include one highly robust AGN detection with FWHM $\sim$ 2800 \kms\ and six showing broad components with FWHM $\sim 600-1600$ \kms, with two in a merger system. We highlight that only broad-line detection is effective since these candidates uniformly lie within narrow emission-line ratio diagnostic diagrams where star-forming galaxies and AGNs overlap. The broad-line AGN fraction ranges from 5.9\% to 33\%, depending on the robustness of the candidates. Assuming that the majority are AGNs, the relatively high AGN fraction is likely due to targeting high-mass galaxies, where simulations demonstrate that broad-line detection is more feasible. Their black hole masses range from $10^6$ to $10^{7.5}~M_{\odot}$ with $0.1 \lesssim L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}\lesssim 1$. Counter to previous JWST studies at high redshift that found overmassive black holes relative to their host galaxies, our candidates lie close to or below the local $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ scaling relations, thus demonstrating the effect of selection biases. This study provides new insights into AGN-host galaxy co-evolution at high redshift by identifying faint broad-line AGNs in galaxy samples, highlighting the importance of considering mass-dependent selection biases and the likelihood of a large population of AGNs being undermassive and just now being tapped by JWST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02690" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Interstellar Medium in I Zw 18 seen with JWST/MIRI: II.

We detect 7 H2 rotational lines, some of which are among the weakest ever measured. The H2 population diagrams are fit with local-thermodynamic-equilibrium models and models of photodissociation regions. We also fit the ortho-/para-H2 ratios (OPRs); in three of the six regions for which it was possible to fit the OPR, we find values significantly greater than 3, the maximum value for local thermodynamic equilibrium. To our knowledge, although predicted theoretically, this is the first time that OPR significantly $&gt; 3$ has been measured in interstellar gas. We find that OPR tends to increase with decreasing H2 column density, consistent with the expected effects of self-shielding in advancing photodissociation fronts. The population diagrams are consistent with H nucleon densities of $\sim 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, and an interstellar radiation field scaling factor, G0, of $\sim 10^3$. This warm, dense H2 gas co-exists with the same highly ionized gas that emits [OIV] and [NeV]. Emission from T $\geq 50$K dust is detected, including an as-yet unidentified dust emission feature near 14 $\mu$m; possible identification as Al$_2$O$_3$ is discussed. The continuum emission from several regions requires that a considerable fraction of the refractory elements be incorporated in dust.

We find a size-stellar mass ($r_{e}-M_{*}$) relationship with a slope that is consistent with literature values at lower redshifts, though offset to lower sizes. We observe a large scatter in $r_{e}$ at low stellar mass ($M_{*}&lt;10^{8.4}$ M$_{\odot}$) which we believe is the result of bursty star formation histories (SFHs) of SF galaxies at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We find that the stellar and ionised gas components are similar in size at $z=6.1$. The evidence of already-established stellar components in these H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) indicates previous episodes of star formation have occurred.

Yet, the theory of Ly$\alpha$ transfer through anisotropic gas distributions remains underdeveloped. We present Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations of Ly$\alpha$ propagation through porous, inhomogeneous neutral gas, systematically exploring the effects of channel geometry, outflows, dust, and lognormally distributed column densities. We find that Ly$\alpha$ photons do not preferentially escape through the lowest-column-density pathways, but instead traverse channels of substantial optical depth, leading to suppressed central flux and the absence of strongly beamed escape. Subdividing channels has little impact, indicating that geometry and covering fraction are more important than porosity. Channels containing moderate amounts of neutral hydrogen alter escape in characteristic ways, including the appearance of quadruple-peaked spectra, which can be captured by a simple flux-channel relation. Outflows reshape the spectra by facilitating escape through dense media, redshifting photons and blending central features, while dust modulates the visibility of small channels by suppressing flux at line center; in both cases, we develop an analytical model that predicts the resulting central fluxes. Extending to lognormal column density fields, we show that Ly$\alpha$ photons probe a broad range of optical depths, producing skewed spectra that can be approximated by weighted sums of homogeneous models. Our results have direct implications for using Ly$\alpha$ as a tracer of gas properties and ionizing photon escape; for instance, spectra suggestive of high column densities may nonetheless allow LyC leakage through narrow channels.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20444" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAGAbg III: Environmental Stellar Mass Functions, Self-Quenching, and the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation in the Dwarf Galaxy Regime</a><span class="id">[2509.20444]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent efforts have extended our view of the number and properties of satellite galaxies beyond the Local Group firmly down to $\rm M_\star\sim 10^6 M_\odot$.

Using the background galaxies sample from the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey at $z&lt;0.05$, we take inventory of the dwarf population down to $\rm M_\star \sim 5\times10^6 M_\odot$ using three metrics: the stellar mass function (SMF) as function of environment, the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) of dwarf galaxies inferred via abundance matching, and the quenched fraction of highly isolated dwarfs. We find that the low-mass SMF shape shows minimal environmental dependence, with the field dwarf SMF described by a low-mass power-law index of $\alpha_1=-1.44\pm0.09$ down to $\rm M_\star \sim 5\times10^6 M_\odot$, and that the quenched fraction of isolated dwarfs drops monotonically to $f_{q} \sim 10^{-3}$ at $\rm M_\star \sim \rm 10^{8.5} M_\odot$. Though slightly steeper than estimates from \HI{} kinematic measures, our inferred SHMR agrees with literature measurements of satellite systems, consistent with minimal environmental dependence of the SHMR in the probed mass range.

Whilst the narrative of our home as a 'humdrum' system has become ingrained in the public psyche via Sagan, there are at least two striking facts about our existence which we know are certainly unusual. First, the stelliferous period spans  10Tyr - yet here we are living in the first 0.1% of that volume. Second, over three-quarters of all stars are low-mass M-dwarfs, stars with no shortage of rocky habitable-zone planets - and yet, again, our existence defies this trend, previously dubbed the Red Sky Paradox. Two plausible resolutions are that a) stars below a certain mass, $M_{crit}$, do not produce observers, and, b) planets have a truncated temporal window for observers, $T_{win}$, negating the longevity advantage of M-dwarfs. We develop a Bayesian model that encompasses both datums and jointly explores the two resolutions covariantly. Our analysis reveals that 1) the hypothesis that these observations are mere luck is disfavored with an overwhelming Bayes factor of  1600; 2) some truncation of low-mass stars is indispensable, lowering $T_{win}$ alone cannot well-explain the observations; and, 3) the most conservative limit on $M_{crit}$ occurs when fixing $T_{win}=10$Gyr, yielding $M_{crit}&gt;0.34 M_{\odot}$ [$0.74 M_{\odot}$] to 2$\sigma$ [1$\sigma$]. Our work challenges the tacit assumption of M-dwarfs being viable seats for observers and, indirectly, even life.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhancing the development of Cherenkov Telescope Array control software with Large Language Models</a><span class="id">[2510.01299]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop AI agents based on instruction-finetuned large language models (LLMs) to assist in the engineering and operation of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) Control and Data Acquisition Software (ACADA).

The detection of these systems could arise via searches using a power-based GW anisotropy model or a deterministic template model. In Schult et al. 2025, we compared the efficacy of these models in constraining the GW signal from a single SMBHB using realistic, near-future PTA datasets, and found that the full-signal deterministic continuous wave (CW) search may achieve detection and characterization first. Here, we continue our analyses using only the CW model given its better performance, focusing now on characterization milestones. We examine the order in which CW parameters are constrained as PTA data are accumulated and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) grows. We also study how these parameter constraints vary across sources of different sky locations and GW frequencies. We find that the GW frequency and strain are generally constrained at the same time (or S/N), closely followed by the sky location, and later the chirp mass (if the source is highly evolving) and inclination angle. At fixed S/N, sources at higher frequencies generally achieve better precision on the GW frequency, chirp mass, and sky location. The time (and S/N) at which the signal becomes constrained is dependent on the sky location and frequency of the source, with the effects of pulsar terms and PTA geometry playing crucial roles in source detection and localization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expectations for the first supermassive black-hole binary resolved by PTAs I: Model efficacy</a><span class="id">[2510.01317]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the most promising targets for Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) is identifying an individual supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) out of the population of binaries theorized to produce a gravitational wave background (GWB). In this work, we emulate an evolving PTA dataset, complete with an increasing number of pulsars and timing baseline, into which we inject a single binary on top of a Gaussian GWB signal. We vary the binary's source parameters, including sky position and frequency, and create an ensemble of simulated datasets with which we assess current Bayesian binary search techniques. We apply two waveform-based template models and a frequency-resolved anisotropy search to these simulations to understand how they compare in their detection and characterization abilities. We find that a template-based search including the full gravitational-wave signal structure (i.e., both Earth and pulsar effects of an incident GW) returns the highest Bayes Factors (BF), exceeding our estimator's capabilities by (S/N) 9-19, and has the most robust parameter estimation. Our anisotropy model attains a realization-median BF&gt;10 at 7&lt;(S/N)&lt;15. Interestingly, despite being a deterministic model, the Earth-term template struggles to detect and characterize low-frequency binaries (5 nHz). These binaries require higher (S/N) 16-19 to reach the same BF threshold. This is likely due to neglected confusion effects between the pulsar and Earth terms. By contrast, the frequency-resolved anisotropy model shows promise for parameter estimation despite treating a binary's GW signal as excess directional GW power without phase modeling. Sky location and frequency parameter constraints returned by the anisotropy model are only surpassed by the Earth term template model at (S/N) 12-13. Milestones for a first detection using the full-signal GW model are included in a companion paper (Petrov et al. 2025).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An improved algorithm for separating clock delays from ionospheric effects in radio astronomy</a><span class="id">[2510.01371]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: Low-frequency radio observations are heavily impacted by the ionosphere, where dispersive delays can outpace even instrumental clock offsets, posing a serious calibration challenge. Especially below 100 MHz, phase unwrapping difficulties and higher-order dispersion effects can complicate the separation of ionospheric and clock delays. Aims: We address this challenge by introducing a method for reliably separating clock delays from ionospheric effects, even under mediocre to poor ionospheric conditions encountered near solar maximum. Methods: The approach employs a key technique: we modelled our likelihood space using the circular Gaussian distribution (von Mises random variable) rather than non-circular distributions that suffer from $2\pi$ phase ambiguities. This ensures that noisier data are weighted less heavily than cleaner data during the fitting process. Results: The method reliably separates clock delays and ionospheric terms that vary smoothly in time whilst providing a good fit to the data. A comparison with the clock-ionosphere separation approach used in standard LOFAR data processing shows that our technique achieves significant improvements. In contrast to the old algorithm, which often fails to return reliable results below 100 MHz even under good ionospheric conditions, the new algorithm consistently provides reliable solutions across a wider range of conditions. Conclusions: This new algorithm represents a significant advance for large-scale surveys, offering a more dependable way to study ionospheric effects and furthering research in ionospheric science and low-frequency radio astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cuHPX: GPU-Accelerated Differentiable Spherical Harmonic Transforms on HEALPix Grids</a><span class="id">[2510.01785]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>HEALPix (Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization) is a widely adopted spherical grid system in astrophysics, cosmology, and Earth sciences. Its equal-area, iso-latitude structure makes it particularly well-suited for large-scale data analysis on the sphere. However, implementing high-performance spherical harmonic transforms (SHTs) on HEALPix grids remains challenging due to irregular pixel geometry, latitude-dependent alignments, and the demands for high-resolution transforms at scale. In this work, we present cuHPX, an optimized CUDA library that provides functionality for spherical harmonic analysis and related utilities on HEALPix grids. Beyond delivering substantial performance improvements, cuHPX ensures high numerical accuracy, analytic gradients for integration with deep learning frameworks, out-of-core memory-efficient optimization, and flexible regridding between HEALPix, equiangular, and other common spherical grid formats. Through evaluation, we show that cuHPX achieves rapid spectral convergence and delivers over 20 times speedup compared to existing libraries, while maintaining numerical consistency. By combining accuracy, scalability, and differentiability, cuHPX enables a broad range of applications in climate science, astrophysics, and machine learning, effectively bridging optimized GPU kernels with scientific workflows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PRESOL: a web-based computational setting for feature-based flare forecasting</a><span class="id">[2510.01799]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar flares are the most explosive phenomena in the solar system and the main trigger of the events' chain that starts from Coronal Mass Ejections and leads to geomagnetic storms with possible impacts on the infrastructures at Earth.

To achieve this, POLAR-2 relies on polarisation measurements and, for the first time will provide these using 2 separate polarimeter detectors. The first of these is a payload optimised to perform Compton polarimetry measurements in the 40-1000 keV energy range using a combination of plastic scintillators and SiPMs. The development of this payload, the design of which is based on lessons learned from the POLAR mission, included optimization of plastic scintillator design. In addition, its development included detailed characterization, space qualification and radiation damage and mitigation strategies for the large number of silicon photo-multipliers included in the design. We will present these along with an overview of the readout electronics. These electronics were developed with flexibility in mind, as well as low cost and low power consumption. As such, its design is of interest beyond this polarimeter and is also used on the spectrometer instrument of POLAR-2 where it is used to read out an array of GAGG:Ce scintillators. This readout, in combination with a coded mask, allows this secondary instrument to provide detailed spectral and localization measurements. The final instrument used in the mission aims to use gas-based detectors to perform polarization measurements in the keV energy region. The novelty of this design is that it will be optimized to use these for wide field of view observations. The combination of the three instruments will allow to perform detailed spectral, localization and polarization measurements of these transient phenomena together for the first time. Here we provide an overview of the technologies employed in the mission along with detailed predictions on its capabilities after its launch currently foreseen in 2027.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reducing Simulation Dependence in Neutrino Telescopes with Masked Point Transformers</a><span class="id">[2510.01733]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Machine learning techniques in neutrino physics have traditionally relied on simulated data, which provides access to ground-truth labels. However, the accuracy of these simulations and the discrepancies between simulated and real data remain significant concerns, particularly for large-scale neutrino telescopes that operate in complex natural media. In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reducing dependence on labeled datasets. Here, we present the first self-supervised training pipeline for neutrino telescopes, leveraging point cloud transformers and masked autoencoders. By shifting the majority of training to real data, this approach minimizes reliance on simulations, thereby mitigating associated systematic uncertainties. This represents a fundamental departure from previous machine learning applications in neutrino telescopes, paving the way for substantial improvements in event reconstruction and classification.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark characterization of Ti/Al LEKIDs for the search of axions in the W-band</a><span class="id">[2510.01913]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the electrical (dark) characterization of lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs) fabricated from a Titanium/Aluminum bilayer and designed for broadband absorption in the W-band (75-110 GHz). These detectors are prototypes for future QCD axion search experiments within the Canfranc Axion Detection Experiment (CADEx), which demand sub 1e-19 W/Hz^0.5 sensitivities under low optical backgrounds. We combine a Mattis-Bardeen analysis to the temperature dependence of the detector parameters with noise spectroscopy to determine the electrical noise equivalent power (NEP). The minimum measured value for the electrical NEP is 3e-19 W/Hz0.5. Across the measured temperature range, we find that quasiparticle lifetime deviates from the expected BCS recombination law. Our analysis suggests that non-equilibrium relaxation is governed by spatial inhomogeneities in the superconducting gap and phonon diffusion effects.

A mock-up robot for a 3U-sized transformable spacecraft is designed to fit in a limited time and space of the microgravity environment available in the drop tower. The robot performs agile reorientation, referred to as nonholonomic attitude control, by actuating joints in a particular manner. To adapt to the very short duration of microgravity in the drop tower test, a successive joint actuation maneuver is optimized to maximize the amount of attitude reorientation within the time constraint. The robot records the angular velocity history of all four bodies, and the data is analyzed to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical model. We confirm that the constructed numerical model sufficiently replicates the robot's motion and show that the post-experiment model corrections further improve the accuracy of the numerical simulations.

To take advantage of future velocity-flow surveys we must however have the theoretical predictions under control. In many respects, the velocity field is easier to simulate than the density field because it is less severely affected by small-scale clustering. Therefore, as we also show in this paper, a particle-mesh (PM) based simulation approach is usually sufficient, yielding results within a few percent of a corresponding P$^3$M simulation in which short-range forces are properly accounted for, but which also carry a much larger computational cost. However, in other respects the velocity field is much more challenging to deal with than the density field: Interpolating the velocity field onto a grid is significantly more complicated, and the vorticity field (the curl-part of the velocity field) is severely affected by both sample variance and discretisation effects. While the former can be dealt with using fixed amplitude initial conditions, the former makes it infeasible to run fully converged simulations in a cosmological volume. However, using the $N$-body code CONCEPT we show that one can robustly extrapolate the cosmic vorticity power spectrum from just 4 simulations with different number of particles. We expect our extrapolated vorticity power spectra to be correct within 5\% of the fully converged result across three orders of magnitude in $k$. Finally, we have also investigated the time dependence of the vorticity as well as the ratio of vorticity to divergence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06496" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identification of Likely Methane Absorption Features in the Optical Spectra of Titan</a><span class="id">[2509.06496]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The optical spectra of Titan reveal a rich set of absorption features, most of which are likely associated with methane (CH$_4$). Methane is a key molecule in planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres, yet a comprehensive high-resolution linelist at optical wavelengths remains incomplete. This study identified and characterized potential CH$_4$ absorption features in high-resolution optical spectra of Titan, providing essential data for linelist development and improving CH$_4$ detection and characterization. We analyzed Titan spectra from the ESPRESSO spectrograph (R $\approx$ 190,000), identifying intrinsic features and measuring their relative strengths. A conservative detection approach was employed, slightly overestimating solar and telluric contributions to distinguish them from Titan's intrinsic features. To assess the impact of spectral resolution, we compared the ESPRESSO data with Titan UVES data (R $\approx$ 110,000). We identified 6,195 absorption features in the ESPRESSO spectra potentially associated with CH$_4$, of which 5,436 are newly reported. ESPRESSO detected twice as many features as UVES in overlapping regions, highlighting the advantage of higher-resolution data. Most detected lines remained unresolved, so our reported features are primarily blended absorption structures. We estimated the detection limit for feature identification to correspond to a CH$_4$ absorption coefficient of approximately 0.02 km-am$^{-1}$. Comparison of our results with a previous analysis of Titan UVES spectra and with experimental CH$_4$ data at a similar temperature showed good agreement, while some discrepancies were observed when compared with data acquired at a different temperature. We provide a comprehensive list of Titan absorption features with key reliability metrics, along with Titan's intrinsic spectra, to support future studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02661" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Future of Artificial Intelligence and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences (AI+MPS)</a><span class="id">[2509.02661]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This community paper developed out of the NSF Workshop on the Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS), which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains (Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics) can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI.
