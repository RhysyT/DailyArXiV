By promoting each anomaly metric to a function of heliocentric distance and introducing a relaxation equation for the effective score, our method incorporates memory, hysteresis and predictive capability. This allows us to have early, stable forecasts of an object's eventual Loeb level based on sparse data obtained at large distances, which is more helpful to quantify its true nature when near Earth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13773" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot Jupiters in Old Wide-Binary Systems</a><span class="id">[2512.13773]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hot Jupiters (HJs) are giant planets with orbital periods shorter than $10$ days, found around $\sim 0.5$-$1\%$ of Sun-like stars. Their origins remain debated despite decades of study. The high prevalence of stellar companions, the eccentricity distribution of 'Cold' Jupiters on longer orbits, and the wide range of stellar spin-orbit misalignments support high-eccentricity migration: planets are excited to eccentric orbits and subsequently circularised via tidal dissipation. Existing high-eccentricity migration models, however, are inefficient in converting the initial population of Cold Jupiters to HJs. Current models reproduce at most $\lesssim 30\%$ of observed HJs, while the resulting Cold/Hot Jupiter ratios ($\gtrsim 30$) overproduce the observed values of $10$-$15$. These models also fail to form HJs around old stars ($\gtrsim 3$ Gyr) on short tidal decay timescales (e.g., $&lt;40$ Myr). Here we show that wide binaries ($a &gt; 10^3$ au) perturbed by the Galactic tidal field produce $1.8\pm 0.14$ more HJs compared to isolated binary systems, accounting for $26$-$40\%$ of the observed population under conservative assumptions. Wide-binaries predominantly produce Gyr-old systems, consistent with the host-age distribution for $t \ge 2.5\ \rm Gyr$. In $\sim 20\%$ of cases, wide-binary perturbations eject giant planets entirely, resolving the Cold/Hot Jupiter ratio discrepancy while naturally seeding the population of free-floating giant planets. In our dynamical framework, wide binaries emerge as active agents that reshape planetary demographics across billions of years. These results will be decisively tested by forthcoming exoplanet and microlensing surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resolving dust and Lyα emission in a lensed galaxy at the epoch of reionization with JWST/CANUCS</a><span class="id">[2512.13778]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Lyman $\alpha$ emission is highly sensitive to dust and neutral hydrogen and is therefore expected to be strongly suppressed in dusty or gas-rich galaxies during the epoch of reionization (EoR). Nevertheless, numerous moderately dusty Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) are observed at this epoch, suggesting that complex interstellar medium (ISM) geometries and feedback-driven outflows may facilitate Ly$\alpha$ escape. We investigate the dust, gas, and stellar properties of the gravitationally lensed LAE HCM 6A at $z=6.5676$ to characterize its multiphase ISM and the physical conditions regulating Ly$\alpha$ escape. We combine JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy, HST+JWST/NIRCam imaging, and JWST/NIRSpec slit spectra from the CANUCS program. Using a customized BAGPIPES SED-fitting framework with a flexible attenuation law, we derive stellar, nebular, and dust properties on integrated ($\sim$kpc), slit-level ($\sim$0.1 kpc), and pixel-level ($\sim$25 pc) scales, enabled by strong lensing ($\mu \approx 8.3$-$9.1$). A Ly$\alpha$ map from SLEUTH traces the spatial distribution of Ly$\alpha$ emission. We measure an unlensed stellar mass of $\log M_\ast = 8.3$-$8.4$ and an intrinsic UV magnitude of $M_{\rm UV} = -19.8 \pm 0.1$. The older region (S1) is moderately dusty with consistent stellar and nebular attenuation indicators, implying a uniform ISM geometry, while the youngest region (S3) shows strong discrepancies among dust tracers, indicating a feedback-shaped multiphase ISM. Ly$\alpha$ emission arises primarily from S3, where a dust-cleared central clump enables efficient Ly$\alpha$ escape. We find Calzetti-like attenuation curves with a UV bump that strengthens with stellar age and decreasing $A_V$. Our observations provide a uniquely detailed, spatially resolved view of a moderately dusty LAE during the EoR, demonstrating how feedback and multiphase ISM structure govern Ly$\alpha$ escape.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydrodynamical mass-loss rates for Very Massive Stars. I. Investigating the wind kink</a><span class="id">[2512.13782]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radiation-driven winds are ubiquitous in massive stars, but in Very Massive Stars (VMSs), mass loss dominates their evolution, chemical yields, and ultimate fate. Theoretical predictions have often relied on extrapolations of O star prescriptions, likely underestimating true VMS mass-loss rates. In the first of a series of papers on VMS wind properties, we investigate a feature predicted by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations: a mass-loss `kink' or upturn where the single-scattering limit is breached and winds transition from optically thin to optically thick. We calculate hydrodynamically consistent non-LTE atmosphere models using the PoWR$^\mathrm{HD}$ code, with a grid spanning $40-135M_\odot$ and 12-50 kK at fixed $\log(L_\star/L_\odot) = 6.0$ and solar-like metallicity with $Z=0.02$. Our models confirm the existence of the kink, where the wind optical depth crosses unity and spectral morphology shifts from O star to WNh types. The predicted location of the kink coincides with the transition stars in the Galactic Arches cluster and reproduces the model-independent transition mass-loss rate of $\log(\dot{M}_\mathrm{trans}) \approx -5.16$ from Vink &amp; Gräfener (2012). For the first time, we locate the kink at $\Gamma_\mathrm{e} \approx 0.43$ ($M_\star \approx 60M_\odot$) without relying on uncertain stellar masses. Above the kink, mass-loss rates scale much more steeply with decreasing mass (slope   10), in qualitative agreement with MC predictions. We additionally identify two bistability jumps in the mass loss driven by Fe ionisation shifts: the first from FeIV to FeIII near 25 kK and the second from FeIII to FeII near 15 kK. Our models thus provide the first comprehensive confirmation of the VMS mass-loss kink while establishing a mass-loss relation with complex mass and temperature dependencies with consequences for stellar evolution, chemical yields, and the black hole mass spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confirming membership in Local Group galaxies with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1</a><span class="id">[2512.13783]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1) to identify stellar members of the Local Group dwarf galaxies. We cross-match DESI targets with candidate members that are based on Gaia proper motions, positions, and photometry. The addition of DESI radial velocities enables secure membership determination in 16 systems, spanning ultra-faint, classical, and irregular dwarf galaxies. Our results confirm that Gaia-based selection algorithms are effective in minimising foreground contamination. With DR1, we find the largest number of member stars for Draco and Sextans. While Draco is discussed in detail in other works, we focus on Sextans and, for the first time with DESI, trace its stellar kinematics to large radii (up to $\sim$10 half-light radii). Our derived systemic velocity and velocity dispersion are consistent with previous works. We find that the more metal-poor population exhibits a higher velocity dispersion and extends to larger radii, whereas the more metal-rich population is kinematically colder and centrally concentrated. The metallicity gradient is steeper in the inner regions of Sextans ($\sim -9\times 10^{-3}$ dex arcmin$^{-1}$ or $\sim-0.29$ dex kpc$^{-1}$), while almost no gradient in the outskirts, hinting for an ex-situ halo or for an “outside-in” star formation. Although DESI [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios for Sextans stars with [Fe/H] $\gtrsim-2.0$ are in line with literature values, those for very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] $\lesssim-2.0$) present a large scatter and strong anti-correlation with metallicity, warranting a caution for using DESI abundances in this regime. We find one ultra metal-poor candidate in Canes Venatici I, which requires higher resolution spectroscopic follow-ups.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13789" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The chemical DNA of the Magellanic Clouds V. R-process dominates neutron capture elements production in the oldest SMC stars</a><span class="id">[2512.13789]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the chemical abundances of Fe, alpha- and neutron-capture elements in 12 metal-poor Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) giant stars, observed with the high-resolution spectrographs UVES/VLT and MIKE/Magellan. These stars have [Fe/H] between -2.3 and -1.4 dex, 10 of them with [Fe/H]&lt;-1.8 dex. According to theoretical age-metallicity relations for this galaxy, these stars formed in the first Gyr of life of the SMC and represent the oldest SMC stars known so far. [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios are enhanced but at a lower level than MW metal-poor stars, as expected according to the slow star formation rate of the SMC. The sample exhibits a large star-to-star scatter in all the neutron-capture elements. The two r-process elements measured in this work (Eu and Sm) have abundance ratios from solar up to +1 dex, three of them with [Eu/Fe]&gt;+0.7 dex and labeled as r-II stars. This [r/Fe] distribution indicates that the r-process in the SMC can be extremely efficient but is still largely affected by the stochastic nature of the main sites of production and the inefficient gas mixing in the early SMC evolution. A similar scatter is observable also for the s-process elements (Y, Ba, La, Ce, Nd), with the stars richest in Eu also being rich in these s-elements. Also, all the stars exhibit subsolar [s/Eu] abundance ratios. At the metallicities of these stars, the production of neutron-capture elements is driven by r-process, because the low-mass AGB stars have not yet evolved and left their s-process signature in the interstellar medium. We also present stochastic chemical evolution models tailored for the SMC that confirm this scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo Lightcones with Optimised Orientation and Interpolation in Cosmological Simulations – an application to mock H$α$ selected galaxies</a><span class="id">[2512.13801]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A critical step to create realistic mock catalogs that support large-scale photometric and spectroscopic sky surveys is the production of cosmological simulations that accurately model the survey observables taking into account the redshift-dependent galaxy formation and evolution processes. Here we develop an efficient framework, HOLCon (Halo Optimised Lightcone Constructor), for post-facto construction of dark matter halo lightcones from simulations and use them to generate a mock galaxy catalogue. HOLCon includes a module to optimise the lightcone's orientation within the simulation box, minimising repeated structures when the survey volume exceeds a single box – a common challenge in modern surveys. A linear interpolation scheme tracks the evolution of halo properties across snapshots. Applied to the publicly available Uchuu simulation, we construct a lightcone of 50 ${\rm deg}^2$ and extending up to $z = 10$, providing representative coverage of deep fields of Stage IV surveys. We validate the lightcone for cosmological applications by comparing the dark matter halo clustering in the lightcone with those from the original simulation snapshots. Subsequently, we make the galaxy-halo connection on the lightcone with a redshift extended version of the SciPIC algorithm producing a comprehensive set of descriptive galaxy attributes. HOLCon leverages Dask, a scalable parallel computing pythonic framework for fast construction of dark matter halo lightcones enabling rapid creation of multiple statistical realizations essential for robust cosmological inference. The produced galaxy mock makes predictions for clustering of H$\alpha$ emitters, making it a useful cosmology resource.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13802" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Mass Flows Through Accretion Discs: A Spectral-Timing Vision for the 2040s</a><span class="id">[2512.13802]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding how mass and angular momentum flow through accretion discs remains a fundamental unsolved problem in astrophysics. Accreting white dwarfs offer an ideal laboratory for addressing this question: their variability occurs on accessible timescales of seconds to minutes, and their optical spectra contain continuum and emission-line components that trace distinct disc regions. Broad-band timing studies have revealed time-lags similar to those observed in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, suggesting propagating fluctuations and possible coupling to an inner hot flow. However, the blending of line and continuum light in broad filters prevents a physical interpretation of these signals. The 2040s will bring an unprecedented number of disc-accreting systems discovered by Rubin-LSST, space-based gravitational-wave observatories, and third-generation ground and space-based detectors. To extract disc physics from these sources, high-cadence optical spectral-timing, simultaneously resolving continuum and individual lines, is essential. Such measurements would directly map how variability propagates through discs, determine how the outer disc responds to changes in the inner flow, and test whether accretion physics is scale-invariant from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. This white paper outlines the scientific motivation and observational capabilities required to realise this vision. It highlights the opportunity for ESO to enable a transformative new window on accretion physics in the coming decade.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13814" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spirals and Vertical Motions in the Planet-Forming Disk around HD 100546. A multi-line study of its gas kinematics</a><span class="id">[2512.13814]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>HD100546 represents a particularly interesting target to study dynamical planet-disk interactions as various features have been observed in both the dust and gas that provide direct and indirect evidence for ongoing planet formation. In this work, we aim to characterize the gas kinematics of five molecular CO emission lines observed with ALMA in HD 100546, to reveal deviations from Keplerian rotation as well as substructures in the peak intensity and line width. We fit the molecular intensity channels with the Discminer package to model the line profiles. Aside from fitting the full cube, we also conduct runs where the blue- and redshifted sides are modeled separately to search for possible asymmetries. Our analysis reveals prominent kinematical spiral features in all five lines on large scales of the disk and we reproduce their morphology with both a linear and logarithmic spiral. In 12CO 2-1, spirals are also seen in the peak intensity residuals, the line width residuals exhibit a prominent ring of enhanced line widths around 125-330 au. The models further show, that the emission from the redshifted side may originate from higher disk layers than that from the blueshifted side. The pitch angles of the spirals are consistent with those driven by an embedded companion inside of 50 au and they suggest a dynamical mechanism rather than gravitational instabilities. We further find indications of a companion around 90-150 au, where tentative dips are present in the radial profiles of the integrated intensity of 13CO and C18O and pressure minima are observed in the azimuthal velocities. For the first time, we also detect downward vertical flows in this region, which coincide with the observed dust gap. The asymmetry in the emission heights may be a result of infall from the disk's environment. Another explanation is provided by a warped inner disk, casting a shadow onto one side of the disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A high-dynamic-range view of the growth of structure and the warm/hot Universe</a><span class="id">[2512.13818]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Baryons heat to temperatures above $&gt;\!\!10^5\,\mathrm{K}$ as they accrete onto massive overdensities – galaxies, groups, clusters, and filaments – where they ionize and become optically transparent. Deep mm-wave observations such as those with ALMA have begun to probe a handful ($\sim\,$4) of massive systems at $z\!\sim\!2-4$, while low-resolution mm-wave surveys have detected thousands of objects at arcminute resolution out to $z\!\approx\!2$. To truly advance the field of the evolution of large-scale structures, mapping the warm/hot distribution of ionized gas out to the redshift of their formation, the ESO community requires a large-aperture single-dish (sub-)mm telescope. This will need to provide several orders of magnitude higher mapping speeds than currently available while preserving the few arcsecond resolution required for imaging the gas and removing contaminating radio and dusty thermal signals across the full (sub-)mm wavelength range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connection between galaxy morphology and dark-matter halo structure II: predicting disk structure from dark-matter halo properties</a><span class="id">[2512.13822]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate how galactic disk structures connect to the detailed properties of their host dark-matter halos using the TNG50 simulation. From the hydrodynamic and matched dark-matter-only runs, we measure a comprehensive list of halo properties describing density structure, angular momentum, shape, assembly history, and environment. Using the morphological decomposition developed in Paper I, we quantify the sizes, scale heights, and mass fractions of the disk components for galaxies at $0 \le z \le 4$. Random Forest (RF) regression shows halo properties alone predict disk size and thickness with high accuracy, while Symbolic Regression (SR) provides compact empirical relations with slightly lower accuracy. Disk height is consistently easier to predict than disk size, and lower-mass halos yield higher accuracy than massive halos. Predictions based on halo properties measured in the full-physics hydro simulations outperform those based on the matched dark-matter-only halos, reflecting the imprint of baryonic restructuring on the inner halo. SHAP analysis reveals that the most informative halo parameters include concentration, Einasto shape, global and inner spin, and recent mass accretion, though their importance varies across disk properties. We show that correlations between disk size and the density-profile shape arise primarily from disk-induced modification of the inner halo, rather than a primordial connection. Finally, we point out that disks become more extended with respect to their host halos at higher redshift in low-mass halos, while massive high-redshift halos show the opposite trend. We provide SR-based prescriptions that accurately map halo properties to disk structures, offering practical tools for galaxy-halo modeling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in Milky Way satellites</a><span class="id">[2512.13823]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), with masses between roughly $10^2\,M_\odot$ and $10^5\,M_\odot$, represent a largely uncharted component of the black-hole (BH) population. They are theoretically predicted to form in several early-Universe pathways, including the remnants of massive Population III stars, the runaway collapse of dense stellar clusters, and the direct collapse of metal-poor gas. Establishing whether IMBHs are present in dwarf galaxy satellites of the Milky Way (MW), and with what occupation fraction - i.e. the fraction of galaxies with a certain stellar mass that host a central BH - provides one of the most incisive tests of BH seed formation models. Despite their importance, present dynamical constraints on IMBHs remain weak. Dynamical IMBH masses or upper limits are available for very few such systems, with secure detections in less than ten cases. A next-generation wide-field spectroscopic facility, capable of combining deep multiplexed stellar spectroscopy with high-resolution integral-field observations of galaxy centers, would open access to IMBH masses in the $\leq10\,M_\odot$ regime. Such an advance would make possible - for the first time - a robust measurement of the IMBH occupation fraction in dwarf galaxies. A key scientific requirement for the coming decades is to establish the observational and instrumental capabilities needed to detect or tightly constrain IMBHs in nearby dwarf galaxies, particularly in the $\simeq10^3-10^4 \,M_\odot$ mass range, and thereby enable a measurement of their occupation fraction. Such a measurement is fundamental for distinguishing between competing scenarios for the formation of BH seeds in the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local Group dwarf galaxies as dark matter probes</a><span class="id">[2512.13827]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Unveiling the fundamental nature of non-baryonic dark matter (DM) has profound implications for our understanding of the Universe and of the physical laws that govern it. Its manifestation as an additional source of matter necessary to explain astrophysical and cosmological observations indicates either a breakdown of General Relativity or that the current Standard Model of Particle Physics is incomplete. In the standard Cold DM (CDM) paradigm, DM consists of collisionless non-relativistic particles with negligible non-gravitational interactions. This simple hypothesis is very successful on large and intermediate scales, but faces challenges on small galactic scales. Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies can play a fundamental role to elucidate whether these challenges stem from poorly understood fundamental baryonic processes or instead indicate that alternative DM scenarios need to be considered. In particular, a systematic determination of their DM halo properties as a function of stellar mass and star formation histories (SFH) will provide crucial observational benchmarks for models to deal with the trickiest issue that prevents us from advancing in our understanding of DM nature, i.e. the impact of baryonic processes in altering the properties of the inner regions of DM haloes. Such systematic study would require assembling accurate l.o.s. velocities (and metallicities) for several thousands of stars per galaxy, for an heterogeneous sample of target galaxies, spanning order of magnitudes in stellar mass and covering distances from about 100 kpc to more than 1 Mpc. This calls for both multi-objects spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes with fov of a few deg2 and a multiplex power in the several 1000s with the capability of providing dense sampling of the innermost regions, as well as for wide-area multi-objects spectrographs with fov of several arcmin2 on 30-40m class telescopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The molecular diversity of the ISM in galaxies across cosmic time</a><span class="id">[2512.13881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Submillimetre molecular lines (e.g., CO, HCN, SiO) provide a uniquely powerful view of the physical and chemical processes that govern star formation (SF) and galaxy evolution.

However, their origin has been debated for decades. Potential sources include internal processes (e.g., mass loss from evolved stars), external mechanisms (e.g., minor mergers or cooling flows), or a combination of both. Gas-rich minor mergers have long been proposed as an important channel for cold gas fueling in both observations and simulations, but direct evidence of cold gas transportation via gas-rich minor mergers remains elusive, particularly in galaxy groups and clusters where environmental effects are prevalent. In this letter, we present the first unambiguous case of direct cold gas transportation onto a brightest group galaxy (BGG) at $z=0.25$, driven by an ongoing close-separation gas-rich minor merger with a mass ratio of $\sim1:56$. High-resolution JWST imaging reveals a heavily obscured, low-mass satellite that is barely visible at restframe optical wavelengths. Tidal stripping from this satellite deposits gas and dust onto the BGG, forming prominent $\sim$10 kpc dust lanes in situ. Cosmological simulations indicate that such interactions preferentially occur in gas-rich satellites undergoing their first infall in highly eccentric orbits. Our results highlight the pivotal role of gas-rich minor mergers in replenishing cold gas reservoirs and shaping the evolution of central ETGs in galaxy groups.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the Reionization Epoch through 21 cm and Line Intensity Mapping Experiments</a><span class="id">[2512.13943]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The epoch of reionization (EoR), marking the Universe's transition from a neutral to ionized state, represents a pivotal phase for understanding the formation of the first stars and galaxies. Intensity mapping of atomic and molecular lines, such as $[\mathrm{CII}]$ and CO J-ladder transitions, across a broad redshift range is a powerful tool for investigating star formation history, metallicity, the distribution of gas and dust, and the physical conditions within galaxies. Additionally, 21 cm line intensity mapping directly probes the neutral hydrogen content in the intergalactic medium, offering a unique window into the timing and morphology of reionization. In this study, we explore the cross-correlation between the 21 cm signal and multi-line intensity mapping (LIM) to forecast their detectability for next-generation experiments. Our analysis emphasizes the complementary potential of these techniques to constrain parameters such as the minimum mass of ionizing sources and the ionization fraction $x_e$. Cross-correlations with LIM also enable constraints on physical properties like metal enrichment and the relationship between star formation rates and multi-line luminosities. Using mock observations from Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-low 21 cm and Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST)-like LIM experiments, we find that the $[\mathrm{CII}]$–21 cm cross-correlation can constrain reionization history by measuring $x_e$ across multiple redshift bins with significance levels ranging from 9 to 40$\sigma$. We extend our analysis to CO transitions, showing that the CO(1-0)–21 cm cross-correlation provides competitive constraints on reionization parameters. The synergies explored here will enable robust constraints on both reionization and LIM parameters, maximizing the scientific return of current and next-generation intensity mapping experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catalogs of optically-selected clusters and photometric luminous red galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program final year dataset</a><span class="id">[2512.13954]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We construct samples of optically-selected clusters and photometric luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program final year dataset covering $\sim 1200$ deg$^2$.

We find that these black holes can produce LRD-like observables when their emission is modeled with a dense gas cloud shrouding the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Between redshifts 5 and 8, we find the number density of LRDs in this simulation to be $\rm 2.04 \pm 0.32 \times 10^{-4} \space Mpc^{-3}$, which is broadly consistent with current estimates for the total LRD population from JWST. Their emission in the rest-frame visible spectrum is dominated by their AGN, which induces the red color indicative of LRDs via a very strong Balmer break. Additionally, the elevated mass of the black holes reduces the temperature of their accretion discs. This shifts the peak of the AGN emission towards longer wavelengths, and increases their brightness in the rest-frame visible spectrum relative to lower mass black holes accreting at the same rate. These simulated LRDs have very minimal dust attenuation ($\rm A_V = 0.21 \pm 0.12$), limiting the amount of dust re-emission that would occur in the infrared, making them very likely to fall below the observed detection limits from observatories like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In contrast to the BRAHMA box, the ASTRID simulation produces systematically smaller black holes and predicts LRD number densities that are more than two orders of magnitude lower than current measurements. We therefore conclude that the presence of black holes that are overmassive relative to their host galaxy, and enshrouded in dense gas, is necessary for AGN-dominated LRD models to reproduce both the observed properties and abundances of JWST LRD populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Holes as Seeds for Extremely Overmassive AGN Observed by JWST</a><span class="id">[2512.14066]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently identified Abell 2744-QSO1 as a compact, metal-poor, black hole (BH) dominated galaxy at $z\simeq 7$. This system exhibits an extreme black-hole-to-stellar mass ratio and unusually low metallicity, posing significant challenges to BH seeding models. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform high-resolution cosmological simulations with a massive primordial black hole (PBH; $M_{\rm BH}=5\times10^7\,M_\odot$) seed, incorporating for the first time a fully coupled treatment of PBH accretion, BH feedback, and Population III/II star formation and stellar feedback. Although PBHs accelerate structure formation through the seed effect, the associated strong thermal feedback from the accretion delays the onset of star formation to $z\lesssim 10$, producing short, bursty episodes throughout the subsequent evolution. PBH-driven outflows expel enriched gas from the nucleus, while sustained inflows from the intergalactic medium continuously replenish pristine material. This feedback-regulated cycle naturally yields low accretion rates ($\dot{m}_{\rm BH}/\dot{m}_{\rm edd} \sim 1-10\%$), subsolar metallicities ($Z/Z_\odot\lesssim10^{-2}$) and extreme $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios during both the initial star-forming phase and the subsequent quenching phases, in excellent agreement with JWST observations. Our results demonstrate that massive PBHs offer a viable pathway for forming the most extreme high-redshift systems, providing a physically motivated explanation for the extraordinary properties of Abell 2744-QSO1, as a sub-class of the broader population of JWST-discovered &quot;little red dots&quot;.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How is Cold Gas Loaded into Galactic Nuclear Outflows?</a><span class="id">[2512.14081]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of the multiphase gas within the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles is crucial for understanding Galactic Center (GC) feedback. We use HI4PI data to investigate the kinematics and physical properties of high-velocity clouds (HVCs) toward the GC. Our results reveal that the HVCs exhibit a distinct asymmetric distribution, closely associated with the bar-driven tilted dust lanes and the distorted overshooting streams. We propose that powerful nuclear outflows interact with these gas-rich, off-plane structures, striping and entraining cold gas from the outer Galactic regions (R_GC 0.5–1.7 kpc) rather than solely from the region of the central molecular zone (CMZ; R_GC&lt;0.3 kpc). In this scenario, as the Galactic bar drives gas inflows along the dust lanes, nuclear outflows simultaneously break through the CMZ, sweeping up and ablating cold gas from the boundary layer of these pre-existing structures. This process naturally accounts for the observed high turbulence, complex spectral signatures, and anomalous spatial-kinematic gas patterns, as well as multiwavelength asymmetries of the bubbles. The HVCs are accelerated to about 230–340 km/s over a dynamical time of  3–6 Myr. When the multiphase, inhomogeneous composition of the gas is included, the estimated gas outflow rate reaches  1 Msun/yr. This value is comparable to the bar-driven inflow rate, indicating a tightly coupled gas cycle in the inner Galaxy. Our research highlights the critical role of bar-driven gas dynamics and nuclear feedback in the secular evolution of the Milky Way, offering a valuable paradigm for investigating gas cycles in external galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The role of supernova remnants for the emergence of pre-biotic chemistry in molecular clouds</a><span class="id">[2512.14143]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There is growing evidence that the Sun might have formed within a nebula impacted by at least one SNR.

The posterior distribution of black hole mass remains flat toward the low-mass end, indicating that the kinematic data places an upper limit on the black hole mass.

Its goal is to improve our understanding of the physics of distant Dusty Star Forming Galaxies (DSFGs) by carrying out deep surveys of two fields, GOODS-North and COSMOS. This work is focussed on GOODS-North, which was observed for 78.2 hours, simultaneously at 1.2 and 2 mm, with a field of view of $\sim$240 arcmin$^2$. With such a deep integration, we were able to measure, for the first time, the confusion noise limits at the 30 m telescope using the best sampled $\sim 62$ arcmin$^2$ and masking sources with a flux greater than 0.54 or 0.17 mJy at 1.2 or 2 mm, respectively. We found a confusion noise of $139.1^{+ 15.9}_{- 19.2}\pm11.9$ $\mu$Jy/beam at 1.2 mm and $38.6^{+ 9.6}_{- 13.1} \pm3.7$ $\mu$Jy/beam at 2 mm (the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is the cosmic variance). In this region, this corresponds to half the instrumental noise. To derive these estimates, we devised a novel estimator, referred to as the cross variance, which also enabled us to estimate the correlated confusion noise between the two bands. Thus, we obtained a result of $49.6^{+ 15.9}_{- 24.8}\pm 6.4$ $\mu$Jy/beam. These values are consistent with the state of the art Simulated Infrared Dusty Extragalactic Sky (SIDES) model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14203" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mass Assembly and Chemical Complexity in the Milky Way</a><span class="id">[2512.14203]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>(Sub-)millimeter spectral lines can be used not only to understand the chemical complexity and enrichment history of an observed portion of our Galaxy, but with spectrally resolved lines, they reveal the physical conditions, dynamics, and even the ionisation state and magnetic field strengths of the gas component of our Galaxy.

A powerful complementary constraint to break degeneracies between different models is galaxy clustering. In this paper, we combine PANORAMIC pure parallel and legacy imaging along 34 independent sightlines to measure the cosmic variance ($\sigma_{\rm CV}$) in the number count of Lyman break galaxies at $z\sim10$ which is directly related to their clustering strength. We find $\sigma_{\rm CV}=0.96^{+0.20}_{-0.18}$, $1.46^{+0.54}_{-0.44}$, and $1.71^{+0.72}_{-0.59}$ per NIRCam pointing ($\sim9.7\,{\rm arcmin}^2$, $\lesssim1.5\,{\rm pMpc}$ at $z\sim10$) for galaxies with M$_{\rm UV}&lt;-19.5$, $-20$, and $-20.5$. Comparing to galaxies in the UniverseMachine, we find that $\sigma_{\rm CV}$ is consistent with our measurements, but that the number densities are a factor $\gtrsim5$ lower. We implement simple models in the UniverseMachine that represent different physical mechanisms to enhance the number density of UV-bright galaxies. All models decrease $\sigma_{\rm CV}$ by placing galaxies at fixed M$_{\rm UV}$ in lower mass halos, but they do so to varying degrees. Combined constraints on $\sigma_{\rm CV}$ and the UVLF tentatively disfavor models that globally increase the star formation efficiency (SFE) or the scatter in the M$_{\rm UV}$-$M_{\rm halo}$ relation, while models that decrease the mass-to-light ratio, or assume a power-law scaling of the SFE with $M_{\rm halo}$ agree better with the data. We show that with sufficient additional independent sightlines, robust discrimination between models is possible, paving the way for powerful constraints on the physics of early galaxy evolution through NIRCam pure parallel imaging.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecting galaxies with their haloes – from parsec to Mpc scales</a><span class="id">[2512.14281]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy evolution is driven by processes occurring across a wide range of scales, from star formation within giant molecular clouds (parsec scales) to outflows and secular evolution across entire galaxies (kpc scales), and the interplay between galaxies, their dark matter haloes, and large-scale structures (Mpc scales). Connecting the distribution of baryonic matter and energy across these scales will remain one of the key challenges for both theoretical and observational astrophysics in the coming decade. A major development towards meeting this challenge has been the growing ability to obtain highly spatially resolved (parsec-scale) integral-field spectroscopic observations (e.g. with VLT/MUSE), as well as to probe the extremely low-surface brightness outskirts of galaxies at large radii and high vertical scale heights. To combine the two regimes, we need a paradigm shift in the way we do spectroscopy on galaxies, especially considering the ongoing and future photometric surveys. The next decade will also bring a revolution in extensive photometric surveys of large areas of the sky, uncovering low surface brightness features around nearby galaxies. However, to fully understand the processes that connect galaxies to their haloes, shape low surface brightness features, and drive secular evolution, spatially resolved spectroscopy will be essential.

Here we present ALMA CO(J=3-2) observations of a bright EHV molecular bullet that reveal its morphology in detail down to scales of 30 au and its kinematic structure across the entire intermediate velocity range ($\sim$30-100 km s$^{-1}$). These provide important new insights into how outflows transfer mass and momentum to the surrounding medium. The observed channel maps display several sequences of ring-like features whose velocity increases and size decreases with projected distance from the driving source, each sequence tracing a thin, bow-shaped shell culminating on-axis in a bright EHV head. The shape, kinematics, and mass of each shell all agree remarkably well with the simplest textbook models of momentum-conserving bowshocks produced by a time-variable EHV jet. The dynamical timescale between consecutive shells is of a few decades, with the latest ejection event coinciding with the protostar optical/IR outburst observed in $\sim$1990. The very strong evidence for bowshock-driven entrainment induced by jet variability revealed by this work suggests that accretion bursts, and therefore variations in the disk snowlines, should occur on decade timescales, which could substantially impact grain growth and planet formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A first systematic study of [OIII] 88$μ$m at $z&gt;8$: two luminous oxygen lines and a powerful ionized outflow in the first 600 million years</a><span class="id">[2512.14486]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present deep ALMA Band 7 observations of the [OIII] $88\mu$m line and underlying dust continuum emission in four UV-bright, gravitationally lensed (magnification $\mu = 1.4-3.8$), JWST-selected galaxies at $z = 8.5 - 10.3$, with observed magnitudes $-22.5 \lesssim M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim -20.5$.

We find, for example, that a typical PSB ($M_\ast\sim10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) at $z\approx1$ has a 15 per cent likelihood of merging and around a 25 per cent likelihood of rejuvenating within 1 Gyr of being identified. Applying these rates and timescales to the observational data, we estimate the fraction of quiescent galaxies that passed through a PSB phase. We find that $18 - 28$ per cent of the build-up in the massive end ($M_\ast&gt;10^{10}$ M$\,_\odot$) of the passive mass function at $1&lt;z&lt;2$ can be explained by PSBs, with the contribution declining to $\sim5$ per cent by $z \simeq 0.5$. Accounting for mergers and rejuvenation reduces the inferred PSB contribution by approximately a factor of two. At lower stellar masses ($M_\ast &lt; 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$), rapid quenching through a PSB phase explains a significantly larger fraction of the growth in the passive mass function. With a visibility time of $\sim$ 0.75 Gyr, we find that around $60-80$ per cent of low-mass passive galaxies underwent a PSB phase.

We measure the stellar mass functions, weak-lensing profiles, and radial number density and red-fraction profiles of stacked clusters in both subsamples. Evolved clusters exhibit more concentrated lensing profiles, bimodal stellar mass functions dominated by massive BCGs, and a deficit of intermediate-mass satellites, while evolving clusters show flatter central lensing signals and an excess of massive satellites. Applying the same selection to IllustrisTNG clusters reproduces these trends and links the observed differences to distinct mass accretion histories. These results demonstrate the close link between cluster galaxy populations and the overall dynamical state of their underlying dark matter halo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio emission in star-forming galaxies: connection to restarted or relic AGN activity</a><span class="id">[2512.14646]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Increasing evidence shows that AGN with radio detections have more perturbed ionized gas kinematics and higher outflow detection rates, suggesting a link between radio emission and these processes. In galaxies with weak or ambiguous AGN signatures, some studies attribute the radio emission to star formation, while others propose AGN-driven winds or weak, unresolved jets as the dominant mechanism. To investigate this connection, we take a step back and analyze a sample of star-forming (SF) galaxies with no clear current AGN signatures. Using low-(LOFAR, 144MHz) and high-frequency (FIRST, 1.4GHz) surveys, combined with spatially resolved spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey, we compare SF galaxies with 144 MHz detections that either do or do not have GHz detections. Despite being matched in stellar mass, redshift, and radio (MHz) luminosity, GHz-detected SF galaxies systematically differ from their non-GHz-detected counterparts. The former display enhanced ionized gas-emission line widths, higher central outflow fractions, redder colors, increased central obscuration, and offset emission-line ratios that shift towards (or closer to) the AGN regime (in the [NII] BPT diagram). Furthermore, the non-GHz galaxies are likely undetected due to their extended radio morphologies, while the GHz-detected ones are significantly more radio compact. Most of the properties from the GHz-detected (compared to non-detected) remarkably resemble the behavior found in many studies of radio-detected AGNs. This suggests that the underlying physical mechanisms shaping GHz-detected SF galaxies properties are fundamentally similar. This raises intriguing questions about whether some compact SF galaxies represent a precursor phase of AGN evolution or a form of low-power AGN. The radio compact characteristic sizes of GHz-detected SF galaxies also suggest a connection between AGN and old starburst galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NGC 3521 as the Milky Way near twin: spectral energy distribution from UV to radio decameter ranges</a><span class="id">[2512.14664]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Milky Way analogues (MWAs) are usually selected from structural and kinematic properties, but robust SED-based similarity criteria are limited by heterogeneous photometry and incomplete wavelength coverage. We present a homogeneous, aperture-photometry SED of the Milky Way near-twin NGC 3521 from the ultraviolet to the radio decameter range. Fluxes are measured within a fixed elliptical isophotal aperture using GALEX, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer/MIPS, Herschel/PACS+SPIRE, and VLA data, and supplemented by meter/decameter constraints. We report new observations obtained in Jan-Feb 2022 with the Ukrainian T-shape radio telescope and derive, for the first time, an upper limit in the 24–32 MHz band. The UV-to-decameter SED (27 points) is modelled with \textsc{CIGALE}, including a dedicated low-frequency radio prescription (\texttt{radio_extra}) that accounts for emission and absorption effects. Using ZTF and NEOWISE data (2014–2025), we detect genuine nuclear variability; optical trends at $\sim2^{\prime\prime}$ primarily trace the compact nucleus, while NEOWISE variability reflects a mix of nuclear changes and warm-dust emission within the larger aperture. The preferred fit yields $M_\star \simeq 6.0\times10^{10},M_\odot$, ${\rm SFR}\simeq1.65,M_\odot,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, $M_{\rm dust}\simeq1.3\times10^{8},M_\odot$, and an effective dust temperature of $\sim23$ K. The decameter constraint gives $S_{28,{\rm MHz}}&lt;11.22$ Jy, consistent with expectations for a Milky Way-like system placed at 10.7 Mpc. We conclude that an integrated, homogeneous SED, especially below 100 MHz, provides a complementary diagnostic for identifying and validating MWAs and for interpreting how Milky Way properties would appear to an external observer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1D stellar mergers: entropy sorting and PyMMAMS</a><span class="id">[2512.14669]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar multiple systems are the norm, not the exception, with many systems undergoing interaction phases during their lifetimes. A subset of these interactions can lead to stellar mergers, where the two components of a stellar binary system come close enough to coalesce into a single star. Accurately modeling stellar mergers requires computationally expensive 3D methods, which are not suited for exploring large parameter spaces as required e.g., by population synthesis studies. In this work, we compare two 1D prescriptions based on the concept of entropy sorting to their 3D counterparts. We employ a basic entropy sorting method ('ES'), which builds the merger remnant by sorting the progenitor stars' shells by increasing entropy, and a Python version of the 'Make Me A Massive Star' code ('PM'), which additionally applies a shock-heating prescription calibrated on SPH simulations of stellar head-on collisions. Comparing to a set of 39 more recent SPH head-on collisions different from the ones used for PM calibration, we find that PM reproduces the outcome of these mergers a lot better than ES in terms of thermal and composition structure post-merger. Both 1D methods produce remnants that are rejuvenated more strongly than expected for massive stars, indicating that increased amounts of hydrogen are being mixed into the core. In an effort to further improve PM, we introduce a scaling factor for the shock-heating. We compare 1D models with both down- and up-scaled heating to a 3D MHD $9 + 8\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ merger of main-sequence stars. Decreasing the shock-heating improves the agreement in terms of the entropy profile, but has only a minor impact on the subsequent stellar evolution of the remnant. We find that 1D methods are able to approximate 3D stellar merger simulations well, and that shock-heating has to be considered to properly predict the post-merger structures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14695" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Observations of the Double Nucleus in NGC 4486B: Possible Evidence for a Recent Binary SMBH Merger and Recoil</a><span class="id">[2512.14695]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A recent study of the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B using JWST-NIRSpec IFU kinematics confirmed a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass $M_{BH}=3.6\pm0.7\times10^8$ ( 8% of the stellar mass). In addition to its double nucleus, the nuclear kinematics show pronounced asymmetries: a velocity-dispersion peak displaced by 6 pc from the galaxy center and a  16 km/s offset in the mean stellar line-of-sight velocity near the SMBH. We examine the origin of the 12 pc double nucleus and these asymmetries and show that the observations favor an SMBH surrounded by an eccentric nuclear disk (END). END formation models require the SMBH to experience a gravitational wave (GW) recoil following a binary SMBH merger. Our orbit-superposition models contain  50% retrograde stars at the edge of the nuclear region, in striking agreement with END-formation simulations. We infer a pre-merger mass ratio q&gt;0.15 and a recoil kick of  340 km/s. Our N-body simulations show that with such a kick, the SMBH returns to the center within  30 Myr. Its flat central core is also consistent with earlier binary black hole scouring. We test two alternative mechanisms-buoyancy-driven oscillations and a pre-merger SMBH binary-but neither reproduces the observed offsets, favoring the GW-kick scenario. Our direct N-body simulations further show that a prograde SMBH binary in a rotating host can stall in a corotation resonance, delaying coalescence. Thus, although NGC 4486B is an old, relaxed galaxy near the Virgo cluster center, its SMBH appears to have merged only recently, making its nucleus a rare nearby laboratory for studying post-merger SMBH dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Any Light Particle Searches with ALPS II: first science results</a><span class="id">[2512.14110]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The light-shining-through-a-wall experiment ALPS II at DESY in Hamburg searched for axions and similar lightweight particles in its first science campaign from February to May 2024.

This review provides a comprehensive explanation of the physical effects of dark matter self-interactions in objects ranging from galactic satellites (dark and luminous) to clusters of galaxies and the large-scale structure.

Stellar mass ($M_\star$) and star formation rate (SFR), are inferred by modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED). For galaxies triggering SMBH activity, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) contaminates the light at all wavelengths, hampering the inference of galaxy parameters. Incomplete AGN templates can lead to systematic overestimates of the stellar mass, biasing our understanding of AGN-galaxy co-evolution. This challenge has gained further impetus with the advent of sensitive wide-area surveys with millions of luminous AGN, including by eROSITA, Euclid and LSST. We aim to estimate the accuracy and bias of AGN host galaxy parameters and improve upon existing techniques. This work makes two contributions: 1) a new SED fitting code, GRAHSP, with a flexible, empirically motivated AGN model including a power law continuum emission lines, a FeII forest and a flexible infrared torus. We verify that our model reproduces published X-ray to infrared SEDs of AGN to better than 20\% accuracy. A fully Bayesian fit with nested sampling includes uncertainties in the model and the data, making the inference highly robust. 2) we created a benchmark photometric dataset where pure quasars are merged with non-AGN pure galaxies into a hybrid (Chimera) object but with known galaxy and AGN properties. Comparing the true and retrieved $M_\star$, SFR and AGN luminosities shows that previous codes systematically over-estimate $M_\star$ and SFR by 0.5 dex with a wide scatter of 0.7 dex, at AGN luminosities above 10^44 erg/s. In contrast, GRAHSP shows no bias on $M_\star$ and SFR. GRAHSP also estimates more realistic uncertainties. GRAHSP enables characterization of the environmental conditions conducive to black hole growth.

The bursty-sn model, driven by intense and episodic SN explosions, produces the highest fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR). Conversely, the smooth-sn model, characterized by gentler SN feedback, results in minimal SFR variability. The hyper-sn model, featuring a more realistic prescription that incorporates hypernova (HN) explosions, exhibits intermediate variability, closely aligning with the smooth-sn trend at lower redshifts. These fluctuations in SFR significantly affect the $\rm{M_{UV} - M_{halo}}$ relation, a proxy for UVLF variability. Among the models, bursty-sn produces the highest UVLF variability, with a maximum value of 2.5. In contrast, the smooth-sn and hyper-sn models show substantially lower variability, with maximum values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. However, in all cases, UVLF variability strongly correlates with host halo mass, with lower-mass halos showing greater variability due to more effective SN feedback in their shallower gravitational wells. The bursty-sn model, though, results in higher amplitudes. Variability decreases in lower mass haloes with decreasing redshift for all feedback models. This study underscores the critical role of SN feedback in shaping the UVLF, and highlights the mass and redshift dependence of its variability, suggesting that UVLF variability may alleviate the bright galaxy tension observed by JWST at high redshifts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09599" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hints of Primordial Magnetic Fields at Recombination and Implications for the Hubble Tension</a><span class="id">[2503.09599]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial Magnetic Fields (PMFs), long studied as relics of the early Universe, accelerate recombination and have been proposed as a way to relieve the Hubble tension. However, previous studies relied on simplified toy models. Here we use recent evaluations of recombination with PMFs, incorporating full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and detailed Lyman-alpha radiative transfer, to test PMF-enhanced recombination ($b\Lambda$CDM) against observational data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia supernovae (SN). Focusing on non-helical PMFs with a Batchelor spectrum, we find a preference for present-day total field strengths of approximately 5-10 pico-Gauss. Depending on the dataset combination, this preference ranges from mild ($\sim 1.8\sigma$ with Planck + DESI) to moderate ($\sim 3\sigma$ with Planck + DESI + SH0ES-calibrated SN) significance. The $b\Lambda$CDM has Planck + DESI $\chi^2$ values equal to or better than $\Lambda$CDM while predicting a higher Hubble constant. Future high-resolution CMB temperature and polarization measurements will be crucial for confirming or further constraining PMFs at recombination. Field strengths of 5-10 pico-Gauss align closely with those required for cluster magnetic fields to originate entirely from primordial sources, without the need for additional dynamo amplification.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bar ages derived for the first time in nearby galaxies: Insights on secular evolution from the TIMER sample</a><span class="id">[2503.20864]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Once galaxies settle their discs and become self-gravitating, stellar bars can form, driving the subsequent evolution of their host galaxy. Determining the ages of bars can therefore shed light on the epoch of the onset of secular evolution. In this work, we apply the first broadly applicable methodology to derive bar ages to a sample of 20 nearby galaxies. The method is based on the co-eval build-up of nuclear structures and bars and involves using IFS data from the MUSE instrument on VLT to disentangle the SFH of the nuclear disc from the background population. This allows us to derive the formation epoch of the nuclear disc and, thus, of the bar. We estimate the bar formation epoch of nearby galaxies - mostly from the TIMER survey-, creating the largest sample of galaxies with known bar ages to date. We find bar formation epochs between 1 and 13 Gyr ago, illustrating how disc-settling and bar formation are processes that first took place in the early Universe and are still taking place in some galaxies. We infer the bar fraction over cosmological time with our sample, finding remarkable agreement with that obtained from direct studies of galaxies at high redshifts. Additionally, for the first time, we can investigate secular evolution processes taking into account the ages of bars. Our results agree with the scenario in which bars aid the quenching of the host galaxy, with galaxies hosting older bars tending to be more &quot;quenched&quot;. We also find that older bars tend to be longer, stronger, and host larger nuclear discs. Furthermore, we find evidence of the nuclear disc stellar mass build-up over time. On the other hand, we find no evidence of downsizing playing a role in bar formation, since we find that bar age is independent of galaxy stellar mass. With the means to estimate bar ages, we can begin to understand better when and how bars shape the observed properties of disc galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The dynamical lineage of ultra-diffuse galaxies from TNG50-1</a><span class="id">[2506.22074]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formation and evolution of the ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) continues to remain a puzzle. Similarities and differences in the morphological and the kinematical properties of the UDGs with their possible precursors, namely low-surface brightness (LSBs), L*-type high-surface brightness (HSBs) and dwarf galaxies, may provide crucial constraints on their origin and evolution. We selected samples of UDGs, LSBs, HSBs and dwarfs from TNG50-1. We first obtained a few possible scaling relations involving some mass properties to analyse if the regression fits for UDGs are in compliance with those of the other samples. Then, we studied individual galaxy cutouts to evaluate the intrinsic shapes of their dark-matter (DM) and stellar components, orbital and kinematical properties related to their stellar velocity dispersion. Finally, we constructed the mock IFU data using the SimSpin code to extract the stellar kinematic moment maps. We observe that the UDGs and the dwarf galaxies have nearly similar regression fits in a. stellar-to-gas mass ratio vs gas mass, b. stellar-to-gas mass ratio vs total dynamical mass, c. stellar central surface density vs ratio of stellar-to-total dynamical mass, and d. total baryonic mass vs total dynamical mass parameter spaces. Next, we find that the isolated UDGs are prolate rotators similar to the dwarf population, while the tidally-bound UDGs can exhibit both prolate and oblate-rotating shapes. The DM and stellar velocity anisotropy properties of the UDGs suggest that they reside in a cored, dwarf-like halo and may be classified by early-type galaxies. Finally, the stellar kinematic properties suggest that both the UDGs and the dwarfs are slow-rotators having low to nearly no-rotations in contrast to the late-type, disc-dominated, fast-rotating LSBs and HSBs. Therefore, we may conclude that the UDGs and the dwarfs possibly have a common dynamical lineage.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord of LRDs: Insights into a &quot;Little Red Dot&quot; with a low-ionization spectrum at z = 0.1</a><span class="id">[2507.23774]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar &quot;V&quot;-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as &quot;Little Red Dots&quot; (LRDs).

We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at $z=0.1$, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in a JWST-selected LRD at $z=2.26$. We find small but statistically significant variability in the H$\alpha$ of SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 consistent with previous findings. Finally, we report new observations with NuSTAR. We confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with $N_{\rm H}&gt;10^{24}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03248" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpha effect and dynamo in density-stratified turbulence with large-scale shear: applications to protoplanetary discs and astrophysical clouds</a><span class="id">[2509.03248]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A joint effect of the density-stratified turbulence (or inhomogeneous turbulence) and a large-scale shear for arbitrary Mach numbers results in the $\alpha$ effect and mean-field dynamo action.

The faint NSCs tend to have a constant color profile, whereas the bright ones have a bluer center, suggesting that the most massive NSCs in our sample might have experienced a mixed formation scenario, including in-situ star formation. A significant portion of our NSCs tend to be more massive than for other galaxy samples of similar stellar mass, which could be due to some dwarfs ongoing tidal disruption or an initial formation of massive NSCs from multiple GC mergers and in-situ star forming activity. More observations of resolved NSC are needed to be able to infer their formation scenario from the structural properties and photometry in dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The HITRAN2024 methane update</a><span class="id">[2511.21840]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spectroscopic parameters of methane from many different studies were gathered to improve the HITRAN database towards its 2024 version.

With this calibration, we estimate argon abundances (Ar/O) of $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 2.26$ bin and $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.11}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 3.15$ bin, suggesting minimal SNe Ia and dominant CCSNe enrichment in this sample. Comparison of our abundance measurements of $z\sim 2-3$ AURORA galaxies with chemical evolution modeling of Milky Way stars shows consistency with the Milky Way Bulge component, suggesting a rapid star-formation timescale. However, even larger samples of actively star-forming galaxies with available argon abundances, as well as comparisons between argon abundance and other critical galaxy properties (e.g., sSFR) and models (e.g., one tuned specifically to this redshift range) are needed to draw stronger conclusions on the role of argon in galactic chemical enrichment at Cosmic Noon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05724" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Misspecification-robust amortised simulation-based inference using variational methods</a><span class="id">[2509.05724]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately represents the underlying data generative process (DGP), recent work has shown that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses a significant issue for their use in real-world problems, due to simulators always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a data-driven manner without adopting hyperparameters or priors governing the misspecification influence.</p></div></details></article>

The Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) will be at the forefront of this quest. The Planetary Camera and Spectrograph (PCS) on ESO's ELT and GmagAO-X on the GMT are planned to become operational in the 2035-2040 time-frame, allowing the characterisation of up to dozen(s) of rocky planets around nearby red dwarf stars.

The study focuses on determining key atmospheric properties, including molecular composition, cloud and haze characteristics, and temperature structure, across planets of varying sizes and orbital separations. Leveraging reflected light spectroscopy and polarimetry, HWO will enable comparative planetology of cool gas giants orbiting both solar-type and M-dwarf stars, bridging the observational gap between hot exoplanets and Solar System giants. We present observational requirements and survey strategies necessary to uncover correlations between atmospheric properties and planetary or stellar parameters. This effort will establish critical constraints on planetary formation, cloud microphysics, and the role of photochemistry under diverse irradiation conditions.

Recent detections of optical millisecond pulsations from three systems in distinct evolutionary stages have opened an entirely new observational window to investigate particle acceleration, pulsar-disk interplay, and intrabinary wind interactions. These discoveries reveal unexpectedly diverse emission mechanisms across accretion regimes, with optical efficiencies in some systems far exceeding those predicted by rotation-powered models. Despite decades of research, key questions remain unresolved: are optical pulsations a universal property of MSPs? How does the presence of an accretion disk boost the conversion of spin-down power into coherent optical emission? What physical processes drive the observed fast variability, and how do pulsar and companion winds regulate mass transfer and binary evolution? Addressing these fundamental problems requires high-time-resolution optical observations, rapid-response observing capabilities, and time-resolved spectroscopy at moderate spectral resolution to map disk and intrabinary-shock variability. Future facilities dedicated to time domain astronomy present a unique opportunity to perform a systematic exploration of optical pulsars across all MSP evolutionary stages for the first time and answer the above-mentioned fundamental questions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vertically resolved minimal-set k-distribution for thermal infrared absorption in the Venus atmosphere</a><span class="id">[2512.14120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The original k-distribution technique is applied to parameterize absorption of thermal radiation in the lower and middle atmosphere of Venus. It is developed for modeling scenarios in which the cost of full radiative transfer calculations necessitates the use of efficient and simplified parameterizations, such as climate modeling. Line-by-line reference modeling based on a Monte Carlo radiative transfer method is embedded into the construction of the k-terms, providing explicit control over accuracy. Using 16 spectral bands spanning 10–6000 cm^{-1}, the method produces 32 k-terms and 16 per-band spectral points for computing Venus cloud optical properties. Vertical resolution of the resulting k-terms is a key advantage, as it avoids the inter-level correlation assumption inherent to the correlated-k method. Height-dependent k(z) functions are supplied on the same vertical grid as the input temperature-pressure profile, enabling direct use in radiative transfer solvers and eliminating the need for vertical interpolation. The implementation yields plausible accuracy below 90 km, with cooling-rate errors of about 1 K day^{-1} and flux errors below 1 percent, while reducing the number of k-terms by a factor of approximately 2.5–3 relative to typical correlated-k approaches. A Fortran driver for generating k(z) functions for arbitrary Venus atmospheric profiles is provided in a public repository.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Alignment of High-resolution Solar Prominence Images Observed by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope</a><span class="id">[2512.14201]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High spatial resolution observation of solar prominence is an important observation subject of the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST). While the current level of observation and image reconstruction technologies for solar prominences are advanced, a significant challenge remains in achieving high-precision alignment among high-resolution prominence images observed at different times and different off-bands. Existing alignment approaches either become ineffective or yield low accuracy, and always require manual intervention during the alignment. These limitations are largely due to the stronger edge gradient and lower structural contrast of the prominence images compared with the solar surface ones. In response to this challenge, our study aims to develop an effective and robust algorithm for high-precision alignment of the prominence images. We thoroughly consider the unique structural characteristics of prominence images and the specific application conditions of various alignment algorithms. Consequently, we propose a comprehensive alignment method that incorporates the optical flow field of the solar surface, the gradient of the solar edge, and the cross-correlation within the solar prominence region. This method is designed to accurately determine the movement displacements among the prominence images. Our results demonstrate that this alignment method excels in both accuracy and robustness, making it well-suited for handling the diverse postures of solar prominence images captured by the NVST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ORCA-TWIN qCMOS Project I.

First, from the ground, we fit the data using a reference calibration signal (a diode) introduced to resolve degeneracies among the various instrument angles. Finally, we utilize on-sky observations of Tau A and the Moon to validate the results. By creating calibration datasets obtained with the reference diode, we evaluate the data quality and quantify phase switch errors to account for the fine polarization response. We also utilize Tau A and Moon observations to calibrate the system's response and stability over time. In addition, we calculate the refraction index of the Moon to be $n_{Moon}$ = 1.209 $\pm$ 0.007 (stat) $\pm$ 0.005 (sys) at 31 GHz under smooth-surface assumption. The results from fitting the instrument phase-switch error angle align with 0 deg at 2$\sigma$ precision, indicating that no further correction is required within a few percent precision. The calibrations with astrophysical sources (Tau A and the Moon) yield consistent results that constrain the polarization angle and responsivity. The polarization efficiency aligns well with ground measurements and the Tau A characterization, whereas the Moon-based calibration is more affected by systematics. We find hints of responsivity variations over time, although the relative responsivity between channels is found to remain stable. In the future, we conclude that installing a live calibrator will enhance performance by continuously monitoring responsivity and, in turn, improving the mitigation of systematic effects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Time-domain astronomy</a><span class="id">[2512.14470]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We outline the science case for a 30-40 m optical/infrared telescope in the Northern Hemisphere, optimised for transformative time-domain astronomy in the 2040s.

Here we present a data augmentation pipeline for images and light curves that mitigates these issues, and apply this to improve classification of Superluminous Supernovae Type I (SLSNe-I) and Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) with our existing NEEDLE code. The method uses a Similarity Index to remove image artefacts, and a masking procedure that removes unrelated sources while preserving the transient and its host. This focuses classifier attention on the relevant pixels, and enables arbitrary rotations for class upsampling. We also fit observed multi-band light curves with a two-dimensional Gaussian Process and generate data-driven synthetic samples by resampling and redshifting these models, cross-matching with galaxy images in the same class to produce unique but realistic new examples for training.

However, if the Backlink shows asymmetry between the two propagation directions, the effective optical pathlengths of the counter-propagating beams can introduce a differential phase noise, called non-reciprocity, into the main interferometric measurement that will limit the achievable accuracy in time-delay interferometry (TDI) post-processing. Hence, it is important to understand the properties of the Backlink to ensure that it will not compromise the interferometric detection. The Three-Backlink Experiment (3BL), which consists of an optical test facility with two rotatable benches, was designed under the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) framework to study the performance of three Backlink configurations: two fiber-based and one free-beam scheme. In this paper, we report recent experimental results from the 3BL. We describe the commissioning and the subsequent noise mitigation. We achieve a setup noise floor below $1\text{ pm}\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ across most of the LISA measurement band, and provide an understanding of the current technical limitations. With this low-noise baseline, we measured the performance of the three Backlink implementations under non-rotational conditions. We show that all three Backlinks reach sub-picometer non-reciprocity levels across most of the frequency band, with the remaining part dominated by the mentioned testbed noise. This enabled us to conduct a preliminary study of the Backlink inherent noise, where we emphasized on the backscatter noise intrinsic to a straightforward fiber-based Backlink, as this is the current baseline for LISA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14485" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Construction techniques and commissioning of the Three-Backlink Experiment for the LISA mission</a><span class="id">[2512.14485]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Designed to detect gravitational waves in the lower-frequency band, the space mission LISA will open a new window to astronomy after its launch in the 2030s.
