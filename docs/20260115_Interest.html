<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19672" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reframing the Free Will Debate: The Universe is Not Deterministic</a><span class="id">[2503.19672]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Free will discourse is primarily centred around the thesis of determinism. Much of the literature takes determinism as its starting premise, assuming it true for the sake of discussion, and then proceeds to present arguments for why, if determinism is true, free will would be either possible or impossible. This is reflected in the theoretical terrain of the debate, with the primary distinction currently being between compatibilists and incompatibilists and not, as one might expect, between free will realists and skeptics. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we argue that there is no reason to accept such a framing. We show that, on the basis of modern physics, there is no good evidence that physical determinism of any variety provides an accurate description of our universe and lots of evidence against such a view. Moreover, we show that this analysis extends equally to the sort of indeterministic worldviews endorsed by many libertarian philosophers and their skeptics, a worldview which we refer to as determinism plus randomness. The papers secondary aim is therefore to present an alternative conception of indeterminism, which is more in line with the empirical evidence from physics. It is this indeterministic worldview, we suggest, that ought to be the central focus of a reframed philosophy of free will.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effects of Physics Teaching Materials on Student Critical Thinking and Creative Thinking Skills: A Meta-Analysis</a><span class="id">[2601.09144]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rapid advancement of technology and science education demands innovative approaches to develop students' critical and creative thinking skills. However, there is limited systematic evidence about the effectiveness of different physics teaching materials in fostering these essential 21st century skills. This study aims to investigate the effect of physics teaching materials on critical thinking skills and creative thinking skills of high school students through a comprehensive meta-analysis of recent research. Using purposive sampling, 20 articles from national journals published between 2019-2023 were analyzed. The results revealed three key findings: (1) physics teaching materials showed varying degrees of effectiveness across different formats, with modules and student worksheets demonstrating the highest effect sizes (3.93 and 3.97 respectively); (2) physics teaching materials significantly enhanced students' critical thinking skills with a high effect size category (3.97); and (3) these materials effectively improved creative thinking skills with a high effect size category (2.97). These findings provide valuable insights for educators and curriculum developers in designing and implementing effective physics teaching materials.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technology Integration in the Project Based Learning Model: Bibliometric Analysis 2015-2024</a><span class="id">[2601.09149]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications discussing technology integration in the Project-Based Learning (PjBL) model during the 2015-2024 period. With the evolving 21st century educational paradigm, PjBL has emerged as one of the most promising pedagogical approaches. In this context, the integration of technology in PjBL becomes an important catalyst that expands the scope and depth of learning experiences while preparing students to face challenges in the digital era. This research applies a bibliometric analysis methodology and systematic literature review, utilizing the Publish or Perish (POP) application for data collection and VOSviewer for data analysis and visualization. The results reveal emerging research trends, collaboration patterns, and focus areas in the scientific literature related to technology integration in PjBL. The bibliometric analysis uncovers research dynamics and knowledge gaps that need to be addressed. These findings provide valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in optimizing the implementation of technology-based PjBL and formulating educational policies responsive to technological developments and 21st-century learning needs. The results of this study are expected to contribute significantly to the academic community and educational practitioners in developing more effective technology based PjBL implementation strategies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration to advance education in the digital age.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experimental verification of the conservation of the magnetic moment and the longitudinal invariant</a><span class="id">[2601.09189]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Adiabatic invariants are fundamental to plasma physics but are often treated as purely theoretical concepts in undergraduate courses due to the difficulty of experimentally demonstrating them. This paper presents a pedagogical experiment to visualize and quantitatively verify the conservation of the magnetic moment ($\mu$) and the longitudinal invariant ($J$) using a standard educational electron charge-to-mass ratio apparatus configured as a magnetic bottle. By analyzing long-exposure photographs of the electron beam trajectory, we reconstructed the helical motion and calculated the invariants under different magnetic field configurations. Our results verify the conservation of the longitudinal invariant ($J$) with a ratio of 0.98 between configurations. The magnetic moment ($\mu$) exhibited a coefficient of variation of approximately 7\%, a deviation consistent with the presence of collisional effects in the tube. These findings demonstrate that complex plasma dynamics can be effectively studied using accessible laboratory equipment, providing a valuable bridge between theory and experiment for physics students.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Personalized Multimodal Feedback Using Multiple External Representations: Strategy Profiles and Learning in High School Physics</a><span class="id">[2601.09470]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Multiple external representations (MERs) and personalized feedback support physics learning, yet evidence on how personalized feedback can effectively integrate MERs remains limited. This question is particularly timely given the emergence of multimodal large language models. We conducted a 16-24 week observational study in high school physics (N=661) using a computer-based platform that provided verification and optional elaborated feedback in verbal, graphical and mathematical forms. Linear mixed-effects models and strategy-cluster analyses (ANCOVA-adjusted comparisons) tested associations between feedback use and post-test performance and moderation by representational competence. Elaborated multirepresentational feedback showed a small but consistent positive association with post-test scores independent of prior knowledge and confidence. Learners adopted distinct representation-selection strategies; among students with lower representational competence, using a diverse set of representations related to higher learning, whereas this advantage diminished as competence increased. These findings motivate adaptive feedback designs and inform intelligent tutoring systems capable of tailoring feedback elaboration and representational format to learner profiles, advancing personalized instruction in physics education.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introducing the Physics of Complex Systems through Videogames</a><span class="id">[2601.06230]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The purpose of this work is to explore a teaching methodology aimed at communicating topics and subjects not typically studied and analyzed in the (Italian) secondary school. We focused specifically on the use of videogames as a recreational and educational tool, grounding our approach in a broadened conceptual view in which engagement and attentional allocation interact with motivational and affective components of play. Within this perspective, the playful format is considered not only to enhance motivation and enjoyment, but also to attenuate learners' counter-arguing tendencies when confronted with unfamiliar or abstract material. Building on this framework, we developed or adapted several videogames whose central scientific topics are phase transitions, sensitivity to initial conditions, and synchronization. We had a certain number of high school students playing the games, and we asked them several questions to guide them and determine whether the communication was successful. At the end of the activity, we administered a questionnaire about the enjoyment and the difficulties encountered in each game, and the relevant critics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07635" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learning About Learning: A Physics Path from Spin Glasses to Artificial Intelligence</a><span class="id">[2601.07635]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability – from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems – it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.</p></div></details></article></body>
