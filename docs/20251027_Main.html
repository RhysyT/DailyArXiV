The original dataset consists of 12 waterfall plots for each event, which contain key information about the prompt emission of each GRB. The dataset's dimensionality is first reduced to a 30-dimensional latent space using an autoencoder, and subsequently to 2D using UMAP. While the methodology and results are discussed in a previous work ( arXiv:2406.03643 ), here we introduce a statistical approach to evaluate the reliability of the final 2D distribution based on the scDEED algorithm. Our analysis shows that the 2D embedding demonstrates overall good reliability, with more than 90\% of the events classified as trustworthy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20876" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swampland Conjectures through ACT Observations: Observational Signatures of Radiative-Corrected Inflation</a><span class="id">[2510.20876]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the consistency of radiatively corrected inflationary models with both the latest observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) combined with Planck 2018 and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and the theoretical constraints imposed by the swampland program. We systematically test two distinct models against three key swampland conjectures: the further refined de Sitter swampland conjecture (FRDSSC), the scalar weak gravity conjecture (SWGC), and the strong scalar weak gravity conjecture (SSWGC). Model I, based on radiatively corrected Higgs inflation, satisfies the FRDSSC and remains consistent with current observational constraints ($n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, $r &lt; 0.038$), but fails to meet the SWGC and SSWGC requirements, indicating limited theoretical compatibility with quantum gravity principles. In contrast, Model II, incorporating radiative corrections with scalar sectors, demonstrates full consistency by satisfying all three swampland conjectures simultaneously while maintaining observational viability. The compatibility of Model II is highly sensitive to the non-minimal coupling $\xi$ and renormalization scales $\mu_b$, with larger values extending the range of swampland-consistent solutions. Our results highlight the critical role of radiative corrections in achieving simultaneous theoretical and observational consistency, and identify Model II as a promising candidate for a fully viable inflationary scenario within the swampland framework. This work provides a methodology for classifying inflationary models based on their swampland compatibility, demonstrating that satisfaction of the FRDSSC alone is insufficient for full theoretical consistency.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It's always the quiet ones: Single Degenerate Double Detonation Type Ia Supernova from Quiescent Helium Accretion</a><span class="id">[2510.20904]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a sub-Chandrasekhar mass double detonation pathway for Type Ia supernovae arising from single degenerate helium accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. Building on our previous one dimensional study of recurrent helium novae (Hillman et al. 2025), we evolve a 0.7 solar mass white dwarf through steady accretion at 10^-8 Msun yr^-1 until it reaches 1.1 solar mass, yielding realistic, time evolved helium rich profiles. These profiles are mapped into FLASH simulations, incorporating nuclear burning for helium and carbon-oxygen detonation, in multi-dimensional hydrodynamic runs. A localized, modest temperature perturbation near the base of the helium shell robustly triggers an outward helium-shell detonation. The ensuing inward propagating shock converges in the carbon-oxygen core, igniting a secondary detonation that unbinds the star. We obtain a Ni56 yield of  0.64 solar mass, an intermediate-mass element (Si-Ca) mass of  0.41 solar mass, and maximum ejecta velocities approaching 22,000 km/s, values consistent with normal Type Ia supernovae. Our results demonstrate that recurrent helium accretors, typically quiescent over long timescales, can evolve under subtle, &quot;quiet&quot; conditions to trigger robust double detonations, supporting their role as viable progenitors of sub-Chandrasekhar mass Type Ia supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiwavelength view of circumstellar interaction in supernovae</a><span class="id">[2510.20913]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The interaction of post-explosion supernova ejecta with the surrounding circumstellar medium creates emission across the electromagnetic spectrum. Since the circumstellar medium is created by the mass lost from the progenitor star, it carries tell-tale signatures of the progenitor. Consequently, observations and modeling of radiation produced by the interaction in various types of supernovae have provided valuable insights into their progenitors. Detailed studies have shown that the interaction in supernovae begins and sustains over various timescales and lengthscales, with differing mass-loss rates in distinct sub-classes. This reveals diverse progenitor histories for these stellar explosions. This review paper summarizes various supernova subtypes, linking them to stellar death pathways, and presents an updated supernova classification diagram. We then present a multi-wavelength study of circumstellar interaction in different supernova classes. We also present unpublished Chandra X-ray as well as radio observations of a type IIn supernova, SN 2010jl, which allow us to extend its circumstellar interaction studies to about 7 years post-explosion. The new data indicates that the extreme mass-loss rate 0.1 Msun/yr in SN 2010jl, reported by Chandra et al. (2015), commenced within the last 300 years before the explosion. We summarize the current status of the field and argue that via detailed studies of the circumstellar interaction, a.k.a. Time Machine technique, one of the big mysteries of stellar evolution, i.e., mapping supernovae progenitors to their explosive outcomes can be solved.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20946" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayesian and Deterministic Neural Network approaches to Faraday Cup calibration and plasma parameter estimation</a><span class="id">[2510.20946]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We describe a novel scheme for analyzing particle detector measurements when a well-calibrated, similarly instrumented spacecraft is present in a similar orbit. To prepare ground truth from measurements provided by a reference spacecraft, the method uses dynamic time warping (DTW)–a technique often used for pattern-matching in time series data. An artificial neural network (ANN) is created and trained to reproduce this ground truth from measurements at the target spacecraft. Unlike previous approaches, this procedure is insensitive to calibration errors in the target data stream, as the neural network may be trained from poorly calibrated particle spectra or even directly from low-level data in engineering units. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept by training an ANN to estimate solar wind proton densities, temperatures, and speeds from the DSCOVR PlasMag Faraday Cup, using the \textit{Wind} Solar Wind Experiment as a reference. We present both deterministic and Bayesian neural network approaches. Applications for Parker Solar Probe, HelioSwarm, and other missions are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Background solutions to the Hubble tension in $f(Q)$ gravity and consistency with BAO measurements</a><span class="id">[2510.20964]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We test whether $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel theories of gravity are capable of solving the Hubble tension while producing consistency with DESI DR2 BAO. We consider three different forms for the $f(Q)$ function: logarithmic, exponential, and hyperbolic tangent. We also consider extensions of these models by adding the Cosmological constant, and compare to phenomenological models with a flexible double exponential addition to the standard $\Lambda$CDM $H(z)$. We test these models against DESI DR2 BAO, Planck 2018, Local $H_0$, and Cosmic Chronometers data. The logarithmic and hyperbolic tangent models do not provide an adequate solution, while the exponential model gives a reasonable solution, though it faces mild tension with the BAO data. The models assisted by the cosmological constant perform slightly better than the exponential, at the cost of reduced theoretical motivation. This highlights the difficulties of finding a theoretically motivated solution to the Hubble tension while producing BAO consistency. The phenomenological models are able to achieve a good fit to all data, giving guidelines for what a background solution to the Hubble tension would look like in general.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relation between sunspots and solar EUV irradiance changes during the Gleissberg cycle</a><span class="id">[2510.20988]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sunspots are the standard measure of solar magnetic activity, which are also used to estimate solar spectral irradiance over centennial time scales. However, because of the lack of homogeneous, century-long spectral measurements, the long-term relation of sunspots and spectral irradiance has not been independently validated. Here we aim to study the relation between sunspots and solar extreme ultra-violet (EUV) irradiance during the last 130 years, over the latest Gleissberg cycle, also called the Modern Maximum, when sunspot cycle heights varied by a factor of 2.5. We calculate the daily variation of the geomagnetic declination at six reliable, long-running stations, whose amplitude (or range) can be used as a centennial proxy of solar EUV irradiance. We also compare this geomagnetic proxy to the solar MgII index of EUV irradiance over the 40-year interval of overlap. We find that sunspot activity dominated over EUV irradiance when cycle heights increased in the early 20th century during the growth and maximum of the Modern Maximum, but EUV irradiance dominated over sunspots during the decay of the MM, when cycle heights decreased in the late 1900s. Our results suggest that the spot-facula ratio varies during Gleissberg cycle -type large oscillations of solar/stellar activity. This modifies the estimated stellar evolution of the relation between brightness and chromospheric activity of the Sun and Sun-like stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parametrisation of the wave-zonal flow interactions taking into account the full Coriolis acceleration. The necessity of going beyond the traditional approximation in the sub-inertial regime and in weakly stratified regions</a><span class="id">[2510.21013]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>From the Earth's atmosphere and oceans to stellar radiation zones, inertia-gravity waves, which are called gravito-inertial waves (hereafter GIWs) in Astrophysics, are transporting momentum and mixing matter when they are damped through heat and viscous diffusions and when they break. Their short-time scale dynamics is governed by the buoyancy force and the Coriolis acceleration. Because of the transport they trigger, they modify the long-term evolution of the large-scale planetary atmospheric (oceanic) circulation and of the structure and rotation of stars. In many state-of-the-art models, the so-called Traditional Approximation of Rotation (hereafter denoted TAR), where the local projection of the rotation vector along the horizontal direction is neglected, is assumed. We aim to identify the applicability regime of this approximation and to propose a non-traditional parametrisation of wave - zonal flow interactions, in which the full Coriolis acceleration is taken into account. We build a prototype local non-traditional Cartesian model in which we take into account the full Coriolis acceleration, buoyancy, and heat and viscous diffusions. On the one hand, the TAR is strongly underestimating GIWs damping in the sub-inertial regime. In this regime a non-traditional modelling must be adopted to predict the correct altitude where momentum is deposited, which is closer to the excitation region of waves than the one predicted using the TAR. On the other hand, non-traditional modellings of GIWs convective and shear-induced breakings are proposed. Taking into account the full Coriolis acceleration leads to a stronger inhibition of the efficiency of the convective and shear-induced overturnings and to a weaker transport than those predicted when assuming the TAR. Finally, a fully non-traditional parametrisation of GIWs - mean zonal flows interaction is derived.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncovering Solar Wind Phenomena with iSAX, HDBSCAN, Human-in-the-loop and PSP Observations</a><span class="id">[2510.21042]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The solar wind is a dynamic plasma outflow that shapes heliospheric conditions and drives space weather. Identifying its large-scale phenomena is crucial, yet the increasing volume of high-cadence Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations poses challenges for scalable, interpretable analysis. We present a pipeline combining symbolic compression, density-based clustering, and human-in-the-loop validation. Applied to 2018-2024 PSP data, it efficiently processes over 150 GB of magnetic and plasma measurements, recovering known structures, detecting uncatalogued CMEs and transient events, and demonstrating robustness across multiple time scales. A key outcome is the systematic use of the magnetic deflection angle ($\theta_B$) as a unifying metric across solar wind phenomena. This framework provides a scalable, interpretable, expert-validated approach to solar wind analysis, producing expanded event catalogs and supporting improved space weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photospheric Chemical Depletion in Post-AGB/Post-RGB Binaries with Second-Generation Protoplanetary Discs</a><span class="id">[2510.21070]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin and evolution of chemical elements in the Universe are governed not only by nucleosynthesis processes in stars, but also by mechanisms that alter observed photospheric compositions. Among these, chemical depletion (underabundance of refractory elements in stellar photospheres) presents a key puzzle in understanding the full chemical lifecycle. This PhD thesis explores the role of disc-binary interaction in shaping chemical abundances in evolved low- and intermediate-mass binary stars, focusing on systems that have undergone the red giant branch (RGB) or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. In this thesis, we investigate binary systems containing post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB, $L_{\rm post-AGB}\,\gtrsim\,2\,500\,L_\odot$) and post-red giant branch (post-RGB, $L_{\rm post-RGB}\,\lesssim\,2\,500\,L_\odot$) binaries as key tracers of AGB/RGB nucleosynthesis. Although the effects of these interactions remain poorly understood, they are known to drive photospheric chemical depletion. This depletion closely resembles that observed in young planet-hosting stars with protoplanetary discs. Combined with other structural and dynamical similarities in disc properties, this suggests a potential link to second-generation planet formation in post-AGB/RGB binaries with circumbinary discs. Although direct imaging of such planets is not feasible, studying signatures such as photospheric depletion provides an indirect means of exploring their possible presence within these systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backmapping of the High- and Low-latitude Solar Wind under Multiple Heliospheric and Coronal Magnetic Field Configurations</a><span class="id">[2510.21076]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar wind backmapping is a critical technique for analyzing the origin of the solar wind and space weather events by correlating in situ measurements with solar remote-sensing observations. This technique typically traces magnetic field lines using a heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) model coupled with a coronal magnetic field (CMF). However, the impact of different HMF and CMF configurations on backmapping uncentainty-particularly regarding high-latitude solar wind-remains inadequately quantified. This study comprehensively evaluates solar wind backmapping by combining two HMF models (Parker spiral, Fisk-type) with three CMF models (Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS), Potential Field Current Sheet (PFCS), Current Sheet Source Surface (CSSS)). Our analysis primarily uses in situ measurements from Ulysses and remote-sensing data from STEREO-A. Key findings are that: (1) while both Fisk and Parker HMF models show comparable consistency with measured magnetic field strength and polarity, they produce certain longitudinal displacements in their back-mapped footpoints on the source surface (2.5$R_{\odot}$); (2) For CMF models (PFSS, PFCS, CSSS), predicted photospheric footpoints exhibit minor variations for high/mid-latitude solar wind but some divergences for ecliptic/low-latitude wind; (3) All three CMF models link high/mid-latitude wind to active regions or coronal holes, yet associate a fraction of ecliptic/low-latitude wind with quiet-Sun regions; (4) Ecliptic/low-latitude sources show significantly stronger dependence on the PFSS source surface height compared to high-latitude wind. These results demonstrate that simpler models (PFSS + Parker) appear reasonably adequate for polar coronal hole wind studies, while low-latitude/ecliptic solar wind exhibits the heightened sensitivity to model choices.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detecting Population III Gamma-Ray Bursts in the Era of EP and SVOM</a><span class="id">[2510.21097]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), putative counterparts of massive, low-metallicity Population III (Pop III) stars, are a promising probe of the first stars. We assess the detectability of these Pop III GRBs using a metallicity-based progenitor criterion and cosmological $N$-body/hydrodynamical simulations with three distinct Pop III initial mass functions (IMFs), focusing on the capabilities of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) aboard the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}) and the coded-mask gamma-ray imager (ECLAIRs) aboard the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}). Our population synthesis model, calibrated to \emph{Swift} data, predicts the following Population II/I (Pop II/I) GRB detection rates at $z&gt;6$: $\sim2.4\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{EP}/WXT and $\sim0.9\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs. For the IMF with very massive first stars ($\mathrm{100\textrm{--}500\,M_\odot}$), we derive upper limits on the Pop III GRB rate at $z&gt;6$ of $&lt;0.06\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{EP}/WXT) and $&lt;0.13\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs), based on the absence of confirmed Pop III progenitors in \emph{Swift} bursts at $z&gt;5.5$. Our results indicate that while Pop III GRBs are subdominant to Pop II/I GRBs at $z&lt;10$, their fractional contribution rises significantly with redshift, reaching $\sim8\%$ ($\sim34\%$) at $z&gt;10$ and $\sim28\%$ ($\sim68\%$) at $z&gt;16$ for \emph{EP}/WXT (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs). This trend is systematically enhanced in the other two IMF models, which adopt a lower stellar mass range of $\mathrm{[0.1,\,100]\,M_\odot}$. We conclude that detecting Pop III GRBs at high redshifts is a realistic prospect, and any GRB detected at $z&gt;16$ is most likely of Pop III origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observation of In-ice Askaryan Radiation from High-Energy Cosmic Rays</a><span class="id">[2510.21104]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first experimental evidence for in-ice Askaryan radiation – coherent charge-excess radio emission – from high-energy particle cascades developing in the Antarctic ice sheet. In 208 days of data recorded with the phased-array instrument of the Askaryan Radio Array, a previous analysis has incidentally identified 13 events with impulsive radiofrequency signals originating from below the ice surface. We here present a detailed reanalysis of these events. The observed event rate, radiation arrival directions, signal shape, spectral content, and electric field polarization are consistent with in-ice Askaryan radiation from cosmic ray air shower cores impacting the ice sheet. For the brightest events, the angular radiation pattern favors an extended cascade-like emitter over a pointlike source. An origin from the geomagnetic separation of charges in cosmic ray air showers is disfavored by the arrival directions and polarization. Considering the arrival angles, timing properties, and the impulsive nature of the passing events, the event rate is inconsistent with the estimation of the combined background from thermal noise events and on-surface events at the level of $5.1\,\sigma$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dissipation and particle acceleration at intermittent structures with velocity and magnetic shear: Interaction of Kelvin-Helmholtz and Drift-Kink instabilities</a><span class="id">[2510.21187]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations of a magnetized, collisionless, relativistic pair plasma subjected to combined velocity and magnetic-field shear, a scenario typical at intermittent structures in plasma turbulence. We create conditions where only the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and Drift-Kink (DK) instabilities can develop, while tearing modes are forbidden. The interaction of DKI and KHI generates qualitatively new structures, marked by a thickened shear layer with very weak electromagnetic field, modulated by KH vortices. Over a range of moderately strong velocity shears explored, the interaction of DKI and KHI results in a significant enhancement of dissipation over cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. Moreover, we observe a new and efficient way of particle acceleration where particles are stochastically accelerated by the motional electric field exterior to the shear layer as they meander in an S-shaped pattern in and out of it. This process takes advantage of the bent geometry of the shear layer caused by the DK-KHI interaction and is responsible for most of the highest-energy particles produced in our simulations. These results further our understanding of dissipation and particle acceleration at intermittent structures, which are present in plasma turbulence across a wide range of astrophysical contexts such as in AGN jet sheaths, potentially relevant to limb-brightened emission, etc., and highlight the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple interacting instabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their nonlinear interaction at the kinetic level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of Quasi-periodic Oscillations in the $γ$-Ray Light Curve of 4FGL J0309.9-6058</a><span class="id">[2510.21205]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we report, for the first time, a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the $\gamma$-ray band of 4FGL J0309.9-6058, also known as PKS 0308-611. We employed three analytical methods (the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, REDFIT, and the weighted wavelet Z-transform) to analyze the QPO signal using \textit{Fermi} $\gamma$-ray light curve data. The analysis reveals a potential QPO during MJD 57983$-$60503, with a period of approximately 550 days and a maximum local significance of 3.72$\sigma$ and global significance of 2.72$\sigma$ derived from the WWZ analysis. To validate this result, we applied Gaussian Process (GP) to the same light curve, which independently confirms the presence of QPO signal consistent with our Fourier-based results. We further extended the analysis to the full duration of the \textit{Fermi} observations, and the results consistently support and strengthen the presence of this QPO signal. Additionally, a time lag between the optical and $\gamma$-ray bands indicates separate emission regions for these two bands. Given the year-like timescale of the QPO signal and the fact that a QPO signal with local significance over 3$\sigma$ for full \textit{Fermi}-LAT observed time, we suggest that the QPO is most likely caused by a precessing jet.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21221" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forecasts of constraining isotropic cosmic birefringence on AliCPT-1</a><span class="id">[2510.21221]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic birefringence (CB) is a promising probe of parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model, characterized by the rotation of the linear polarization plane of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. This effect, quantified by the birefringence angle $\beta$, generates non-zero $EB$ and $TB$ correlations that are otherwise absent in standard cosmology. However, instrumental miscalibration angles $\alpha$ can mimic this signal, necessitating a joint estimation approach. In this work, we forecast the sensitivity of the AliCPT experiment, combined with Planck HFI data, on constraining the isotropic CB angle using a semi-analytical maximum-likelihood method. We simulate observations under various foreground complexities, rotation angles, and scanning strategies, and demonstrate that AliCPT can achieve an uncertainty of $\sigma(\beta)=0.09^\circ$ with one-year data, which will improve to $0.026^\circ$ after four years' observations. We also find that neglecting or mismodeling the foreground $EB$ correlation will introduce significant biases, which can be alleviated under a clean but small sky patch.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A simple toy model for the electromagnetic variability of lump-dominated circumbinary disks around binary black holes</a><span class="id">[2510.21331]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The electromagnetic detection of circumbinary disks around pre-merger binary black holes (BBHs) relies on theoretical predictions. These are generally obtained through expensive numerical simulations, but simple or fast toy models are lacking to unleash the potential of these theoretical advances for observational purposes. We aim to present a simple toy model to compute the electromagnetic variability of circumbinary disks around circular-orbit BBHs at relativistic separations, focusing on the impact of disk non-axisymmetries. We assume that the disk is threaded by spiral arms and hosts a hotspot linked to an overdense structure (the {\lq}lump{\rq}) preferably reported in binaries close to equal mass. We build a simple temperature distribution, and estimate its thermal emission, perceived by a distant observer, via a ray-tracing code in a BBH approximate metric. We propose a toy model reproducing the main lightcurve features and show it is consistent with 2D general-hydrodynamical simulations under the assumption of compressional heating and expansional cooling except for purely dynamical effects such as the binary-lump beat. The lightcurve exhibits a main modulation at the lump's period (i.e. a few times the orbital period), due to relativistic Doppler effect, and a shorter one at the orbital-like period, due to spiral arms or the beat. These are more prominent in the optical/UV band for a total binary mass $M\, {=} \, 10^{4-10}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, where the disk energy spectrum peaks. For $M=10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, a $4\%$-amplitude lump modulation is detectable with the Vera Rubin Observatory after six months of observation, up to $z\, {=}\, 0.5$.

Observations with current instruments have lead to the detection of only a few YMSCs but future instruments should significantly increase this number. However, the details of the production of the VHE emission are not well understood: What is the spectrum of accelerated particles? What is the efficiency of cosmic-ray production? What fraction of the wind luminosity is converted into the turbulent magnetic field? To address these questions, we simulate the population of YMSCs in the gamma-ray domain, by means of Monte Carlo methods, and apply the constraints based on the subsample of YMSCs currently detected at TeV energies. We confront our simulated populations with the catalogue of the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey and the First LHAASO Catalogue of Gamma-Ray Sources, allowing us to investigate crucial aspects of particle acceleration at YMSCs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21487" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic Field Configuration of a Quiescent Prominence Revealed by Large-amplitude Longitudinal Oscillations in End-view Observations</a><span class="id">[2510.21487]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Prominence seismology, applied to the large-amplitude longitudinal oscillation, is used to indirectly diagnose the geometry and strength of the magnetic fields inside the prominence. In this paper, combining imaging and spectroscopic data, the magnetic field configuration of a quiescent prominence is revealed by large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations observed in end view on 2023 December 4. Particularly, the prominence oscillation involved blueshift velocities in Dopplergrams and horizontal motions in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) images. Originally, the prominence oscillation was triggered by the collision and heating of an adjoining hot structure associated with two coronal jets. The oscillation involved two groups of signals with similar oscillatory parameters, a three-dimensional (3D) initial amplitude of 40 Mm and a 3D velocity amplitude of 48 km/s, both lasting for 4 cycles with a period of 77 minutes, with a phase difference of pi/4. While the angle between 3D velocities and the prominence axis ranges from 10 to 30. Two methods, utilizing time-distance diagrams and velocity fields, are employed to calculate the curvature radius of magnetic dips supporting the prominence materials. Both methods yield similar value ranges and trends from the bottom to the top of magnetic dips, with the curvature radius increasing from 90 Mm to 220 Mm, then decreasing to 10 Mm, with transverse magnetic field strength 25 Gauss. From this, the realistic 3D geometry of the prominence magnetic dips is determined to be sinusoidal. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first accurate calculation of the 3D curvature radius and geometry of the prominence magnetic dips based on longitudinal oscillatory motions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21502" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-Messenger Search for Neutrino and Gravitational-Wave Emissions from Binary Black Holes Near Active Galactic Nuclei</a><span class="id">[2510.21502]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binary black holes (BBHs) in the vicinity of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are particularly interesting systems from both a cosmological and astrophysical point of view. Matter and radiation fields within the dense AGN environment could produce electromagnetic and neutrino emission in addition to gravitational waves (GWs). Moreover, interactions between BBHs and AGN accretion disks are expected to influence BBH formation channels and merger rates. Understanding these sources could help explain the unexpectedly high BBH masses observed through GWs by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations. We present a search for coincident gravitational-wave and neutrino emission from AGNs. Our innovative approach combines information from gravitational-wave data, neutrino observations, and AGN optical catalogs to increase the chances of identifying potential sources and studying their properties. We assess the sensitivity of the search using subthreshold gravitational-wave candidates from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, neutrino event candidates from public IceCube Neutrino Observatory data and AGN candidates from the Quaia catalog.

In GW observations, waveform analysis provides direct measurements of luminosity distances; however, the redshifts of GW sources cannot be determined due to the mass-redshift degeneracy. By cross-correlating GW events with galaxies, one can establish a correspondence between luminosity distance and redshift shells, enabling cosmological inference. In this work, we explore the scientific potential of cross-correlating GW sources detected by third-generation (3G) ground-based GW detectors with the photometric redshift survey of the China Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). We find that the constraint precisions of the Hubble constant and the matter density parameter can reach $1.04\%$ and $2.04\%$, respectively. The GW clustering bias parameters $A_{\rm GW}$ and $\gamma$ can be constrained to $1.52\%$ and $4.67\%$, respectively. These results highlight the significant potential of the synergy between CSST and 3G ground-based GW detectors in constraining cosmological models and probing GW source formation channels using cross-correlation of dark sirens and galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21529" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sco X-1 as a continuous gravitational waves source: modelling the secular evolution using MESA</a><span class="id">[2510.21529]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the prospects for detecting continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from Sco X-1 and evaluate the most likely waveform- and progenitor- parameters. We study the evolution of different Sco X-1 progenitors, identifying those that give rise to detectable signals. We model the spin evolution of the neutron star (NS) by the accretion torque and the GW torque. We consider two mechanisms for generating the non-axisymmetry responsible for the GW torque: i) magnetic mountains and ii) deformation after crustal breakage. Both torques are intertwined with the binary evolution, which we trace from the formation of the NS in a binary system with a main-sequence companion. We do this with MESA, starting from a set of initial binary configurations. At current sensitivity, a magnetic ellipticity of $\varepsilon\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ is necessary for detection. The highest frequency at which we have detectable signals increases with the accretion efficiency $\eta$, and it can be as high as 360Hz. At 3G (Cosmic Explorer/Einstein telescope) sensitivity, less deformed Sco X-1 NSs, with ellipticities as small as $6\cdot 10^{-9}$, are detectable, but the waveform highly depends on the binary system: the highest frequency of detectable signals spans the very broad range 600-1700Hz, strongly depending on $\eta$ and mass of the progenitor donor star $M^d$. If $\eta\leq$30%, the crust does not break. When $\eta\in$[40%,60%] only progenitors with $M^d\geq[1.1,1.5]M_{\odot}$ present crustal breakage, while if $\eta\geq$70% all crusts break. In some systems the crust breaks during their Sco X-1 phase. If Sco X-1 were one of those systems, it would be emitting a very loud GW signal sweeping from O(1000)Hz down to torque-balance frequencies. We estimate current detection probability for this signal to be under 1%; this probability increases substantially – to around 41% – with third-generation detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Irradiated Atmospheres IV: Effect of Mixing Heat Flux on Chemistry</a><span class="id">[2510.21543]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Vertical mixing disrupts the thermochemical equilibrium and introduces additional heat flux that alters exoplanetary atmospheric temperatures. We investigate how this mixing-induced heat flux affects atmospheric chemistry. Temperature increase in the lower atmosphere by the mixing-induced heat flux alters species abundances there and modifies those in the upper atmosphere through vertical transport. In the lower atmosphere, most species follow thermodynamic equilibrium with temperature changes. In the upper layers, species mixing ratios depend on the positions of quenching levels relative to the regions exhibiting significant mixing-induced temperature variations. When the quenching level resides within such region (e.g. CO, $\rm CH_4$, and $\rm H_2O$ with strong mixing), the mixing ratios in the upper atmosphere are modified due to changes in the quenched ratios affected by the temperature variation in the lower atmosphere. This alters the mixing ratio of other species (e.g. NO and $\rm CO_2$) through the chemical reaction network, whose quenching occurs in the region without much temperature change. The mixing ratios of $\rm CH_4$, $\rm H_2O$, and $\rm NH_3$ decrease in the lower atmosphere with increasing mixing heat flux, similarly reducing these ratios in the upper atmosphere. Conversely, the mixing ratios of CO, $\rm CO_2$, and NO rise in the lower atmosphere, with CO and $\rm CO_2$ also increasing in the upper levels, although NO decreases. Weaker host star irradiation lowers the overall temperature of the planet, allowing a smaller mixing to have a similar effect. We conclude that understanding the vertical mixing heat flux is essential for accurate atmospheric chemistry modeling and retrieval.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D Synthetic Convective Velocity Fields to Initialise Core-Collapse Supernova Simulations from 1D Progenitors</a><span class="id">[2510.21611]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are among the most energetic and complex astrophysical phenomena, requiring threedimensional (3D) simulations to capture their intricate explosion mechanisms. One of the key ingredients for such simulations is the 3D pre-collapse structure, which can impact the development and geometry of the subsequent explosion. While stellar convection simulations can provide such 3D initial conditions, these remain too expensive and demanding for widespread use. In this work, we present a method to generate synthetic 3D velocity fields for convective zones from 1D initial conditions, creating initial conditions for CCSN simulations using a vector spherical harmonics expansion without the need for expensive hydrodynamic progenitor simulations. The synthetic velocity field is designed to capture the typical scales and velocities of the convective flow as the most relevant parameters for the subsequent explosions. In addition, it respects relevant physical constraints such as the near-anelasticity of flow, vanishing radial vorticity, and zero net angular momentum in the convective zones. A Python implementation of this method is publicly available, offering the CCSN community a practical tool for generating synthetic velocity fields for multi-dimensional simulations to study the impact of 3D progenitor asymmetries on the CCSN mechanism.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21626" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peakbagging the K2 KEYSTONE sample with PBjam: characterising the individual mode frequencies in solar-like oscillators</a><span class="id">[2510.21626]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The pattern of individual mode frequencies in solar-like oscillators provides valuable insight into their properties and interior structures. The identification and characterisation of these modes requires high signal-to-noise and frequency resolution. The KEYSTONE project unlocks the asteroseismic potential of the K2 mission by providing individually reduced, high-quality time series data, global asteroseismic parameters, and spectroscopic analysis for 173 solar-like oscillators. In this work, we build on the KEYSTONE project and present the first analysis of the pattern of individual modes in the oscillation spectra for the K2 KEYSTONE stars. We perform a robust identification and characterisation of the modes through peakbagging methods in the open-source analysis tool PBjam. We present over 6000 mode frequencies, widths, and heights for 168 stars in the sample, covering the HR diagram from FGK dwarfs to sub-giants and the lower red giant branch, providing a significant increase in the number of individual mode frequency detections for main sequence and sub-giant oscillators. This study also presents sample-wide trends of oscillation patterns as a function of the fundamental stellar properties, and improves the precision of the global asteroseismic parameters. These measurements are part of the legacy of the K2 mission, and can be used to perform detailed modelling to improve the precision of fundamental properties of these stars. The results of this analysis provides evidence for the validity of using PBjam to identify and characterise the modes resulting from the observations of the future PLATO mission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESI constraints on two-field quintessence with exponential potentials</a><span class="id">[2510.21627]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a quintessence model involving two scalar fields with double-exponential potentials. This configuration allows the system as a whole to emulate the dynamics of a single field with a shallower potential, enabling scalar fields that individually cannot drive cosmic acceleration to collectively achieve and sustain it. We assess the viability of this model by performing a fully Bayesian analysis and confronting its predictions with observational data, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift parameters, the newly released Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) Type Ia supernova (SnIa) sample. Our analysis shows that the two-field quintessence model yields a log Bayes factor relative to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model of $\Delta \ln B \sim 4$, indicating moderate evidence against the latter. We also find that the central values of the two slopes of the exponential potentials are both close to 1, whereas the slope of an effective single-field system is constrained to be less than order unity. This property is theoretically desirable from the perspective of higher-dimensional theories. Thus, the two-field quintessence model with exponential potentials provides a physically motivated and compelling mechanism that is consistent with both observational and theoretical requirements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21633" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the Co-SIMP dark matter model using the 21-cm signal from dark ages</a><span class="id">[2510.21633]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The redshifted 21-cm signal from the dark ages offers a powerful probe of cosmological models and the underlying dark matter microphysics. We investigate deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction, an absorption trough of approximately $-40.6\,\mathrm{mK}$ at redshift $z \simeq 85.6$, in the context of co-SIMP dark matter. The strength of co-SIMP interactions, quantified by the parameter $C_{\rm int}$, enhances the absorption depth and shifts the trough to higher redshifts. For example, a model with $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ produces a minimum brightness temperature of $-50.6\,\mathrm{mK}$ at $z \simeq 86.2$. The 21-cm power spectrum increases with $C_{\rm int}$ in addition to the global signal. We assess the detectability of these signatures using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Fisher matrix forecasts. The maximum SNR reaches $\sim 15.7$ for $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ for the global signal. Fisher forecast for $1,000$ hours of integration time shows that this model can be distinguished from a null-signal at $4.3\sigma$ and from the $\Lambda$CDM model case at $1.6 \sigma$, with order-of-magnitude improvements for 100,000 hours of integration. For the 21-cm power spectrum, our forecasts reveal complementary trends; with a modest setup (collecting area of $5\,\mathrm{km}^2$ and 1,000 hours of integration time), the $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ model can be detected at $4.63\sigma$ and differentiated from the standard scenario at $1.78 \sigma$. These findings highlight the potential of the 21-cm cosmology to probe the properties of dark matter and demonstrate that upcoming dark ages experiments, particularly space-based and lunar observations, can offer a promising avenue to test co-SIMP models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predicted observational effects of rapid rotation for Be stars</a><span class="id">[2510.21640]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We conduct a systematic study on the effects of rapid rotation on predicted Be star observables. We use the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, \textsc{hdust}, to model a comprehensive range of Be star subtypes at varying rotation rates. Using these models, we predict $V$ magnitude and photometric color, H$\alpha$ line profiles, and polarization at UV wavelengths as well as in the $V$-band for Be stars from B0 to B8. For each spectral subtype, we investigate the effects of disk density on the produced observables. We find that reddening and brightening effects of gravity darkening may cause rapidly-rotating stars to appear more evolved than they truly are. Rotational effects on the H$\alpha$ line profile shape may reduce line intensity for Be stars viewed at low inclinations and increase line intensity for those viewed at high inclinations. Additionally, rapid rotation can significantly impact the measured equivalent width of the line produced by a star with a moderate to high density disk, especially at high inclinations. When the star-disk system is viewed near edge-on, gravity darkening can result in stronger H$\alpha$ emission than would otherwise be expected for a disk of a given density. We also find that the competing effects of rapid rotation and H \textsc{i} opacity cause the slope of the polarized continuum (the polarization color) to be very sensitive to changes in the stellar rotation rate. This quantity offers a strong diagnostic for the rotation rate of Be stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mechanisms of Superrotation in Slowly-Rotating and Tidally-Locked Planets</a><span class="id">[2510.21680]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Superrotation is a common feature of quickly rotating gas giants, slowly rotating planetary bodies, and tidally-locked planets. In this paper we compare and contrast the mechanisms of superrotation in slow rotators and tidally-locked planets. We cover a wide range of planetary properties, varying in particular the thermal Rossby number Ro_T (controlled by planetary size, rotation rate, and instellation) and a radiative relaxation timescale T_rad (which parameterizes atmospheric optical thickness). We use a two-level model that contains the principal mechanisms for superrotation in both regimes yet remains analytically tractable. Linearizations of the model elucidate the behavior of superrotation-inducing eddies. In tidally-locked planets a Matsuno-Gill-like structure organizes the eddy effects but of itself is insufficient to produce superrotation; baroclinicity and low-level drag are additional essential ingredients. Nonlinear integrations further explore the superrotating regimes and exhibit significant time variability even in statistical equilibrium. Not all tidally-locked regimes superrotate: subrotation arises at high T_rad (optically thick atmospheres) and weak low-level drag. On axisymmetrically-forced slow rotators, superrotation is always linked to a previously identified Rossby-Kelvin instability. Perhaps surprisingly, the instability itself is also linked to the spinup of superrotation in some tidally-locked regimes. Finally, we explore the continuous transition in the mechanisms of superrotation from axisymmetrically-forced to tidally-locked planets by applying a progressively stronger asymmetric equatorial forcing. The Matsuno-Gill pattern quickly dominates over traveling planetary Rossby-Kelvin waves in forcing superrotation, although both mechanisms can coexist. These results provide a unified view of superrotation mechanisms across a wide range of planetary bodies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HOLISMOKES XIX: SN 2025wny at $z=2$, the first strongly lensed superluminous supernova</a><span class="id">[2510.21694]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present imaging and spectroscopic observations of supernova SN 2025wny, associated with the lens candidate PS1 J0716+3821.

Optical spectroscopy of the brightest image with the Nordic Optical Telescope and the University of Hawaii 88-inch Telescope allows us to determine the redshift to be z_s = 2.008 +- 0.001, based on narrow absorption lines originating in the interstellar medium of the supernova host galaxy. At this redshift, the spectra of SN 2025wny are consistent with those of superluminous supernovae of Type I. We find a high ejecta temperature and depressed spectral lines compared to other similar objects. We also measure, for the first time, the redshift of the fainter of the two lens galaxies (the &quot;perturber&quot;) to be z_p = 0.375 +- 0.001, fully consistent with the DESI spectroscopic redshift of the main deflector at z_d = 0.3754. SN 2025wny thus represents the first confirmed galaxy-scale strongly lensed supernova with time delays likely in the range of days to weeks, as judged from the image separations. This makes SN 2025wny suitable for cosmography, offering a promising new system for independent measurements of the Hubble constant.

Quantifying the extent of this contamination is essential for accurate measurements of atmospheric composition, as stellar activity can manifest as false atmospheric signals in planetary transmission spectra. We present a study of hot Jupiter HD 189733b, which has over 50 hours of JWST observations scheduled or taken, to measure the activity level of the host star at the current epoch. We utilize high-resolution spectra of the H${\alpha}$ line from the MEGARA spectrograph on the 10-m GTC to examine the activity level of HD 189733 during a transit. We measure H${\alpha}$ becoming shallower mid-transit by an H${\alpha}$ index of ${\delta}$ = 0.00156 ${\pm}$ 0.00026, which suggests that HD 189733b crosses an active region as it transits. We posit this deviation is likely caused by a spot along the transit chord with an approximate radius of $R_{spot}$ = 3.47 ${\pm}$ 0.30R${\oplus}$ becoming occulted during transit. Including an approximation for unocculted spots, we estimate that this spot could result in transit depth variations of ${\sim}$17 ppm at the 4.3 micron CO2 feature. Since this is comparable to JWST NIRCam Grism mode's noise floor of ${\sim}$20 ppm, it could bias atmospheric studies by altering the inferred depths of the planet's features. Thus, we suggest ground-based high-resolution monitoring of activity indicator species concurrently taken with JWST data when feasible to disentangle stellar activity signals from planetary atmospheric signals during transit.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SENSEI: A Search for Diurnal Modulation in sub-GeV Dark Matter Scattering</a><span class="id">[2510.20889]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter particles with sufficiently large interactions with ordinary matter can scatter in the Earth's atmosphere and crust before reaching an underground detector.

We argue that the local disorder at the grain boundary produces a landscape of potential barriers similar to that of an amorphous liquid thin film, significantly reducing activation barriers to diffusive hops relative to the bulk solid. This also introduces a screening dependence, such that boundary diffusion does not exhibit the same universality as the bulk crystal.

This approach offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made publicly available to advance future studies of solar wind dynamics and space weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WimPyC: an extension module of WimPyDD for the calculation of WIMP capture in celestial bodies</a><span class="id">[2510.21185]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce WimPyC, a Python code for the calculation of the capture rate of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) by celestial bodies through nuclear scattering in the optically thin regime. WimPyC is an extension of the WimPyDD code, that calculates WIMP-nucleus scattering signals in direct detection (DD) experiments, and allows to combine DD and capture in celestial bodies in virtually any scenario within the framework of Galilean-invariant non-relativistic effective theory (NREFT), including inelastic scattering, an arbitrary WIMP spin and a generic WIMP velocity distribution in the Galactic halo. WimPyDD and WimPyC are suitable for both top-down approaches, where the interaction operators of a high-energy physics model are matched to those of the NREFT, and to bottom-up studies, where the Wilson coefficients of the NREFT are explored in a model-independent way and/or where the velocity distribution is written in terms of a superposition of streams taken as free parameters. As in the case of WimPyDD WimPyC exploits the factorization of the three main components that enter in the calculation of the capture rate: i) the Wilson coefficients that encode the dependence of the signals on the ultraviolet completion of the effective theory; ii) a response function that depends on the nuclear physics; iii) the halo function that depends on the WIMP velocity distribution. In WimPyC these three components are calculated and stored separately for later interpolation and combined together only as the last step of the signal evaluation procedure. This makes the phenomenological study of the capture rate with WimPyC transparent and improves computational speed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Space waste: An update of the anthropogenic matter injection into Earth atmosphere</a><span class="id">[2510.21328]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large satellite constellations are one of the main reasons for an increasing amount of mass being brought into low Earth orbit in recent years. After end of life, the satellites, as well as rocket stages, reenter Earth's atmosphere. This space waste burns up and thus injects a substantial amount of its matter into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. A first comprehensive analysis of the anthropogenic injection and a comparison to the natural injection by meteoroids was presented by Schulz &amp; Glassmeier (2021). They found significant and even the dominant injection of several metal elements regularly used in spacecraft compared to the natural injection. The first observations of space waste remnants in stratospheric aerosol particles (Murphy et al., 2023) confirmed several of these estimates, but also revealed differences and new insights. The current study presents an update to the space waste injection estimates of Schulz &amp; Glassmeier (2021), assessing the years from 2015 to 2025 but also considering future mass influx scenarios. 43 elements are considered and thus a much more detailed comparison to the meteoric injection is possible. Comparison of estimated elemental fluxes to stratospheric aerosol data shows excellent agreement. From 2020 onward, a strong rise in space waste mass influx to the atmosphere can be seen. Future scenarios discussed by Schulz &amp; Glassmeier (2021) may already be reached by the end of 2025. In 2024, 24 elements were dominating the meteoric injection compared to 18 in 2015. Several of them are transition metals, which are known for their catalytic activity. This indicates a substantial risk of long-term adverse effects on the atmosphere such as ozone depletion, radiative effects and changes in cloud formation, if no action is taken. Research is urgently needed into the atmospheric accumulation, chemistry, and general atmospheric effects of specific elements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational waves from the sound shell model: direct and inverse phase transitions in the early Universe</a><span class="id">[2510.21439]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmological phase transitions are a frequent phenomenon in particle physics models beyond the Standard Model, and the corresponding gravitational wave signal offers a key probe of new physics in the early Universe. Depending on the underlying microphysics, the transition can exhibit either direct or inverse hydrodynamics, leading to a different phenomenology. Most studies to date have focused on direct transitions, where the cosmic fluid is pushed or dragged by the expanding vacuum bubbles. In contrast, inverse phase transitions are characterized by fluid profiles where the plasma is sucked in by the expanding bubbles. Using the sound shell model, we derive and compare the gravitational wave spectra from sound waves for direct and inverse phase transitions, providing new insights into the potential observable features and the possibility of discriminating among the various fluid solutions in gravitational wave experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A cosmological model with logarithmic f(T) gravity and H(z) quadratic expansion</a><span class="id">[2510.21466]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the late-time cosmological expansion of a modified teleparallel gravity model of type logarithmic type.

This feature implies that detecting a neutrino can reveal valuable insights into its source. Among the known sources of neutrinos, core-collapse supernovae are one of the most efficient factories. On average, a single collapse occurs every second in the observable universe, emitting approximately $10^{58}$ neutrinos. The total flux of neutrinos reaching Earth from all core-collapse supernovae across the universe is the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB). Detection of the DSNB is just around the corner. This guaranteed flux of astrophysical neutrinos encodes information about the whole supernova population, including an answer to a currently unsolved question about the rate at which black holes form from massive stars. This chapter discusses the ingredients entering the DSNB calculation as well as current experimental limits and hints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UVIT/AstroSat observation of TW Hya</a><span class="id">[2403.19478]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The paper demonstrates the spectroscopic and photometric capabilities of the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) to study T-Tauri stars (TTSs).

They are significantly more informative than the 2-point correlation function. Their connection to $N$-point correlation functions, void probability functions and Counts-in-Cells is known. However, the connections between the CDFs and other geometric and topological spatial summary statistics are yet to be fully explored in the literature. This understanding will be crucial to find optimally informative summary statistics to analyse data from stage 4 cosmological surveys. We explore quantitatively the geometric interpretations of the $k$NN CDF summary statistics. We establish an equivalence between the 1NN CDF at radius $r$ and the volume of spheres with the same radius around the data points. We show that higher $k$NN CDFs are equivalent to the volumes of intersections of $\ge k$ spheres around the data points. We present similar geometric interpretations for the $k$NN cross-correlation joint CDFs. We further show that the volume, or the CDFs, have information about the angles and arc lengths created at the intersections of spheres around the data points, which can be accessed through the derivatives of the CDF. We show this information is very similar to that captured by Germ Grain Minkowski Functionals. Using a Fisher analysis we compare the information content and constraining power of various data vectors constructed from the $k$NN CDFs and Minkowski Functionals. We find that the CDFs and their derivatives and the Minkowski Functionals have nearly identical information content. However, $k$NN CDFs are computationally orders of magnitude faster to evaluate. Finally, we find that there is information in the full shape of the CDFs, and therefore caution against using the values of the CDF only at sparsely sampled radii.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An on-the-fly line-driven-wind iterative mass-loss estimator (LIME) for hot, massive stars of arbitrary chemical compositions</a><span class="id">[2504.00936]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mass-loss rates from hot, massive stars are important for a range of astrophysical applications. We present \href{ this https URL }{LIME}, a fast, efficient, and easy-to-use real-time mass-loss calculator for line-driven winds from hot, massive stars with given stellar parameters and arbitrary chemical compositions. The tool is publicly available online. We compute the line force on-the-fly from excitation and ionization balance calculations using a large atomic data base containing more than four million spectral lines. We then derive mass-loss rates from line-driven wind theory, including effects of a finite stellar disk and gas sound speed. For a given set of stellar parameters and chemical composition, we obtain predictions for mass-loss rates and for the three line-force parameters at the wind critical point. A comparison of our predicted mass-loss rates with a large sample of recent, state-of-the-art, homogeneously derived empirical mass-loss rates obtained from the XshootU collaboration project demonstrates that the simple calculator presented here performs on average as well as, or even better than, other available mass-loss recipes based on fits to restricted model grids computed from more sophisticated but less flexible methods. In addition to its speed and simplicity, a strength of our mass-loss calculator is that it avoids uncertainties related to applying fit formulae to underlying model grids calculated for more restricted parameter ranges. In particular, individual chemical abundances can be easily modified, and their effects on predicted mass-loss rates can be readily explored. This enables direct applications also to stars that are significantly chemically modified at the surface.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probabilistic mapping between multiparticle production variables and the depth of maximum in proton-induced extensive air showers</a><span class="id">[2504.08610]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with air nuclei triggers extensive air showers that reach their maximal energy deposition at the atmospheric depth $X_{\max}$. The distribution of this shower observable encodes information about the proton-air cross-section via fluctuations of the primary interaction point, $X_1$, and hadron production through $\Delta X_{\max} \equiv X_{\max} - X_1$. We introduce new multiparticle production variables, $\alpha_{\textrm{had}}$, $\zeta_{\textrm{had}}$, and $\zeta_{\mathrm{EM}}$, built from the energy spectra of secondaries in the primary interaction. Their linear combination, $\xi$, predicts over $50 \%$ of the fluctuations in $\Delta X_{\max}$. Moreover, we build a probabilistic mapping based on the causal connection between $\xi$ and $\Delta X_{\max}$ that enables model-independent predictions of $X_{\max}$ moments with biases below $3\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}}$. Therefore, measurements of the distribution of $X_{\max}$ allow a data-driven probing of secondary hadron spectra from the cosmic-ray-air interaction, in proton-induced showers. The distributions of the new multiparticle production variables can be measured in rapidity regions accessible to current accelerators and are strongly dependent on the hadronic interaction model in the kinematic regions exclusive to ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compact stellar systems hosting an intermediate mass black hole: magnetohydrodynamic study of inflow-outflow dynamics</a><span class="id">[2504.21640]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are a missing link in black hole demographics, with only tentative observational evidence to date. Dense stellar clusters such as IRS 13E near the Galactic Center are promising IMBH hosts, where accretion is likely driven by winds from nearby Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Yet, the dynamics of such wind-fed systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate how high-velocity stellar winds, magnetic fields, and metallicity-dependent radiative cooling influence gas dynamics and black hole accretion in compact WR clusters. Using three-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations, we model each WR star as a source of mass, momentum, energy, and magnetic flux, and include a cooling function that depends on chemical abundance. We compare isotropic versus disk-like stellar distributions to explore the impact of cluster geometry. Across all models, we find that the accretion rate onto the IMBH is suppressed by up to five orders of magnitude relative to the total stellar mass-loss rate. Turbulent, shock-heated outflows driven by wind-wind collisions dominate the flow, expelling most injected gas. While enhanced cooling in high-metallicity runs promotes the formation of dense clumps, these structures are typically unable to reach the black hole. The system's integrated X-ray luminosity is dominated by colliding WR winds, masking the IMBH's radiative signature. Accretion occurs in short-lived, quasi-periodic episodes triggered by close stellar passages, but even these flares remain difficult to detect against the luminous wind background. Our results naturally explain the low detectability of IMBHs in compact WR clusters and provide theoretical predictions to guide future X-ray and infrared observational strategies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Current constraints on the minimally extended varying speed of light model through the cosmic distance duality relation</a><span class="id">[2505.15768]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the most crucial tests of the standard cosmological model consists on testing possible variations on fundamental physical constants. In frameworks such as the minimally extended varying speed of light model (meVSL), the relationship between the luminosity distance ($D_{\text{L}}$) and the angular diameter distance ($D_{\text{A}}$), namely the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), is expected to deviate from $\eta(z) \equiv D_{\text{L}}/D_{\text{A}}(z)(1+z)^{-2} = 1$, making it a powerful probe to check a potential variation of fundamental constants. Hence, we test the viability of the meVSL model through the CDDR by comparing $D_{\text{A}}$ measurements, provided by the transverse (2D) and anisotropic (3D) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations from different surveys, like SDSS, DES and DESI, in combination with $D_{\text{L}}$ measurements from Pantheon+ type Ia Supernova (SNe) compilation. The Gaussian Process reconstruction is employed on the SN data to match $D_{\text{A}}$ with $D_{\text{L}}$ at the same redshift. We find no deviation of the standard CDDR relation within 1-2.6$\sigma$ confidence level when considering SNe with 2D and 3D BAO samples combined together. However, when SNe and 2D BAO only are considered, the standard CDDR is only recovered at $\sim 4\sigma$ confidence level. However, such a result might be due to some recently discussed tensions between SN and BAO datasets, especially at low redshifts, in addition to possible inconsistencies between the BAO datasets individually. Therefore, our results show no significant evidence in favour of the meVSL model, once these potential systematics are taken into account.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for Historical Extragalactic Optical Transients Associated with Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2506.06420]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a systematic search for past supernovae (SNe) and other historical optical transients at the positions of fast radio burst (FRB) sources to test FRB progenitor systems. Our sample comprises 83 FRBs detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and its KKO Outrigger, along with 93 literature FRBs representing all known well-localized FRBs. We search for optical transients coincident in position and redshift with FRBs and find no significant associations within the 5-sigma FRB localization uncertainties except for a previously identified potential optical counterpart to FRB 20180916B. By constraining the timescale for SN ejecta to become transparent to FRB emission, we predict that it takes at least 6-10 years before the FRB emission can escape. From this, we infer that approximately 7% of matched optical transients, up to 30% of currently known SNe, and up to 40% of core-collapse SNe could have an observable FRB based on timescales alone. We derive the number of new, well-localized FRBs required to produce one FRB-SN match by chance, and find it will take   22,700 FRBs to yield one chance association at the projected CHIME/FRB Outrigger detection rate. Looking forward, we demonstrate redshift overlap between SNe detected by the upcoming Vera C.

The baryonic matter (BM) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach with density-dependent couplings, while the dark sector mirrors the visible sector with analogous thermodynamic conditions. Using a two-fluid formalism with purely gravitational DM-BM interaction, we find that rotation enlarges the star, whereas DM admixture increases compactness and enhances gravitational stability. However, increased compactness due to DM lowers the threshold for rotational instabilities, making DM-admixed stars more susceptible. Rotation decreases {central temperature behavior} by redistributing thermal energy over a larger volume and reducing central density, while DM raises temperatures by deepening the gravitational potential and increasing thermal energy. Stars become more prone to collapse and rotational instabilities as frequency ($\nu$) rises and the polar-to-equatorial radius ratio ($r_p/r_e$) decreases, especially near the Keplerian limit ($\nu_K$). DM-admixed stars also show higher surface gravitational redshifts due to their compactness. Our results qualitatively agree with universal relations primarily derived for rotating cold stars. These findings highlight competing effects of rotation and DM on NS thermal evolution, structure, and observables, potentially offering indirect probes of DM within NSs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Field-level constraints on cosmic birefringence from hybrid ILC maps combining $E$- and $B$-mode channels</a><span class="id">[2507.22109]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic birefringence, arising from a potential parity-violating interaction between cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons and evolving pseudo-scalar fields such as axion-like particles, can rotate the CMB polarization plane and induce an effective correlation between the CMB $E$- and $B$-mode polarization. In this work, we introduce a hybrid internal linear combination (ILC) method that combines both $E$- and $B$-mode frequency maps into the component separation pipeline, enabling the disentanglement of correlated and uncorrelated components of CMB polarization in the presence of cosmic birefringence and instrumental polarization angle miscalibration. We derive an analytic linear relation connecting the birefringence-induced correlated component of the CMB $E$- (or $B$-) mode field to the full CMB $B$- (or $E$-) mode field convolved with a modulating field. By performing linear regression between these fields across multiple sky patches, we directly estimate the birefringence angle at the field level. This allows us to distinguish cosmic birefringence from polarization angle miscalibration and foreground contamination, as the ILC responds differently to achromatic cosmic birefringence and chromatic systematic effects, with its weights projecting spatial or harmonic dependence only onto the latter. This non-parametric, field-level approach provides a novel way to probe cosmic birefringence directly in real space. When applied to realistic simulations of the forthcoming LiteBIRD satellite mission, our method yields constraints that are competitive with, and complementary to, existing power spectrum-based analyses. When applied to Planck Release 4 (PR4) data, we find a birefringence angle of $\beta = 0.32^\circ \pm 0.12^\circ$, a $2.7\sigma$ detection that remains robust against varying sky fractions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital and Pulsation Analysis of 42 Heartbeat Stars Discovered in TESS Data</a><span class="id">[2508.01156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Heartbeat stars (HBSs) are ideal laboratories for studying the formation and evolution of binary stars in eccentric orbits and their mutual tidal interactions.

Subsequently, Tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) are detected in ten systems, and their pulsation phases and modes are identified. Most pulsation phases can be explained by the dominant being spherical harmonic degree $l=2$ and azimuthal order $m=0$ or $\pm2$. For TIC 156846634, the harmonic with large deviation ($&gt;3\sigma$) from the expected adiabatic phase can be expected to be a traveling wave or significantly nonadiabatic. The harmonic numbers $n$ = 16 in TIC 184413651 may not be considered as a TEO candidate due to its large deviation ($&gt;2\sigma$) from the adiabatic expectation. Moreover, TIC 92828790 shows no TEOs but exhibits a significant $\gamma$ Dor-type pulsation. The eccentricity-period ($e-P$) relation also shows a positive correlation between eccentricity and period, as well as the existence of orbital circularization. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows that TESS HBSs have higher temperatures and greater luminosities than Kepler HBSs, possibly due to selection effects.

However, unlike any known GRB, the \textit{Einstein Probe} detected soft X-ray emission up to 24 hours before the gamma-ray triggers. We present comprehensive X-ray observations of the transient's afterglow obtained with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory between 0.5 to 65 days (observer frame) after the initial high-energy trigger. The X-ray emission decays steeply as $\sim t^{-1.9}$, and shows short timescale X-ray variability ($\Delta T/T &lt; 0.03$) in both Swift and NuSTAR, consistent with flares superposed on an external shock continuum. Serendipitous detections by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) out to $\sim$0.3 days and continued NuSTAR variability to $\sim$2 days imply sustained central engine activity; including the precursor, the required engine duration is $\gtrsim 3$ days. Afterglow modeling favors the combination of forward and reverse shock emission in a wind-like ($k \approx 2$) environment. These properties, especially the long-lived engine and early soft X-ray emission, are difficult to reconcile with a collapsar origin, and GRB 250702B does not fit neatly with canonical ultra-long GRBs or relativistic tidal disruption events (TDEs). A hybrid scenario in which a star is disrupted by a stellar-mass black hole (a micro-TDE) provides a plausible explanation, although a relativistic TDE from an intermediate-mass black hole remains viable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11940" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Near the Runaway: The Climate and Habitability of Teegarden's Star b</a><span class="id">[2510.11940]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Teegarden's Star b, a nearby terrestrial world receiving an Earth-like instellation, is a prime candidate for next-generation observatories targeting temperate exoplanets in their habitable zones.

The result that Teegarden's Star b is habitable under the most recent instellation measurement reinforces its status as one of the most compelling targets for future habitability and biosignature searches.

Using this, we have produced a set of DES Y3-like synthetic measurements for 2-point shear correlation functions $\xi_{\pm}$ (2PCFs) and i3PCFs $\zeta_{\pm}$ across 6 cosmological and 11 systematic parameters. Having validated these measurements against theoretical predictions and thoroughly examined for potential systematic biases, we have found that the impact of source galaxy clustering and reduced shear on the i3PCF is negligible for Stage-III surveys. Furthermore, we have tested the Gaussianity assumption for the likelihood of our data vector and found that while the sampling distribution of the 2PCF can be well approximated by a Gaussian function, the likelihood of the combined 2PCF + i3PCF data vector including filter sizes of $90'$ and larger can deviate from this assumption.

In this context, it is interesting to investigate constraints on neutrino masses, dark energy and the Hubble parameter that are agnostic to some aspects of the cosmological model. Here we choose to be agnostic to the value of the sound horizon at recombination, while sticking to standard assumptions regarding the time of recombination and the growth of structures. To be consistent, we also disregard information on the full shape of the CMB temperature and polarization spectrum on sub-degree scale. With such agnostic and conservative assumptions, using data mainly on uncalibrated distances, the growth of structures, and laboratory bounds on tritium $\beta$-decay, we find that: (i) the dark energy evolution is well constrained by uncalibrated data on angular and luminosity distances, with a mild preference for dynamical dark energy, independently of the value of the sound horizon; (ii) large values of the Hubble rate are favored, $H_0=74.7^{+3.4}_{-4.4}$ km/s/Mpc (68\%CL), together with low values of the sound horizon, $r_{\rm s}=131.1^{+6.8}_{-6.9}$ Mpc (68\%CL); the SH0ES value of $H_0$ is thus marginally preferred over the low value returned by the standard inverse distance ladder analysis; (iii) the cosmological neutrino mass bound relaxes to $\sum m_\nu = 0.69^{+0.33}_{-0.47}$ eV (68\%CL) and becomes well compatible with the normal and inverted neutrino mass schemes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14091" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards a precision calculation of $N_{\rm eff}$ in the Standard Model IV: Estimating the impact of positronium formation</a><span class="id">[2411.14091]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a first assessment of how the previously unexplored effect of positronium formation can impact on the value of the effective number of neutrino species in the Standard Model, $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$. Adopting a Yukawa form for the electrostatic potential, we discuss two possible scenarios that differ primarily in their assumptions about entropy evolution. The first, out-of-equilibrium scenario assumes that thermal corrections to the potential such as Debye screening prevent positronium from appearing until the temperature drops below a threshold. Once the threshold is reached, entropy generated in the QED sector from the equilibration process, if instantaneous, leads to a variation in $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$ of at most $|\Delta N_{\rm eff}| \sim 10^{-4}$, comparable to other uncertainties in the current benchmark value for $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$. A more gradual formation could however yield a larger change. The second, equilibrium scenario assumes the QED sector to stay in equilibrium at all times. In this case, we show that cancellations between the first, $s$-wave bound- and scattering-states contributions ensure that it is possible to evolve the system across the bound-state formation threshold without generating entropy in the QED sector. The corresponding change in $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$ then closely matches the $\mathcal{O}(e^2)$ perturbative result derived in previous works and the $\mathcal{O}(e^4)$ contribution is capped at $|\Delta N_{\rm eff}| \lesssim 10^{-6}$. We also comment on the impact of deviations from a pure Yukawa potential due to the presence of a thermal width.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07692" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singularity resolution and inflation from an infinite tower of regularized curvature corrections</a><span class="id">[2504.07692]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories obtained from well-defined dimensional regularizations of Lovelock invariants.

These modes enable the detection of vector dark matter with masses $m \sim 10^{-24} - 10^{-22}\ \mathrm{eV}$ and $m \sim 10^{-18} - 10^{-16}\ \mathrm{eV}$, respectively, using pulsar timing arrays. While previous studies have explored the fast mode, they neglect the full statistical treatment of the vector field and a precise treatment of its polarization structure. In this work, we investigate the timing residuals from both modes, fully accounting for the statistical properties of ultralight vector dark matter, assuming equipartition among its three polarization states. The two-point correlation functions of timing residuals that we derive serve as direct tools for identifying vector dark matter signatures as a stochastic background in pulsar timing data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bispectrum Islands</a><span class="id">[2506.19198]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inspired by the amplitude bootstrap program, the spirit of this work is to constrain the space of consistent inflationary correlation functions - specifically, the bispectrum of curvature perturbations - using fundamental principles such as unitarity, locality, analyticity, and symmetries. To this end, we assume a setup for inflation in which de Sitter isometries are only mildly broken by the slow roll of the inflaton field, and study the bispectrum imprinted by a generic hidden sector during inflation. Assuming that the hidden sector's contributions to primordial non-Gaussianity are dominated by the exchange of a scalar operator (which does not preclude high-spin UV completions), we derive nontrivial positivity constraints on the resulting bispectrum $B(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. In particular, we show that $B$ must be negative in a certain region around the equilateral configuration. For instance, for isosceles triangles (with $k_2=k_3$) this region is given by $0.027\lesssim k_3/k_1\leq 2$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unitarity imposes upper and lower bounds on the bispectrum shape, thereby carving out a Bispectrum Island where consistent shapes in our setup can reside. We complement our analysis by contemplating alternative setups where the coupling to the hidden sector is allowed to strongly break de Sitter boosts. We also identify situations that would push the bispectrum off the island and the profound physical features they would reveal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phantom Crossing and Oscillating Dark Energy with $F(R)$ Gravity</a><span class="id">[2506.21010]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we shall consider how a dynamical oscillating and phantom crossing dark energy era can be realized in the context of $F(R)$ gravity. We approach the topic from a theoretical standpoint considering all the conditions that may lead to a consistent phantom crossing behavior and separately how the $F(R)$ gravity context may realize oscillating dark energy era. Apart from our qualitative considerations, we study in a quantitative way two $F(R)$ gravity dark energy models which are viable cosmologically and also exhibit simultaneously phantom crossing behavior and also oscillating dark energy. We consider these models by solving numerically the field equations using appropriate statefinder parameters engineered for dark energy studies. As we show, $F(R)$ provides a natural extension of Einstein's general relativity which can naturally realize a transition from a phantom era to a quintessential era, a feature supported by recent observational data, without resorting to phantom scalar fields to realize the phantom evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02063" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial high energy neutrinos: theoretical/observational constraints and sharp spectral features</a><span class="id">[2507.02063]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Among the few ways that allow or could allow us to probe the early Universe from the observation of a flux of primordial particles, there is one possibility which has been little studied: the observation today of high energy neutrinos which could have been emitted shortly after the Big Bang, from the decay or annihilation of early universe relics. We perform a general study of such a possibility. To this end, we first emphasise that these neutrinos could display various kinds of sharp spectral features, resulting from the primary energy spectrum at emission, and from how this spectrum is smoothed by redshift and radiative correction effects. Next, we determine the ranges of mass (from a fraction of eV all the way to the Planck scale) and lifetime of the source particles along which we do not/we do expect that the sharp spectral feature will be altered by interactions of the neutrinos on their way to the detector, mainly with the cosmic neutrino background or between themselves. We also study the theoretical (i.e. mainly BBN and CMB) and observational constraints which hold on such a possibility. This allows us to delineate the regions of parameter space (mass, lifetime and abundance) that are already excluded, hopeless for future observation or, instead, which could lead to the observation of such neutrinos in the near future.</p></div></details></article></body>
