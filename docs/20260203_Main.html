We study rotating BHs surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM), exploring their observable features through both analytical and numerical approaches. Using the existence criterion of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), we first derive joint constraints on the PFDM intensity parameter k and the spin parameter a. Within the resulting physically allowed parameter regime, we perform high-resolution, general-relativistic ray-tracing simulations of thin accretion disks at 87 GHz and 230 GHz, capturing the detailed brightness morphology and photon ring structure shaped by PFDM. By incorporating angular diameter measurements of M87^{*} and Sgr A^{*} from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), we further narrow down the viable parameter space and directly compare synthetic images with EHT observations of M87^{*}. We find that the inclusion of PFDM improves the agreement with the observed compact shadow and asymmetric brightness distribution, suggesting that dark matter may leave observable imprints on horizon-scale images. Our results position PFDM as a physically motivated extension to the Kerr geometry and highlight a promising astrophysical pathway for probing dark matter near BHs with current and future VLBI campaigns.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Progress in Particle Physics and Modern Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2602.00106]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This is the translation into English of my paper published in Russian at the paper collection on cosmology at \\ 1981. The content of the book is presented in the Appendix. This is the first paper where the dynamical mechanism of phoenix universe was worked out. The notion of phoenix universe was first mentioned in the paper by Lemaitre in 1933, where he assumed that a repetition of successive phases of expansion and contraction was possible. Lemaitre called such model of the universe, that is born, dies and is reborn, the phoenix model, named after the mythical bird able to reborn from the ashes. According to the author, there could be an infinite number of such cycles in the past and future. In this model, however, a possible solution to the fundamental question was unclear, what was the mechanism for the rebirth of the universe. This mechanism was worked out in my paper, published in 1980 in Russian. Moreover, in our recent paper with E. Arbuzova a mechanism of dynamical cancellation of vacuum energy was proposed, that permits to eliminate vacuum energy locally down to zero and permits universe to jump to a lower hot level, leading to rebirth of a hot universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00223" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supernova Rates and Luminosity Functions from ASAS-SN III: Over a Decade of Type Ia SNe and Their Subtypes</a><span class="id">[2602.00223]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present volumetric rates and luminosity functions (LFs) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN), covering the 11-year period from 2014 to 2024. By combining the 2014–2017 $V$-band sample with the 2018–2024 $g$-band sample, we construct a large statistical dataset of $1776$ SNe Ia. We compute completeness corrections based on injection-recovery simulations of the ASAS-SN light curves, taking into account the variations in light curve shapes. For our standard sample ($M_{g,\mathrm{peak}}&lt;-16.0$ mag), we extract a total volumetric SN Ia rate of $R_{\mathrm{tot}} = (2.55 \pm 0.12) \times 10^4\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,h_{70}^3$ at a median redshift of $z=0.029$. With a statistical uncertainty of $4.7\%$, this is the most precise local measurement to date. While the &quot;normal&quot; SNe Ia account for $(92.7 \pm 1.9)\%$ of this rate, the total LF reveals immense diversity, with $M_{g,\mathrm{peak}}$ spanning over five magnitudes. The LF of SNe Iax is also broad and rises toward lower luminosities, resulting in a likely lower limit of $(4.3 \pm 1.8)\%$ of the total rate. We place strong constraints on the rate of SNe Ia-CSM, finding they account for only $(0.036 \pm 0.017)\%$ of the total local rate. Finally, we find that the low-luminosity 02es-like SNe are $7 \pm 5$ times more common than the luminous 03fg-like SNe. This places demographic constraints on models proposing a physical continuum for these two subtypes, implying that any common channel for the two classes must strongly favor lower-luminosity explosions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fireballs' Whispers of Their Central Engine: Relativistic Filtering of Afterglow QPOs</a><span class="id">[2602.00257]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) afterglows have been suggested as probes of the central engine. Such interpretations generally assume that the observed modulation frequency directly corresponds to an intrinsic oscillation frequency of the source. We show that this assumption is not generally valid and that interpreting such features without accounting for relativistic propagation may lead to misleading inferences about the engine nature. We show that relativistic propagation effects - most importantly integration over equal-arrival-time surfaces - act as a frequency-dependent filter that can significantly modify or suppress intrinsic variability. In the constant- $\Gamma$ case, the angular kernel acts as a stationary low-pass filter that suppresses high-frequency variability without altering its frequency, whereas Blandford-McKee deceleration renders the filter time-dependent and manifests observationally as an apparent frequency drift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fourth HAWC Catalog of Very-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Sources</a><span class="id">[2602.00263]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an updated catalog of TeV gamma-ray sources based on the fifth pass of data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. This release benefits from improved event reconstruction and nearly three additional years of observations. It also incorporates a systematic multi-source fitting framework, enabling more flexible and accurate modeling of the gamma-ray sky. This fitting procedure was modeled after the manual approach used in HAWC analyses of individual sources and regions, as well as other gamma-ray catalogs, like the 4FGL. In addition to more varied modeling of source morphology and spectral parameters compared to previous HAWC catalogs, this catalog uses a robust modeling of Galactic diffuse TeV emission. The fitting procedure uses both point-like and symmetric Gaussian spatial templates to model the source morphology. The spectral shape of the emission is modeled with either a simple power-law or log-parabola to explore curvature in the spectral energy distribution. We report 85 sources at the 4{\sigma} level, including 11 sources not associated with any TeVCat source using a distance-based association criterion. Distance-based association with the 1LHAASO catalog results in 22 4HWC sources without a counterpart. Additionally, there are 12 sources not associated with any physical counterpart in the Low- or High-Mass X-Ray Binary, the ATNF, or Fermi Pulsar, or SNR catalogs of sources. Five of the aforementioned sources have no counterpart in any of the catalogs searched and represent an opportunity for follow-up observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00301" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studying dark gaps in Ly-$α$ forest transmission with large reionization simulation</a><span class="id">[2602.00301]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The physical conditions of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the final stages of cosmic reionization ($z\sim5.0-6.0$) are not yet fully understood. Recent reports of unexpectedly large-scale ($\ge 150 h^{-1}\mathrm{cMpc}$) correlation in Ly-$\alpha$ transmission flux using extended XQR-30 quasar spectra pose interesting consequences on the reionization end stages. In this work, we investigate the Ly-$\alpha$ forest dark-gap distribution (defined as regions with transmitted flux below 0.05) as another sensitive tracer of the IGM, using an efficient, large-volume ($\sim 1 ~\mathrm{Gpc}$) simulation framework. By constructing a suite of physically motivated model variants (i.e, varying the reionization redshift, IGM temperature, and ionizing-photon mean free path), we generate synthetic sightlines and compare their predicted cumulative distribution of dark gaps with that of observed spectra (at redshift intervals of $\Delta z=0.2$). We find that most of the models achieve qualitatively consistent agreement with the data. Specifically, the scenario involving a slightly later reionization completion ($z\sim 5.4$) provides the closest match, while a short constant mean free path model disfavors the data at lower redshifts. These findings give further support for the emerging scenario of reionization end extending to $z\le5.7$, although they can not rule out a slightly early reionization with enhanced post-ionization ultraviolet (UV) background fluctuations. A similar conclusion arises from the redshift distribution of long dark gap ($L\ge 30 ~h^{-1}\mathrm{cMpc}$) fraction. However, the model variants are still not able to reproduce the observed strong flux correlations at unusually large scales, which remains open for further investigations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electron-positron cascade in magnetospheres of supermassive Kerr black holes and the origin of relativistic AGN jets</a><span class="id">[2602.00313]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The avalanche mechanism of plasma production in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is detailed, and constraints on system parameters needed for efficient electron-positron pair cascades are explored. Whether an AGN falls within this favorable parameter range may explain the observed radio-loud versus radio-quiet dichotomy. On the other hand, this study shows that cascades generate orders of magnitude fewer pairs than is necessary to explain the synchrotron emission observed in luminous jets. This fact suggests the existence of either an alternative lepton source, namely pair production of photons from the hot accretion flows around AGN central black holes, or matter loading of the jets from the surrounding medium, or, most likely, both. The case of the radio galaxy 3C 120 is considered in detail.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Interactions and Habitability in the TOI-700 Multi-Planet System</a><span class="id">[2602.00332]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of a second earth sized planet (TOI-700e) interior to the habitable candidate TOI-700d has prompted further research into this system, as the additional planet makes the TOI-700 system a tightly packed multi-planet system with multiple planets in the habitable zone, like TRAPPIST-1. In this work, we use the planetary evolution code VPLanet to assess the potential habitability of TOI-700d and TOI-700e. We first examine their orbital dynamics to evaluate the influence of planet-planet interactions on the planet spin, obliquity, and eccentricity. We then investigate whether these interactions are sufficient to cause either TOI-700d or e to be perturbed out of a habitable state, and whether we expect either planet could retain surface oceans over Gyr timescales. Together, these analyses allow us to assess the long-term habitability prospects of both TOI-700d and TOI-700e. We find that multi-planet interactions in the TOI-700 system do not prevent either planet from potentially retaining habitable conditions; however, we find that TOI-700e is located very near the boundary of the tidally locked habitable zone ( arXiv:1705.10362 ), suggesting further work is needed to determine whether it is truly habitable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nested, asymmetric H$-$He circumstellar shells in the Type Icn/Ibn SN 2024abvb</a><span class="id">[2602.00389]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interacting transients probe mass loss in the final stages of stellar evolution; however, the geometry and timing of multi-episode mass loss remain poorly constrained. SN 2024abvb is a nearby interacting event with transitional Ibn/Icn spectroscopic properties and multi-epoch polarimetry, offering a rare opportunity to study structured circumstellar material (CSM). We aim to characterise the kinematics, composition and geometry of the CSM around SN 2024abvb and to identify plausible progenitor/ejection scenarios that can produce the observed spectro-polarimetric evolution. We present high-resolution (VLT/UVES and VLT/X-Shooter) optical/NIR spectroscopy across several epochs, complemented by broadband polarimetry and spectropolarimetry (VLT/FORS2 and NOT/ALFOSC). Line identifications, velocity decompositions and polarimetric time-series are used to trace multiple kinematic components and changes in scattering geometry. The high-resolution spectra reveal multiple narrow CSM components composed of He, C and O with absorption minima at $\sim150 - 400$ km s$^{-1}$ and additional faster material up to $\sim2000$ \kms. Low-velocity Balmer absorptions are present, indicating distant H-rich material, a first in SNe Ibn/Icn. Polarimetry shows a marked evolution ($P\sim1\%$ near peak, $\lesssim0.5\%$ after $\sim1$ week, rising to $\sim1.5\%$ at $\sim20$ d with $\sim50^\circ$ position-angle rotation and to $\sim4\%$ at $\sim30$ d, stronger in the blue), implying a time-variable, wavelength-dependent scattering/obscuration component. The combination of kinematics and polarimetric behaviour is consistent with multiple, concentric toroidal shells with differing orientations and partial dust content.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydration Features on Near-Earth Objects: Integrating New Data with Prior Results</a><span class="id">[2602.00430]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Near-Earth objects (NEOs) are excellent laboratories for testing processes that affect airless bodies, as well as informing us about Solar System history. Though most NEOs are nominally anhydrous because they formed inside the Solar System frost line and their surface temperatures are high enough to remove volatiles, a 3-micron feature typically indicative of OH/H2O has been identified on several such bodies. Possible sources for OH/H2O on these bodies include carbonaceous chondrite impactors or interactions with protons implanted by solar wind. The MIT-Hawaii Near-Earth Object Spectroscopic Survey (MITHNEOS) began its 3-micron observation campaign of NEOs in 2022 and has obtained spectral data of 15 predominantly nominally anhydrous (i.e., mostly S-complex or V-type) targets using NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility's (IRTF) near-infrared spectrometer, SpeX. Spectra were collected using both prism (0.7-2.52 micron) and LXD_short (1.67-4.2 micron) modes to accurately characterize asteroid spectral type and the 3-micron region. Four of the 15 NEOs observed exhibit a 3-micron feature, exhibiting band shapes similar to those identified in a previous NEO survey (McGraw et al. 2022), which found a trend between hydration band presence and large aphelion (i.e., Q &gt; 2.06 AU). Combining our new observations with the pre-existing database of NEO 2-4-micron data revealed that band depth increases with decreasing orbital inclination and that all NEOs with hydration bands have i &lt; 27 degrees with most having i &lt; 14 degrees. We find that NEOs with low inclination and large aphelia are the most likely bodies in near-Earth space to possess surficial OH/H2O.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Envelope Inflation and outflow Driven by Energy Deposition in Massive Stars</a><span class="id">[2602.00546]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Evolved massive stars are known to undergo outflow with high mass ejections, resulting in the loss of a substantial portion of their envelopes. One proposed mechanism driving these events is the release or deposition of energy within the stellar envelope. We use a one-dimensional hydrodynamical code to investigate the resulting outflow and stellar response to energy deposition at specific regions inside a $\rm 70 \, M_{\odot}$ star. We compare hydrostatic and hydrodynamic models and test for different energies and widths of the depositing region. We find that due to the deposited energy, the envelope expands significantly, and under certain conditions, such as assuming a uniform electron scattering opacity, this energy input becomes sufficient to unbind material from the outer envelope. This, in turn, leads to the formation of an outflow. We find that higher deposited energy triggers a strong outflow and results in a somewhat hotter and less expanded envelope due to the rapid loss of energy through expelled material. This driving mechanism leads to sudden envelope expansion and the formation of strong outflows in our models, highlighting the generic hydrodynamic response of massive star envelopes to impulsive energy input.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamma-Ray Bursts: Evidence for a Common Origin of X-ray Plateaus with Diverse Temporal Decay Index</a><span class="id">[2602.00662]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A significant fraction of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibit a plateau in the early X-ray afterglow light curve, whose mechanism remains uncertain. While the post-plateau normal decay index ($\alpha_2$) is commonly used to constrain the afterglow dynamics, the shallow-decay slope of the plateau itself ($\alpha_1$) has received comparatively little attention. Recent observations, however, reveal substantial dispersion in $\alpha_1$, raising the question of whether GRBs with rising, flat and mildly decaying plateaus represent intrinsically distinct populations. To address this question, we collect a uniform sample of 185 $\textit{Swift}$ GRBs with a well-defined plateau and divide them into three groups based on $\alpha_1$. Using a non-parametric approach, we reconstruct their X-ray luminosity functions, redshift distributions and event rates. It is found that the three groups exhibit statistically consistent properties across all diagnostics, with no evidence for group-specific features. Monte Carlo perturbation tests further show that these results are insensitive to the adopted classification boundaries of $\alpha_1$. Our results indicate that variations in the plateau slope $\alpha_1$ do not define distinct GRB subclasses, but instead the sample constitutes a statistically uniform population governed by a common framework.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00724" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Population synthesis of double white dwarfs: evolutionary effects on system properties</a><span class="id">[2602.00724]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are natural outcomes of binary stellar evolution and key sources for future space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We investigate how different binary interaction channels shape the physical and orbital properties of DWD systems, focusing on component masses, orbital separations, core compositions, and mass transfer rates. Using the binary population synthesis code COMPAS, we evolve $10^7$ binaries with physically motivated initial distributions of binary parameters. Our simulations reproduce the strong bimodality in the final orbital separations, including a pronounced deficit of systems around $100-500 \rm\,R_\odot$, arising from distinct evolutionary pathways: wide DWDs predominantly originate from stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), while close DWDs form through unstable RLOF leading to at least one common envelope (CE) phase. Moreover, we show that the core compositions of WDs provide a powerful tracer of evolutionary history: He-core WDs are strongly concentrated in close systems, whereas CO-core WDs span the full separation range and exhibit a small mass gap in wide binaries. We further identify a correlation between the accreted mass and the final orbital separation, highlighting the impact of non-conservative mass transfer on the resulting orbital configuration of DWD systems. These results underscore the links among evolutionary channels, chemical composition, and mass transfer rates; thereby provide a unique framework for interpreting Gaia DWD samples and forecasting the joint electromagnetic and GW population accessible to LISA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00765" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A study of solar energetic particle transport on 30 March 2022 using multi-spacecraft data assimilation</a><span class="id">[2602.00765]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze a unique solar energetic particle event observed simultaneously by the BepiColombo and STEREO-A spacecraft on March 30, 2022. The two spacecraft at heliocentric distances of 0.6 and 1.0 AU are expected to be aligned approximately along the same magnetic field line, providing a valuable opportunity to investigate particle transport processes in the inner heliosphere. Protons with energies above 1.0 MeV exhibit velocity dispersion during the rise phase, suggesting that the energetic particles are produced close to the Sun, possibly associated with a coronal mass ejection. In contrast, protons during the decay phase are characterized by long-lasting time profiles with longer time scales at 1.0 AU than at 0.6 AU, suggesting that the particles deviate from ballistic propagation. By assimilating these multi-spacecraft observation data into numerical simulations of the focused transport equation, for the first time, we estimate the mean free path parallel to the magnetic field as a time series. The inferred mean free path decreases over time and approaches around 0.5-1.0 AU at the STEREO-A location during the decay phase, suggesting an increasing influence of scattering on particle transport. This interpretation is qualitatively supported by independent STEREO-A observations that showed increasing magnetic field fluctuations, suggesting the connection between the particle transport and the local field fluctuations. However, only a fraction of these fluctuations is expected to contribute to particle scattering, which may be due to the multidimensional nature of magnetic field fluctuations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flow Generation via Catastrophic Loss of Equilibrium in Weakly-Rotating Self-Gravitating Fluids: A Minimal Idealized Model</a><span class="id">[2602.00786]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper explores the catastrophic energy transformations, in particular the ones leading to the generation of a flow in a weakly rotating self-gravitating fluid/gas found, for instance, in the vicinity of a massive compact object. Because of the similarity in the governing equations, the system dynamics is worked out exactly in parallel to the methods developed for investigating catastrophic relaxation in stellar plasmas [1-3]. In the latter a more “complex&quot; equilibrium state, on slow changes in the environment, can lose its equilibrium (catastrophe), and transform to a less complex state with a very different energy mix from the original. It is shown that a similar transformation in the weakly rotating self-gravitating fluid/gas will convert much of its gravitation energy into kinetic energy in the flow. Since flows are a perennial ingredient of high-energy astrophysical systems, the energy transformation processes revealed in present study, can advance our understanding of a variety of them. Some particularly relevant examples are: macro-scale flows / structures in galaxies, accretion discs, and the dynamics and stability of a rotating star / its atmosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elongation of a Solar Filament and its Three-Dimensional Numerical Reconstruction for Magnetic Structures</a><span class="id">[2602.00801]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quiescent filaments are prominent features of the solar atmosphere, and their evolution reflects the coronal magnetic field's response to photospheric magnetic activity. Here, we report on a quiescent filament observed from 2023 September 28-29, aiming to understand how the magnetic configuration shapes its feet and drives its extension. For this purpose, high-resolution spectral data in H$\alpha$ and Mg II k are used from the Télescope Héliographique pour l'Etude du Magnétisme et des Instabilités Solaires (THEMIS) and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), respectively. To track changes in the filament, we utilise long-term data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG). We analyse the longitudinal magnetic field in the photosphere using the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard Hinode, as well as SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data. In addition to this, we use GONG H$\alpha$ data to analyze the longitudinal oscillations in the filament. Observations show that parasitic polarities and canceling flux play a key role in forming and reorganizing the filament feet and in lengthening the filament. A 3D MHD reconstruction using vector magnetograms reveals that its magnetic configuration evolves into a full flux rope (FR), whose extension on the second day matches the observed filament growth. The FR is separated from the surrounding nearly potential field by quasi-separatrix layers, which in turn are separated by current layers. They get more organized around the FR as it is growing up. Moreover, the longitudinal oscillations in the extended filament are attributed to heating from flux cancellation in underlying bright points.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00802" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Has Kronos devoured Planet Nine and its epigones?</a><span class="id">[2602.00802]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Planet Nine hypothesis encompasses a body of about 5-8 Earth's masses whose orbital plane would be inclined to the ecliptic by one or two tens of degrees and whose perihelion distance would be as large as about 240-385 astronomical units. Recently, a couple of his epigones have appeared: Planet X and Planet Y. The former is a sort of minor version of Planet Nine in that all its physical and orbital parameters would be smaller. Instead, the latter would have a mass ranging from that of Mercury to the Earth's one and semimajor axis within 100-200 astronomical units. By using realistic upper bounds for the orbital precessions of Saturn, one can get insights on their position which, for Planet Nine, appears approximately confined around its aphelion. Planet Y can be just a Mercury-sized object at no less than about 125 astronomical units, while Planet X appears to be ruled out. Dedicated data reductions by modeling such perturber(s) are required to check the present conclusions, to be intended as hints of what might be detectable should planetary ephemerides include them. A probe on the same route of Voyager 1 would be perturbed by Planet Nine by about 20-40 km after some decades.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00820" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Dynamics of Multi-Axion Quintessence</a><span class="id">[2602.00820]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One fundamental physics interpretation of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results is that the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe is driven not by the cosmological constant, but by a slowly rolling scalar field, a natural model for which is an axion with a decay constant close to the Planck scale. In the “string axiverse” one expects not one, but many, axions and this may allow the ability to engineer large effective decay constants. We thus investigate dark energy dynamics in a toy model with two axions, and compute the prior probability for the dark energy equation of state parameters $(w_0,w_a)$ implied by priors on the fundamental parameters of the model conditioned weakly on the resulting cosmology. We find various interesting behaviours, for example where both fields can be in an oscillating regime while maintaining $w_0&lt;-1/3$, and models with opposite sign for $w_a$ than in a single-field model. The prior probability in $(w_0,w_a)$ gains support away from the “thawing quintessence” behaviour preferred by DESI, and when the axions have cross-interactions this effect becomes stronger. When the axions interact, one in general still requires large decay constants, but if the axions are non-interacting the largest decay constant can be reduced. The novel equations of state we illustrate may also be of relevance to models of early dark energy or inflation/reheating with mutliple axions. Further exploration of dynamics in models with $N\gg 1$ axions is warranted.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What's Their Age Again? A Blue-Straggler Merger Scenario in the $γ$ Persei Binary System</a><span class="id">[2602.00896]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We used MIST isochrone fitting and a dedicated grid of stellar evolution models computed with MESA to constrain the ages of the components of the $\gamma$ Persei binary system. While individual stars can be matched to the models at specific metallicities, no joint isochrone solution reproduces both the observed masses and evolutionary states. The stellar evolutionary tracks calculated by \texttt{MESA} reveal a clear evolutionary mismatch. The primary component of the system is in a post-main-sequence phase consistent with the red giant branch or red clump. In contrast, the lighter secondary component lies near the turn-off point of the main-sequence or is in the early phase of the subgiant branch. This discrepancy can be overcome by assuming that the $\gamma$ Persei system was born as a triple and the primary component is a rejuvenated star formed through a merger of a close-by pair of main-sequence stars. We show that the merger must have occurred no later than a few hundred Myr after system formation, and the progenitor masses of the merging stars are restricted by a combination of stars that fall within a narrow band in the $(M_{1,a},M_{1,b})$ plane, corresponding to $M_{1,a}\simeq0.9$-$2.1\,M_\odot$ and $M_{1,b}\simeq2.3$-$2.5\,M_\odot$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Successive Partial Disruptions with Orbital Precession in a White Dwarf-Black Hole System for Repeating GRB 250702B</a><span class="id">[2602.01073]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The peculiar gamma-ray burst GRB 250702B is the longest event ever observed, lasting about one day and exhibiting four prompt-emission flares of $\sim100$ s with irregular recurrence intervals of at least one hour. To explain this hierarchy of timescales, we consider a scenario in which a stellar object undergoes repeated partial tidal disruptions by a black hole (BH). We find that if a white dwarf (WD) is on a highly eccentric orbit ($e\approx0.97$) around an intermediate-mass black hole (BH) with $M_{\rm BH}\lesssim10^{6}\,M_\odot$ and $a = 50\,R_\odot\left(M_{\rm BH}/10^{6}\,M_\odot\right)^{1/3}$, the observed properties of GRB 250702B can be naturally reproduced. In this framework, the duration of each flare is determined by the viscous accretion timescale of material stripped near pericenter, with a typical mass $\Delta M \approx 2\times10^{-2}\,M_\odot$. The minimum recurrence time corresponds to the orbital period, while the total activity period is set by the secular orbital evolution timescale leading to the complete disruption of the WD. Furthermore, if $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{5}\,M_\odot$ and the orbit has a minimum polar angle relative to the BH equatorial plane of $\theta_{\rm min}\gtrsim0.12 {\rm rad}$, relativistic frame dragging induces $\gtrsim0.1$ rad precession of the orbital angular momentum between successive pericenter passages, comparable to a typical GRB jet half-opening angle, resulting in intermittent alignment with the observer and irregular flare spacing. The WD experiences $\approx40$ jet-launch episodes before complete disruption, but only four are expected to be observed on-axis. The remaining off-axis jets become visible at late times, enhancing the radio afterglow by about an order of magnitude, providing a testable prediction of this scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01093" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ocean Circulation on Tide-locked Lava Worlds: 3D Modeling with a Simple Boundary Iteration Method</a><span class="id">[2602.01093]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tide-locked lava worlds are surface-melted rocky planets under 1:1 tidally locked orbit (i.e., synchronously rotating) with orbital period being equal to rotation period and with permanent hot dayside and cold nightside. Previous studies on this type of planets employed scaling analyses and two-dimensional (2D) simulations. This work is a continuation of the previous researches but including the effect of the Coriolis force and the simulation domain is extended to a 3D global sphere. We find that under the condition with thermal-only forcing (without surface wind stresses), the area-mean ocean depth is about 50–300 m (depending on vertical diffusivity) and the area-mean effect of horizontal ocean heat transport (in the order of 10$^{3}$ to 10$^{4}$ W m$^{-2}$) is significantly smaller than stellar radiation (in the order of 10$^{6}$ W m$^{-2}$ at the substellar region), being consistent with previous results. Different from 2D results, due to the effect of the Coriolis force, large-scale horizontal gyres form on the dayside, ocean currents near the west boundaries are much stronger than that near the east boundaries (called as “western intensification”), the deepest ocean is not right at the substellar point but in the middle latitudes as the vertical diffusivity is moderate or large, and meanwhile there exists significant asymmetry between the west and the east of the substellar point. These results establish a first picture for the 3D thermal-driven ocean circulation and confirm that the lava ocean should be shallow on tide-locked lava worlds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation-Driven Origin of Super-Equipartition Magnetic Fields in Accretion Discs and Outflows</a><span class="id">[2602.01097]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic fields play a central role in accretion physics around black holes, yet their physical origin within accretion flows remains an open problem. In this work, we investigate the generation and subsequent evolution of magnetic fields triggered by anisotropic radiation fields in black hole accretion discs with compact rotating inner corona. We self-consistently evolve the magnetic field using the generalized field evolution MHD equation, including advection, shear-driven induction, and Hall effects. The radiation field acts as a primary field generator, while azimuthal rotation in the magnetized plasma provides rapid amplification. We find that radiation-generated fields efficiently reach a dominant toroidal component by Keplerian rotation, leading to magnetic field strengths of order $\sim 10^{8}\,\mathrm{G}$ in the vicinity of a 10 solar mass black hole and accretion disc-corona emitting at luminosity equivalent to the Eddington unit. These magnetic fields are achieved within viscous timescales and reach or exceed local equipartition estimates based on gas pressure. When vertical outflows are included, the amplified magnetic fields are advected into the corona, magnetizing disc-launched winds and jet precursors with field strengths of similar order. Our results demonstrate that radiation is not merely a passive component of accretion flows, but provides a robust and unavoidable trigger for the generation of dynamically significant magnetic fields. Our results provide a physically grounded explanation for the origin of large-scale, structured magnetic fields in and around accretion discs. This mechanism offers a pathway for magnetizing accretion discs and their outflows without invoking externally supplied magnetic flux, with broad implications for X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei and other transients such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skewness in the Hellings-Downs curve</a><span class="id">[2602.01108]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent Pulsar Timing Array datasets provide compelling evidence for a nano-Hertz gravitational-wave background, but robust detection requires characterizing statistical fluctuations of the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation expected from a finite population of discrete sources. Building on the variance calculation of Allen (2023), we derive the third central moment (skewness) of the HD correlation for a single unpolarized point source and an ensemble of many interfering point sources in the confusion-noise regime. To isolate the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of the background, we extend the pulsar-averaging formalism to third order by introducing a three-point averaged correlation function, which allows us to define the cosmic skewness. We find that the skewness remains non-zero in the large-source-number limit and is controlled by a new geometric three-point function. These results suggest that incorporating higher-order moments could provide additional information on source discreteness beyond standard Gaussian analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Herringbone structures during an X-class eruptive flare</a><span class="id">[2602.01117]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we report quasi-periodic herringbone structures during the impulsive phase of an X-class flare, coinciding with the distinct acceleration phase of eruptive prominence ejection on 2023 December 31. The prominence propagates non-radially in the southeast direction with an inclination angle of $\sim$35$\fdg$4. The fast coronal mass ejection (CME) at a speed of $\sim$2852 km s$^{-1}$ drives a shock wave and a coronal EUV wave. The herringbone structures lasting for $\sim$4 minutes take place at the initial stage of a group of type II radio burst. The herringbones in the frequency range 20$-$70 MHz are characterized by simultaneous forward-drift and reverse-drift bursts with average durations of $\sim$2.5 s and $\sim$3.1 s. The frequency drift rates of these bursts fall in a range of 1.3$-$9.4 MHz s$^{-1}$ with average values of $\sim$3.6 and $\sim$4.1 MHz s$^{-1}$, respectively. The speeds of electron beams producing the herringbones are estimated to be 0.04$-$0.41 $c$, with average values of $\sim$0.23 $c$ and $\sim$0.11 $c$ for forward-drifting and reverse-drift bursts, respectively. The heights of particle acceleration regions are estimated to be 0.64$-$0.78 $R_{\sun}$ above the photosphere, which are consistent with the height of CME front ($\sim$0.75 $R_{\sun}$) when the shock forms. Quasi-periodic pulsations with periods of 17.5$-$21.3 s are found in the radio fluxes of herringbones, suggesting that electrons are accelerated by the CME-driven shock intermittently.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detectability and Model Discriminability of the Dark Ages 21 cm Global Signal</a><span class="id">[2602.01263]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 21 cm signal from neutral hydrogen atom is almost the only way to directly probe the Dark Ages. The Dark Ages 21 cm signal, observed at frequencies below 50 MHz, can serve as a powerful probe of cosmology, as the standard cosmological model predicts a well-defined 21 cm spectral shape. In this work, we assess the detectability and model-selection power of 21 cm observations assuming physically motivated foregrounds, optimistic error levels, and several observing strategies for the signals predicted in various cosmological models. Using a Bayesian evidence-based comparison, we find that wide-band observations covering 1-50 MHz can identify the evidence of non-zero 21 cm signals from models considered in this paper except the one with a smooth spectrum that peaks at lower frequencies. In particular, observations below 15 MHz are essential to avoid degeneracies with the foreground. Furthermore, even with observations measured at 5 MHz intervals over the frequency range 1-50 MHz, the 21 cm signal can be identified if the errors are sufficiently small. This indicates that the intrinsic 21 cm spectral shape can be captured without foreground degeneracy even with a limited number of frequency channels.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Variable-Slope Smooth-$k$ Filter for Modeling Halo Abundances with Damped and Oscillatory Power Spectra</a><span class="id">[2602.01320]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a variable-slope smooth-$k$ (VSMK) filter within the Press-Schechter formalism to model halo mass functions derived from damped and oscillatory matter power spectra. While the standard smooth-$k$ approach successfully captures small-scale suppression effects, it intrinsically couples these to oscillatory features at intermediate scales. The VSMK filter generalizes this framework by allowing the effective logarithmic slope of the $k$-space window function to vary smoothly between two asymptotic regimes, thereby decoupling the small-scale suppression of halo abundances from the intermediate-scale oscillatory features characteristic of dark acoustic oscillations. We compare the analytic predictions obtained with the VSMK filter to $N$-body simulations for warm dark matter and ETHOS-based models, showing that a single parameter set reproduces both regimes simultaneously. The VSMK filter thus provides a unified and flexible analytic framework for modeling halo abundances in non-cold dark matter scenarios with damped and oscillatory power spectra.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar Flare Hosts MeV-peaked Electrons in a Coronal Source</a><span class="id">[2602.01323]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar flares promptly release large amounts of free magnetic energy in the solar corona to produce substantial populations of high-energy charged particles, both ions and electrons. These particles are detected when they radiate microwaves in solar magnetic fields and X- and {\gamma}-rays when they encounter matter. Analysis of {\gamma}-rays in solar flares has revealed a distinct continuum component dominating at MeV energies, which differs from the well-studied X-ray continuum produced by flare-accelerated electrons with steeply falling energy spectra. The origin and precise spatial location and extent of this mysterious MeV component have been unknown up to now. If it is produced by bremsstrahlung, such a {\gamma}-ray component requires an unusual population of electrons peaked at a few MeV. Here we report a joint study of this MeV-peaked electron population in the 2017-Sep-10 solar flare with Fermi MeV {\gamma}-ray data and EOVSA spatially resolved microwave imaging spectroscopy data. We demonstrate that the microwave spectrum from the peaked MeV distribution has a distinctly different shape from that produced by the well-known population of electrons with falling energy spectrum. We inspected microwave maps of the flare and identified an evolving area where the measured microwave spectra matched the theoretically expected one for the MeV-peaked population, thus pinpointing the site where this MeV component resides in the flare. The locations are in a coronal volume adjacent to the region where prominent release of magnetic energy and bulk electron acceleration were detected, which implies that transport effects play a key role in forming this population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A single field inflationary potential consistent with recent observations</a><span class="id">[2602.01327]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current observations indicate that an inverse exponential form of the inflaton potential provides an excellent description of single-field inflation.

To describe post-inflationary evolution and reheating, we extend the inverse exponential potential by adding a steep exponential term that remains negligible during inflation but becomes important afterwards. The resulting full potential develops a minimum after the end of inflation, leading to oscillations of the scalar field and consequently reheating of the Universe. We find that the maximum reheating temperature attainable in this scenario is of order $10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV}$.

Notably, the chemical potential enables efficient production even when the $U(1)$-breaking mass is smaller than the effective diagonal mass. We compute the gravitational wave signal generated by this mechanism during inflation, derive the primordial tensor spectrum, and map it to the present day energy density $\Omega_{\mathrm GW}(f)$. Assuming the $U(1)$ field constitutes the dominant component of dark matter, this mapping fixes the characteristic frequency, which we compare with projected sensitivity curves of ongoing and proposed gravitational wave observatories.

The current classification of $\delta$ Scuti stars into High-Amplitude $\delta$ Scuti (HADS) and Low-Amplitude $\delta$ Scuti (LADS) stars is based on the peak-to-peak amplitude of their light curves (&gt;0.3 mag). Nevertheless, this classification may not fully capture the complexity of their pulsation mechanisms and non-linear effects, leading to possible misclassifications. This investigation aims to challenge the existing classification of $\delta$ Scuti stars according to amplitude, employing the exploration of frequency domain features and non-linear mechanisms in order to identify intrinsic subgroups. The objective is to get a deeper understanding of the properties of $\delta$ Scuti stars. We use machine learning clustering techniques, specifically hierarchical clustering (HC) with Ward's linkage, to analyze a sample of 142 $\delta$ Scuti stars observed by space telescopes such as CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS. We focus on frequency-domain features, including fundamental and overtone modes, as well as non-linear features such as harmonic, sums, and subtraction frequencies, to uncover intrinsic subgroups within $\delta$ Scuti stars. The results of the clustering process indicate that the present amplitude-based classification (HADS/LADS) exhibits partial alignment with the clusters identified by using features from the frequency-domain. However, the study identified additional sub-groups, suggesting a greater variety of nonlinear effects that are not captured by the amplitude alone. It highlights the importance of non-linear features, such as the number of subtraction combinations, which may be indicative of resonance effects or other internal physical mechanisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01364" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling the Dynamics and Thermochemistry for the Outer Atmospheres of the Ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b</a><span class="id">[2602.01364]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present three-dimensional simulations of the ultra-hot Jupiter (UHJ) WASP-121b from the planetary surface to extended outflows, coupling hydrodynamics with consistent non-equilibrium thermochemistry, ray-tracing radiative transfer, and hydrodynamics using the GPU-accelerated Kratos framework. The fiducial model exhibits several atmospheric layers, including the lower atmospheres controlled by day-night circulation, and transonic photoevaporative outflows at higher altitudes shaped into two spiral arms by the stellar gravity and orbital motion effects. Different species could trace different regions: Fe probes rotation-dominated inner layers, Na maps dense spiral arms where recombination balances photoionization, and H$\alpha$ and He $10830~{\rm A}$ features trace progressively more extended, ionized gas. With spiral arm velocities reaching $\sim 40~{\rm km\ s}^{-1}$ projected along the line of sight, this morphology explains observed high-velocity Na and H$\alpha$ absorption features without requiring significant super-rotation jet streams. Parametric studies reveal complex dependencies on stellar irradiation: enhanced FUV intensifies outflows and extends spiral arms spatially and kinematically, while EUV and X-ray expands spiral structures into attenuated, ionized regions. Stellar wind confinement compresses the dayside outflow and enhances metastable helium absorption. This work demonstrates that current and future transmission spectral observations that probe multiple species can provide important constraints on astrophysical environments of UHJs by comparing state-of-the-art simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01373" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigation on Quasi-periodic Oscillation Phase Lag of RE J1034+396</a><span class="id">[2602.01373]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We conduct an in-depth study of the quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) properties of RE J1034+396, by constructing QPO phase-folded light curves from 10 XMM-Newton observations during 2020-2021.

They are key $\gamma$-ray sources providing a unique laboratory for studying extreme particle acceleration and plasma physics. Variability in $\gamma$-ray emission is an important signature that may constrain the size of the emission region and the physical processes driving flares. However, current large-scale $\gamma$-ray catalogs, such as the Fermi-LAT 4LAC-DR3, typically characterize variability only on long timescales (yearly or 60-day), lacking necessary constraints on short-term behavior from days to weeks. To address this, we systematically characterize $\gamma$-ray variability in AGNs across short timescales: 3-day, 7-day (weekly), and 30-day (monthly). We present a preliminary catalogue of variable AGN based on light curves from the Fermi-LAT Light Curve Repository. We show that the variability amplitude ($\sigma_{\rm NXS}^{2}$) presents similar values across different timescales, potentially increasing for a subsample of sources as the observation timescale increases. This high-cadence analysis reinforces the known dichotomy between flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), with FSRQs consistently exhibiting stronger variability. By identifying the most luminous and variable sources at each timescale, we highlight key targets for follow-up with next-generation observatories such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), ASTRI Mini-Array, and the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO), where strong short-term variability suggests highly compact emission zones and extreme particle acceleration efficiency. This catalogue contributes to the understanding of high-energy outflows in AGN jets and provides a foundation for optimizing observational strategies through a unified variability metric across timescales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exoALMA XIX: Confirmation of Non-thermal Line Broadening in the DM Tau Protoplanetary Disk</a><span class="id">[2602.01620]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Turbulence is expected to transport angular momentum and drive mass accretion in protoplanetary disks.

Using the radiative transfer code mcfost within a Bayesian inference framework that evaluates over five million disk models to efficiently sample the parameter space, we fit high-resolution (0.15&quot;, 28 m s-1) 12CO J = 3-2 observations of DM Tau from the exoALMA Large Program. This approach enables us to simultaneously constrain the disk structure and kinematics, revealing a significant nonthermal contribution to the line width of  0.4cs, inconsistent with purely thermal motions. Using the CO-based disk structure as a starting point, we reproduce the CS J = 7-6 emission well, demonstrating that the CS (which is more sensitive to nonthermal motions than CO) agrees with the turbulence inferred from the CO fit. Establishing a well-constrained background disk model further allows us to identify residual structures in the moment maps that deviate from the expected emission, revealing localized perturbations that may trace forming planets. This framework provides a powerful general approach for extracting disk structure and nonthermal broadening directly from molecular line data and can be applied to other disks with high-quality observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting neutrino-driven magnetogenesis during stellar core collapse</a><span class="id">[2602.01659]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The literature has not converged onto a precise depiction of the magnetogenesis process for pulsars, and it is profitable to preliminarily but exhaustively assess the viability of the plethora of alternative proposals, before substantial efforts are invested into simulating them in detail.

We discover a new transition at $L_{\rm t} \approx 4.5 \times 10^{37}\ {\rm erg\ s^{-1}}$, accompanied by systematic evolution of spectral parameters, in particular a significant turnover in the blackbody normalization. This transition luminosity in the sub-Eddington regime represents the fifth transition identified so far in Swift J0243.6+6124, further highlighting the complexity of its accretion-powered emission. We interpret the transition in terms of a multipolar magnetic-field configuration, where weak ($\sim 2.8 \times 10^{12}\ {\rm G}$) and strong ($\sim 1.6 \times 10^{13}\ {\rm G}$) magnetic poles dominate the emission at different accretion rates. On the magnetospheric scale, this configuration is equivalent to an effective dipole field of $\sim 6.6 \times 10^{12}\ {\rm G}$, while allowing the local surface field to exceed $10^{13}\ {\rm G}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigation of magnetic topology and triggering mechanisms of a C-class flare and active-region blowout jet</a><span class="id">[2602.01742]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronal jets are collimated plasma eruptions which are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere. Believed to be triggered by magnetic reconnection, these jets can contribute to various phenomena, including coronal heating and particle acceleration. Coronal jets are a contemporary area of research with their onset mechanism meriting further attention. Importantly, a subclass of jets, the blowout jets, are particularly interesting because of their broad spire, suggesting substantial three-dimensional (3D) reconnection between open and closed field lines involving 3D null points. Consequently, here we explore the onset of a blowout jet associated with Active Region (AR) SPoCA 29093 detected by Spatial Possibilistic Clustering Algorithm (SPoCA). This AR produced a C1.1-class flare on 10 November 2022 and we investigate it using a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic simulation initiated with a non force-free-field (NFFF) extrapolation of the photospheric magnetic field. Key elements of the extrapolated field lines are the presence of a 3D null and a magnetic flux rope (MFR) co-located with the jet activity region, the evolution of which is further traced in the simulation. The simulation suggests that magnetic reconnection is responsible for the evolution of the MFR, leading to a near-simultaneous onset of the flare and jet as observed by the AIA/SDO. In particular, the simulation shows spontaneous creation and annihilation of 3D null pairs via magnetic reconnection near the jet region. Such spontaneous null pair generation, in principle, can trigger or contribute to coronal jets; opening up a new avenue for further research.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01887" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Achondrites in meteor data: Spectra, dynamics, and physical properties of candidate aubrite and eucrite impactors</a><span class="id">[2602.01887]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Meteor spectroscopy presents new opportunities for investigating the diversity of small Solar System bodies and capturing the real distribution of present material types. We analyze 180 higher-resolution meteor spectra from the All-sky Meteor Orbit System (AMOS) network to identify meteoroids with atypical compositions. In addition to several iron bodies, we identify the first two achondritic meteoroids in our database, both likely meteorite-dropping impactors, and compare them with a reference ordinary chondrite meteoroid observed under similar conditions. Their spectra show strong compositional departures: one case has strong Mg and Si with low Fe, while the other has strong Ca, Al and Ti with low Mg. Derived relative elemental abundances imply an aubrite-like and a eucrite-like composition. The aubrite-like meteoroid exhibits unexpected enhancements in Ca, Mn and Ti in short-lived intensity spikes, which we interpret as rapid release of localized inclusions rather than bulk enrichment. This indicates that transient spectral features can reveal internal heterogeneity in achondritic meteoroids beyond their average composition. Dynamical and physical properties are consistent with these classifications: the eucrite-like meteoroid originated from an inner-main-belt orbit influenced by the $\nu_6$ resonance and shows compact ablation with low erosion and an estimated bulk density of 3.16 $\pm$ 0.10 g cm -3; the aubrite-like meteoroid came from a short-period, low-eccentricity orbit similar to some E-type near-Earth asteroids. Both events show atypical light curves, but our results indicate that robust identification of achondritic meteoroids in surveys generally requires emission spectra. This work presents one of the first detailed studies of achondrites from meteor observations and provides reference properties of atypical meteors for future surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulation-based cosmological inference from optically-selected galaxy clusters with $\texttt{Capish}$</a><span class="id">[2602.01911]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy clusters are powerful probes of the growth of cosmic structure through measurements of their abundance as a function of mass and redshift. Extracting precise cosmological constraints from cluster surveys is challenging, as we must contend the complex relationship between richness and the underlying halo mass, selection function biases, super-sample covariance, and correlated measurement noise between mass proxies. As upcoming photometric surveys are expected to detect tens to hundreds of thousands of galaxy clusters, controlling these systematics becomes essential. In this paper, we present a forward-modelling approach using Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), which provides a natural framework for jointly modelling cluster abundance and lensing mass observables while capturing systematic uncertainties at higher fidelity than analytic likelihood methods - which rely on simplifying assumptions such as fixed covariances and Gaussianity - without requiring an explicit likelihood formulation. We introduce $\texttt{Capish}$, a Python code for generating forward-modelled galaxy cluster catalogues using halo mass functions and incorporating observational effects. We perform SBI using neural density estimation with normalizing flows, trained on abundance and mean lensing mass measurements in observed redshift-richness bins. Our forward model accounts for realistic noise, redshift uncertainties, selection functions, and correlated scatter between lensing mass and observed richness. We find good agreement with likelihood-based analyses, with broader SBI posteriors reflecting the increased realism of the forward model. We also test $\texttt{Capish}$ on cluster catalogues built from a large cosmological simulation, finding a good fit to cosmological parameters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical evolution of the Uranian satellite system III.

Previous studies suggest that, in order to reproduce the current orbital configuration, Ariel must have had an eccentricity of approximately $\sim 0.01$ before the resonance encounter, which would prevent resonant capture. However, the rapid tidal circularization of Ariel's orbit implies that some prior mechanism must have excited its eccentricity before the resonance encounter. In this work, we performed a large number of simulations using an N-body integrator to assess whether the earlier $7/4$ mean-motion resonance between Miranda and Ariel could serve as a mechanism to increase Ariel's eccentricity. Our results show that, due to divergent migration, resonance capture does not occur. As the satellites cross the nominal resonance, Ariel's eccentricity is only excited to $3.4 \times 10^{-4}$, substantially smaller than the required value. Therefore, the $7/4$ mean-motion resonance is not a viable mechanism for increasing Ariel's eccentricity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A model for the emission of SGRBs-GW from binary mergers</a><span class="id">[2602.02225]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This report is divided into three main parts: 1. The first two chapters discuss the emission of Short GRB (SGRB) from binary mergers surrounded by a strong magnetic field. By introducing our model, we investigated the physics of the emission of SGRBs from rotating and charged rotating BHs. A rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized neutron star (millisecond magnetar) is the primary source of strong magnetic fields ranging from $10^{13}~\rm to ~ 10^{16} G$. The decay of the magnetic field could power electromagnetic radiation, especially X-rays and gamma rays from NSs or NS-BH mergers as their primary sources. Considering the merger of compact bodies (NS-NS or NS-BH or BH-BH), we can obtain interesting results. 2. In the next two chapters, we reviewed the BH interiors to understand the nature of black hole interior information and evaporation from its initial to final phases via entropy variation. The evolution relation obtained from two types of entropy gives diverse understandings of the evaporation of BHs under Hawking radiation. 3. The fifth Chapter is related to BH configuration (information) entropy and the thermodynamic phase transition of $f(R)$ BH. Here, we consider a d$-$dimensional black hole (BH) in $f(R)$ gravity and analyze the effect of modified gravity on critical point parameters, the difference in number densities, and configuration entropy during the BH phase transition phenomenon. These results were also compared with charged AdS BH, the holographic dual of van der Waal's fluid, and hence the BH in modified gravity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A whole-planet model of the Earth without life for terrestrial exoplanet studies</a><span class="id">[2602.02267]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As the only known habitable (and inhabited) planet in the universe, Earth informs our search for life elsewhere. Future telescopes like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will soon look for life on rocky worlds around Sun-like stars, so it is critical that we understand how to distinguish habitable planets from inhabited planets. However, it remains unknown if life is necessary to maintain a habitable planet, or how all of the components of an evolving planet impact habitability over time. To address these open questions, we present a coupled interior-atmosphere evolution model of the Earth without life from 50 Myr to 5 Gyr that reproduces 19 key observations of the pre-industrial Earth within measurement uncertainties after 4.5 Gyr. We also produce a reflected light spectrum covering the possible wavelength range of HWO. Our findings support the view that life is not required to maintain habitable surface conditions. The model presented here is apt for predicting the long-term habitability of Earth-like exoplanets via evolving bulk properties. By generating realistic reflected light spectra from evolved atmospheric states, this model represents significant progress towards whole-planet modeling, which may ultimately provide a robust abiotic baseline for interpreting biosignature observations with HWO.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for ultra-high energy neutrons from Galactic sources with the Pierre Auger Observatory</a><span class="id">[2602.02275]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Deflections in the propagation of charged ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) caused by magnetic fields make the identification of their sources challenging. On the other hand, the arrival directions at Earth of neutrons point directly to their origin. The emission of UHECRs from a source is expected to be accompanied by the production of neutrons in its vicinity through interactions with ambient matter and radiation. Since free neutrons travel a mean distance $d/\text{kpc}=9.2(E/\text{EeV})$ before decaying, a neutron flux in the EeV range could be detected on Earth from sources of UHECRs in our Galaxy. Using cosmic-ray data from the Phase I of the Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory, we search for neutron fluxes from Galactic candidate sources. We select more than 1000 objects of astrophysical interest, stacking them into target sets. The targets all have declinations within the exposure of the Observatory, ranging from $-90^\circ$ up to $+45^\circ$ for energies above 1 EeV (and up to $+20^\circ$ for energies down to 0.1 EeV). Given that a neutron air shower is indistinguishable from a proton one, there is a significant background due to cosmic rays. A neutron flux from the direction of a candidate source would be identified by a celestial density of events that significantly exceeds the expected density of cosmic rays for that direction. No significant excess is found at any tested target direction, and an upper limit on the neutron flux is calculated for each candidate source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02289" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helium escape in context: Comparative signatures of four close-in exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2602.02289]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of escaping atmospheres on close-in exoplanets show a wide range in the strength and morphology of He I 10830 A and H I absorption. Scaling relations attempt to link the He I signal to XUV irradiation, mass loss, and bulk planetary parameters. We test these relations with a comparative analysis of HD209458b, HD189733b, HD149026b, and GJ1214b using a 1D hydrodynamic, multi-species, full-atmosphere escape model. For the benchmark HD209458b, our previously validated solution reproduces the observed He I and Ha transit depths without imposing composition constraints. HD189733b exhibits comparable He I depths, but the broadest reported profiles require  12 km/s of additional non-thermal broadening, whereas more recent measurements are narrower, consistent with our predictions. For HD149026b, despite similar system properties, our model shows that higher gravity suppresses escape and enhances diffusive separation, depleting helium at high altitudes and yielding extremely weak He I absorption. For the sub-Neptune GJ1214b, H/He-only models overestimate He I absorption; including H2 and its ions (H2+, H3+, HeH+) lowers the escape rate and modifies the ion/electron balance, reducing the metastable helium densities. Compared against scaling relations, HD189733b observations and our HD149026b prediction fall below the trend, whereas some observations of HD209458b and GJ1214b are consistent; however, the observed transit depths are variable. Across all targets, we find diffusive separation of helium and hydrogen, which may explain why sub-solar He/H ratios are often required in simplified models. We conclude that interpreting He I and Ha absorption requires first-principles models that include self-consistent temperature and velocity profiles, multi-species transport, and molecular chemistry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of Coronal Mass Ejections in Different Data-Driven Solar Wind Conditions</a><span class="id">[2602.02300]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Numerical models of the solar wind and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) utilize photospheric magnetic field observations to prescribe the inner boundary conditions for the plasma solutions. These magnetic field data are available to the community through various observational instruments, prepared via different methodologies and/or flux-transport models. The solar wind solution driven by these maps provides the ambient plasma environment into which CMEs travel, coupling, and interacting with the surrounding plasma and governing the CME evolution and propagation in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. In this work, we use different input magnetic field maps for the same time period to drive the global Alfven Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM). We obtain the ambient solar wind conditions and compare the plasma properties and magnetic morphology in the coronal domain to study the influence of the input maps. To understand how the resulting coronal solutions impact CMEs, we launch eruptions described by analytical flux ropes into these data-driven solutions and compare their evolution in the coronal domain (up to 24 solar radii radially). The CMEs achieve varying speeds, deceleration rates, propagation directions, mass and energies while coupling with the background solar wind. We quantify these differences to show that the different input driving maps can significantly impact the simulated CME propagation in the solar wind plasma. This also highlights the importance of understanding the uncertainties associated with data-driven modeling that become increasingly important in operational models and space weather prediction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Negentropy as Diagnostic of Cosmic Density Fields and Dynamical Dark Energy Models</a><span class="id">[2602.02339]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We employ negentropy ($J$), defined as the difference between the information content of a non-Gaussian probability distribution and a Gaussian with identical variance, as an information-theoretic probe of non-Gaussianity in the cosmic density field. We quantify its sensitivity to dynamical dark energy by studying the evolution of $J(a)$ and its derivatives $\Gamma_1(a)$ and $\Gamma_2(a)$ across three parameterisation schemes: CPL, JBP, and BA. We determine the characteristic redshift $z_{NG}$, marking the epoch of maximal non-Gaussian structure formation, and the turnaround redshift $z_{TA}$, when information production transitions due to dark-energy domination, finding $z_{NG}\sim0.81$ and $z_{TA}\sim0.18$ for $\Lambda$CDM. Our diagnostics clearly discriminate between thawing and freezing quintessence models and phantom dark energy at low redshifts. Thawing models show small departures from $\Lambda$CDM, freezing models display higher $z_{TA}$, while phantom models exhibit lower $z_{TA}$, reflecting late-time evolution. We provide a practical prescription for measuring negentropy from discrete galaxy distributions, establishing a framework that can be applied to simulations and observations.

We employ a physics-based forward model of large-scale structure using Lagrangian perturbation theory, incorporating light-cone effects, redshift-space distortions, quasar bias, and survey selection effects. This approach enables a detailed and physically motivated inference of the three-dimensional density field and initial conditions over the entire cosmic volume considered. We analyse both the G &lt; 20.0 (Quaia Clean) and G &lt; 20.5 (Quaia Deep) samples, where G denotes the Gaia broad optical-band magnitude, imposing conservative sky cuts to ensure robustness against foreground contamination. The resulting reconstructions span a comoving volume of (10h^{-1} Gpc)^3 with a maximum spatial resolution of 39.1 h^{-1}Mpc, making this the largest field-level reconstruction of the observable Universe in terms of comoving volume to date. We validate our reconstructions through a range of internal and external consistency checks, including the cross-correlation of the inferred density fields with Planck CMB lensing, where we detect a signal at  4\sigma significance.

Successive shock regimes in shock-breakout candidates, most notably low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LL GRBs), naturally introduce distinct physical environments producing a multi-component neutrino flux extending from 10 TeV to the UHE regime. Integrating prompt and afterglow phases within a unified dynamical framework yields a self-consistent explanation for this broadband emission. In this work, we discuss this framework, building on MWL observations. We show that the prompt emission from GRB 060218-like events accounts for $\gtrsim 10\%$ of the diffuse flux at 100 TeV, while GRB 100316D-like configurations predict a distinct flux peak near $10^{-9}\rm~GeV~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~sr^{-1}$ at 100 PeV, providing a physical interpretation for the 220 PeV KM3-230213A event. This decoupling explains the lack of low-energy counterparts for individual UHE detections while maintaining consistency with the total diffuse neutrino flux. Ultimately, this framework identifies SBO-like LL GRBs as a unifying origin for these phenomena, providing a physical link across a wide band from 10 TeV to EeV energies testable by next-generation observatories, including GRAND, IceCube-Gen2, and RNO-G.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What to make of the Earth's curiously intermediate land fraction?</a><span class="id">[2602.02392]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Approximately two-thirds of the Earth, the only known inhabited planet, is covered in ocean.

It has been previously suggested that this may represent a certain degree of fine-tuning, and thus perhaps observers are a-priori more likely to develop on those rare worlds with nearly equal land-ocean ratios, such as our own. In this work, we take the single datum of the Earth and then use Bayesian inference to compare four models for the probability distribution of a planet becoming inhabited by observers as a function of land-fraction, $f$, which we classify as i) land-centric ii) ocean-centric iii) equi-centric and iv) indifference. We find that no model is strongly favoured over the others, but that 1) the land-centric model is disfavoured over all others, and, 2) the equi-centric model is favoured over all competitors. Further, we show that more extreme models with heavy tail-weighting are strongly disfavoured even when conditioned upon the Earth alone. For example, a land-centric model where the median planet has $f=0.82$ (or greater) is in strong tension with our existence. Finally, we consider the potential addition of more data via Mars or exoplanets. Should paleo-Mars have once harboured life and had $f&lt;0.20$, then this would strongly favour the ocean-centric model for life, over a land-centric hypothesis. We show that strong evidence for/against the equi-centric model versus its competitors would likely require at least a dozen inhabited exoplanets, offering a well-motivated sample size for future experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonlinear interaction between dynamo-generated magnetic fields, mean flows and internal gravity waves in stellar stably-stratified layers: From 3D to 1D</a><span class="id">[2602.02421]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic fields have been constrained at the surface of several massive and intermediate-mass stars, but their origin and properties in deep stellar radiative interiors are still debated, despite recent detections in the core of some red giant stars. Therefore, the modelling of AM transport in stellar radiative layers only relies on theoretical and numerical estimates of magnetic fields. Recent 3D numerical simulations show that a dynamo could occur in deep radiative regions. A realistic setup for understanding AM transport in such layers thus requires to take into account the mutual interactions of IGW and dynamo-generated magnetic field. We model the dynamics induced by IGW and dynamo in rotating radiative stellar layers using a simple description applicable to various evolutionary stages. As dynamo action and the propagation of IGW are 3D processes that have characteristic timescales short compared to periods associated with structural evolution of stars, we propose a mean-field 1D model by taking advantage of the dynamo coefficients computed from 3D spherical simulations. In this model, the necessary mean shear flow to trigger the dynamo results from the dissipation of monochromatic IGW generated in existing adjacent convective layers, which are expected to drive the formation of an oscillating rotational shear layer, the so-called Shear Layer Oscillation (SLO). In turn, magnetic effects can act on the mean flow through the Lorentz force. We show that the inclusion of magnetic fields adds up to the already very complex nonlinear problem and gives rise to the emergence of new dynamical regimes. Particularly, the fast SLO generated very close to the place where IGW are generated is perturbed by magnetic fields. This dynamical change can filter the wave energy spectrum transmitted towards further layers, with potential influence on the long-term evolution of the inner rotation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The FLAMINGO Project: Exploring the X-ray–cosmic-shear cross-correlation as a probe of large-scale structure</a><span class="id">[2602.02484]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Baryonic feedback processes associated with galaxy formation directly influence the large-scale structure by redistributing gas. Recent measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and stacks of X-ray emission from optically selected galaxy clusters suggest that feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is more efficient at expelling gas from low-mass clusters than previously thought. The measurement of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and diffuse X-ray emission provides a new probe of the distribution of gas in groups and clusters. We use the FLAMINGO cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to examine the X-ray–cosmic-shear cross-correlation. The cross-correlation is most sensitive to the distribution of gas in haloes with masses $10^{14}\leq M_{200\mathrm{c}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\leq10^{15}$. It is sensitive to the strength of feedback, but the effects of variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. We compare the FLAMINGO predictions with the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps. We find that, if we neglect the X-ray emission from AGN that would remain unresolved by ROSAT, then the fiducial FLAMINGO model is in excellent agreement with the data, while models with stronger or weaker feedback are ruled out. However, if we account for unresolved AGN, either using the direct FLAMINGO predictions or by abundance matching to the observed (extrapolated) AGN luminosity function, then models with stronger feedback are preferred. We conclude that to exploit the potential of the X-ray–lensing cross-correlation, it will be necessary to resolve fainter AGN, and to use external constraints to break the degeneracy between baryonic feedback and cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reheating in geometric Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity</a><span class="id">[2602.00317]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study Weyl-invariant purely gravitational theories formulated within the Einstein-Cartan framework.

We find that, although quantum corrections break electromagnetic duality, the Love matrices in electric and magnetic backgrounds are related by a $Z_2$ symmetry under electric-magnetic exchange. Going beyond EFT, we compute the Love matrices of small magnetic black holes. We show that the running of the Love matrices is governed by the running of the $U(1)$ gauge coupling, and we derive the correspondence between Love and $U(1)$ beta functions for arbitrary harmonics. The overall picture that emerges is that the QFT-induced tidal response of magnetic black holes saturates in the strong-field regime. These results imply that nearly-extremal magnetic black holes charged under an Abelian dark sector could be probed by gravitational-wave observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Realization of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2 in Nieh-Yan modified teleparallel gravity</a><span class="id">[2602.00506]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations from the DESI Collaboration indicate a preference for quintom dark energy, i.e., its equation of state evolves across the cosmological constant boundary $w=-1$. It is well known that models with single perfect fluid or single scalar field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity develop perturbative instabilities around the crossing, thereby cannot realize the quintom scenario. In this paper, we provide a method to circumvent the instability problem of these models by introducing the coupling of dark energy to the Nieh-Yan density in teleparallel gravity. We show that with this coupling the background evolution is not affected, but the dark energy perturbation is removed from the menu of dynamical degrees of freedom, thus avoiding the intrinsic difficulties in the old models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Irreversibility and Entropy Exclusion in Collisionless Plasmas</a><span class="id">[2602.01314]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine entropy production in reduced descriptions of collisionless plasmas. Introducing a closure dependent entropy hierarchy, we show that non-conservative moment closures generate a residual entropy associated with irreversible information loss, whereas invariant closures remain reversible. The monotonic growth of this residual entropy imposes a statistical realizability constraint on macroscopic plasma states, excluding regions of phase space independent of dynamical stability. For anisotropic plasmas, we evaluate entropy production within a second-order moment closure, identifying contributions from transport and magnetic field inhomogeneity. The resulting entropy exclusion boundary is broadly consistent with observed anisotropy distributions in space plasmas. Statistical realizability thus emerges as an organizing principle for reduced collisionless plasma descriptions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the wormhole echo hypothesis for GW231123</a><span class="id">[2602.01615]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The short-duration gravitational-wave (GW) event GW231123 has inferred component masses in the pair-instability mass gap and exhibits a burst-like morphology with no clearly inspiral, making it an interesting target for tests beyond the standard binary black hole (BBH) interpretation. In this work, motivated by its phenomenological similarity to GW190521, we test whether GW231123 is compatible with a wormhole-echo scenario by modeling a leading echo pulse with a well-motivated phenomenological sine-Gaussian wavepacket. We perform Bayesian model comparison against a BBH baseline described by the IMRPhenomXPHM-SpinTaylor waveform, and obtain the Bayes factor ratio $\ln B^{\rm Echo}_{\rm BBH} = 1.87$, corresponding to weak-to-moderate support for the echo hypothesis. In our previous analysis for GW190521 within the same overall framework, we found $\ln B^{\rm Echo}_{\rm BBH} \approx -2.9$, implying a shift of $\Delta \ln B \approx 4.8$ between the two events. This sign change indicates that GW231123 is more compatible with a single-pulse echo description than GW190521.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Theoretical investigation of transition data of astrophysical importance in neutral sulphur</a><span class="id">[2602.02122]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurate and comprehensive atomic data are essential for the modelling of stellar spectra. Uncertainties in the oscillator strengths of specific lines used for abundance analyses directly translate into uncertainties in the derived elemental abundances; incomplete or biased atomic data sets can impart significant errors in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) modelling. Theoretical calculations of atomic data are therefore crucial to supplement the limited experimental results. In this work, we present extensive atomic data, including oscillator strengths, transition rates, and lifetimes for 1730 electric-dipole (E1) transitions among 107 levels in neutral sulphur (S I) using the multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and relativistic-configuration-interaction (RCI) methods. These levels belong to the configurations $\mathrm{3p^3np (n=3-7)}$, $\mathrm{3p^3nf (n=4,5)}$, $\mathrm{3s3p^5}$, $\mathrm{3p^3ns (n=4-7)}$, and $\mathrm{3p^3nd (n=3-6)}$. The accuracy of the computed transition rates is assessed by combining the comparison of the differences in transition rates between the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges with a cancellation-factor (CF) analysis. Approximately 16% of the ab initio results achieved an accuracy classification of A-B, corresponding to uncertainties within 10%, as defined by the Atomic Spectra Database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST ASD). Applying a fine-tuning technique was found to significantly improve the accuracy of the results in the Coulomb gauge, thereby improving the consistency between the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges; about 24% of the fine-tuned transition data are assigned to the accuracy classes A-B.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Constraints on $Λ$(t)CDM Models</a><span class="id">[2305.18591]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Problems with the concordance cosmology $\Lambda$CDM as the cosmological constant problem, coincidence problems and Hubble tension has led to many proposed alternatives, as the $\Lambda(t)$CDM, where the now called $\Lambda$ cosmological term is allowed to vary due to an interaction with pressureless matter.

Using SNe Ia, cosmic chronometers data plus constraints on $H_0$ from SH0ES and Planck satellite, we constrain the free parameters of this class of models. By using the Planck prior over $H_0$, we conclude that the $\lambda_*$ term can not be discarded by this analysis, thereby disfavouring models only with the time-variable terms. The SH0ES prior over $H_0$ has an weak evidence in this direction. The subclasses of models with $\alpha'=0$ and with $\beta=0$ can not be discarded by this analysis. Finally, by using distance priors from CMB, the $\Lambda$ time-dependence was quite restricted.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirage Sources and Large TeV Halo-Pulsar Offsets: Exploring the Parameter Space</a><span class="id">[2407.02829]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the asymmetric propagation of 100 TeV electrons (whose radiation mainly concentrates on 20–30 TeV) in turbulent magnetic fields around pulsars, using GPU-accelerated simulations to explore their trajectories and interactions within pulsar wind nebulae and the interstellar medium.

We describe the background's cosmological dependence and show how it can be used as a “stochastic siren” to measure $H_0$. By analyzing existing resolved binary black hole mergers and the current non-detection of the background, we find that $H_0$ can be measured more accurately relative to using resolved mergers alone.

We also propose a growth parametrization that turns to be a good approximation for the HS and Symmetron models, with a deviation less than $0.6 \%$. To compute the RSD multipoles we employ an expansion of the velocity moments generating function that is suitable for general modified gravity models. Later, we apply the fk-Perturbation Theory (fkPT) approximation to reduce the computation time of nonlinear kernels, to find the fullshape galaxy power spectrum for the Symmetron, and study the differences with HS model. The RSD multipoles of the Symmetron result similar to those of the HS F6 model.

In this framework, DE arises from the difference between the vacuum energy of an expanding FRW universe and Minkowski spacetime, induced by QCD topological sectors. The resulting DE term in the Friedmann equation scales with the Hubble rate, $\rho_{\rm DE}(t)\propto H(t)$, once DE dominates cosmic expansion, i.e. when the Universe is close to the de Sitter regime with $H\approx$ constant. The QCD scale, $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}\sim100~{\rm MeV}$, naturally fixes the DE density and explains why its influence becomes significant only recently. The construction relies solely on the Standard Model of particle physics, introducing no new fields or couplings. The most fundamental change is the possibility of modifying the evolution of the background cosmology in the Friedmann equation. Key predictions include: (a) A present-day equation of state parameter $w_{\rm DE,0}&gt;-1$ that asymptotically approaches the de Sitter limit $w_{\rm DE}=-1$ in the future. (b) A present-day Hubble constant $H_0$ that asymptotically approaches a constant $\overline{H}$ set by $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$.

A joint interpretation of the optical, infrared, and X-ray light curves suggests that MRC 0614-083 has undergone a super-Eddington accretion flare accompanied by efficient proton acceleration. That flare has initiated a delayed infrared echo within the surrounding dust torus, which serves as a target for photomeson ($p\gamma$) interactions such that a self-consistent picture emerges that complements the blazar jet scenario: the predicted UHE neutrino flux is at the level expected from joint $E^{-2}$ fit with the IceCube measurements at lower energies, the variable nature of the event alleviates the tension with IceCube limits, and the accompanying electromagnetic cascade describes the X-ray flare around the neutrino detection time.

These cycles consist of active and inactive windows, with the peak activity centred within the active phase. For FRB 20180916B, studies reported a frequency-dependent or chromatic behaviour, for which the activity window starts earlier and becomes narrower at higher frequencies. The activity across frequencies is typically modelled with a power law. We developed a simple model that combines the phase and frequency dependence of the activity windows of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B. Our goal was to perform a chromaticity study for FRB 20121102A that incorporates model improvements to account for the cyclic nature of its activity window and to compare the chromatic behaviour of the two periodic FRBs. We standardised the detections from the 425 observing epochs for FRB 20121102A and the 214 epochs for FRB20180916B to account for differences in the radio telescope sensitivity. To the normalised detection-rate phase distribution, we fitted a von Mises distribution and extracted the peak activity phase and activity width. These quantities as a function of frequency were then modelled as power laws to construct the chromatic model. The activity window starts earlier at higher frequencies for the two sources. The activity window of FRB 20121102A broadens at higher frequencies, however, and that of FRB 20180916B broadens at lower frequencies. Interestingly, it appears to remain active during at least 80% of the cycle at C band. The observed chromatic behaviour of FRB 20180916B is consistent with previous findings. For FRB 20121102A, a chromaticity in its activity window is also seen, but the source appears to be active for longer at higher frequencies, which is different from the behaviour of FRB 20180916B.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stochastic-tail of the curvature perturbation in hybrid inflation</a><span class="id">[2507.22439]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The exponential-tail behaviours of the probability density function (PDF) of the primordial curvature perturbation are confirmed in the mild-waterfall variants of hybrid inflation with the use of the stochastic formalism of inflation.

In addition to the well-known friction effects, we identify a novel effect that significantly enhances the strength of first-order phase transitions.

The mid-infrared JWST spectrum of T Cha shows multiple prominent aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) around 6.2, 8.1, and 11.3 $\mu$m. AIBs are commonly accepted as the emission stemming from PAH molecules. We aim to characterize the PAHs giving rise to the AIBs observed in the JWST spectrum of T Cha. Our objective is to estimate the PAH abundances, in terms of their sizes, ionization fraction, and mass, in the disk of T Cha. We perform spectral fitting of the observed AIBs to identify the possible underlying PAH emission components. We transfer the stellar radiation through a parametric disk model in order to reproduce the mid-IR spectrum, optical photometric fluxes, and mm continuum band fluxes of T Cha. We include PAH dust grains, which are stochastically heated, in our model calculations to simulate the AIBs. Thus, we estimate the PAH abundances from our modelling. We use the results from previous observations and modelling efforts to reduce our model degeneracies. The overall disk morphology - an inner and an outer disk separated by a dust gap - derived in this work is consistent with the previous results from Spitzer, VLT, and ALMA observations. PAHs are located within the outer disk in our model. Given our best fiducial model, we estimate a population of small PAHs of &lt;26 C atoms, with an ionized PAH fraction of $\sim0.15$. We also obtain a PAH-to-dust mass ratio of  7$\times$10$^{-3}$, which amounts to  17% of the PAH-to-dust mass ratio observed in the ISM. We predict the outer disk to have a frontal wall with smaller dust grains, sizes limited up to $\mu$m-order, in order to properly fit the continuum slope within 14-25 $\mu$m.

We find that third-generation networks reach sub-percent precision on the Hubble constant within a few years, achieving 0.2% after a decade with CE+ET+LVK, while LVK remains limited to the 6% level. The LVK fifth observing run may shed light on the H_0 tension only if the inferred value falls outside the range spanned by the Planck and SH0ES determinations, which currently achieve far higher precisions. Supernovae do not directly tighten H_0 but stabilize its inference through parameter correlations and enable an absolute calibration of the supernova magnitude M_B. In dynamical dark-energy models, the joint analysis of Roman supernovae and bright sirens yields a Figure of Merit of 25 for ET+LVK and 76 for CE+ET+LVK, to be compared with the state-of-the-art DESI DR2 BAO plus DESY5 supernovae value of 56.

We compute the time-dependent GR MHD evolution of a GRB central engine where the newly formed black hole is accreting the mass from post-merger remnant. We explore the wind properties, for a range of the initial parameters of the system, and study representative cases for compact binary merger progenitors. We compute a suite of 2D and 3D time-dependent General Relativistic numerical simulations with a tabulated 3-parameter equation of state that allows for evolution of chemical composition evolution of the accretion flow. The neutrino emission is accounted for by incorporating the leakage scheme, where neutrino optical depth is calculated along the radial rays. We parameterize the optically thick and thin tori with different values of the pressure maximum and entropy in the disk, while the strength of large-scale poloidal magnetic fields is parameterized according to the chosen gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio. To probe the winds, we follow the particle trajectories. Upon this, we derive the nucleosynthetic yields of heavy elements in the outflows, and we map the regions of Lanthanide rich and poor ejecta. We find that the outflow carries high mass of neutron rich material expanding with mildly relativistic velocities. Our accretion disks operating under the SANE mode can power the GRB jets via neutrino annihilation, if the disk to BH mass ratio is larger than about 0.01 and the black hole is spinning.

The mechanism behind these outflows remains uncertain, but may relate to instabilities or state transitions in the accretion disk formed from the TDE. We model the radio emission powered by the collision of mass outflows (&quot;flares&quot;) from TDE accretion disks, considering scenarios in which two successive disk flares collide with each other, as well as collisions between the outflow and the circumnuclear medium (CNM). For flare masses of $\sim 0.01$-$0.1 M_{\odot}$, varied CNM densities, and different time intervals between ejected flares, we demonstrate that the shocks formed by the collisions have velocities $0.05c$-$0.3c$ at $\sim 10^{17}$ cm and power bright radio emission of $L_{\nu} \sim 10^{27}$-$10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, consistent with the properties inferred for observed events. We quantify how the typical peak timescale and flux varies for different properties of our models, and compare our model predictions to a selection of TDEs with delayed radio emission. Our models successfully reproduce the light curves and SEDs for several events, supporting the idea that delayed outflows from disk instabilities and state transitions can power late-time radio emission in TDEs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence of 1:1 slope between rocky Super-Earths and their host stars</a><span class="id">[2511.17717]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The relationship between the composition of rocky exoplanets and their host stars is fundamental to understanding planetary formation and evolution. However, previous studies have been limited by inconsistent datasets, observational biases and methodological differences. This study investigates the compositional relationship between rocky exoplanets and their host stars, utilizing a self-consistent and homogeneous dataset of 21 exoplanets and their 20 host stars. By applying sophisticated interior structure modeling and comprehensive chemical analysis, we identify a potential 1:1 best-fit line between the iron-mass fraction of planets and their host stars equivalent with a slope of $m = 0.94^{+1.02}_{-1.07}$ and intercept of $c = -0.02^{+0.31}_{-0.29}$. This results are consistent at the 1$\sigma$ level with other homogeneous studies, but not with heterogeneous samples that suggest much steeper best-fit lines. Although, our results remain tentative due to sample size and data uncertainties, the updated dataset significantly reduces the number of super-Mercuries from four to one, but it remains that several high-density planets are beyond what a primordial origin would suggest. The planets in our sample have a wider range of compositions compared to stellar equivalent values, that could indicate formation pathways away from primordial or be the result of random scattering owing to current mass-radius uncertainties as we recover the observed outliers in mock population analysis $\sim15\%$ of the time. To truly determine whether the origin is primordial with a 1:1 true relation, we find that sample of at least 150 planets is needed and that stars that are iron enrich or depleted are high value targets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planet Migration in Protoplanetary Disks with Rims</a><span class="id">[2511.21328]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Complex structures, including sharp edges, rings and gaps, have been commonly observed in protoplanetary disks with or without planetary candidates. Here we consider the possibility that they are the intrinsic consequences of angular momentum transfer mechanisms, and investigate how they may influence the dynamical evolution of embedded planets. With the aid of numerical hydrodynamic simulations, we show that gas giants have a tendency to migrate away from sharp edges, whereas super-Earths embedded in the annuli tend to be retained. This implies that, observationally, Jupiters are preferentially detected in dark rings (gaps), whereas super-Earths tend to be found in bright rings (density bumps). Moreover, planets' tidal torque provide, not necessarily predominant, feedback on the surface density profile. This tendency implies that Jupiter's gap-opening process deepens and widens the density gap associated with the dark ring, while super-Earths can be halted by steep surface density gradient near the disk or ring boundaries. 13Hence, we expect there would be a desert for super-Earths in the surface density gap.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blazar classification from multi-wavelength data using Deep Learning</a><span class="id">[2511.23134]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) has detected more than 7,000 gamma-ray sources, a significant fraction of which are identified as blazars, while a comparable number remain classified as blazars of uncertain type (BCUs) or are unassociated with counterparts at other wavelengths. The absence of complete multi-wavelength spectral information presents a major obstacle to robust source classification, despite such data providing the most reliable means of understanding blazar properties. In this work, we focus on classifying BCUs into the two primary blazar subclasses, flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), using a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) trained on multi-wavelength observational parameters. We first identify the most informative features by quantifying their information content and then use these features to train the ANN, whose performance is evaluated using a k-fold cross-validation strategy to ensure robust generalization. The trained model is subsequently applied to classify BCUs into BL Lacs and FSRQs. Our results demonstrate that machine learning-based classification using a carefully selected set of multi-wavelength parameters offers an efficient and reliable approach for resolving the nature of BCUs and improving the completeness of the gamma-ray blazar population in Fermi-LAT catalogs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vetting and False Positive Analysis of TOI 864.01: Evidence for a Likely Hierarchical Eclipsing Binary Masked by Dilution</a><span class="id">[2601.02171]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed vetting analysis of the TESS candidate TOI 864.01, initially identified as a potential ultra-short-period (P   0.52 d) Earth-sized planet orbiting an M-dwarf. Using 12 sectors of TESS photometry spanning a multi-year baseline, we recover a robust periodic transit-like signal. While the recovered transit depth is attenuated by detrending (  158 ppm), the SPOC pipeline reports an undiluted depth of   640 ppm. Stellar characterization based on Gaia DR3 astrometry yields a nominally single-star solution (RUWE = 1.18), highlighting the limitations of astrometric vetting for tight companions. We performed a statistical validation analysis using TRICERATOPS, aggregating data from all 12 available sectors. The analysis yields a False Positive Probability (FPP) of 0.25 and a Nearby False Positive Probability (NFPP) of &lt; 10^-4. While these metrics ostensibly classify the target as a viable planetary candidate based on Gaia-resolved sources, they fail to account for sub-pixel companions. Crucially, archival high-resolution imaging from the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP SG1) reveals a stellar companion at a separation of 0.04&quot;, unresolved by both Gaia and TESS. When this companion is considered, the signal is best interpreted as a Hierarchical Eclipsing Binary (HEB) on the companion. Bayesian model comparison yields an inconclusive result (Delta ln Z   0.25), consistent with the degeneracy introduced by unresolved blending. Ground-based follow-up photometry further supports significant dilution, with a measured transit depth (  0.37 ppt) shallower than predicted (  0.64 ppt) and a timing offset of 6.3 minutes. Taken together, we classify TOI 864.01 as a probable False Positive and recommend its retirement from planetary candidate lists.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identification of three new ultraluminous X-ray sources in NGC 4631 and NGC 1097: Evidence for stellar-mass black holes</a><span class="id">[2601.08047]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations of galaxies continue to reveal new ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), increasing their known population and improving the statistics needed to understand their nature. We study the ULX populations of NGC 4631 and NGC 1097 using archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift/XRT observations to identify new ULXs and investigate their X-ray and optical properties. We analyzed X-ray data spanning 2000-2025. Spectral fitting was performed for sources with sufficient counts using absorbed power-law and diskbb models. Variability analyses, including hardness-intensity diagrams and light curves, were used to assess short- and long-term variability. Optical color-magnitude diagrams and near-infrared (NIR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were employed to identify possible donor stars. In NGC 4631, we identified two new transient ULXs, X-6 and X-7, with X-ray count rates varying by more than an order of magnitude. The LX-T^4 relation from diskbb fits provides strong evidence that NGC 4631 X-6 is powered by a stellar-mass black hole accreting via a standard disk. The optical sources within the X-ray error circles of X-6 and X-7 are candidate counterparts, suggesting these systems are candidate HMXBs. In NGC 1097, we discovered a new transient ULX, ULX-3, showing X-ray luminosity variations by a factor of about 30 and evidence for spectral state transitions, consistent with either a stellar-mass black hole or a neutron star. We identified a unique optical and NIR counterpart. While the optical emission is variable, the NIR emission is stable. The NIR SED is consistent with a blackbody temperature of about 3300 K, compatible with a red supergiant donor with a radius of about 200 solar radii.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational and theoretical aspects of Superspinars</a><span class="id">[2407.14851]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This article delves into the observational signatures and theoretical underpinnings of rotating astrophysical objects, with a particular focus on superspinars -exotic objects characterized by the absence of event horizons due to their high angular momentum. While solutions within General Relativity (Kerr superspinars) predict such objects, their classical forms harbor naked singularities, violate causality, and exhibit problematic repulsive gravitational effects. These characteristics render classical superspinars theoretically objectionable, leading to the consideration of them as physically implausible. On the other hand, the incompatibility between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics suggests the exploration of alternative models, particularly those in which Quantum Gravity dominates the core and prevents the formation of scalar curvature singularities. This work demonstrates that superspinars without scalar curvature singularities can avoid all the complications associated with Kerr superspinars. Moreover, from a phenomenological standpoint, it is shown that the silhouettes of these superspinars could be markedly distinct from those of black holes and classical Kerr superspinars. To substantiate these differences, we perform a comprehensive analysis of inner null geodesics and investigate the structure of the Planckian region within superspinars without scalar curvature singularities. Our study reveals that only these superspinars provide the potential for distant observers to directly observe the extremely high curvature regions within their interiors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Krylov Complexity in early universe</a><span class="id">[2411.18405]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Lanczos algorithm offers a framework for constructing wave functions in closed and open quantum systems from their Hamiltonians. Since the early universe is inherently an open system, we employ this algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across various cosmological phases: inflation, radiation domination (RD), and matter domination (MD). Our results highlight a clear distinction in Krylov complexity between the closed- and open-system methodologies. To accurately capture the influence of potentials during RD and MD, we examine a set of inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, $R^2$ inflation, and chaotic inflation, while incorporating violations of slow-roll conditions. This study is conducted in conformal time through the preheating stage. Numerically, we find that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy shows remarkable similarity across different potentials during RD and MD. Furthermore, we rigorously construct an open two-mode squeezed state using the second kind of Meixner polynomial. Based on this construction, we derive for the first time the evolution equations for the squeezing parameter $r_k$ and phase $\phi_k$ in terms of the scale factor. Our analysis indicates that dissipative effects lead to rapid decoherence-like behavior. In addition, we observe that the inflationary universe behaves as a strongly dissipative system, whereas during the RD and MD epochs the universe exhibits weak dissipative characteristics. This work opens new perspectives for studying the universe from a quantum-informational viewpoint.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</a><span class="id">[2503.17840]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields – “unparticles&quot; – during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dispersion relation of the neutrino plasma: Unifying fast, slow, and collisional instabilities</a><span class="id">[2505.20389]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In neutrino-dense astrophysical environments, these particles exchange flavor through a coherent weak field, forming a collisionless neutrino plasma with collective flavor dynamics. Instabilities, which grow and affect the environment, may arise from neutrino-neutrino refraction alone (fast limit), vacuum energy splittings caused by masses (slow limit), or neutrino-matter scattering (collisional limit). We present a comprehensive analytical description of the dispersion relation governing these unstable modes. Treating vacuum energy splittings and collision rates as small perturbations, we construct a unified framework for fast, slow, and collisional instabilities. We classify modes into gapped, where collective excitations are already present in the fast limit but rendered unstable by slow or collisional effects, and gapless, which are purely generated by these effects. For each class, we derive approximate dispersion relations for generic energy and angle distributions, which reveal the order of magnitude of the growth rates and the nature of the instabilities without solving directly the dispersion relation. This approach confirms that slow and collisionally unstable waves generally grow much more slowly than they oscillate. Consequently, the common fast-mode approximation of local evolution within small boxes is unjustified. Even for fast modes, neglecting large-distance propagation of growing waves, as usually done, may be a poor approximation. Our unified framework provides an intuitive understanding of the linear phase of flavor evolution across all regimes and paves the way for a quasi-linear treatment of the instability's nonlinear development.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four-point correlation functions in axion inflation</a><span class="id">[2506.02331]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model.

In this work, we hypothesize that GW190521 might represent a single, isolated gravitational wave (GW) echo pulse from the wormhole, which is the postmerger remnant of BBHs in another universe and connected to our universe through a throat. The ringdown signal after BBHs merged in another universe can pass through the throat of wormhole and be detected in our universe as a short-duration echo pulse. Our analysis results indicate that our model yields a network signal-to-noise ratio comparable to that of the standard BBHs merger model reported by the LVK collaboration.

We demonstrate a Sweet–Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \sim 10^4$. For larger values of Lundquist number, between $2\times 10^4\le S \le 2 \times 10^5$, plasmoid formation sets in, leading to a slight enhancement of the reconnection rate, $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/3}$, consistent with the prediction from linear tearing mode induced reconnection, indicating that reconnection remains resistivity-dependent and therefore slow. In this range of $S$-values, the plasmoids do not undergo a merger cascade, as they are rapidly advected out of the reconnection layer. Only for $S &gt; 2 \times 10^5$, we observe the nonlinear development of the tearing-mode instability, with plasmoid coalescence and a saturation of the reconnection rate at $V_\text{rec} / V_A \sim 0.01$. At such high $S$, however, the corresponding Reynolds number is large, reaching $\text{Re} &gt; 2000$ even on scales comparable to the current-sheet thickness.

However, this pushes the GW energy density high enough to destabilise the process of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). This problem can be overcome by &quot;softening&quot; the stiff period, so that the field is gradually tending towards freefall from a frozen start.

However, the uncertainties in s-process nucleosynthesis – particularly those arising from Maxwellian Averaged Cross Sections (MACS) – propagate directly into the r-process residuals, affecting their reliability. Building upon the seminal work of Goriely (1999), who introduced a multi-event s-process model to quantify these uncertainties, we revisit the problem using a simplified yet effective approach. By assuming that the relative uncertainty in s-process isotopic abundances scales linearly with the MACS uncertainties from data libraries (KADoNiS), we identify a subset of isotopes for which the r-process residuals remain significantly uncertain. Using updated solar abundances (Lodders 2025) and s-process contributions from Bisterzo et al.

Our analysis provides a practical framework for prioritizing future experimental efforts that will profit from upgrades and enhancements of the n_TOF facility.

This thesis presents phenomenological investigations organized around three pillars: consolidation of the three-flavor oscillation paradigm, exploration of new physics viability, and precise determination of solar neutrino fluxes. The theoretical framework introduces massive neutrinos, leptonic mixing, and flavor transitions, followed by experimental results emphasizing Borexino and NOvA data analyses. The first pillar establishes the three-flavor framework through global analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator data, providing updated determinations of mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$) and mass-squared differences ($\Delta m^2_{21}$, $\Delta m^2_{31}$), while quantifying ambiguities in mass ordering and $\theta_{23}$ octant. The second pillar investigates Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) with electrons and quarks, combining Borexino data with COHERENT's CE$\nu$NS measurements to establish bounds on propagation and detection couplings, excluding viable NSI parameter regions including potential LMA-D solutions. The third pillar advances solar neutrino physics through precision flux determinations, integrating pp-chain and CNO-cycle measurements. Results show preference for high-metallicity Standard Solar Models and incompatibility between $3+1$ mixing parameters favored by Gallium experiments and solar observations.

As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect.</p></div></details></article></body>
