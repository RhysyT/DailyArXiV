<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10549" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We Have Never Been Sophisticated</a><span class="id">[2511.10549]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many philosophers of physics maintain that a physical theory that exhibits (certain kinds of) symmetries is flawed, on the grounds that such theories posit &quot;excess structure&quot;. In an influential paper, Dewar [2019, &quot;Sophistication about Symmetries&quot;, \emph{Brit. J. Phil. Sci.} \textbf{70}: 485-521] introduces a distinction between &quot;reduction&quot; and &quot;sophistication&quot; as alternative ways of removing excess structure. In this paper we re-examine the distinction as Dewar draws it, and we argue that there is no physically or philosophically important distinction between what Dewar calls &quot;reduction&quot; and what he calls &quot;internal sophistication&quot;. We then argue that there are multiple notions of &quot;reduction&quot; in the literature that ought to be distinguished, both in motivation and in outcome.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zeno's paradox and black hole information loss problem</a><span class="id">[2511.10106]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a conceptual parallel between the black hole information problem and Zeno's paradox, highlighting the role of limiting procedures that turn formally infinite constructions into finite physical observables. Building on the replica–wormhole paradigm, we move beyond unitarity restoration to formulate a quantitative notion of irreversibility in Hawking radiation. Our main result is a modular thermodynamic framework for black-hole evaporation, in which modular entropy, entanglement capacity, and relative entropy assume thermodynamic roles. The monotonicity of relative entropy furnishes a generalized second law that determines the arrow of evolution in replica space. We further resolve the apparent tension between the replica method and the quantum no-cloning theorem by interpreting replicas as ensemble representations rather than physical copies of an unknown state, thereby clarifying the operational meaning of gravitational path integrals. A key message of this work is that non-additivity in Tsallis statistics provides an information-theoretic analogue of the correlations induced by replica wormholes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07502" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Heisenberg and Schrödinger to the P vs. NP Problem</a><span class="id">[2511.07502]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This essay offers an epistemological reinterpretation of the foundational divide between matrix mechanics and wave mechanics. Though formally equivalent, the two theories embody distinct modes of knowing: procedural construction and recognitional verification. These epistemic architectures anticipate, in philosophical form, the logical asymmetry expressed by the P versus NP problem in computational complexity. Here, the contrast between efficient generation and efficient recognition is treated not as a mathematical taxonomy but as a framework for understanding how knowledge is produced and validated across physics, computation, and cognition. The essay reconstructs the mathematical history of quantum mechanics through the original derivations of Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Pascual Jordan, Paul Dirac, Erwin Schrödinger, Paul Ehrenfest, and Wolfgang Pauli, culminating in John von Neumann's unification of both approaches within the formalism of Hilbert space. By juxtaposing Heisenberg's algorithmic formalism with Schrödinger's representational one, it argues that their divergence reveals a structural feature of scientific reasoning itself-the enduring tension between what can be procedurally constructed and what can only be recognized.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10102" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the design of a profession-oriented course on Theoretical Mechanics for physics education students</a><span class="id">[2511.10102]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on a profession-oriented course we offered at the University of Vienna, aimed at physics education teacher students. The course on Theoretical Classical Mechanics has been conceived and designed from its outset with the explicit goal of bridging the gap between the abstract, mathematical notions employed in Theoretical Physics with the concrete future needs of prospective teachers in their profession. We aimed at countering both the negative attitudes of students towards Theoretical Physics and the interrelated skepticism of professors regarding the students mathematical proficiency. Our main findings are that these goals can indeed be achieved through a careful selection of course material and the associated mathematical tools, by closely interwoven lecture topics and exercises, and thorough planning according to principles for high-school teaching known from science education research. Establishing close connections between the material taught in the course and the students future occupation as high-school teachers has proven to be of utmost importance. This is possible without any sacrifice of mathematical rigor or of the quality of Physics presented.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LOCA-R: Near-Perfect Performance on the Chinese Physics Olympiad 2025</a><span class="id">[2511.10515]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Olympiad-level physics problem-solving presents a significant challenge for both humans and artificial intelligence (AI), as it requires a sophisticated integration of precise calculation, abstract reasoning, and a fundamental grasp of physical principles. The Chinese Physics Olympiad (CPhO), renowned for its complexity and depth, serves as an ideal and rigorous testbed for these advanced capabilities. In this paper, we introduce LOCA-R (LOgical Chain Augmentation for Reasoning), an improved version of the LOCA framework adapted for complex reasoning, and apply it to the CPhO 2025 theory examination. LOCA-R achieves a near-perfect score of 313 out of 320 points, solidly surpassing the highest-scoring human competitor and significantly outperforming all baseline methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective Note-taking and its Impact on Learning Undergraduate Introductory Physics Courses</a><span class="id">[2507.21326]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Taking notes during lectures is one of the required skills, among many others, that students need (i) to master the topic covered in the lecture, (ii) to actively engage in the learning process with minimal to no distractions, (iii) to retain learned knowledge and skills for a longer time, and (iv) in securing better grade. To learn the role of note-taking in learning undergraduate-level introductory algebra-based physics courses, we present a comparative study of students' achievement in two minority-serving universities, namely, Fayetteville State University and The University of North Carolina at Pembroke (i) when students were taught effective note-taking strategies, motivated them to prepare notes and let them use their self-prepared notes in timed assignments and exams versus (ii) no note-taking scheme was implemented, keeping all other conditions the same. The no-note-taking scheme was used in the first introductory algebra-based physics course, while the note-taking scheme was used in the second introductory algebra-based physics course. Students' scores on the final exam and aggregated grade, accounting for all grading components, are taken as measurement tools. Analysis shows that effective note-taking helps students secure better letter grades.</p></div></details></article></body>
