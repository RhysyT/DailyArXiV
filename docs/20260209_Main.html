If one assumes such deviations to be real, a model-independent formalism (cosmography) is useful for locating the source of the problem with concordance cosmology. The extraordinarily good fit of LambdaCDM to the CMB data shows that it was a successful model of the universe at high redshift. Yet at lower redshift – when the dark energy density becomes significant, and its precise physical nature becomes important – the universe may have gone off the track of simple LambdaCDM. Here we use linear cosmography fits to binned Supernova data to reconstruct the detailed temporal history of the Hubble parameter, thus probing for interesting time-dependent behaviors of the expansion rate during and after the onset of cosmic acceleration. Using combined Type Ia supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey 5-Year data release and the Union2.1 compilation, we find intriguing hints of an oscillatory pattern in the Hubble parameter during the acceleration era. While these hints are low-significance, and not robust under different redshift binnings, we present this work as a proof-of-concept demonstration of this method for reconstructing the Hubble parameter evolution, which may be useful for the voluminous Supernova data sets anticipated to become available during the next few years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for dark matter signals with high energy astrophysical neutrinos in IceCube</a><span class="id">[2602.06121]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-energy neutrinos provide a potentially powerful and distinctive probe for dark matter (DM) - neutrino interactions, particularly in environments with enhanced DM densities, such as the DM spikes predicted to form around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, which identified four AGN, namely TXS 0506+056, NGC 1068, PKS 1424+240, and NGC 4151 as neutrino sources, provide a unique opportunity to search for signatures of these interactions. In this study, we use IceCube data to derive the most stringent constraints to date on both the energy-dependent and energy-independent DM-neutrino scattering cross-sections. We perform a statistical analysis using data from individual sources as well as a combined (stacked) analysis of all four sources. Our strongest limits arise from the stacking analysis, yielding an upper bound of $\sigma_{0} \le 8\times 10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ for an energy-independent cross-section and $\sigma_{0} \le 10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ for a linearly energy-dependent cross-section, both at 90\% confidence level, particularly in scenarios involving the adiabatic growth of black holes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing habitable regions with SRG/eROSITA</a><span class="id">[2602.06124]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar high-energy radiation is a key driver of atmospheric erosion and evolution in exoplanets, directly affecting their long-term habitability. We present a comprehensive study on stellar high-energy radiation and its impact on exoplanetary atmospheres, leveraging data from the \textit{SRG/eROSITA} all-sky survey. Our sample consists of 3750 main-sequence stars identified by cross-matching with \textit{Gaia} DR3. Utilizing X-ray spectral fits from the \textit{eROSITA} catalog, we computed X-ray ($L_X$) and combined extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) luminosities ($L_{\mathrm{EUV}}$), which we used to derive XUV fluxes at the habitable zone ($F_{\mathrm{XUV,HZ}}$). We find that the majority of stars in our sample are significantly more XUV-active than the Sun, with habitable zone fluxes ranging from $10^0$ to $10^5$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The ratio of $L_{\mathrm{XUV}}/L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ is found to be higher for cooler, magnetically active stars, highlighting their potentially hazardous nature for planetary atmospheres. Applying the energy-limited escape model, we computed atmospheric mass-loss rates for hypothetical earth-like planets located at the habitable zone of each star. We also present local maps for distances up to $500$ pc of the average XUV flux, revealing “hazard zones” where stellar radiation could significantly influence planetary atmospheric evolution. This work demonstrates the power of X-ray surveys in constraining the high-energy environments of exoplanets and underscores the critical role of stellar activity in planetary habitability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Satellites and small bodies with ALMA: Insights into Solar System formation &amp; evolution</a><span class="id">[2602.06126]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems has made major advances in the past decade. This progress has been driven in large part by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), which has given us an unprecedented view of Solar System bodies themselves, and of the structure and chemistry of forming exoplanetary systems. Within our own Solar System, ALMA has enabled the detection of new molecules and isotopologues across moons and comets, as well as placing new constraints on the compositions and histories of small bodies through thermal emission observations. In this article, we highlight some key areas where ALMA has contributed to a deeper understanding of our Solar System's formation and evolution, and place these discoveries in the context of our evolving understanding of protoplanetary disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamic Zoom Simulations of structure formation beyond standard cosmology</a><span class="id">[2602.06133]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>(Abridged) A thorough interpretation of the current and upcoming generation of cosmological observations requires unprecedented large-scale, high-resolution simulations spanning multiple cosmological models and parameters. The realization of these computationally demanding simulations poses a crucial technical challenge. We present beyond - $\Lambda$CDM implementations of the Dynamic Zoom Simulations (DZS) method, a performance-enhancing technique tailored for large-scale simulations that produce lightcone-like outputs. This approach dynamically decreases the resolution of a simulation in the regions that are not in causal connection with the observer, saving computational resources without directly affecting the physical properties within the lightcone. We implemented the DZS algorithm in two state-of-the-art codes supporting non-standard cosmologies, namely modified $f(R)$ gravity in Arepo and dark sector interactions in Gadget4. We analyzed result accuracy and performance gains across resolution, simulation volume and model by comparing runs performed with and without the DZS algorithm. Our DZS reproduce the lightcone halo mass function, sky-projected massmaps, and matter and weak lensing convergence power spectra with an accuracy of $\simeq$ 0.1% or higher in most cases. In terms of performance, DZS runs in our test simulations can save up to $\sim$ 50% runtime compared to the non-DZS counterparts. A scaling to larger simulated volumes suggests that performance gains could improve by an additional $\sim$ 20% at the resolution levels of current state-of-the-art simulations. The validation of the DZS algorithm in non-standard models demonstrates that this technique can enable cost effective, large-scale ($\gtrsim$ 1 cGpc/h) simulations with state-of-the-art resolution, providing the computational framework needed to constrain and help the interpretation of forthcoming data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Neutron Star Observations Point Towards Exotic Matter: Existing Explanations and a Prospective Proposal</a><span class="id">[2602.06170]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Multi-messenger astronomical observations of neutron stars, together with more precise calculations and constraints coming from dense matter microphysics, are generating tension with regard to equations of state models used to describe neutron star cores. Assuming an abrupt first-order phase transition with a slow conversion speed between phases, we propose different slow stable hybrid star configurations aiming to reconcile all current constraints simultaneously; within this framework, we also introduce a novel non-CSS parametrization to the quark matter equation of state and discuss its strengths and limitations. We analyze our model results in conjunction with a review of other relevant theoretical possibilities existing in the literature. We found that modern neutron star observations seem to favor the existence of some type of exotic matter in the neutron star cores; in particular, our slow stable hybrid star scenario remains a proposal capable of satisfying these constraints. However, due both to the existing skepticism regarding some of the adopted hypotheses in most extreme neutron star measurements and to the precise adjustment needed for the equation-of-state parameters, significant tension and open questions remain.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compact HII Regions as Clocks of Massive-Star Formation: Evidence for Long Formation Timescales</a><span class="id">[2602.06196]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit the luminosity function (LF) of compact HII regions in the context of the inertial–inflow model, in which massive stars assemble over extended, mass-dependent timescales. The comparison of the compact-HII-region LF with that of OB stars is traditionally used to estimate the compact-HII-phase lifetime and is often cited as evidence for the classical “lifetime problem&quot; of HII regions. We show that once stellar growth during the ionizing phase is included, the LF comparison instead constrains massive-star formation timescales, so the lifetime problem turns into evidence for prolonged growth. We illustrate the principle with a simple analytic model and then forward-model the two LFs with Monte Carlo realizations. We also derive revised Galactic LFs for compact HII regions and OB stars from the Red MSX Source survey and the Alma Luminous Star catalogue. The joint LF constraints imply a growth law where the formation time is about 2 Myr for a $60\,M_\odot$ star, with a square-root dependence on mass. The revised OB-star LF exhibits a statistically significant knee at $\log_{10}(L_{\rm k}/L_\odot)=5.0$, while the HII-region LF knee occurs at lower luminosity, as expected in the interpretation that HII regions are powered by stars that are still growing in mass. We conclude that massive stars in the Milky Way form over Myr timescales that increase with their final mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disk-Regulated Mass Transfer Between Rotating Non-Degenerate Stars: Insights from Be and sdOB Binaries</a><span class="id">[2602.06259]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mass transfer between non-degenerate stars is a fundamental but still poorly understood process in binary evolution. The commonly used rotationally limited accretion prescription in detailed binary evolution simulations that account for stellar rotation generally yields low accretion efficiencies that are difficult to reconcile with several observational constraints. We present a physically-motivated mass-accretion prescription in which accretion or decretion disks regulate the angular momentum transported to the accretor, thereby allowing for continued accretion at near-critical rotation. The accretion efficiency can be calculated from the conservation of the mass and the angular momentum of the disk. Analytical estimates show that the accretion efficiency depends on stellar rotation and mass ratio for direct impact accretion, and additionally on stellar radius and orbital separation in the disk accretion regime. The overall mass-weighted accretion efficiencies are close to the values expected near the threshold rotation rate, where the accreted specific angular momentum declines sharply. Applying this model to binary evolution simulations, we find that rotationally limited accretion systematically underestimates Be-star masses in Be+subdwarf O/B-type star (sdOB) systems, whereas the disk-star coupling model can produce more massive Be stars that are consistent with observations. The final binary component masses depend not only on accretion efficiency but also core-envelope mass ratio, which itself depends sensitively on the assumed overshooting. We find that our new disk-star coupling model with reduced overshooting yields component masses for Be+sdOB systems that are in closer agreement with observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Difficulties with Late-Time Solutions for the Hubble Tension</a><span class="id">[2602.06293]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the notion that cosmological models that modify the late-time expansion history cannot simultaneously fit the SH0ES collaboration's measurements of the Hubble constant, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations data, and Type Ia supernova distances. Adopting a few simple phenomenological models, we quantitatively demonstrate that a satisfactory fit with a model with late-time expansion history can only be achieved if one of the following is true: 1) there is a sharp step in the absolute magnitude of Type Ia supernovae at very low redshift, $z\sim 0.01$, or 2) the distance duality relation, $d_L(z)=(1+z)^2d_A(z)$, is broken. Both solutions are trivial in that they effectively decouple the calibrated SNIa measurements from other data, and this qualitatively agrees with previous work built on studying specific dark-energy models. We also identify a less effective class of late-time solutions with a transition at $z\simeq 0.15$ that lead to a more modest improvement in fit to the data than models with a very low-z transition. Our conclusions are largely unchanged when we include surface brightness fluctuation distance measurements, with their current systematic uncertainties, to our analysis. We finally illustrate our findings by studying a physical model which, when equipped with the ability to smoothly change the absolute magnitude of Type Ia supernovae, partially resolves the Hubble tension.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Archival Optical Counterpart Search for Extragalactic Fast X-Ray Transients Discovered by Einstein Probe</a><span class="id">[2602.06321]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extragalactic fast X-ray transients (eFXTs) represent a rapidly growing class of high-energy phenomena, whose physical origins remain poorly understood. With its wide-field, sensitive all-sky monitoring, the Einstein Probe (EP) has greatly increased the discovery rate of eFXTs. The search and identification of the optical counterparts of eFXT are vital for understanding their classification and constraining their physical origin. Yet, a considerable fraction of eFXTs still lack secure classifications due to the absence of timely follow-up observations. We carry out a systematic search of publicly available optical survey data and transient databases (including the Zwicky Transient Facility, ZTF, and the Transient Name Server, TNS) for optical counterparts to eFXT candidates detected by EP. In this paper, we describe our ongoing program and report the first results. Specifically, we identified the eFXT EP240506a to be associated with a UV/optical counterpart, AT 2024ofs. Spectroscopy of its host galaxy with VLT yields a redshift of $z = 0.120 \pm 0.002$. By combining archival survey data with early-time multiwavelength observations, we find that the luminosity and light-curve evolution of AT 2024ofs are consistent with a core-collapse supernova origin. From detectability simulations, we estimate a local event rate density $\rho_{0}=8.8^{+21.2}_{-3.9}\ \mathrm{yr^{-1}\, Gpc^{-3}}$ for EP240506a-like events, and completeness-corrected rate of about $36$–$78\ \mathrm{yr^{-1}\ Gpc^{-3}}$ for EP-detected X-ray transients associated with supernovae. Our results demonstrate the potential of EP to uncover prompt high-energy emission from core-collapse supernovae and underscore the critical importance of timely follow-up of future eFXT events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06403" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reversal of Spin: Comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak</a><span class="id">[2602.06403]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rotations of cometary nuclei are known to change in response to outgassing torques. The nucleus of comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak exhibited particularly dramatic rotational changes when near perihelion in 2017 April. Here, we use archival Hubble Space Telescope observations from 2017 December to study the post-perihelion lightcurve of the nucleus and to assess the nucleus size. From both Hubble photometry and non-gravitational acceleration measurements we find a diminutive nucleus with effective radius r = 500+/-100 m. Systematic optical variations are consistent with a two-peaked (i.e., rotationally symmetric) lightcurve with period 0.60+/-0.01 days, substantially different from periods measured earlier in 2017. The spin of the nucleus likely reversed between perihelion in 2017 April and December as a result of the strong outgassing torque. We infer a dimensionless moment arm k = 0.013, about twice the median value in short-period comets. The lightcurve range of 0.4 magnitudes indicates a projected nucleus axis ratio greater than 1.4:1, while the active fraction of the nucleus decreased from 2.4 in 2001 (suggesting augmentation of the gas production by sublimating coma ice grains) to 0.14 in 2017, a result of long-term modification of the surface. We find that the physical lifetime of this small nucleus to spin-up is short compared to the reported 1500 year dynamical time spent in the current orbit. Two limiting reconciliations of this inequality are suggested. The nucleus could be in a state of unusually strong activity, leading us to over-estimate the average mass loss rate and outgassing torque and so to under-estimate the physical lifetime. Alternatively, the nucleus could be the surviving remnant of a once larger body for which outgassing torques were less effective in changing the spin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06407" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Hole signatures from femtolensing and spectral fringe of Gamma Ray Bursts</a><span class="id">[2602.06407]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Femtolensing of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are vastly studied to constrain the primordial black hole (PBHs) lighter than $10^{-13}$ solar mass and may close the window for PBH dark matter. In this case, wave optics formalism is required and carefully implemented in our analysis. Incorporating the GRB observational data from Swift XRT, we perform the statistic analysis of PBH lensing, comparing with null hypothesis where BAND model is used to parametrize the GRB spectrum. We found few GRB data manifest the spectral fringe which characterize the feature of femtolensing by PBHs, and the analysis shows moderate statistical preference in terms of goodness of fit. Conversely, since most of the fitting to GRB spectral data do not improved with PBH lensing, we utilize to obtain upper bound on the PBH fractional abundance with respect to dark matter. However, the robust constraint cannot be achieved, unless the size of GRBs are smaller than $5\times10^{7}$ m for PBH mass around $5\times10^{-15}$ solar mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super-knee cosmic rays from interacting supernovae</a><span class="id">[2602.06410]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There is increasing evidence that, in the very late phase of stellar evolution before core collapse, massive stars have winds with large mass loss rates that give rise to a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. After core collapse, a shock wave forms when the supernova ejecta interacts with this CSM. In such an interaction, the nuclei in the CSM can undergo diffusive shock acceleration and reach very high energies. We consider such a model, which includes magnetic field amplification from the non-resonant streaming instability, enhancement to the abundance of heavy-ions, and composition-dependent acceleration. Applying this to several supernova subclasses, we find that IIn supernovae can supply a dominant fraction of the observed super-knee cosmic-ray (CR) flux from $\sim{\rm few}\times10^{15}\,{\rm eV}$ to $\sim{\rm few}\times10^{17}\,{\rm eV}$ and is consistent with recent LHAASO measurements above the CR knee. This systematic model also explains the increasingly heavy nuclear composition in this energy range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06465" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Walkaway Star HP Tau/G2: Evidence for a Stellar Merger</a><span class="id">[2602.06465]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>HP Tau/G2 is a luminous, short-period, fast-rotating G-type weak-line T Tauri star with a large radius, an oblate shape with gravity-darkening, little circumstellar material, and centered in a slowly expanding cloud cavity. It is an X-ray source and a variable nonthermal radio source. It forms, together with the late-type T Tauri star KPNO 15, a pair of oppositely directed walkaway stars launched when a multiple system broke apart  5600 yr ago. Momentum conservation indicates a mass of G2 of only  0.7 Msun, much lower than the  1.9 Msun determined from evolutionary models. G2 is virtually a twin of FK Com, the prototype of a class of evolved stars resulting from coalescence of W UMa binaries. We suggest that G2 became a very close and highly eccentric binary during viscous evolution in the protostellar stage and with KPNO 15 formed a triple system, which again was part of a larger unstable group including the binary G3 and the single G1. Dynamical evolution led to multiple bound ejections of KPNO 15 before it finally escaped after  2 Myr. As a result the G2 binary recoiled and contracted 5600 yr ago, became Darwin unstable and merged in a major outburst  2000 yr ago. The nearby compact triple system G1+G3 was also disturbed, and broke up 4900 yr ago, forming another walkaway pair. The G5 star HD 283572 has similar unusual properties, indicating that G2 is not a pathological case. G2 is now fading towards a new stable configuration. YSO mergers may be rather common and could explain some FUor eruptions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Non-Eruptive Reconfiguration of a Quiescent Filament After a Nearby Active Region Emergence</a><span class="id">[2602.06522]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The unpredictability of solar filament eruptions presents major challenges for forecasting space weather, as such eruptions frequently drive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that impact the heliosphere. While nearby flux emergence is often linked to their destabilisation, the specific characteristics of both the emerging flux and the filament that determine whether an eruption occurs remain unclear. We report observations of a quiescent filament that did not erupt following the nearby emergence of active region NOAA 13270 and a subsequent C-class flare in April 2023. Our analysis combines multi-viewpoint extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging and X-ray imaging with EUV spectroscopy, radio imaging and measurements of, and extrapolations from, the photospheric magnetic field. We identify the formation of a coronal null point and fan-spine topology at the interface between the active region and filament which exhibited persistent slow reconnection, indicated by chromospheric brightenings, persistent radio emission, and plasma upflows. Our results indicate that ongoing reconnection and jets can relieve magnetic stress and enable filament stability, even when under strong perturbation. We suggest that the orientation of emerging flux relative to the ambient field is a critical parameter in filament evolution, and provide observational constraints for models of filament stability and eruption.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AB Aur, a Rosetta stone for studies of planet formation (IV): C/O estimates from CS and SO interferometric observations</a><span class="id">[2602.06551]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context.

We aim to derive the sulfur abundance and the C/O ratio in the AB Aur disk using interferometric observations of CS and SO. Methods. New NOEMA observations of CS 3-2 towards AB Aur are presented. We used velocity-integrated intensity maps to determine the inclination and position angles. Keplerian masks were constructed for all observed species to assess the presence of non-Keplerian motions. We use the CS/SO ratio to study the C/O ratio. We compare our present and previous interferometric observations of AB Aur with a NAUTILUS disk model to gain insight into the S elemental abundance and C/O ratio. Results. We derive an observational CS/SO ratio ranging from 1.8 to 2.6. Only NAUTILUS models with C/O &gt; 1 can reproduce such ratios.

Despite their diverse physical origins – such as Sachs-Wolfe effects, integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects, or fossil effects from primordial non-Gaussianity – SGWB anisotropies exhibit a universal angular structure. We show that this universality arises from a single vertex function, the Cosmological Form Factor (CFF), which encodes the information on how long-wavelength modes modulate the SGWB statistics. Two fundamental principles – statistical isotropy and locality – uniquely determine the angular dependence of the CFF, resulting in a universal multipole scaling of the SGWB anisotropies. The CFF formalism provides a common language for classifying SGWB anisotropies and offers a powerful framework for interpreting upcoming observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studies on the spin and magnetic inclination evolution of magnetars Swift J1834.9-0846 under wind braking</a><span class="id">[2602.06615]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The magnetar Swift J1834.9-0846 presents a significant challenge to neutron star spin-down models. It exhibits two key anomalies: an insufficient rotational energy loss rate to power its observed X-ray luminosity, and a braking index of $ = 1.08\pm 0.04$, which starkly contradicts the canonical magnetic dipole value of $n=3$. To explain these anomalies, we develop a unified spin-evolution model that self-consistently integrates magnetic dipole radiation, gravitational wave emission, and wind braking. Within this framework, we constrain the wind braking parameter to $\kappa \in [13, 37]$ from the nebular properties, finding it contributes substantially (17%-51%) to the current spin-down torque. Bayesian inference reveals that the birth period is poorly constrained by present data and is prior-dependent, indicating a millisecond birth is allowed but not required. Furthermore, we constrain the number of precession cycles to $\xi \sim 10^{4}$–$10^{5}$, and our analysis favors a toroidally-dominated internal magnetic field configuration as the most self-consistent explanation for the low braking index. Finally, we assess the continuous gravitational-wave detectability. The present-day signal is undetectable. However, the early-time signal might have reached the projected sensitivity of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories, such as the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO) and the Einstein Telescope (ET), although a confident detection would require exceptionally stable rotation, an assumption considered highly optimistic for a young magnetar. This work establishes a unified framework that links magnetar spin-down with their interior physics and multi-messenger observables, providing a physically consistent interpretation for Swift J1834.9-0846 and a new tool for understanding similar extreme neutron stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotational Behaviour of Exotic Compact Objects</a><span class="id">[2602.06660]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We construct exotic compact objects composed entirely of self-interacting asymmetric fermionic dark matter governed by a repulsive Yukawa potential with massive dark interaction boson. By considering the structural, tidal, and rotational properties of solar mass self-gravitating dark matter systems, and contrasting them against purely baryonic neutron stars, described by the well understood SLy4 equation of state, we hope to shed some light on the place of dark compact systems in the context of gravitational wave astronomy, specifically due to the difficulty parsing mass and radius data from events with no electromagnetic counterpart. Here we consider systems composed of 1 GeV and 10 GeV dark matter. Relevant compact objects are then analysed and simulated as both static bodies, and rotating systems governed by the Hartle-Thorne formalism to second order.

The observed abundances are the result of the balance between the accretion flux and the dilution of this planetary material by internal transport processes. A recent study showed that more massive DA WDs are less polluted than smaller mass ones. It was suggested that the reason could be related to the formation of planetary systems when these stars were on the main sequence. The aim of this work is to test how internal dilution processes, including thermohaline convection, change with WD masses, and whether such an effect could account for variations in the observed pollution. We computed the efficiency of atomic diffusion and thermohaline convection after the accretion of heavy elements onto WDs using static DA models with various masses, effective temperatures, and hydrogen contents. We confirm that thermohaline convection is always more efficient in diluting accreted elements than atomic diffusion, as previously shown in the literature. However, we find that element dilution by thermohaline convection is less efficient in massive WDs than in smaller mass ones, due to their larger internal density. We showed that the differences in observed heavy element pollution in WDs according to their masses cannot be explained by the dilution induced by atomic diffusion and thermohaline mixing alone. Indeed, the pollution by planetary system accretion should be more easily detectable in massive WDs than in low-mass ones. We discuss other processes that should be taken into account before drawing any conclusion about the occurrences of planetary systems according to the mass of the star on the main sequence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06789" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forecasting Supermassive Black Hole Binary Gravitational Wave Probes: Prospects for Future Pulsar Timing Array and Space-Borne Detectors</a><span class="id">[2602.06789]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive framework for predicting the detection prospects of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) by future gravitational wave (GW) observatories, examining both space-borne detectors (LISA, Taiji, TianQin) and next-generation pulsar timing array (PTA) combined with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-PTA).

We focus on PBHs that inject electromagnetic (EM) energy into the intergalactic medium (IGM) after recombination, in the mass range $3.2\times 10^{13}\,\mathrm{g} \lesssim M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 5\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{g}$. For each PBH mass, we compute the redshift-dependent energy injection from Hawking evaporation using \texttt{BlackHawk}, fully accounting for the time evolution of the PBH mass and the complete spectrum of emitted Standard Model particles and gravitons. The resulting photons and electrons are propagated through the primordial plasma using \texttt{DarkHistory}, which self-consistently models EM cascades and determines the fraction of injected energy deposited into ionization, excitation, and heating of the IGM. These modifications to the ionization and thermal histories are incorporated into a Gaussian Process reconstruction of the free-electron fraction based on low-$\ell$ CMB polarization data from the \textit{Planck} mission. This non-parametric approach allows for a statistically well-defined separation between exotic high-redshift energy injection and late-time astrophysical reionization, allowing PBH evaporation to be constrained through its contribution to the high-redshift optical depth. Requiring consistency with current CMB measurements, we obtain upper limits on the initial PBH abundance that are robust against reionization modeling uncertainties and systematically more conservative than existing bounds, reflecting the fully numerical and time-dependent treatment of Hawking evaporation and energy deposition. Our results demonstrate the power of reionization observables as a precision probe of PBH evaporation and other scenarios involving late-time energy injection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in stellar radiative regions.

Linear study of shear-driven instabilities</a><span class="id">[2602.06889]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper is the first in a series investigating magnetohydrodynamic instabilities that may contribute to angular-momentum transport and magnetic-field evolution in stellar radiative zones. We focus on shear-driven instabilities, specifically the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) instability and the magnetorotational instability (MRI), which are expected to play key roles in the internal dynamics of radiative regions. We carried out a local linear stability analysis using a numerical approach that extends beyond classical limiting cases and includes stabilizing effects such as stratification and magnetic tension, allowing the exploration of realistic flow regimes. These results were validated through a global mode analysis in a Taylor-Couette configuration. We recovered the standard MRI and azimuthal MRI stability criteria and quantified the effects of stratification, magnetic tension, and diffusion on their growth. In strongly sheared regimes, we derived a new criterion for the magnetised GSF (MGSF) instability and clarified the transition from SMRI to MGSF as stratification and magnetic effects narrow the unstable domain. We also provided approximate growth-time formulae that identify the dominant instability under given stellar conditions and can be implemented in 1D stellar evolution codes. Global Taylor-Couette calculations validate the local WKB analysis. Applied to subgiants and young red giants, our results show that shear-driven instabilities can grow rapidly for magnetic fields below 100 kG. Strong axial fields (100 kG) confined to the hydrogen-burning shell suppress instabilities unless the shear is sufficiently distant. These results support incorporating our criteria and growth estimates into stellar evolution models to assess the efficiency of shear-driven transport.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-spherical BUFFALOs: a weak lensing view of the Frontier Field clusters and associated systematics</a><span class="id">[2602.06904]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy clusters are tracers of the large scale structures of the Universe, making the time evolution of their mass function dependent on key cosmological parameters, such as the cosmic matter density or the amplitude of density fluctuations $\sigma_8$. Accurate measurements of cluster's total masses are therefore essential, yet they can be challenging, particularly for clusters with complex morphologies, as simple mass profiles are often adopted to fit the measurements. In this work, we focus on the Frontier Fields galaxy clusters: a sample of six extremely massive systems, that, in most cases, exhibit highly complex mass distributions. The BUFFALO survey extended the Hubble Space Telescope observations for the Frontier Fields galaxy clusters, providing high-resolution multi-band imaging within a few Mpc. Combining this high-quality imaging dataset with ancillary spectroscopy, we produce weak-lensing catalogues with very high source densities, about 50 sources/arcmin$^2$. This allows us to robustly estimate the individual weak-lensing cluster masses and quantify the sensitivity of these measurements on different factors, such as the cluster centring, the uncertainty on the redshift distribution or the foreground contamination and boost factor correction. This provides a data-driven analysis of the different sources of systematics that can impact such measurements. We find that the largest sources of systematic bias arise for the most disturbed clusters, such as the multi-modal, merging galaxy cluster Abell 2744. This analysis sets a comprehensive framework for assessing the impact of systematics on the weak-lensing estimates of cluster masses, and in particular, in the case of unrelaxed clusters. This can play a key role in forthcoming cosmological analyses based on wide-field surveys such as Euclid and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time of the Rubin Observatory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards a Fully Automated Pipeline for Short-Term Forecasting of In Situ Coronal Mass Ejection Magnetic Field Structure</a><span class="id">[2602.06926]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an automated pipeline for operational short-term forecasting of coronal mass ejection (CME) magnetic field structure at L1, coupling arrival time prediction, in situ detection, and iterative flux rope reconstruction, following near-real-time remote-sensing CME identification. The system is triggered by new entries in the CCMC DONKI database and first applies the drag-based ELEvo model to determine whether an Earth impact is expected and estimate arrival time. This estimate defines a temporal window constraining the search for CME signatures in real-time L1 in situ solar wind data, where the magnetic obstacle (MO) is automatically detected using the deep learning model ARCANE. Upon MO onset, iterative reconstructions with the semi-empirical flux rope model 3DCORE are performed, using a Monte Carlo fitting scheme, producing continuously updated forecasts of the remaining magnetic field profile. We evaluate the pipeline using 3870 archived DONKI entries and archived NOAA real-time in situ data from 2013-2025, assessing forecast performance at different stages of MO observation. For 61 events with an associated ground-truth counterpart in the ICMECAT catalog, forecasts based on initial MO data already achieve performance comparable to full-event reconstructions. Typical errors are  5 hours in timing of magnetic field extrema and  10 nT in field strength metrics, with limited systematic improvement as more of the event is observed. Results show substantial event variability and systematic underestimation of extrema, indicating deviations from ideal flux rope assumptions. These findings demonstrate the potential of fully autonomous real-time forecasting while highlighting limitations imposed by event complexity and model representational capacity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mapping plasma properties of Cassiopeia A with XRISM/Resolve: a Bayesian analysis via UltraSPEX</a><span class="id">[2602.06952]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mapping the physical conditions of the shocked plasma of young supernova remnants (SNR) is crucial for understanding their explosion mechanisms, ejecta structure, and large-scale asymmetries. Using $&gt;350$ ks of XRISM/Resolve high spectral resolution observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), the youngest known Galactic core-collapse SNR, we present the first microcalorimeter-based plasma parameter maps of any SNR. We tessellate Cas A into $1'\times1'$ regions and fit the broadband spectra as thermal emission from two pure-metal ejecta components – corresponding to intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) and iron-group elements (IGEs) – plus nonthermal synchrotron radiation. For robust inference, we introduce UltraSPEX, a Bayesian framework that couples the SPEX plasma code with the UltraNest nested-sampling algorithm, yielding full posterior distributions and exploration of parameter degeneracies. Key findings include enhanced Ar/Si and Ca/Si abundance ratios near the base of the Si-rich jets, and a high Ni/Fe mass ratio ($0.08\pm0.015$) in the base of NE jet. IGEs ejecta exhibit systematically higher Doppler velocities and broadenings than IMEs ejecta in most regions, with maximum differences of $\sim800$ km/s and $\sim1200$ km/s, respectively; Ca shows distinct (faster) kinematics from other IMEs in several SE regions. The ionization timescale and electron temperature show a robust anti-correlation, particularly for IGEs. This relation and measured parameter values could be explained by semi-analytical models with significant ejecta clumping (overdensities of $\sim10$ for IGEs and up to $\sim100$ for IMEs) and reduced historical reverse-shock velocities. Nonthermal emission accounts for a substantial fraction, with at least 47% of the 4–6 keV continuum and dominates in the western regions, where the spectrum hardens.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Matter Heating of Compact Stars Beyond Capture: A Relativistic Framework for Energy Deposition by Particle Beams</a><span class="id">[2602.06111]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Compact astrophysical objects, such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, can act as detectors of energetic particle fluxes originating from astrophysical accelerators. While most existing capture and heating calculations assume isotropic very low energetic incident fluxes from the halo dark matter, many realistic sources produce highly directional beams or jets, for which gravitational focusing, trajectory multiplicity, and local energy deposition must be treated consistently. In this work, we develop a general relativistic formalism to compute the local density, capture probability, and energy deposition of particles arriving as directed beams onto compact objects. The framework is based on the mapping of an asymptotic particle flux to local densities through geodesic congruences, allowing for gravitational focusing, multi-stream regions, and optical depth effects to be incorporated in a unified way. The formalism applies to arbitrary particle species and interaction models, and separates capture from through-going energy deposition in a frame-consistent manner. As an explicit application, we consider relativistic particle beams generated in astrophysical jets and evaluate their interaction with two compact objects samples: a white dwarf and a neutron star. In particular, we illustrate the framework using boosted dark matter produced in a list of 324 blazars as a representative case study, computing the resulting fluxes and the associated heating in the selected stars. Additional regimes such as the interaction roof and geometric limit are discussed, highlighting the conditions under which compact objects can efficiently convert incident beam energy into observable heating.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scalar Tsunamis from Black Hole Formation</a><span class="id">[2602.06112]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stars and other macroscopic objects may be surrounded by potentially large field configurations of very light scalars coupled to ordinary matter.

Using the three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, we construct the chiral effective potential in a Schwarzschild spacetime background. We find that PBHs promote chiral symmetry restoration and induce a nontrivial local phase structure in the vicinity of the event horizon simultaneously. In particular, this structure exhibits a novel chiral symmetry breaking pattern involving both second- and first-order phase transitions, a feature absent in flat spacetime. We further demonstrate that PBHs act as genuine catalysts for the chiral phase transition by analyzing the bounce solution in curved spacetime. The presence of PBHs substantially enhances the inverse duration parameter $\beta/H$ while leaving the overall transition strength comparable to that in flat spacetime. As a consequence, even a small population of PBHs can induce $\mathcal{O}(1)$ shifts in both the peak frequency and the peak amplitude of the GW spectrum generated by the first-order dark chiral phase transition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravastar on the brane with a timelike extra dimension</a><span class="id">[2602.06691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We construct a gravastar configuration within the Shtanov-Sahni (SS) braneworld scenario, characterized by a timelike extra dimension and negative brane tension. Unlike classical black holes, which inevitably culminate in central curvature singularities, our model demonstrates that the SS braneworld dynamics naturally regularize the interior geometry and prevent singularity formation. By solving the modified Einstein field equations induced on the brane, we obtain explicit interior, shell, and exterior solutions without invoking the idealized thin-shell approximation. The gravastar core is modeled as a Bose–Einstein condensate, while the intermediate shell consists of ultra-dense stiff matter. Bulk Weyl corrections induce anisotropic effective pressures on the brane, a feature that emerges intrinsically in this scenario and supports stability. We analyze the active gravitational mass, energy, entropy, and proper thickness of the shell, and establish the junction conditions at the interfaces. Our analysis reveals that the SS gravastar exhibits suppressed or even negative effective mass, reflecting the repulsive nature of the interior condensate, and admits stable equilibrium solutions consistent with energy conditions. This highlights the SS braneworld gravastar as a physically viable compact object and a compelling alternative to black holes. A key novelty of our construction is that the stabilizing pressure anisotropy and suppressed effective gravitational mass arise dynamically from higher-dimensional Weyl corrections, rather than being imposed through ad hoc matter sources or thin-shell idealizations. This provides the first fully analytic realization of a finite-thickness, stable gravastar in the Shtanov-Sahni braneworld, highlighting a genuinely geometric mechanism for singularity avoidance in compact objects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayesian Constraints on the Neutron Star Equation of State with a Smooth Hadron-Quark Crossover</a><span class="id">[2602.06696]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform a Bayesian inference of the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) within a unified framework that incorporates hadronic matter, quark matter, and a smooth hadron–quark crossover.

Motivated by the possibility of the nuclear matter spin-polarization, in this paper, we study the new properties to $SL\nu$ obtained under the influence of net matter polarization. We demonstrate that the polarization can enhance or completely suppress the radiation. Also, it introduces a characteristic asymmetry into the total radiation from the compact object, which could be an observable feature dependent on the matter polarization and the magnetic field inside the stellar (if the field is connected to the stellar matter polarization).

We demonstrate that this setup is ideal for systematic studies of tidal effects, in a way that is free from coordinate, gauge, and field redefinition ambiguities. We use a combination of worldline effective field theory, the background field method, and advanced scattering amplitude techniques to derive phase shifts for scattering of spin-$0,1,2$ fields off generic compact objects at third PM order. We demonstrate that the inclusion of the recoil of the object is crucial for consistency of this calculation. Focusing on a particular case of black holes, we extract the leading static and dynamical Love numbers of the spin-0 field and the static Love number of the spin-1 field in four dimensions by matching our EFT amplitudes and calculations in General Relativity. We show, fully on-shell, that the leading static Love numbers vanish identically, while the dynamical Love numbers are not zero and run logarithmically. The latter resolves the ambiguities of previous off-shell matching calculations. We also extend our results to seven dimensions, where spin-2 Love numbers undergo a renormalization group running at 2PM, which we compute explicitly. In addition, we extract the leading static Love numbers of spin-0 and spin-1 fields in five dimensions, which also run.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04373" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the role of nuclear parameters in Neutron Star oscillations: a model comparison</a><span class="id">[2412.04373]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent studies based on the relativistic mean field (RMF) model found certain nuclear empirical parameters, in particular the nucleon effective mass, to be strongly correlated with observable properties of Neutron Stars (NSs), such as the frequencies of $f-$mode oscillations. This shows the potential to constrain the values of effective mass from future observations of $f-$modes. One of our primary goals of this work is to investigate whether such correlations are physical or an artifact of the underlying nuclear model. To test this, we perform a comparative study of the correlations between NS astrophysical observables and nuclear physics parameters using two different equation of state models based on RMF theory and non-relativistic Meta-Modelling (MM) scheme. The nuclear meta-model does not assume any underlying nuclear model and therefore allows us to test the model dependence of the results. The calculations of the $f-$mode characteristics are performed within the relativistic Cowling approximation. We use state-of-the-art nuclear microscopic calculations at low density and multi-messenger astrophysical data at high-density within a Bayesian-inspired scheme to constrain the parameter space of the nuclear models. From the posterior distribution, we probe the underlying correlations among nuclear parameters and with NS observables. We find that the correlation between the symmetry energy and its slope is physical, while that of the nucleon effective mass with NS observables is model-dependent. The study shows that the effective mass governs the high density behaviour in RMF models, while in the MM it is controlled by the higher order saturation parameters, and hence probes the possibility of constraining them from future $f$-mode observations. The findings of this investigation are interesting both for astrophysics as well as nuclear physics communities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing Missing Baryons in the Cosmic Filaments with tSZ and CMB-Lensing Stacking</a><span class="id">[2507.08561]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the distribution of missing baryons in the cosmic filaments by stacking $\sim 30,700$ filaments across the northern and southern SDSS sky regions using Planck Compton-$y$ and CMB lensing maps.

The LT correction is applied first, then the NN is trained on the resulting fields to improve accuracy across scales. The method uses a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and yields significant performance gains: approximately 50% improvement over LT alone and 12% over NN alone. The reconstructed fields from the LT+NN method show stronger correlations with the true real-space fields than either LT or NN separately. The hybrid method also improves clustering statistics such as halo-halo and halo-void correlations, with benefits extending to BAO scales. Compared to NN-only, it provides better suppression of spurious anisotropies on large and quasi-linear scales, as measured by the quadrupole moments of correlation functions. This work shows that combining a physically motivated dynamical model with a machine learning algorithm leverages the strengths of both approaches. The LT+NN method achieves high accuracy with modest training data and computational cost, making it a promising tool for future applications to more realistic galaxy surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The spin-orbit alignment hypothesis in millisecond pulsars</a><span class="id">[2507.13893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are spun up during their accretion phase in a binary system. The exchange of angular momentum between the accretion disk and the star tends to align the spin and orbital angular momenta on a very short time scale compared to the accretion stage. In this work, we study a subset of $\gamma$-ray MSPs in binaries for which the orbital inclination angle $i$ has been accurately constrained thanks to the Shapiro delay measurements. Our goal is to constrain the observer viewing angle $\zeta$ and to check whether it agrees with the orbital inclination angle $i$, in other words if $\zeta \approx i$. We use a Bayesian inference technique to fit the MSP $\gamma$-ray light curves based on the third $\gamma$-ray pulsar catalogue (3PC). The emission model relies on the striped wind model deduced from force-free neutron star magnetosphere simulations. We found good agreement between the two angles $i$ and $\zeta$ for a significant fraction of our sample, about four fifth, confirming the spin-orbit alignment scenario during the accretion stage. However about one fifth of our sample deviates significantly from this alignment. The reasons are manifold: either the $\gamma$-ray fit is not reliable or some precession and external torque avoid an almost perfect alignment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resolving the Planck-DESI tension by non-minimally coupled quintessence</a><span class="id">[2508.01759]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Planck measurement of cosmic microwave background (CMB) has established the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model as the concordant model along with other observations. However, recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have renewed the matter fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension between Planck-$\Lambda$CDM and DESI-$\Lambda$CDM. Directly reconciling this CMB-BAO tension with a dynamical DE in Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization seems to imply a crossing of the equation-of-state (EoS) through $w=-1$ at low redshifts. In this letter, we resolve this $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension by allowing for the DM non-minimally coupled to gravity via a quintessence field. This non-minimal coupling is preferred over $3\sigma$ confidence level. Consequently, even though the usual effective EoS of the coupled quintessence apart from the standard CDM part never crosses but always above $w=-1$, a misidentification with the $w_0w_a$CDM model would exactly fake such a crossing behavior, and the tensions on neutrino mass and growth rate in the $\Lambda$CDM model are also relieved in our model as a result of the resolved $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New Status Qvo?

Here, we present SN 2021qvo: a SN Ia that exhibits a clear early bump in photometry obtained by the Young Supernova Experiment. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2021qvo show that it has a broader light curve, higher peak luminosity, shallower Si II $\lambda$5972 pseudo-equivalent width, and lower ejecta velocities than normal SNe Ia, which are all consistent with the characteristics of the 2003fg-like (often called ”super-Chandrasekhar&quot;) SN subtype. Including SN 2021qvo, just four known 2003fg-like SNe Ia have sufficient pre-peak data to reveal a rising light-curve bump, and all four have bump detections. Host-galaxy analysis reveals that SN 2021qvo exploded in a low-mass galaxy ${\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) = 7.83^{+0.17}_{-0.24}$, also consistent with other members of this class. The current leading early-bump 2003fg-like SN Ia progenitor model involves an interaction between the circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta. We test the validity of this theory by modeling the early bump and subsequent light-curve evolution of SN 2021qvo with the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients. We find that the bump can be modeled with a best-fit CSM mass in the range $M_\mathrm{CSM}=3.31-8.51 \times 10^{-3} M_\odot$. SN 2021qvo adds to the small but growing number of 2003fg-like SNe Ia with rising light-curve bumps; as the number of these SNe Ia with CSM estimates continues to grow, population-level inferences about the CSM distribution will be able to constrain the progenitor scenario for these SNe Ia.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13949" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Explicit M1 Radiation-hydrodynamics Scheme for Three-dimensional Protostellar Evolution</a><span class="id">[2510.13949]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) scheme that enables three-dimensional simulations resolving both protostellar interiors and their surrounding accretion flows within a single framework, to clarify how a protostar evolves while interacting with the accretion flow. The method builds on an explicit two-moment M1 closure scheme with a reduced speed of light approximation (RSLA) for massively parallel computation. Our scheme introduces a complementary non-RSLA radiation component that dominates in optically thick regions. This hybrid treatment restores physical energy conservation inside protostars, which would otherwise be violated under the RSLA, while retaining the advantage of large time steps. To overcome the limitation of the conventional M1 closure in solving radiative transfer in extremely optically thick regions inside protostars and across steep optical-depth gradients near their surfaces, we incorporate the optical-depth information of neighboring cells into the radiative transfer calculation. We further evolve photon number densities in addition to radiation energy densities to reconstruct an effective local spectrum on the fly without resorting to costly multi-frequency transport. We implement this scheme in the adaptive mesh refinement code SFUMATO and verify its validity through a series of test calculations. As an application, we follow the early evolution of a massive protostar formed at high redshift, within a full cosmological context. The results reveal a continuous structure connecting the swollen protostar and its surrounding disk, which cannot be captured in conventional one-dimensional models. This RHD scheme opens a path to studies of protostellar evolution and its interaction with the accretion flow in realistic three-dimensional environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting electron-capture decay for Galactic cosmic-ray data</a><span class="id">[2510.14544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Electron-capture (EC) unstable species in Galactic cosmic rays constrain the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and acceleration. They have also been advocated as tracers of reacceleration or gas inhomogeneities during their transport. The number of EC-unstable species grows with mass, with an expected EC-decay impact more important for larger atomic number and lower energy. We revisit the modelling of EC decay and its detectability in the context of recent unmodulated low-energy (Voyager) and high-precision data for heavy (AMS-02) and very-heavy nuclei (ACE-CRIS, CALET and Super-TIGER). We solve the transport equation for a multi-level configuration (up to any number of electrons attached) in the diffusion and leaky-box models. Their decayed fractions are found to be qualitatively similar but with very different absolute fluxes. We check that the standard two-level approximation, wherein the cosmic-ray nucleus is fully ionised or with one electron attached, is sufficient for most situations. We find that the impact of EC-decay is negligible in current data, except possibly for fluxes or ratios involving $^{51}$Cr, $^{55}$Fe, and Co. These conclusions are robust against significant uncertainties in the attachment and stripping cross-sections.

The structure of the shock precursor is shaped by a competition between the Bell instability and the Weibel (filamentation) instability. The Bell instability is dominant at relatively high magnetizations $(\sigma\gtrsim10^{-3})$, whereas the Weibel instability prevails at lower magnetizations $(\sigma\lesssim10^{-4})$. Shocks with precursors shaped by Bell modes efficiently accelerate ions, converting a fraction $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}\sim0.2$ of the upstream flow energy into downstream nonthermal ion energy. The maximum energy of nonthermal ions exhibits a Bohm scaling in time, as $E_{\max}\propto t$. A much smaller fraction $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{e}}\ll0.1$ of the upstream flow energy goes into downstream nonthermal electrons in the Bell regime. On the other hand, when the precursor is dominated by Weibel modes, the shock efficiently generates both nonthermal ions and electrons with $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}\sim\varepsilon_{\mathrm{e}}\sim0.1$, albeit with a slower scaling for the maximum energy, $E_{\mathrm{max}}\propto t^{1/2}$. Our results are applicable to a wide range of trans-relativistic shocks, including the termination shocks of extragalactic jets, the late stages of gamma-ray burst afterglows, and shocks in fast blue optical transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Birth of Be Star Disks II.

The mechanisms that lead to disk formation and dissipation are not known although progress has been made with some systems. We present a study of a disk outburst of the Be star lambda Pavonis. Our dataset comprises 698 high-resolution spectra contemporaneous with TESS photometry in 2023. Near the end of TESS monitoring, the star began disk building from a pristine diskless state. We find the disk built within 5 days in optical H I and He I lines, while the disk circularized in about 12 days. The disk began to decay in higher excitation He I first, then lower excitation transitions, with the decay ending last for H-alpha. We examine non-radial pulsations both through TESS photometry and the line profile variations (LPVs) in the spectroscopy. Our analysis indicates that two periodicities seen in TESS photometry (at 1.644 and 1.485 cycles/d) are not seen in the spectral lines before, during, or after the outburst. The strongest photometric signal is a periodicity at 0.163 cycles/d, which appears as a difference between the two weaker signals and is visible in the spectra without any apparent changes in amplitude or phase. We additionally find evidence for fast non-photometric pulsational variations over the course of spectroscopy obtained before, during, and after the outburst. These fast LPVs are strong, and interfere with the two weaker signals, hampering our ability to detect them in spectroscopy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17364" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantifying sunspot group nesting with density-based unsupervised clustering</a><span class="id">[2512.17364]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sunspot groups often emerge in spatial-temporal clusters, known as nests or complexes of activity. Quantifying how frequently such nesting occurs is important for understanding the organisation and recurrence of solar magnetic fields. We introduce an automated approach based on kernel density estimation and DBSCAN clustering to identify nests in the longitude-time domain and to measure the fraction of sunspot groups that belong to them. The method combines a smooth representation of emergence patterns with a density-based clustering procedure, validated using synthetic solar-like cycles and corrected for variations in data density. We apply this method to 151 years of sunspot-group observations from the Royal Greenwich Observatory Photoheliographic Results (RGO, 1874-1976) and Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station (KMAS, 1955-2025) catalogues. Across all cycles and latitude bands, the mean nesting degree is $\langle D\rangle = 0.61 \pm 0.12$, implying that about 60 percent all sunspot groups emerge within nests. Nesting is strongest at mid-latitudes (10$^\circ$-20$^\circ$), and results from the two independent datasets agree in the period of overlap. The nesting degree significantly correlates with the solar activity level, with the correlation strengthening when small groups are excluded. The characteristic inter-nest spacing contracts from $\sim$200-500 Mm at low activity to $\sim$60-100 Mm at solar maximum, approaching typical sunspot-group dimensions. The identified nests range from compact clusters to long-lived, drifting structures, offering new quantitative constraints on the persistence and organisation of solar magnetic activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00962" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A comprehensive study of the relations between the properties of planetary systems and the chemical compositions of their host stars</a><span class="id">[2601.00962]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The giant planet-metallicity correlation revealed that planetary formation depends on the stellar properties. There is growing evidence that it is also valid for smaller hot planets, but it is not clear whether elements other than iron also influence the properties of planetary systems. To investigate this, we determined the abundances of 13 chemical elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni and Cu) for a sample of 561 Kepler exoplanet-hosting stars using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra. We find that stars in systems having only large or hot planets are enriched in some elements relative to those having only small or warm planets, respectively, with this signature being related to the underlying stellar metallicity. This Kepler sample is composed of stars belonging to the Galactic low- and high-$\alpha$ sequences, corresponding to the chemical thin and thick disks. Our results reveal that stars enhanced in $\alpha$-elements may facilitate the formation of large planets in metal-poor environments although the iron abundance is still a limiting factor. We also investigated chemical abundances as a function of elemental condensation temperatures and found that there is a diversity of slopes regardless of the exoplanetary systems hosted by the star. We confirmed that the Sun is depleted in refractory elements relative to the solar twins in our sample, all of which host a diversity of exoplanets, suggesting that this depletion is caused by processes not related to planet formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A dynamical systems approach to studying the equivalence principle in dilaton gravity</a><span class="id">[2601.20156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study a string-inspired dilaton cosmology in the Damour–Polyakov (DP) regime using dynamical-systems methods, aiming to make explicit how cosmological relaxation controls deviations from the equivalence principle. Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sulfur Enrichment in Close-in Exoplanet Atmospheres Induced by Pebble Drift across the Salt Line</a><span class="id">[2602.05300]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of JWST have revealed that several close-in exoplanets have sulfur-rich atmospheres through SO$_2$ detections. Atmospheric sulfur is often thought to originate from solid accretion during planet formation, whereas recent simultaneous detections of SO$_2$ and NH$_3$ challenge this conventional scenario. In this study, we propose that ammonium salts, such as NH$_4$SH tentatively detected in comets and molecular clouds, play a significant role in producing sulfur-rich disk gases, which serve as the ingredient of giant planet atmospheres. We simulated the radial transport of dust containing volatile ices and ammonium salts, along with the dissociation, sublimation, and recondensation of these materials, thereby predicting the atmospheric chemical structures and transmission spectra of planets inheriting these compositions. Assuming that ammonium salts sequester 20% of the elemental nitrogen and sulfur budgets, our results reveal that they enhance sulfur and nitrogen abundances in disk gases to 2-10 times the solar values near the salt dissociation line. Photochemical simulations demonstrate that SO$_2$, NS, H$_2$S, NO, and NH$_3$ become the dominant N and S chemical species in the atmospheres on planets that inherited the gas compositions inside H$_2$O snowline. SO$_2$ features clearly appear in the infrared transmission spectra when the salt-bearing grains enhance the sulfur abundance of disk gas by pebble drift. Our model provides a novel scenario that explains the SO$_2$ detected in some exoplanet atmospheres solely from disk gas accretion. Volatile-element ratios, particularly N/S and C/O, would provide a key to disentangle our scenario from the conventional solid-accretion scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Double-Burst Nature and Early Afterglow Evolution of Long GRB 110801A</a><span class="id">[2602.05404]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 110801A, utilizing multi-band data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and ground-based telescopes. The $\gamma$-ray emission exhibits a distinct two-episode (“double-burst”) structure. Rapid follow-up observations in the optical and X-ray bands provide full coverage of the second burst. The optical light curve begins to rise approximately 135 s after the trigger, significantly preceding the second emission episode observed in X-rays and $\gamma$-rays at $\sim 320$ s. This chromatic behavior suggests different physical origins for the optical and high-energy emissions. Joint broadband spectral fitting (optical to $\gamma$-rays) during the second episode reveals that a two-component model, consisting of a power-law plus a Band function, provides a superior fit compared to single-component models. We interpret the power-law component as the afterglow of the first burst (dominating the optical band), while the Band component is attributed to the prompt emission of the second burst (dominating the high-energy bands). A physical synchrotron model is also found to be a viable candidate to explain the high-energy emission. Regarding the afterglow, the early optical light curve displays a sharp transition from a rise of $\sim t^{2.5}$ to $\sim t^{6.5}$, which is well-explained by a scenario involving both reverse shock (RS) and forward shock (FS) components. We constrain the key physical parameters of the burst, deriving an initial Lorentz factor $\Gamma_0 \sim 60$, a jet half-opening angle $\theta_j \sim 0.09$, and an isotropic kinetic energy $E_{\rm k,iso} \sim 10^{54.8}$ erg.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04059" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundamental oscillations as a tool to distinguish boson stars from neutron stars and black holes</a><span class="id">[2502.04059]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive boson stars are self-gravitating configurations of self-interacting scalar fields and can be modeled by a massive scalar field with a quartic self-interaction potential.

In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that non-radial fundamental ($f$-)mode characteristics also follow a scaling in the strong interaction limit, opening up the outstanding prospect of evaluating the mode properties for boson stars for arbitrary masses spanning the scalar dark matter parameter space allowed by current observations. We provide the scaling relations within full general relativity and obtain the mode characteristics corresponding to the maximum boson star mass configuration. We apply these to determine the $f$-mode properties for boson stars solely as a function of their mass and compactness, which allows distinguishing them from those of neutron stars and black hole quasinormal modes in comparable mass range. In particular, we show that the frequencies are always lower than those of corresponding black holes of the same mass by a factor of 4.5.

In binary systems, these clouds can produce distinctive observational imprints. Recent studies accounting for nonlinearities induced by orbital backreaction suggest that if the binary forms at a large separation, resonance transitions can significantly deplete the cloud, minimizing later observational consequences except for very specific orbital inclinations. In this paper, we extend this framework to supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), considering the influence of their astrophysical evolutionary histories. We find that, before entering the gravitational wave (GW) radiation stage, the additional energy loss channels can accelerate orbital evolution. This acceleration makes hyperfine resonant transitions inefficient, allowing a sufficient portion of the cloud to remain for later direct observations. We further discuss the ionization effects and cloud depletion occurring at this stage. Based on these theoretical insights, we explore how multi-messenger observations for SMBHBs can be utilized to detect the ionization effects of boson clouds by examining changes in the orbital period decay rate via electromagnetic measurements and variations in GW strain over a wide frequency band. Our findings reveal a complex dependence on the binary's total mass, mass ratio, and boson mass, emphasizing the significant role of astrophysical evolution histories in detecting boson clouds within binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reheating after the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</a><span class="id">[2507.21215]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Theories with radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) lead to first-order phase transitions and the production of gravitational waves as well as primordial black holes if the supercooling period lasted long enough.

When it is, the dominant reheating mechanism can be the decays of the field responsible for RSB in the Standard Model (SM) sector. We point out that in a similar way dark matter (DM) can be produced and we analyze in some detail the case of a sterile-neutrino, finding that the full DM abundance is reproduced when this particle is at the $10^2$ MeV scale in a well-motivated SM completion. When the RSB scale is not much larger than the EW symmetry breaking scale, we find that efficient reheating always occurs when the energy density of the false vacuum is first entirely transferred to a dark photon and then to SM fermions via dark-photon decays.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metastable Strings and Gravitational Waves in One-Scale Models</a><span class="id">[2511.08546]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Metastable cosmic strings provide a minimal and predictive origin for the stochastic gravitational-wave background reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments.

Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong lensing cosmography using binary-black-hole mergers: Prospects for the near future</a><span class="id">[2512.15168]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A small fraction of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black holes (BBHs) will be gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies and galaxy clusters. Strong lensing will produce multiple identical copies of the GW signal arriving at different times. Jana et al. \cite{Jana_2023} recently proposed a method to constrain cosmological parameters using strongly lensed GW events detected by next-generation (XG) detectors. The idea is that the number of strongly lensed GW events and the distribution of their lensing time delays encode imprints of the cosmological parameters. From the observed number of lensed GW events (tens of thousands) and their time delay distribution, this method can provide a new probe of cosmology, obtaining information at intermediate redshifts. In this work, we explore the possibility of doing lensing cosmography using upcoming observations of the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. This requires incorporating the detector network selection effects in the analysis, which was neglected earlier. We expect dozens of lensed GW events to be detected by upgraded LVK detectors, potentially enabling modest constraints on cosmological parameters. Even with relatively modest numbers of lensed detections, we demonstrate the potential of lensing cosmography. For XG detectors, our revised forecasts are consistent with the earlier forecasts that neglected the selection effects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18093" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Multi-messenger Probe of Dark Matter-Nucleon Interactions from Ultra-high Energy Cosmic Ray Acceleration</a><span class="id">[2512.18093]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It has been suggested that the density of dark matter (DM) halo can be highly enhanced around supermassive black holes at the centers of massive galaxies. If real, these DM \emph{spikes} would offer new opportunities to probe the properties of DM. In this work, we point out that DM spikes can significantly impact the composition and survivability of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays accelerated near supermassive black holes. A large DM-nucleon cross section would fragment heavy nuclei into lighter elements and prevent them from attaining the energies observed at Earth. While the origin of cosmic rays remains a mystery, we show that if the highest-energy cosmic rays on Earth come from sources like NGC 1068, then cross sections of size $\sigma_{\chi p} \leq 10^{-33} \left( \frac{m_\chi}{\mathrm{GeV}}\right)\;\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ would be excluded by cosmic ray data. These bounds can be competitive with other existing probes and rule out new parameter space in the DM mass region $m_\chi\in [3\;\mathrm{MeV}, 30\;\mathrm{MeV}]$. While the uncertainties on the acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays prevent us from setting robust limits, our study highlights an important connection between DM spikes and cosmic ray physics that is complementary to existing cosmological and direct detection constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22914" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exact black holes and black branes with bumpy horizons supported by superfluid pions</a><span class="id">[2601.22914]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present exact solutions of the Einstein-$SU(2)$ non-linear sigma model in $3+1$ spacetime dimensions, describing bumpy black holes and black branes. Using an Ansatz for superfluid pion multi-vortices, the matter sector reduces to a first-order BPS system, while the Einstein equations reduce to a Liouville equation with a smooth source governing the horizon deformation. These solutions describe horizons of different constant curvatures, with nontrivial bumpy geometries protected by an integer topological invariant, namely the vorticity, which also controls the number of bumps and the black hole thermodynamics. Remarkably, such horizons arise in a minimal and physically motivated matter model, without invoking exotic fields or modified gravity. The physical implications of these results in holography and astrophysics are briefly described.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the stability of viscous Riemann ellipsoids</a><span class="id">[2602.05658]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The present study investigates the linear stability of Riemann ellipsoids in both the inviscid limit and in the presence of weak viscosity. In the inviscid regime, we derive a generalised Poincare equation governing small fluid oscillations and construct a family of polynomial solutions that extends the classical results of Cartan to flows with a uniform strain field. This formulation provides an analytic dispersion relation for three-dimensional ellipsoidal disturbances and remains computationally efficient at arbitrary harmonic degree, in contrast to the virial tensor method or to short-wavelength (WKB) approximations. The viscous effects are incorporated through a boundary-layer analysis based on Prandtls theory, leading to first-order viscous corrections to the inviscid spectrum and allowing a systematic investigation of viscosity-driven instabilities. Stability diagrams are presented over the space of admissible Riemann ellipsoids, illustrating the roles of rotation, internal strain, and diffusion, with implications for rotating shear flows in geophysical and astrophysical contexts.</p></div></details></article></body>
