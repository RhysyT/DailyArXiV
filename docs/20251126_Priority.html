Yet the properties of dust, particularly the grain size distribution, in these systems remain uncertain. We present Band 6 observations of WR 112 by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope (ALMA), which are the first millimeter observations of a WC binary system capable of resolving its dust emission. By combining ALMA observations with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images, we were able to analyze the spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) of WR 112. We found that the SEDs are consistent with emissions from hydrogen-poor amorphous carbon grains. Notably, our results also suggest that the majority of grains in the system have radii below one micrometer, and the extended dust structures are dominated by nanometer-sized grains. Among four parameterizations of the grain radius distribution that we tested, a bimodal distribution, with abundant nanometer-sized grains and a secondary population of 0.1-micron grains, best reproduces the observed SED. This bimodal distribution helps to reconcile the previously conflicting grain size estimates reported for WR 112 and for other WC systems. We hypothesize that dust destruction mechanisms such as radiative torque disruption and radiative-driven sublimation are responsible for driving the system to the bimodal grain size distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estimating the masses of Narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies using damped random walk method</a><span class="id">[2511.19587]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), commonly associated with rapidly accreting, relatively low-mass black holes ($10^6$ - $10^8 M_\odot$) hosted in spiral galaxies. Although typically considered to have high Eddington ratios, recent observations, particularly of $\gamma$-ray-emitting NLSy1s, have raised questions about their true black hole masses, with some estimates approaching those of Broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLSy1) systems. In this work, we present the recalibrated mass estimations for a large sample of NLSy1s galaxies with z $&lt;0.8$. We apply the damped random walk (DRW) formalism to a comparison set of 1,141 NLSy1 and 1,143 BLSy1 galaxies, matched in redshift and bolometric luminosity using SDSS DR17 spectroscopy. Our analysis employs a multivariate calibration that incorporates both the Eddington ratio and the rest-frame wavelength to refine the mass estimates. We obtain median DRW-based black hole masses of $\text{log}(M_{\text{BH}}^{\text{DRW}}/M_\odot) = 6.25 \pm 0.65$ for NLSy1s and $7.07 \pm 0.67$ for BLSy1s, in agreement with their respective virial mass distributions. Furthermore, we identify strong inverse trends between the variability amplitude and both optical luminosity and FeII emission strength, consistent with a scenario where higher accretion rates suppress long-term optical variability. These findings reinforce the view that NLSy1s harbor smaller black holes and highlight the value of variability-based approaches in tracing AGN accretion properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mind the Information Gap: Unveiling Detailed Morphologies of z 0.5-1.0 Galaxies with SLACS Strong Lenses and Data-Driven Analysis</a><span class="id">[2511.19595]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new state-of-the-art lens models for strong gravitational lensing systems from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey, developed within a Bayesian framework that employs high-dimensional (pixellated), data-driven priors for the background source, foreground lens light, and point-spread function (PSF). Unlike conventional methods, our approach delivers high-resolution reconstructions of all major physical components of the lensing system and substantially reduces model-data residuals compared to previous work. For the majority of 30 lensing systems analyzed, we also provide posterior samples capturing the full uncertainty of each physical model parameter. The reconstructions of the background sources reveal high significance morphological structures as small as 200 parsecs in galaxies at redshifts of z 0.5-1.0, demonstrating the power of strong lensing and the analysis method to be used as a cosmic telescope to study the high redshift universe. This study marks the first application of data-driven generative priors to modeling real strong-lensing data and establishes a new benchmark for strong lensing precision modeling in the era of large-scale imaging surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards Reconciling Reionization with JWST: The Role of Bright Galaxies and Strong Feedback</a><span class="id">[2511.19600]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The elevated UV luminosity functions (UVLF) from recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have challenged the viability of existing theoretical models. To address this, we use a semi-analytical framework – which couples a physically motivated source model derived from radiative-transfer hydrodynamic simulations of reionization with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler – to perform a joint calibration to JWST galaxy surveys (UVLF, $\phi_{\rm UV}$ and UV luminosity density, $\rho_{\rm UV}$) and reionization-era observables (ionizing emissivity, $\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$, neutral hydrogen fraction, $x_{\rm HI}$, and Thomson optical depth, $\tau$). We find that models with weak feedback and a higher contribution from faint galaxies reproduce the reionization observables but struggle to match the elevated JWST UVLF at $z &gt; 9$. In contrast, models with stronger feedback (i.e., rapid redshift evolution) and a higher contribution from bright galaxies successfully reproduce JWST UVLF at $z \geq 10$, but over-estimate the bright end at $z &lt; 9$. The strong-feedback model constrained by JWST UVLF predicts a more gradual and extended reionization history, as opposed to the sudden reionization seen in the weak-feedback models. This extended nature of reionization ($z\sim 16$ - $6$) yields an optical depth consistent (at 2-$\sigma$) with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraint, thereby alleviating the photon-budget crisis. In both scenarios, reionization is complete by $z \sim 6$, consistent with current data. Our analysis highlights the importance of accurately modeling feedback and ionizing emissivities from different source populations during the first billion years after the Big Bang.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing AGN-Galaxy Co-Evolution with UV Line-Selected Obscured AGN</a><span class="id">[2511.19602]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding black hole-galaxy co-evolution and the role of AGN feedback requires complete AGN samples, including heavily obscured systems. In this work, we present the first UV line-selected ([Nev]3426 and CIV1549) sample of obscured AGN with full X-ray-to-radio coverage, assembled by combining data from the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey, the COSMOS2020 catalogue, IR photometry from XID+, and radio observations from the VLA and MIGHTEE surveys. Using CIGALE to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we analyse 184 obscured AGN at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.2 and 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.1, enabling detailed measurements of AGN and host galaxy properties, and direct comparison with SIMBA hydrodynamical simulations. We find that X-ray and radio data are essential for accurate SED fits, with the radio band proving critical when X-ray detections are missing or in cases of poor IR coverage. Comparisons with matched non-active galaxies and simulations suggest that the [NeV]-selected sources are in a pre-quenching stage, while the CIV-selected ones are likely quenched by AGN activity. Our results indicate that [NeV] and CIV selections target galaxies in a transient phase of their co-evolution, characterised by intense, obscured accretion, and pave the way for future extensions with upcoming large area high-z spectroscopic surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In medio stat virtus: enrichment history in poor galaxy clusters</a><span class="id">[2511.19603]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The enrichment history of galaxy clusters and groups remains far from being fully understood. Recent measurements in massive clusters have revealed remarkably flat iron abundance profiles out to the outskirts, suggesting that similar enrichment processes have occurred for all systems. In contrast, abundance profiles in galaxy groups have sometimes been measured to decline with radius, challenging our understanding of the physical processes at these scales. In this paper, we present a pilot study aimed at accurately measuring the iron abundance profiles of MKW3s, A2589, and Hydra A, three poor clusters with total masses of $M_{500} \simeq 2.0-2.5 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$, intermediate between the scales of galaxy groups and massive clusters. Using XMM-Newton to obtain nearly complete azimuthal coverage of the outer regions of these systems, we show that abundance measurements in the outskirts are more likely to be limited by systematics than by statistical errors. In particular, inaccurate modelling of the soft X-ray background can significantly bias metallicity estimates in regions where the cluster emission is faint. Once these systematics are properly accounted for, the abundance profiles of all three clusters appear to be flat at $Z \sim 0.3$ Z$_{\odot}$, in agreement with values observed in massive clusters. Using available stellar mass estimates, we also computed their iron yields, thereby beginning to probe a largely unexplored mass range. We find $Y_{Fe,500} = 2.68\pm0.34$, $2.54\pm0.64$, and $7.51\pm1.47$ Z$_{\odot}$ for MKW3s, A2589, and Hydra A, respectively, spanning the transition regime between galaxy groups and massive clusters. Future observations of systems with temperatures of $2-4$ keV will be essential to further populate this intermediate-mass regime and to draw firmer conclusions on the chemical enrichment history of galaxy systems across the full mass scale.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19608" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metal enrichment of galaxies in a massive node of the Cosmic Web at $z \sim 3$</a><span class="id">[2511.19608]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the mass-metallicity relation for star-forming galaxies in the MUSE Quasar Nebula 01 (MQN01) field, a massive cosmic web node at $z \sim 3.245$, hosting one of the largest overdensities of galaxies and AGNs found so far at $z &gt; 3$. Through James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) spectra and images from JWST and Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we identify a sample of 9 star-forming galaxies in the MQN01 field with detection of nebular emission lines ($\rm H\beta$, [OIII], $\rm H\alpha$, [NII]), covering the mass range of $\rm 10^{7.5}M_\odot - 10^{10.5}M_\odot$. We present the relations of the emission-line flux ratios versus stellar mass for the sample and derive the gas-phase metallicity based on the strong line diagnostics of [OIII]$\lambda5008$/$\rm H\beta$ and [NII]$\lambda6585$/$\rm H\alpha$. Compared to the typical, field galaxies at similar redshifts, MQN01 galaxies show relatively higher [NII]$\lambda6585$/$\rm H\alpha$ and lower [OIII]$\lambda5008$/$\rm H\beta$ at the same stellar mass, which implies a higher metallicity by about $0.25\pm 0.07$ dex with respect to the field mass-metallicity relation. These differences are decreased considering the “Fundamental Metallicity Relation”, i.e. if the galaxies' Star Formation Rates (SFR) are also taken into account. We argue that these results are consistent with a scenario in which galaxies in overdense regions assemble their stellar mass more efficiently (or, equivalently, start forming at earlier epochs) compared to field galaxies at similar redshifts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond the Monsters: A More Complete Census of Black Hole Activity at Cosmic Dawn</a><span class="id">[2511.19609]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST has revealed an abundance of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts ($z &gt; 3$), pushing the limits of black hole (BH) science in the early Universe. Results have claimed that these BHs are significantly more massive than expected from the BH mass-host galaxy stellar mass relation derived from the local Universe. We present a comprehensive census of the BH populations in the early Universe through a detailed stacking analysis of galaxy populations, binned by luminosity and redshift, using JWST spectroscopy from the CEERS, JADES, RUBIES, and GLASS extragalactic deep field surveys. Broad H$\alpha$ detections in $31\%$ of the stacked spectra (5/16 bins) imply median BH masses of $10^{5.21} - 10^{6.13}~ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ and the stacked SEDs of these bins indicate median stellar masses of $10^{7.84} - 10^{8.56} ~\rm{M_{\odot}}$. This suggests that the median galaxy hosts a BH that is at most a factor of 10 times over-massive compared to its host galaxy and lies closer to the locally derived $M_{BH}-M_*$ relation. We investigate the seeding properties of the inferred BHs and find that they can be well-explained by a light stellar remnant seed undergoing moderate Eddington accretion. Our results indicate that individual detections of AGN are more likely to sample the upper envelope of the $M_{BH}-M_*$ distribution, while stacking on “normal&quot; galaxies and searching for AGN signatures can overcome the selection bias of individual detections.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SE3D: Testing the recovery of stellar population, dust and structural properties on mock-observed toy model and simulated galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.19614]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The translation from direct observables to physical properties of galaxies is a key step in reconstructing their evolutionary histories. Variations in stellar populations and star-dust geometry can induce inhomogeneous mass-to-light ratios, complicating this process. SE3D is a novel modelling framework, built around a radiative transfer emulator, aimed at tackling this problem. In this paper, we test the ability of SE3D to recover known intrinsic properties of toy model and TNG50 simulated galaxies from mock observations of their multi-wavelength photometric and structural properties. We find an encouraging performance for several key characteristics, including the bulk stellar mass, dust mass and SFR, as well as their respective radial extents. We point out limitations, and investigate the impact of various sources of model mismatch. Among them, mismatch in the shapes of star formation histories contributes most, with radial and azimuthal structure and stellar metallicity distributions playing a progressively more minor role. We also analyse the evolution from z=2 to z=0 of resolved stellar and dust properties of TNG galaxies, as measured intrinsically and expressed in their distribution across UVJ and IRX-$\beta$ diagnostic diagrams. We test different methods to assign dust to the simulation, and find a persistent lack of Mdust/Mstar evolution and a more limited dynamic range across the diagnostic diagrams compared to observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$\nabla\cdot{B}=0$ versus the Universe</a><span class="id">[2511.19615]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We implement the constrained divergence cleaning algorithm of \citet{Tricco2016} into the cosmological smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) code OpenGadget3. Our implementation modifies the governing equations of SPMHD to allow the constrained hyperbolic/parabolic cleaning scheme to be applied consistently in an expanding cosmological framework. This ensures that divergence errors in the magnetic field are actively propagated away and damped, rather than merely being advected with the flow or partially controlled by source terms. To validate our implementation, we perform a series of standard test problems, including the advection of divergence errors, the Orszag-Tang vortex, the Brio-Wu shock tube, and magnetised Zeldovich pancakes. These tests confirm that our scheme successfully reduces divergence errors while preserving the correct physical evolution of the system. We then apply the method to a fully cosmological simulation of a massive galaxy cluster, comparing the results to those obtained using the previously employed Powell eight-wave divergence preserving scheme. We find that the overall density structure of the cluster is largely unaffected by the choice of divergence cleaning method, and the magnetic field geometry and strengths in the cluster core remain similar. However, in the cluster outskirts ($r \approx$ 1-3 $h^{-1}$ Mpc), the magnetic field is amplified by a factor of $\sim$ 5 compared to the Powell-only approach. Moreover, the constrained divergence cleaning algorithm reduces the divergence error by 2-3 orders of magnitude throughout the cluster volume, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining the solenoidal condition of the magnetic field in large-scale cosmological simulations. Our results suggest that accurate divergence control is essential for modeling magnetic field amplification in low-density regions of galaxy clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of the Cosmological 21 cm Signal in Auto-correlation at z   1 with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment</a><span class="id">[2511.19620]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first detection of the cosmological 21 cm intensity mapping signal in auto-correlation at z   1 with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). Using 94 nights of observation, we have measured the 21 cm auto-power spectrum over a frequency range from 608.2 MHz to 707.8 MHz (z = 1.34 to 1.01) at 0.4 h Mpc^-1 &lt; k &lt; 1.5 h Mpc^-1, with a detection significance of 12.5 sigma. Our analysis employs significant improvements to the CHIME data processing pipeline compared to previous work, including novel radio frequency interference (RFI) detection and masking algorithms, achromatic beamforming techniques, and foreground filtering before time averaging to minimize spectral leakage. We establish the robustness and reliability of our detection through a comprehensive suite of validation tests. We also measure the 21 cm signal in two independent sub-bands centered at z   1.08 and z   1.24 with detection significance of 8.7 sigma and 9.2 sigma, respectively. We briefly discuss the theoretical interpretation of these measurements in terms of a power spectrum model, deferring the details to a companion paper. This auto-power spectrum detection demonstrates CHIME's capability to probe large-scale structure through 21 cm intensity mapping without reliance on external galaxy surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19623" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SE3D: Building a radiative transfer emulator to fit panchromatic resolved galaxy observations with 3D models of dust and stars</a><span class="id">[2511.19623]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a framework for analysing panchromatic and spatially resolved galaxy observations, dubbed SE3D. SE3D simultaneously and self-consistently models a galaxy's spectral energy distribution and its spectral distributions of global structural parameters: the wavelength-dependent galaxy size, light profile and projected axis ratio. To this end, it employs a machine learning emulator trained on a large library of toy model galaxies processed with 3D dust radiative transfer and mock-observed under a range of viewing angles. The toy models vary in their stellar and dust geometries, and include radial stellar population gradients. The computationally efficient machine learning emulator uses a Bayesian neural network architecture, and reproduces the spectral distributions at an accuracy of   0.05 dex or less across the dynamic range of input parameters, and across the rest-frame UVJ colour space spanned by observed galaxies. We carry out a sensitivity analysis demonstrating that the emulator has successfully learned the intricate mappings between galaxy physical properties and direct observables (fluxes, colours, sizes, size ratios between different wavebands, ...). We further discuss the physical conditions giving rise to a range of total-to-selective attenuation ratios, Rv, with among them most prominently the projected dust surface mass density.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metal-loaded outflows in sub-Milky Way galaxies in the CIELO simulations</a><span class="id">[2511.19630]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernova (SN) feedback-driven galactic outflows are a key physical process that contributes to the baryon cycle by regulating the star formation activity, reducing the amount of metals in low-mass galaxies and enriching the circumgalactic (CGM) and intergalactic media (IGM). We aim to understand the chemical loop of sub-Milky Way (MW) galaxies and their nearby regions. We studied 15 simulated central sub-MW galaxies (M* &lt;= 10^10 Msun) and intermediate-mass galaxies (M* \sim 10^10 Msun) from the CIELO-P7 high-resolution simulations. We followed the evolution of the progenitor galaxies, their properties and the characteristics of the outflows within the redshift range z = [0, 7]. We used two dynamically-motivated outflow definitions, unbound outflows and expelled mass rates, to quantify the impact of SN feedback. At z \sim 0, sub-MW galaxies have a larger fraction of their current oxygen mass in the gas phase but have expelled a greater portion beyond the virial radius, compared to their higher-mass counterparts. Galaxies with M* &lt;\sim 10^9 Msun have 10-40 per cent of their total oxygen mass within R200 in the CGM, and an equivalent to 10-60 per cent expelled into the IGM. In contrast, more massive galaxies have most of the oxygen mass locked by the stellar populations. The CGM of low-mass galaxies predominantly contains oxygen low-temperature gas, acting as a metal reservoir. We find that the outflows are more oxygen-rich for sub-MW galaxies, Zout/ZISM \sim 1.5, than for higher-mass galaxies, Zout/ZISM &lt;= 0.5, particularly for z &lt; 2. Mass-loading factors of eta_out \sim 0 - 6 are detected in agreement with observations (abridged).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19632" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disc growth and vertical heating of lenticular galaxies in the Fornax cluster</a><span class="id">[2511.19632]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed analysis of the vertical and radial structure of mono-age stellar populations in three edge-on lenticular galaxies (FCC 153, FCC 170, and FCC 177) in the Fornax cluster, using deep MUSE observations. By measuring the half-mass radius (R$_{50}$) and half-mass height (z$_{50}$) across 1 Gyr-wide age bins, we trace the spatial evolution of stellar populations over cosmic time. All galaxies exhibit a remarkably constant disc thickness for all stars younger than  6 Gyr, suggesting minimal secular heating and limited impact from environmental processes such as tidal shocking or harassment. Evidence of past mergers (8-10 Gyr ago) is found in the increase of z$_{50}$ for older populations. We find that accreted (metal-poor) stars have been deposited in quite thick configurations, but that the interactions only moderately thickened pre-existing stars in the galaxies, and only caused mild flaring in the outer regions of the discs. The radial structure of the discs varies across galaxies, but in all cases we find that the radial extent of mono-age populations remains constant or grows over the past 8 Gyr. This leads us to argue that within the radial range we consider, strangulation, rather than ram-pressure stripping, is the dominant quenching mechanism in those galaxies. Our results highlight the usefulness of analysing the structure of mono-age population to uncover the mechanisms driving galaxy evolution, and we anticipate broader insights from the GECKOS survey, studying 36 nearby edge-on disc galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing ionized gas kinematics in Lyman-Break Analogs.

These compact, strongly star-forming galaxies serve as local analogs of high-redshift starbursts. Using high-resolution VLT/X-shooter spectra, we model the optical emission-line profiles, including [O III] 4959,5007 and the Balmer lines, with multi-component Gaussian fits. All galaxies show complex kinematics that require both narrow (sigma &lt; 90 km/s) and broad (sigma &gt; 90 km/s) components. The narrow components trace highly turbulent gas associated with massive star-forming regions, while the broad components indicate ionized outflows driven by stellar winds and supernova feedback, with outflow velocities of about 200-500 km/s. Estimated mass outflow rates range from 0.20 to 2.72 solar masses per year, with mass-loading factors between 0.03 and 0.81. We find a mild increase in mass loading toward lower stellar masses, as well as a strong correlation between mass loading and star-formation-rate surface density, suggesting that more compact starbursts drive more powerful outflows. These trends are consistent with those seen in star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts. Our results highlight the importance of local UV-compact starbursts for understanding feedback processes in low-mass, rapidly star-forming galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19692" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internal kinematics of dwarf galaxies orbitally moving in ultralight dark matter</a><span class="id">[2511.19692]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For dwarf galaxies modeled as deformed Plummer spheres and orbitally moving in ultralight dark matter halo of the Milky Way, the torque induced by the dynamical friction force is determined.

We find that the isomer is about eight times less abundant than the cyclic one. We also report a detailed line-by-line study of cyclopropenethione (c-H$_2$C$_3$S) to compare the abundance of the O and S isomers. We find that cyclic O-isomers are more abundant than cyclic S-isomers; however, the opposite trend is found for the most stable linear isomers, with l-H$_2$C$_3$S being more than one order of magnitude more abundant than l-H$_2$C$_3$O. A comprehensive theoretical chemical analysis shows that the abundances of the H$_2$C$_3$O and H$_2$C$_3$S isomers are controlled by different formation pathways. In particular, while l-H$_2$C$_3$O is potentially produced by dissociative electron recombination reactions, ion-neutral chemistry is more effective at producing l-H$_2$C$_3$S and c-H$_2$C$_3$S.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symbiotic Stars (Including T Corona Borealis) Are Not Immediate Progenitors of Normal Type Ia Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2511.19948]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A popular solution to the Type Ia supernova (SNIa) progenitor problem is that the immediate progenitors are symbiotic star systems.

Comparisons of SLAM predicted [Fe/H] values between two components of M+M dwarfs wide binaries show no bias but with a scatter of 0.11 dex. Further comparisons with two other works, which also calibrated the [Fe/H] of M dwarfs by using the F/G/K companions, reveal biases of -0.06$\pm$0.16 dex and 0.02$\pm$0.14 dex, respectively. The SLAM-derived effective temperatures agree well with the temperature which is calibrated by using interferometric angular diameters (bias: -27$\pm$92 K) and those of the LAMOST (bias: -34$\pm$65 K), but are systematically lower than those from an empirical relationship between the color index and $T_{\rm eff}$ by 146$\pm$45 K.

At fixed halo mass, we find a clear positive correlation between stellar mass and halo concentration, particularly in low-mass haloes between $10^{11}$ and $10^{12}\,\rm M_\odot$, where all halo properties are computed from the corresponding dark-matter-only simulation. Two scenarios have been proposed to explain this trend: the earlier formation of higher-concentration haloes allows more time for star formation, or the deeper gravitational potential wells of higher-concentration haloes enhance baryon retention. To distinguish between them, we examine correlations between halo concentration, stellar mass, stellar age, and stellar metallicity. While, at fixed halo mass, halo concentration correlates with stellar age, stellar age itself shows only a weak correlation with stellar mass, indicating that early formation alone cannot account for the concentration-dependence in the scatter of the SMHM relation. In contrast, both stellar metallicity and halo concentration exhibit correlations with stellar mass. The connection between halo concentration and stellar metallicity persists even when simultaneously controlling for both halo mass and stellar mass. These results support the scenario in which the deeper gravitational potentials in higher-concentration haloes suppress feedback-driven outflows, thereby enhancing both baryon and metal retention.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for the potential electromagnetic counterparts of neutrino events in SDSS galaxies at z&lt;0.1</a><span class="id">[2511.20184]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Identification of electromagnetic emission in coincidence with high-energy neutrinos is fundamentally important for multimessenger astronomy. Such observations are essential for constraining source localization, determining the source type, and understanding emission mechanisms. Typically, they require following up a neutrino alert (IceCube issues two alert streams: Gold, with at least 50 percent probability of astrophysical origin, and Bronze, with at least 30 percent probability) with an electromagnetic facility, primarily in X-ray and gamma-ray bands. Another approach involves electromagnetic monitoring of hot spots in the IceCube skymap, i.e., positions exceeding the instrument sensitivity. An alternative method consists in performing correlation analysis across available neutrino events and source catalogs. We searched for spatial coincidence between galaxies from SDSS and high-energy neutrino events. The analysis includes IceCube Gold alerts and neutrino-electromagnetic coincidence events from AMON (Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network), identified through the end of September 2025. We examined galaxies from the morphological catalog at redshifts 0.02 to 0.1, which contains 315,776 SDSS DR9 objects with absolute stellar magnitudes in the range from -24 to -13 in the r band. Among 59 IceCube Gold alerts, we found three with only one galaxy (SDSS J231231.52+033415.1) within the 50 percent containment radius. Among 24 neutrino-electromagnetic coincidence events, three more contain only one galaxy (SDSS J220711.14+122535.9) within the same radius. These six galaxies represent the most promising candidates for potential host galaxies of neutrino sources.

Recent studies, however, indicate that galaxy clusters occupy a parallel but offset relation, raising questions about the universality of the BTFR. Here, we demonstrate that the offset between galaxies and clusters arises naturally from cosmic time evolution. Using the evolving BTFR derived from the Nexus Paradigm of quantum gravity, we show that the normalization of the relation evolves as an exponential function of cosmic time., while the slope remains fixed at $\sim 4$. This provides a simple and predictive framework in which both galaxies and clusters obey the same universal scaling law, with their apparent offset reflecting their different formation epochs. Our results unify mass- velocity scaling across five orders of magnitude in baryonic mass, offering new insights into cosmic structure formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulating the Stellar Bycatch: Constraining the Prevalence of Extraterrestrial Transmitters within Radio SETI Surveys</a><span class="id">[2511.20231]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Searches for radio technosignatures place constraints on the prevalence of extraterrestrial transmitters in our Galaxy and beyond. It is important to account for the complete stellar population captured within a radio telescope's field of view, or stellar 'bycatch'. In recent years, catalogues from ESA's Gaia mission have enabled SETI surveys to place tighter limits on extraterrestrial transmitter statistics. However, Gaia remains restricted by magnitude limits, astrometric uncertainty at large distances, and confusion in crowded regions. To address these limitations, we investigate the use of the Besançon Galactic Model to simulate the statistical underlying stellar population to derive more realistic constraints on the occurrence of extraterrestrial transmitters. We apply this method to Breakthrough Listen's Enriquez/Price survey, modelling 6,182,364 stellar objects within 1229 individual pointings and extending the search out to distances $\leq 25$kpc. We place limits on the prevalence of high duty cycle transmitters within 2.5kpc, suggesting $\leq (0.000995 \pm 0.000002)\%$ of stellar systems contain such a transmitter (for near-zero drift rates and EIRP$_{\mathrm{min}} \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{16}$W). In support of broader adoption, we provide a simple calculator tool that enables other researchers to incorporate this approach into their own SETI analyses. Our results enable a more complete statistical estimation of the number and stellar type of systems probed, thereby strengthening constraints on technosignature prevalence and guiding the analysis of future SETI efforts. We also conclude that SETI surveys are, in fact, much less biased by anthropocentric assumptions than is often suggested.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for Radio Pulsations from Neutron Star Candidates in Detached Binaries</a><span class="id">[2511.20242]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent optical astrometric and spectroscopic surveys have identified numerous neutron star (NS) candidates in non-accreting detached binary systems, but their compact-object nature remains unconfirmed. In this work, we present targeted radio observations of 31 such candidates using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, and the Shanghai TianMa Radio Telescope. Over a total of 46.65 hours of observing time, we detected neither periodic nor single-pulse radio emissions. These nondetections place stringent upper limits on the flux densities of any potential radio signals, reaching  4 $\mu$Jy for periodic emission and  10 mJy for single pulses with FAST. Since our observations are highly sensitive and the flux density upper limits are well below the median fluxes of known Galactic pulsars, this suggests that geometric beaming is the most likely explanation for the non-detections if these objects are indeed pulsars. Alternatively, the NSs may be sufficiently old ($\gtrsim$ 10 Gyr) and have become intrinsically radio-quiet. In this case, our findings highlight the inherent difficulty of confirming NSs in such old detached binary systems through radio pulsation searches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Projection Effects in Barred Galaxies Causing Wrong Interpretation of Radial Flows</a><span class="id">[2511.20267]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy disks in rotation are sometimes the site of radial flows, especially in their gas component. It is important to estimate the outflows, due to AGN or supernovae feedback, or inflows due to bar gravity torques. However, these radial flows may be confused with non-circular motions, which are quite frequent in the center of galaxy disks. We use a simulated giant, barred spiral galaxy from the GalMer database to study the non-circular motions induced by the bar. Our goal is to identify the spurious radial flows that kinematics modeling algorithms can detect, assuming circular orbits for the gas. Using mock data of a strongly barred galaxy, we quantify the radial velocities computed by the 3D-Barolo algorithm for different disk inclinations and several bar orientations in the plane of the sky: along the major and minor kinematic axes and at 45° from them. Our results show that projection effects cause kinematics modeling algorithms to confuse the radial component of velocity due to elliptical orbits with significant radial flows with mean values up to 84 km.s$^{-1}$, within the bar region. The computed rotation curve is also wrongly estimated inside the bar region, by as much as 150 km.s$^{-1}$ for the highest inclination.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tails of Gravity: Persistence of Star Formation in the CMZ Environment</a><span class="id">[2511.20300]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We characterize star-forming gas in six molecular clouds (Sgr B1-off, Sgr B2, Sgr C, the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds, and the Brick) in the Galactic central molecular zone (CMZ), and compare their star-forming activities with those in molecular clouds outside the CMZ. Using multi-band continuum observations taken from ${\it Planck}$, ${\it Herschel}$, JCMT/SCUBA-2, and CSO/SHARC2, we derived 8.5&quot; resolution column density maps for the CMZ clouds and evaluated the column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs). With the archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm dust continuum data, we further evaluated the mass of the most massive cores ($M_{\rm core}^{\rm ma x}$). We find that the N-PDFs of four of the selected CMZ clouds are well described by a piecewise log-normal + power-law function, while the N-PDFs of the remaining two can be approximated by log-normal functions. In the first four targets, the masses in the power-law component ($M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$), $M_{\rm core}^{\rm max}$, and star formation rate (SFR) are correlated. These correlations are very similar to those derived from low-mass clouds in the Solar neighborhood and massive star-forming regions on the Galactic disk. These findings lead to our key hypotheses: (1) In the extreme environment of the CMZ, the power-law component in the N-PDF also represents self-gravitationally bound gas structures, and (2) evolution and star-forming activities of self-gravitationally bound gas structures may be self-regulated, insensitive to the exterior environment on $\gtrsim$5-10 pc scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Spectral Coverage on Parameter recovery in Blazar Modeling</a><span class="id">[2511.20336]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the impact of spectral coverage on parameter recovery is critical for accurate interpretation of blazar spectra. In this study, we examine how the data coverage influences the reliability of parameter estimation within the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) framework. Using OJ 287, TXS 0506+056, and Mrk 421 as representative of the low-, intermediate- and high synchrotron peak classes (LSP, ISP and HSP), respectively, we generate synthetic SEDs based on their best-fit models and perform 1,000 fits for each of the 21 observational configurations per source type. Our analysis quantifies the coverage probability for all model parameters, such has the magnetic field strength and the electron luminosity, and reveals that different blazar subclasses exhibit distinct sensitivities to spectral gaps. For LSPs, a minimal dataset comprising optical/UV, X-ray, and GeV $\gamma$-ray bands is sufficient for robust parameter inference. In contrast, ISPs and HSPs require broader spectral coverage to constrain the physical parameters. For ISP, we find that reliable parameter recovery can be achieved with two different minimal band combinations: \textit{(i)} X-ray, high energy $\gamma$-ray, and very high energy $\gamma$-ray data, or \textit{(ii)} optical/UV, X-ray, and high energy $\gamma$-ray data. For HSPs, the minimal configuration enabling reliable parameter recovery includes the optical/UV, X-ray, and very high energy $\gamma$-ray bands. We discuss the role of very high energy $\gamma$-ray observations, showing that they significantly enhance parameter recovery for HSPs. Our results provide practical guidelines for designing optimized multi-wavelength observation campaigns and for assessing the robustness of SSC model inferences under incomplete spectral coverage.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20414" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Hole merger rates in the first billion years in light of JWST data</a><span class="id">[2511.20414]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discoveries have unveiled an abundance of faint and massive Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts (z=4-9), that surpass by 10 to 100 times the extrapolated bolometric (Bol) and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions (LF) from previous AGN campaigns. The two main models that are put forward to explain these observations correspond to light seeds (150 Msol) accreting in episodes of super Eddington, and heavy seeds ($10^3$ - $10^5$ Msol) growing at the Eddington limit. Future gravitational observatories like the Laser Interferometer Satellite Antenna (LISA) will help disentangle these models by reporting the BH-BH merger events from mid to high redshifts. Aims. This work aims to report the predicted merger rates in the heavy seed scenario in light of recent JWST data. In our models we explore (i) instantaneous merging between BHs, (ii) delayed merging after a dynamical timescale, as well as extreme spin configurations (a=0.99, a=-0.99) to bracket BH mass growth. Methods. We use Delphi, a semi-analytical model that tracks baryonic physics over a hierarchical evolution of dark matter halos through cosmic time within the first billion years of the Universe. We calibrate this model for it to simultaneously reproduce galaxy and JWST-AGNs observables. Results. We show reasonable agreement with the Bolometric Luminosity function at z=6, where BHs must accrete 10-100 times more gas than in previous works calibrated to pre-JWST data. However, we underpredict (overpredict) the bright end $10^45.5$ erg s$^-1$ (all luminosity range) at z=7 (z=5) by 1-3.2 dex (0.22-1.6 dex). Regarding BH-BH merger events, the instantaneous (delayed) models predict a total of 28.06 (19.61) yr$^-1$ for BHs at z&gt;=5, which is within the range of merger rates reported in previous literature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estimating the triaxiality of massive clusters from 2D observables in MillenniumTNG with machine learning</a><span class="id">[2511.20429]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Properties of massive galaxy clusters, such as mass abundance and concentration, are sensitive to cosmology, making cluster statistics a powerful tool for cosmological studies.

We utilize the flagship hydrodynamical volume of the suite of cosmological-hydrodynamical MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations as our ground truth. Our model combines the feature extracting power of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the message passing power of a graph neural network (GNN) in a multi-modal, fusion network. Our model is able to extract 3D geometry information from 2D idealized cluster multi-wavelength images (soft X-ray, medium X-ray, hard X-ray and tSZ effect) and mathematical graph representations of 2D cluster member observables (line-of-sight radial velocities, 2D projected positions and V-band luminosities). Our network improves cluster geometry estimation in MTNG by $30\%$ compared to assuming spherical symmetry.

Neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) absorption lines can be used to probe the cold neutral medium (CNM) at high Galactic latitudes. Cold HI with a significant optical depth from the GASKAP-HI survey is found to be located predominantly if not exclusively within filamentary structures that can be identified as caustics with the Hessian operator. Most of these HI filaments (57%) are also observable in the far-infrared (FIR) and trace the orientation of magnetic field lines. Aims. We considered whether molecular hydrogen (H2) might also be preferentially associated with CNM filaments. Methods. We analyzed 241 H2 absorption lines against stars and determined whether the lines of sight intersected HI or FIR filaments. Using Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) H2 data in the velocity range -50 &lt; vLSR &lt; 50 km/s, we traced 65 additional H2 lines for filamentary HI and FIR structures in velocity and probed the H2 absorption for coincidences in position and velocity. Results. For 305 out of 306 positions, the lines of sight with H2 absorption intersect HI filaments. In 120 cases, there is also evidence for a correlation with dusty FIR filaments. All of the 65 available sight lines with known velocities intersect HI filaments. In 64 cases, the H2 velocities are consistent with HI filament velocities. For FIR filaments, an agreement is found for only 13 out of 14 H2 absorption lines. Conclusions. For the majority of H2 absorption lines, there is evidence that H2 is associated with cold HI filaments. Evidence of an association with FIR filaments is less compelling. Confusion along the line of sight limits the detectability of FIR filaments. For a comparable degree of UV excitation in the disk and lower Galactic halo, the formation rate of H2 appears to be enhanced in HI filaments with increased CNM densities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of new N-emitters over a wide redshift range</a><span class="id">[2511.20484]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST observations have revealed rare galaxies with UV spectra exhibiting intense lines of nitrogen, indicative of super-solar N/O abundances at low metallicity.

Using public JWST NIRSpec data, we have identified 45 N-emitters with robust NIII] or NIV] detections, including 4 previously known objects. We find N-emitters from redshift $z\sim 3-11$ among a broad diversity of galaxies, in terms of morphology, UV magnitude, stellar mass, SFR, metallicity, and rest-optical line strengths. The UV nitrogen lines show typical equivalent widths between $\sim 5-50$ Å. Carbon lines are generally fainter than the N lines. Using strong line calibrations established at high-redshift, we find metallicities $12+log(O/H)\sim 7.15-8.5$, including thus also high metallicities. The H$\beta$ equivalent width of N-emitters varies strongly, and sources with low EWs show clear signs of a Balmer break, indicative of composite stellar populations combining both young (&lt; 10 Myr) stars responsible of the UV emission lines and an older population contributing to the rest-optical spectrum. Supersolar N/O ratios are found in all N-emitters. C/O abundances are comparable to those of galaxies at the same metallicity, and all N-emitters show high N/C ratios or lower limits ($\log(N/C) &gt; 0.5$), independently of metallicity. The observed abundance ratios are compatible with ejecta from H-burning and do not show signs of Carbon enhancements, even at higher metallicities. Finally, we find that the fraction of N-emitters increases with redshift, and we quantify this evolution. Our study increases the sample of known N-emitters by a factor $\sim 3$, reveals a diversity of properties among N-emitters, and provides new constraints on their nature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20542" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">H II regions and supernova remnants associated with molecular clouds: A pilot study with the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey</a><span class="id">[2511.20542]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive stars (mass beyond 8 solMass) release vast amounts of energy into the interstellar medium through their stellar winds, photoionising radiation and supernova explosions.

This pilot study combines 1.3 GHz continuum data from the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS) with 13CO (2-1) data from the Structure, Excitation, and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic Interstellar Medium (SEDIGISM) survey to identify and examine molecular clouds associated with H II regions and supernovae remnants (SNRs). We focus on their physical properties and massive star formation potential. We identify 268 molecular clouds from the SEDIGISM tile covering the Galactic plane region between 341 and 343 longitude deg and latitude deg equal to or less 0.5, of which 90 clouds (34 per cent) are associated with SMGPS extended sources. Compared to unassociated clouds, we find that associated clouds exhibit significantly higher mean mass (9600 solMass vs. 2500 solMass ) and average gas surface density (104 solMass / pc^2 vs. 67 solMass / pc^2 ), and slightly elevated but comparable virial parameters. We also find that the size-linewidth scaling relation is steeper for associated clouds compared to unassociated clouds. In addition, radio luminosity shows a positive correlation with total complex mass, and the ratio L_radio/L_complex increases with source size, consistent with an evolutionary sequence where expanding H II regions progressively disrupt their natal molecular environment. These findings suggest an enhanced dynamical activity for the associated clouds and support the hypothesis that feedback from massive stars influences molecular cloud properties and may trigger star formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20566" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The origin of B-type runaway stars based on kinematics</a><span class="id">[2511.20566]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Runaway stars depart their birthplaces with high peculiar velocities.

We then derived atmospheric parameters for each star using the Stellar Label Machine (SLAM), which is trained on TLUSTY synthetic spectra computed under the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) assumption. Using the derived atmospheric parameters as input, we estimated stellar masses and ages with a machine learning model trained on PARSEC evolutionary tracks. We finally performed orbital traceback with GALPY to analyze their origins.

Starting from the full angle-dependent transfer equation, we generalize absorption and emission coefficients to an arbitrary number of lines, derive a modified Fokker-Planck expansion of the frequency-redistribution COLT Monte Carlo radiative transfer code and find excellent agreement with the analytic predictions across a wide range of line separations, optical depths, and damping parameters, establishing our solutions as stringent validation benchmarks. For concrete applications related to the Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen, we examine how fine-structure splitting and deuterium injection modify the emergent spectra, internal radiation field, and radiative force multiplier. We show that these effects leave previous conclusions about Lyman-alpha feedback in the early universe essentially unchanged. Even when direct observational diagnostics are subtle, our framework provides novel analytic and numerical insights into coupled resonance-line transport and facilitates progress in general modeling of multi-line radiative transfer in diverse astrophysical settings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Periodic gravitational lensing by oscillating boson stars</a><span class="id">[2511.19606]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that oscillating (real-scalar) boson stars can act as strictly periodic gravitational lenses and generically host an \emph{oscillating radial caustic}.

Aims: Our aim is to investigate whether LISA can resolve WD binaries in GCs well enough in terms of sky location and distance that they can be distinguished from binaries in the MW disc. Methods: We used a sample of 20 of the most massive GCs around the MW and simulated LISA's sky location and distance measurement errors for WD binaries in these GCs using the software package GWToolbox. We did this in the context of a model of the LISA-detectable binaries in the MW from the population synthesis code SeBa. Results: We find that for five of the GCs in our sample, binaries in the GC could be easily distinguished from MW disc binaries using the sky location alone; for another five, binaries in the GCs could be distinguished using a combination of LISA's sky location and distance measurements; and for the final ten, binaries in the GCs could not be distinguished from overlapping MW disc binaries. The results depend strongly on the sky locations of the GCs, with GCs far away from the Galactic plane being easy to resolve, while GCs close to the Galactic centre overlap with many MW disc binaries. The most promising GC for finding a WD binary that could be resolved to that GC, based on sky location and GC mass, is 47 Tucanae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (III) The Mysteries of the Milky Way UV Background</a><span class="id">[2504.15382]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are hypothetical objects with nuclear density that would have formed during the quark-hadron transition and could make up most of the dark matter today. These objects have a mass greater than a few grams and are sub-micrometer in size. They would also help explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry and the similarity between visible and dark components of the universe, i.e. $\Omega_{\text{DM}} \sim \Omega_{\text{visible}}$. These composite objects behave as cold dark matter, interacting with ordinary matter and producing pervasive electromagnetic radiation. This work aims to calculate the FUV electromagnetic signature in a 1 kpc region surrounding the solar system, resulting from the interaction between antimatter AQNs and baryons. To this end, we use the high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the Milky Way, FIRE-2 Latter suite, to select solar system-like regions. From the simulated gas and dark matter distributions in these regions, we calculate the FUV background radiation generated by the AQN model. We find that the results are consistent with the FUV excess recently confirmed by the Alice spectrograph aboard New Horizons, which corroborated the FUV excess initially discovered by GALEX a decade ago. We also discuss the potential cosmological implications of our work, which suggest the existence of a new source of FUV radiation in galaxies, linked to the interaction between dark matter and baryons.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06350" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mapping neutral islands during end stages of reionization with photometric intergalactic medium tomography</a><span class="id">[2505.06350]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During the epoch of reionization (EoR), the first generation of luminous sources in our Universe emitted ionizing photons that almost completely ionized the gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). The growth of ionized bubbles and the persistence of neutral islands within the IGM hold vital clues to understanding the morphology and timeline of cosmic reionization. We explore the potential of photometric IGM tomography using deep narrow-band (NB) imaging to observe the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest transmission in background galaxies with the Subaru/Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC). Based on our simulations, we find that the currently available NB filter is suitable for mapping the IGM at $z\simeq 5.7$, corresponding to the late stages of reionization. Our findings indicate that over $\sim$500 background galaxies are needed to accurately reconstruct the IGM at scales greater than 200 Mpc, achieving more than a 40 per cent correlation with the true distribution. This technique can help detect final remaining neutral islands that span more than 20 Mpc lengths. Using the superpixel method built to identify physical patterns in noisy image data, we find that the neutral island size distribution can be recovered with an accuracy of $\sim$0.3 dex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these reconstructed maps are correlated with the galaxy distribution and anti-correlated with the cosmological 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen in the IGM. Lastly, we find that these reconstructed maps are anti-correlated with the patchy optical depth to the cosmic microwave background. As such, multiple measurements can be employed for confirmed detection of neutral islands during the end stages.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecting JWST discovered N/O-enhanced galaxies to globular clusters: Evidence from chemical imprints</a><span class="id">[2505.12505]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent JWST observations have revealed a growing population of galaxies at $z&gt;4$ with elevated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios. These &quot;N/O-enhanced&quot; galaxies (NOEGs) exhibit near- to super-solar N/O at sub-solar O/H, clearly deviating from the well-established scaling relation between N/O and O/H observed in local galaxies. The origin of this abundance anomaly is unclear. Interestingly, local globular clusters also exhibit anomalous light-element abundances, whose origin remains debated. In this work, we compare the chemical abundance patterns of 22 known NOEGs at $0\lesssim z\lesssim 12$ – primarily discovered with JWST – to those observed in local globular clusters. We find similarities in the abundances of C, N, O, Fe, and He between the two populations. The similar abundance patterns support the scenario in which globular cluster stars formed within proto-cluster environments – similar to those traced by NOEGs – that were self-enriched. Indeed, the enhancement in N/O in early galaxies appears to be only found in dense stellar environments with $\Sigma _{\star}\gtrsim 10^{2.5}~M_\odot~{\rm pc^{-2}}$, as expected for the progenitors of globular clusters in the Milky Way, and similar to those of star clusters identified in strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies. Furthermore, we find a tentative positive correlation between N/O ratios and stellar mass among NOEGs. The apparent high occurrence rate of NOEGs at high redshift is consistent with the picture of cluster-dominated star formation during the early stages of galaxy evolution. Measuring chemical abundances across diverse stellar environments in high-redshift galaxies will be crucial for elucidating the connection between NOEGs and globular clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10667" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Simulation Based Inference Approach to the Dynamics of the MW-LMC System - Validation</a><span class="id">[2507.10667]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) has generated dynamical disequilibrium throughout the MW. The interaction has displaced the MW's centre of mass, manifesting as an apparent 'reflex motion' in velocities of outer halo stars. Often, expensive high fidelity MW–LMC simulations are required to model these effects, though the range of model parameter spaces can be large and complex. We investigate the ability of lower fidelity, rigid MW-LMC simulations to reliably infer the model parameters of higher fidelity N-body and hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in MW–LMC simulations using a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) approach. We produce and release a set of 128,000 MW–LMC rigid potentials, with stellar haloes evolved to present-day, each adopting a unique combination of model parameters including the MW mass, the LMC mass and the dynamical friction strength. For these simulation parameters, we use SBI to find their posterior distributions. We find that our SBI framework trained on rigid MW–LMC simulations is able to correctly infer the true simulation LMC mass within a $1\sigma$ confidence interval from both N-body and cosmological simulations when knowledge of the induced MW reflex motion is provided as data. This motivates future applications of the presented SBI framework to observational data, which will help constrain both MW and LMC properties, as well as the dynamics of the MW's reflex motion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metallicity fluctuation statistics in the interstellar medium and young stars – II.

These observations have revealed complex correlations between elemental abundances, but thus far there has been no analytic theoretical framework to interpret these data. In this paper we extend the simple stochastically-forced diffusion model of Krumholz &amp; Ting (2018), which has proven successful at explaining the spatial abundance patterns of single elements, to multiple elements, clarifying why elements are correlated and what controls their degree of correlation, and making quantitative predictions for the degree of correlation in both gas and young stars. We show that our results are qualitatively consistent with observed patterns, and point out how application of this theory to measured correlations should enable determination of currently unknown parameters describing r-process nucleosynthesis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Accurate Comprehensive Approach to Substructure: IV.

However, to simplify the treatment we neglected dynamical friction (DF). Here, we revisit that work by including it. That is done in a fully analytic manner, i.e. avoiding the integration of subhalo orbital motions. This leads to simple accurate expressions for the abundance and radial distribution of subhaloes of different masses, which disentangle the effects of DF from those of tidal stripping and shock-heating. This way we reproduce and explain the results of simulations and extend them to haloes of any mass, redshift and formation times in the desired cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analysis of mass-transferring binary candidates in the Milky Way</a><span class="id">[2509.08118]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mass transfer between stars in binary systems profoundly impacts their evolution, yet many aspects of this process (especially the stability, mass loss, and eventual fate of such systems) remain poorly understood. One promising avenue to constrain these processes is through the identification and characterisation of systems undergoing active mass transfer. Inspired by the slow brightening preceding stellar merger transients, we worked on a method to identify Galactic mass-transferring binaries in which the donor is a Hertzsprung gap (HG) star. We constructed an initial sample of HG stars using the Gaia EDR3 contribution Starhorse catalogue, and we identified candidate mass-transferring systems by selecting sources that exhibit Balmer emission features (using the low-resolution Gaia XP spectra), mid-infrared excess (from WISE photometry), and photometric variability (inferred from the error in the Gaia G-band magnitude). This multi-criteria selection yielded a sample of 67 candidates, which we further analysed using complementary photometric and spectroscopic data. Among our candidates, we identified at least nine eclipsing binaries and some sources that are potential binaries as well. Three sources in our sample are strong candidates for mass-transferring binaries with a yellow component, and three more are binaries with a Be star. Notably, four sources in our sample are strong candidates for hosting a compact companion, based on their ultraviolet or X-ray signatures. The main sources of contamination in our search are hot but highly reddened stars (primarily Oe and Be stars). As an additional outcome of this work, we present a refined catalogue of 308 bona fide HG stars, selected using improved extinction corrections and stricter emission-line criteria. This enhanced sample is expected to contain a significantly higher fraction of scientifically valuable mass-transferring binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02301" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relativistic Jets and Winds in Radio-Identified Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidates</a><span class="id">[2510.02301]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supermassive black hole binary systems (SMBHBs) are thought to emit the recently discovered nHz gravitational wave background; however, not a single individual nHz source has been confirmed to date. Long-term radio-monitoring at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates: blazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux density variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence of a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model, where a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel, along which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation from the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency arises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed. Our model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be applied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio polarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested with forthcoming observations. Our results motivate future numerical simulations of jetted SMBHB systems and have implications for the fueling, structure, and evolution of blazar jets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Vertically Orientated Dark Matter Halo Marks a Flip of the Galactic Disk</a><span class="id">[2510.08684]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Unveiling the 3D shape of the Milky Way's dark-matter halo is critical to understanding its formation history. We created an innovative dynamical model with minimal assumptions on the internal dynamical structures and accommodates a highly flexible triaxial DM halo. By applying the method to 6D phase-space data of K-giant stars from LAMOST + Gaia, we robustly determine the 3D dark-matter distribution of the Milky Way out to approximately $50$ kpc. We discover a triaxial, nearly oblate dark-matter halo with $q_{\rm DM} = Z/X= 0.92\pm0.08$, $p_{\rm DM} = Y/X= 0.8\pm0.2$ averagely within 50 kpc, where $Z$ axis is defined perpendicular to the stellar disk. The axes ratio $q_{\rm DM} &gt; p_{\rm DM}$ is strongly preferred; the long-intermediate axis plane of the dark-matter halo is unexpectedly vertical to the Galactic disk, yet aligned with the `plane of satellites'. This striking configuration suggests that the Galactic disk (and the inner halo) has flipped, likely torqued by minor mergers, from an original alignment with the outer dark-matter halo and satellite plane, as supported by Milky Way analogues from Auriga and TNG50. By allowing $q_{\rm DM}(r)$ and $p_{\rm DM}(r)$ vary with radii, we find tentative evidence that the dark-matter halo is twisted, that it agrees alignment with the disk in the inner regions and transitions to a vertical orientation at $r\gtrsim 20$ kpc, supporting the disk flip scenario prediction. Such disk reorientation is non-trivial yet its physical mechanism is straightforward to comprehend and naturally originates a vertical satellite plane. Our findings offer a unified framework that links dark-matter halo orientation, satellite alignment, and disk evolution, reinforcing the internal consistency of the Milky Way in $\Lambda$CDM model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The dark matter wake of a galactic bar revealed by multichannel Singular Spectral Analysis</a><span class="id">[2510.09751]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Milky Way is known to contain a stellar bar, as are a significant fraction of disc galaxies across the universe.

Understanding the physical mechanisms underlying this coupling requires modelling of the structural deformations to the potential that are mutually induced between components. In this work we use Basis Function Expansion (BFE) in combination with multichannel Singular Spectral Analysis (mSSA) as a non-parametric analysis tool to illustrate the coupling between the bar and the dark halo in a single high-resolution isolated barred disc galaxy simulation. We demonstrate the power of mSSA to extract and quantify explicitly coupled dynamical modes, determining growth rates, pattern speeds and phase lags for different stages of evolution of the stellar bar and the dark matter response. BFE &amp; mSSA together grant us the ability to explore the importance and physical mechanisms of bar-halo coupling, and other dynamically coupled structures across a wide range of dynamical environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XRISM-Subaru views of Abell 754: Energetic ICM Motions Revealed by XRISM/Resolve</a><span class="id">[2510.16553]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the merging cluster Abell 754 using \textit{XRISM}/Resolve. In GO1 phase, \textit{XRISM}/Resolve observed Abell 754 in two deep pointings, targeting the eastern primary core (114 ks) and the middle of the X-ray filamentary structure (190 ks). Spectral fits to full field-of-view data reveal a line-of-sight velocity difference of $656 \pm 35$ km s$^{-1}$ between the two pointing, corresponding to a bulk Mach number of 0.45$\pm$0.03. Velocity dispersions are measured to be $220^{+26}_{-29}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $279^{+24}_{-23}$ km s$^{-1}$ in the eastern and middle pointing, respectively. Within the eastern core, the velocity dispersion shows spatial variation, reaching $497^{+144}_{-117}$ km s$^{-1}$ in the southern core with high temperature – among the largest values yet reported in galaxy clusters to date. Narrow-band analysis of the Fe–K complex in this region reveals systematically higher temperatures derived from He-like and H-like Fe line ratio compared to those obtained via broadband fits, indicating multi-phase structures. Two-temperature modeling further separates a cooler core phase from a hotter, shock or turbulence-heated phase whose velocity is blueshifted, similar to that of the middle pointing. These results point to a mixing interface where post-shock gas from the south overlaps, in projection, with cooler core gas, inflating the observed line widths in this region. Weak-lensing analysis with Subaru/HSC and Suprime-cam confirms that the eastern component is about twice as massive as the western one, consistent with disruption and gas stripping of the latter. The curved morphology of the eastern X-ray core, together with the measured kinematics, is naturally explained by an off-axis, post–core-passage merger that imparts angular momentum and drives large-scale rotational and fallback flows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A targeted radio survey of infrared-selected bow shock candidates</a><span class="id">[2510.23470]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bow shocks around massive stars have primarily been detected in IR emission, but radio detections are becoming more frequent with the commissioning of sensitive and large field-of-view interferometers. Radio data probes both thermal and non-thermal emission, thereby constraining the relativistic electron population. We undertook a radio survey for bow shocks based on IR catalogues of candidates, using the VLA and the 100-m Effelsberg Telescope, aiming for new detections and to better characterise the multi-wavelength emission. We used Gaia DR3 to re-calculate spatial motion of the driving stars with respect to the surrounding stellar population. We studied the radio emission from bow shocks using emission maps and spectral-index measurements, and compared our results with data from catalogues and multi-wavelength emission. Of the 24 targets observed with the VLA in the 4-12 GHz band, six were clearly detected (including two previously reported) and 5 possibly detected. A subset of these were also observed and detected with Effelsberg at 4-8 GHz. The VLA-derived spectral index maps indicate non-thermal emission for most sources, but the statistical uncertainties are large for most sources and all Effelsberg observations indicate thermal emission. Assuming thermal emission, we obtain upper limits on the electron density within the shocked layer. We obtained upper limits on radio emission from the bow shock of Zeta Oph at a similar flux level to predictions from MHD simulations. Our survey marks a significant addition to the ca. 10 previously known radio-emitting bow shocks in the literature, and demonstrates that deep, targeted radio surveys can effectively detect IR-selected bow shocks. Follow-up observations of these targets at lower and higher frequencies are encouraged to determine whether any are non-thermal emitters like the bow shocks of BD+43, BD+60 and LS2355.

We generate a synthetic population of $\sim10^{10}$ interstellar objects with M-star kinematics in order to obtain $\sim10^4$ Earth-impactors. The relative flux of impactors arriving from the direction of the solar apex and the galactic plane is enhanced by a factor of $\sim2$ relative to the mean. The fastest impactors also arrive from these directions, although Earth-impactors are generally slower than objects in the overall population. This is because the Earth-impacting subset contains a higher fraction of low-eccentricity hyperbolic objects which are more strongly affected by gravitational focusing. Earth-impacting interstellar objects are more likely to have retrograde orbits close to the ecliptic plane. A selection effect makes the distribution of inclination of Earth-impacting interstellar objects uniform/sinusoidal at low/high perihelion distances. In turn, low perihelion impactors have higher impact probability towards the ecliptic plane. The overall impactor population therefore exhibits an intermediate inclination distribution between uniform and sinusoidal. The highest velocity impacts are most likely to occur in the spring when the Earth is moving towards the solar apex. However, impacts in general are more likely to occur during the winter when the Earth is located in the direction of the antapex. Interstellar objects are more likely to impact the Earth at low latitudes close to the equator, with a slight preference for the Northern hemisphere due to the location of the apex. These distributions are independent of the assumed interstellar object number density, albedos, and size-frequency distribution and are publicly available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDSS-ALMA Legacy Value Archival Gas Exploration (SALVAGE) – I: global star formation is governed by central (not global) molecular gas</a><span class="id">[2511.06775]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Star-forming galaxies form tight relations between their stellar mass, star-formation rate, and molecular gas reservoir on global and resolved scales. On the path to quiescence, the exchange between gas and stars must inevitably be broken. Understanding the mechanisms governing star formation and quenching therefore requires observations of both the stellar and molecular gas components. To this end, we have assembled a sample of 277 galaxies ($0.02 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.25$) with semi-resolved optical and millimetre $^{12}$CO(1-0) data, wherein the properties of the inner $\thicksim$2 kpc can be distinguished from the outer regions. This effort was made possible by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogues and the maturing archive of the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array (ALMA). We call this dataset the SDSS-ALMA Legacy Value Archival Gas Exploration (SALVAGE). In this work, we leverage SALVAGE to provide a semi-resolved perspective on global scaling relations and why some galaxies deviate from them. In agreement with previous work, we find that the offset of a galaxy from the global star-forming main sequence (SFMS) is driven by its inner star formation rate. With the relative inner and outer distributions of molecular gas fraction and star formation efficiency, we investigate whether the central star formation driving global changes is due to fuel availability or efficiency. We find that the position of a galaxy within the SFMS is largely due to the inner star-formation efficiency, while departure from the SFMS is driven by availability of central gas. The central few kpc are thus the most consequential region for galaxy evolution at low redshift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectrophotometric evidence for a metal-bearing, carbonaceous, and pristine interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</a><span class="id">[2511.19112]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>3I/ATLAS is only the second confirmed cometary object known to enter the Solar System from interstellar space.

Despite these benefits, the trajectory optimization of spacecraft utilizing such configurations remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a sequential convex programming (SCP) approach for the optimal design of multi-mode and multi-propulsion spacecraft trajectories. The method extends the dynamical linearization within SCP using sparse automatic differentiation, enabling efficient inclusion of multiple propulsion modes or systems without complex manual reformulation while maintaining comparable computational efficiency. New constraint formulations are introduced to ensure selection of a single propulsion mode at each time step and limit the total number of modes used. The approach is demonstrated for (i) a low-thrust Earth-67P rendezvous using the SPT-140 thruster with 20 discrete modes, and (ii) an Earth-Mars transfer employing both a low-thrust engine and a solar sail. Results confirm that the proposed method can efficiently compute optimal trajectories for these scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixellated Posterior Sampling of Point Spread Functions in Astronomical Images</a><span class="id">[2511.19594]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a novel framework for upsampled Point Spread Function (PSF) modeling using pixel-level Bayesian inference. Accurate PSF characterization is critical for precision measurements in many fields including: weak lensing, astrometry, and photometry. Our method defines the posterior distribution of the pixelized PSF model through the combination of an analytic Gaussian likelihood and a highly expressive generative diffusion model prior, trained on a library of HST ePSF templates. Compared to traditional methods (parametric Moffat, ePSF template-based, and regularized likelihood), we demonstrate that our PSF models achieve orders of magnitude higher likelihood and residuals consistent with noise, all while remaining visually realistic. Further, the method applies even for faint and heavily masked point sources, merely producing a broader posterior. By recovering a realistic, pixel-level posterior distribution, our technique enables the first meaningful propagation of detailed PSF morphological uncertainty in downstream analysis.

The beam combination will be achieved by a four-telescope integrated optics beam combiner (IOBC) that fulfills specific requirements. Our goal was to manufacture the mid-infrared IOBC for NOTT based on the double-Bracewell architecture and run a detailed laboratory characterization in the L' band. We focus on the achievable raw and self-calibrated nulling ratios. We use a double Michelson interferometer to produce four broadband coherent beams simulating the four telescopes of the VLTI and perform broadband nulling at room temperature. We analyze the modal, chromatic, and polarization behavior of the IOBC, and measure its total throughput. We were able to manufacture a single-mode four-telescope double-Bracewell IOBC in GLS mid-infrared transparent glass using Ultrafast Laser Inscription. We show that the directional couplers forming the four-telescope IOBC (4T-nuller) have an achromatic splitting ratio across the band 3.65-3.85 um with a 40/60 and 50/50 splitting for the side couplers and the central coupler, respectively. We report a total throughput of 37%, including the Fresnel losses that will be mitigated with anti-reflection coatings, and quantify differential birefringence. Operating at room temperature, with 200 nm bandwidth centered at 3.8 um and without polarization control, we measure an average raw null of 8.13+/-0.03x10-3 and a self-calibrated null of 1.14+/-0.01x10-3. Finally, we show that a theta^6 broad null can be experimentally reproduced in these conditions. This is, to our knowledge, the first measurement of a broadband L' deep null obtained with a four-telescope integrated optics beam combiner. The next step foresees testing the 4T-nuller in cryogenic conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pile-up simulator for XRISM/Xtend onboard the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM)</a><span class="id">[2511.19967]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In X-ray astronomy, most observatories utilize multi-pixel photon-counting devices. When a photon counting device observes a bright source, we face an unavoidable problem called pile-up. Pile-up leads to mistakes in the observational properties of the source, mainly an apparent decrease in the X-ray flux. X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) has two X-ray telescopes, one of which is Xtend, a CCD camera with a wide field-of-view (FOV) of 38 arcmin square. Xtend has three operating modes: full window mode with a frame exposure of  4 s, 1/8 window mode with  0.5s and reduced FOV, and 1/8 window mode with burst option, whose frame exposure is reduced to  0.06 s. Observers need to select the operating mode according to their target fluxes. We develop the pile-up simulator for Xtend to provide a quantitative assessment of pile-up according to the fluxes, spectra, and shapes of X-ray sources. We derived the 10% pile-up limits for a point source of 7.8, 66.2, and 447.9 counts/s for full window, 1/8 window, and 1/8 window mode with burst option, respectively, by assuming the Crab spectrum.

This frequency range was selected because VLF radio waves are efficiently reflected by the lower ionospheric layers, and any changes in these layers lead to corresponding variations in the received signal. We have used a magnetic loop antenna for signal reception along with a low noise amplifier, analog-to-digital converter, and spectrum analyzer. Data was collected over the course of a few days, from a remote location with minimal electromagnetic interference. From the viewpoint of cost, simplicity and accessibility, this method far surpasses traditional methods of detecting solar flares, using satellites, telescopes, etc.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Strategies for Observing Technosignatures on Terrestrial Exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2511.20329]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The search for technosignatures – remotely detectable evidence of extraterrestrial technology – draws upon examples from the recent history of Earth as well as projections of Earth's technosphere. Facilities like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will significantly advance the feasibility of characterizing the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, while other future mission concepts could extend this search to mid-infrared wavelengths. We draw upon a recently developed set of ten self-consistent scenarios for future Earth technospheres as analogs for extraterrestrial technospheres, which we use to outline a stepwise technosignature search strategy beginning with HWO and followed by other missions. We find that HWO could reveal elevated abundances of a CO$_2$ + NO$_2$ pair on planets with combustion and other large-scale industry, which could be observable in up to in eight of the ten scenarios. Follow-up radio observations could reveal narrow-band directed transmissions, which occurs in two of the scenarios. Further study by direct detection at mid-infrared wavelengths with the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) could reveal spectral features from industry, such as the combination of CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 in four scenarios and CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 + CF$_4$ in one scenario; two of these also include the N$_2$O + CH$_4$ + NH$_3$ triple from large-scale agriculture. Other mission concepts such as a Solar Gravitational Lens mission could reveal large-scale surface features in two scenarios that otherwise show no detectable technosignatures, while an interplanetary fly-by or probe mission would be the most conclusive way to reveal the presence of technology on terrestrial exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Performance Calibration of the Wavefront Sensor's EMCCD Detector for the Cool Planets Imaging Coronagraph Aboard CSST</a><span class="id">[2511.20386]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The wavefront sensor (WFS), equipped with an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) detector, is a critical component of the Cool Planets Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C) on the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST).

It is the first mission that is being designed, built, and potentially launched before its target is known. This approach will enable the spacecraft to perform the first mission to a Long Period Comet from the Oort Cloud, as these comets have fleeting visits to the inner Solar System lasting only months to years from first discovery, too short for the usual process of mission development to be followed. In this paper we describe a number of factors that need to be considered in selecting a target for the mission, including scientific, orbital, spacecraft and instrument constraints, and discussion of different prioritisation strategies. We find that, in the case where we have a choice of targets, our decisions will mostly be driven by orbital information, which we will have relatively early on, with information on the activity level of the comet an important but secondary consideration. As cometary activity levels are notoriously hard to predict based on early observations alone, this prioritisation / decision approach based more on orbits gives us confidence that a good comet that is compatible with the spacecraft constraints will be selectable with sufficient warning time to allow the mission to intercept it.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20524" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The miniJPAS and J-NEP surveys: Machine learning for star-galaxy separation</a><span class="id">[2511.20524]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a supervised machine learning classification of sources from the Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) Pathfinder datasets: miniJPAS and J-NEP.

The photonic lantern (PL) can be used to sense aberrations at the final science imaging plane.

Physics lecturing can be more effective when digital twins are used to accompany theory classes. Research in physics has greatly benefited from the advent of modern, high-level programming languages, which facilitate the implementation of user-friendly code. Here, we report our own Python-based software, the gr-orbit-toolkit, to simulate orbits in classical and general relativistic scenarios. First, we present the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for classical and relativistic orbital accelerations. For the latter, we follow a post-Newtonian approach. Second, we describe our algorithm, which numerically integrates these ODEs to simulate the orbits of small-sized objects orbiting around massive bodies by using Euler and Runge-Kutta methods. Then, we study a set of sample two-body models with either the Sun or a black hole in the center. Our simulations confirm that the orbital motions predicted by classical and relativistic ODEs drastically differ for bodies near the Schwarzschild radius of the central massive body. Classical mechanics explains the orbital motion of objects far away from a central massive body, but general relativity is required to study objects moving at close proximity to a massive body, where the gravitational field is strong. Our study on objects with different eccentricities confirms that our code captures relativistic orbital precession. Our convergence analysis shows the toolkit is numerically robust. Our gr-orbit-toolkit aims at facilitating teaching and research in general relativity, so a comprehensive user and developer guide is provided in the public code repository.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19533" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experimental Demonstration of an On-Axis Laser Ranging Interferometer for Future Gravity Missions</a><span class="id">[2511.19533]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We experimentally demonstrate a novel interferometric architecture for next-generation gravity missions, featuring a laser ranging interferometer (LRI) that enables monoaxial transmission and reception of laser beams between two optical benches with a heterodyne frequency of 7.3 MHz.

Persistent microseisms in the 0.1-0.3 Hz band couple into the instruments, degrade lock stability, and contribute substantially to detector downtime during observing runs. The multi-stage seismic isolation system has achieved remarkable success in mitigating such disturbances through active feedback control, yet residual platform motion remains a key factor limiting low-frequency sensitivity and duty cycle. Further reduction of this residual motion is therefore critical for improving the long-term stability and overall astrophysical reach of the observatories. In this work, we develop a data-driven approach that uses machine learning to model and suppress residual seismic motion within the isolation system. Ground and platform sensor data from the detectors are used to train a neural network that predicts platform motion driven by microseismic activity. When incorporated into the control scheme, the network's predictions yield up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in residual motion compared to conventional linear filtering methods, revealing that nonlinear couplings play a significant role in limiting current isolation performance. These results demonstrate that machine-learning-based control can provide a powerful new pathway for enhancing active seismic isolation, improving lock robustness, and extending the low-frequency observational capabilities of gravitational-wave detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strangelet Searches from Neutron Stars, Binary Mergers, and Gamma-Ray Bursts with Current and Future Observatories</a><span class="id">[2511.19799]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strange quark matter (SQM) is considered a possible true ground state of QCD at high densities.

This work analyzes the stability of strangelets, production cross-sections, and mass-to-charge ratios using QCD-based models.
