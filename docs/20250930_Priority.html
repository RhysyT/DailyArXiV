Observations suggest that high-$z$ star clusters reached stellar surface densities above $10^5 M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, suggesting scenarios where models predict that the ability of stellar feedback to counter gravitational collapse is severely limited. We investigate the first star clusters in a suite of AREPO simulations, which explore the capacity for $\Lambda$CDM halos to maximally form high-density systems without feedback. We include the effects of the supersonic baryon-dark matter streaming velocity, an effect that impacts gas density and distribution in early minihalos. We show that early star clusters can reach high densities even in regions of strong supersonic streaming, provided feedback is weak. We analyze the interplay of the stream velocity and the dynamical processes of structure formation, finding that JWST has the opportunity to detect the brightest, most massive objects in our computational box. The detection of individual $z\geq12$ Pop III star clusters below $10^7M_\odot$ is challenging, although lensing could reveal these objects in rare configurations, especially if a top-heavy IMF is present. We find that accounting for baryonic clusters separately from dark matter halos complicates predictions for the faint-end of the high-$z$ UVLF, with competing effects from the stream velocity and low-mass clusters outside of halos. Finally, we explore clustering of star clusters as a promising probe of the stream velocity in these systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Splashback-like Feature of Central Galaxies in Galaxy Clusters</a><span class="id">[2509.22780]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a splashback-like feature in the outer region of central galaxies (CGs) in clusters. This feature is detected as a &quot;dip&quot; in the radial slope of the CG surface brightness, derived through the stacking of Dark Energy Survey data of over four thousand galaxy clusters in the redshift range of 0.2 to 0.5 with richness 20 and above. The local minimum of the dip occurs between 40 to 60 kpc from the CG center, with a mild dependence on cluster richness. This feature resembles the density transition caused by the splashback effect at the outskirts of galaxy clusters, when accreted matter reaches the apocenter for the first time. We turn to the IllustrisTNG hydro-dynamic simulation to gain theoretical insights. Density bumps, shells and accretion streaks are identified in the diffuse stellar content of the CGs and intra-cluster light which relate to the recent history of disruption and accretion. These features occur at the outskirts of the CGs, up to several hundred kiloparsecs from the cluster center. Thus, the location of the splashback-like dip in the data potentially marks the edge of the CG and the beginning of a region with the cluster diffuse light undergoing active or recent accretion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A New Sample of Dwarf Galaxies with X-ray-Selected AGN Candidates from the eROSITA All-Sky Survey</a><span class="id">[2509.22783]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To investigate the population of massive black holes in dwarf galaxies, we conduct a systematic search for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using data from the first data release of the eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1). We crossmatch dwarf galaxy positions in the NASA-Sloan Atlas with X-ray sources from eRASS and apply rigorous criteria to remove contaminants such as background sources, galaxies with dubious stellar masses, and X-ray binaries. Potential contamination from ultraluminous X-ray sources is also assessed. We ultimately assemble a sample of 27 X-ray-selected AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses $M_{*} = 10^{7.5-9.5} M_{\odot}$ and redshifts $z&lt;0.15$. An analysis of the host galaxy properties reveals that the AGN candidates are predominantly situated in systems with $g-r$ colors, star formation rates, and concentrations typical of the broader dwarf galaxy population. Detailed examination of the X-ray sources indicates that most AGN candidates in our sample are consistent with being located in the nuclear regions of their host galaxies and exhibit Eddington ratios ranging between $\lambda_{Edd} \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-1}$, with a few radiating at/above their Eddington limit. Notably, our methodology identifies 15 previously unreported AGNs candidates, highlighting the complementary nature of our approach to the existing literature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22789" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Masses, Star-Formation Efficiencies, and Dynamical Evolution of 18,000 HII Regions</a><span class="id">[2509.22789]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present measurements of the masses associated with $\sim18,000$ HII regions across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies by combining data from JWST, HST, MUSE, ALMA, VLA, and MeerKAT from the multi-wavelength PHANGS survey. We report 10 pc-scale measurements of the mass of young stars, ionized gas, and older disk stars coincident with each HII region, as well as the initial and current mass of molecular gas, atomic gas, and swept-up shell material, estimated from lower resolution data. We find that the mass of older stars dominates over young stars at $\gtrsim10\rm\,pc$ scales, and ionized gas exceeds the stellar mass in most optically bright HII regions. Combining our mass measurements for a statistically large sample of HII regions, we derive 10 pc scale star-formation efficiencies $\approx6{-}17\%$ for individual HII regions. Comparing each region's self-gravity with the ambient ISM pressure and total pressure from pre-supernova stellar feedback, we show that most optically bright HII regions are over-pressured relative to their own self-gravity and the ambient ISM pressure, and that they are hence likely expanding into their surroundings. Larger HII regions in galaxy centers approach dynamical equilibrium. The self-gravity of regions is expected to dominate over pre-supernova stellar feedback pressure at $\gtrsim130\rm\,pc$ and $60\rm\,pc$ scales in galaxy disks and centers, respectively, but is always sub-dominant to the ambient ISM pressure on HII region scales. Our measurements have direct implications for the dynamical evolution of star-forming regions and the efficiency of stellar feedback in ionizing and clearing cold gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterizing the star cluster populations in Stephan's Quintet using HST and JWST observations</a><span class="id">[2509.22800]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stephan's Quintet (SQ) is a local compact galaxy group system that exhibits significant star formation activity. A history of tidal interactions between its four member galaxies and a recent collision between an intruder galaxy and the original group are associated with active star formation, particularly in many shocked regions in the intra-group medium. Using an existing star cluster candidate (SCC) catalog constructed from HST UV/optical images, we integrate flux measurements from five near-infrared filters (F090W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W) obtained from JWST NIRCam observations in 2022. Leveraging the extended photometric baseline from HST and JWST, spanning  300 nm to  3500 nm, we perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the CIGALE code to derive reliable estimates of age, mass, and extinction for the 1,588 high-confidence SCCs. We confirm earlier results that very young SCCs ( a few Myr) are predominantly located along previously identified shock regions near the merging galaxies, while older (&gt;100 Myr) and globular clusters are more widely distributed. Our analysis shows that NIR photometry helps break the age-extinction degeneracy, reclassifying many SCCs from older to younger, moderately dust-extincted clusters when added to HST-based SED fits. We also observe a strong spatial correlation between young clusters and CO-traced molecular gas, although active star formation is present in several regions with no detectable CO. We find that the two prominent epochs of star formation, around 5 Myr and 200 Myr, correspond to the two major interaction events in SQ that gave rise to the observed extended tidal features.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22802" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Role of Pre-Processing in Tidal Feature Formation within Galaxy Clusters</a><span class="id">[2509.22802]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the formation of tidal features, such as tidal tails, streams, and shell-like structures, composed of stars stripped from satellites within galaxy clusters. For this, we use multiresolution cosmological $N-$body simulations with the “galaxy replacement technique&quot;. We find that the fraction of satellites with tidal features increases with the mass of the host clusters but is not related to the dynamical state of the clusters. Although the strong tidal field in the cluster environment accelerates the mass loss of the satellites, only 20\% of tidal-featured galaxies form their tidal features purely due to tidal perturbation in the cluster environment, without any interactions with other galaxies before falling into the cluster. In contrast, the majority (80\%) is affected by the preprocessing, as they experienced merging events with other galaxies before infalling into the cluster. Among this preprocessing population, 45\% of all tidal-featured galaxies form their tidal features after passing the pericenter of the cluster, affected by both preprocessing and the tidal field of the cluster, whereas 35\% of all tidal-featured galaxies form their tidal features before reaching the pericenter, primarily due to preprocessing. Notably, this fraction increases from 35\% to 40-50\% when we focus only on galaxies with brighter surface brightness limits or higher stellar mass. Therefore, our results highlight that preprocessing is an important channel for forming tidal features within clusters. However, the importance of preprocessing may be further amplified in observations, since more massive galaxies, which are commonly associated with preprocessing, are preferentially detected.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Star Formation Main Sequence down to 10$^{7} M_\odot$ at $1 &lt; z &lt; 9$</a><span class="id">[2509.22871]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Main Sequence of Star-Forming Galaxies (SFGMS or MS) is a fundamental scaling relation that provides a global framework for studying galaxy formation and evolution, as well as insight into the complex star formation histories (SFHs) of individual galaxies. In this work, we combine large-area pre-JWST surveys (COSMOS2020, CANDELS), which probe high-$M_\star$ sources (${&gt;10^9\,M_\odot}$), with SHARDS/CANDELS FAINT and JWST data from CANUCS, CEERS, JADES, and UNCOVER, to obtain a high-$z$, star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass ($M_\star$) complete sample spanning both high- and low-$M_\star$ regimes. Completeness in both $M_\star$ and SFR is key to avoiding biases introduced by low-mass, highly star-forming objects. Our combined data set is 80% complete down to $10^{7.6}\,M_\odot$ at $z\sim1$ ($10^{8.8}\,M_\odot$ at $z\sim9$). The overall intrinsic MS slope (based on the SFR$_{100}$ and $M_\star$ derived with Dense Basis and nonparametric SFHs) shows little evolution up to $z\sim5$, with values $\sim0.7 - 0.8$. The slope in the low-$M_\star$ regime becomes steeper than that in the high-$M_\star$ end at least up to $z\sim5$, but the strength of this change is highly dependent on the assumptions made on the symmetry of the uncertainties in $M_\star$ and SFR. If real, the steepening suggests reduced star formation efficiency or declining gas content with decreasing $M_\star$. The transition between the low-$M_\star$ regime and the canonical MS occurs around $10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$, independent of $z$. This critical value may coincide with the assembly of galaxies' disks, which can provide a mechanism for self-regulation that stabilizes them against feedback. The intrinsic scatter is compatible with canonical estimates, also at low-$M_\star$, ranging from $0.2-0.3$ dex. This is indicative of rapid variations in star formation being averaged out over $\lesssim100$ Myr.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22915" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A gradient boosting and broadband approach to finding Lyman-α emitting galaxies beyond narrowband surveys</a><span class="id">[2509.22915]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we test whether gradient-boosting algorithms, trained on broadband photometric data from traditional Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting (LAE) surveys, can efficiently and accurately identify LAE candidates from typical star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts and brightness levels. Using galaxy samples at $z \in [2,6]$ derived from the COSMOS2020 and SC4K catalogs, we trained gradient-boosting machine-learning algorithms (LGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost) using optical and near-infrared broadband photometry. To ensure balanced performance, the models were trained on carefully selected datasets with similar redshift and i-band magnitude distributions. Additionally, the models were tested for robustness by perturbing the photometric data using the associated observational uncertainties. Our classification models achieved F1-scores of $\sim 87\%$ and successfully identified about $7,000$ objects with an unanimous agreement across all models. This more than doubles the number of LAEs identified in the COSMOS field compared with the SC4K dataset. We managed to spectroscopically confirm 60 of these LAE candidates using the publicly available catalogs in the COSMOS field. These results highlight the potential of machine learning in efficiently identifying LAEs candidates. This lays the foundations for applications to larger photometric surveys, such as Euclid and LSST. By complementing traditional approaches and providing robust preselection capabilities, our models facilitate the analysis of these objects. This is crucial to increase our knowledge of the overall LAE population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Masses for 23 Pre-Main Sequence Stars in Upper Scorpius: A Critical Test of Stellar Evolutionary Models</a><span class="id">[2509.23001]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present dynamical masses for 23 pre-main sequence K- and M-type stars in the Upper Scorpius star-forming region. These masses were derived from the Keplerian rotation of CO disk gas using the MCMC radiative-transfer package pdspy and a flared-disk model with 15 free parameters. We compare our dynamical masses to those derived from five pre-main sequence evolutionary models, and find that most models consistently underestimate stellar mass by $\gtrsim$25%. Models with updated treatment of stellar magnetic fields are a notable exception $-$ they consistently return stellar masses in good agreement with the dynamical results. We find that the magnetic models' performance is valid even at low masses, in contrast with some literature results suggesting they may overestimate stellar mass for M$_{\star}$ $\lesssim$ 0.6 M$_{\odot}$. Our results are consistent with dynamical versus isochronal evaluations for younger samples (e.g. Taurus, 1-3 Myr), and extend the systematic evaluation of stellar evolutionary models up to stars $\sim$11 Myr in age. Finally, we derive disk dust masses to evaluate whether using dynamical masses versus isochronal masses changes the slope of the log(M$_{dust}$)$-$log(M$_{\star}$) relation. We derive a slightly shallower relation using dynamical masses versus isochronal masses, but the slopes of these relations agree within uncertainties. In all cases, we derive a steeper-than-linear relation for log(M$_{dust}$)$-$log(M$_{\star}$), consistent with previous literature results for Upper Sco.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-wavelength probes of the Milky Way's Cold Interstellar Medium: Radio HI and Optical KI Absorption with GASKAP and GALAH</a><span class="id">[2509.23066]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comparative analysis of interstellar hydrogen (HI) and potassium (KI) absorption from the radio and optical surveys, GASKAP and GALAH, to study the physical and kinematic properties of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way foreground towards the Magellanic Clouds. By comparing GASKAP HI absorption with interstellar KI absorption detected in GALAH spectra of nearby stars (within 12 arcmin angular distance or a spatial separation of  0.75 pc), we reveal a strong kinematic correlation between these two tracers of the cold neutral ISM. The velocity offsets between matched HI and KI absorption components are small, with a mean (median) offset of -1.3 (-1.2) km s-1 and a standard deviation of 2.3 km s-1. The high degree of kinematic consistency suggests a close spatial association between Ki and cold HI gas. Correlation analyses reveal a moderate positive relationship between HI and KI line-of-sight properties, such as KI column density with HI column density or HI brightness temperature. We observe a  63% overlap in the detection of both species towards 290 (out of 462) GASKAP HI absorption lines of sight, and estimate a median KI/HI abundance ratio of  2.3 x 10^(-10), in excellent agreement with previous findings. Our work opens up an exciting avenue of Galactic research that uses large-scale surveys in the radio and optical wavelengths to probe the neutral interstellar medium through its diverse tracers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23298" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The origin of double-peaked narrow emission-line galaxies in MaNGA Survey</a><span class="id">[2509.23298]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We select 36 double-peaked narrow emission-line galaxies (DPGs) from 10,010 unique galaxies in MaNGA survey. These DPGs show double-peaked Balmer lines and forbidden lines in the spectra. We use a double Gaussian model to separate the double-peaked profiles of each emission line into blue and red components ($\lambda_\text{blue}$ &lt; $\lambda_\text{red}$), and analyze the spatially resolved kinematics and ionization mechanisms of each component. We find that in 35 out of 36 DPGs, the flux ratio between the blue and red components varies systematically along the major axes, while it keeps roughly a constant along the minor axes. The blue and red components of these DPGs exhibit similar distributions in both the value of line-of-sight velocity and the velocity dispersion. Additionally, 83.3% DPGs have both blue and red components located in the same ionization region in the [SII]-BPT diagram. Combining all these observational results, we suggest that the double-peaked emission line profiles in these 35 DPGs primarily originate from rotating discs. The remaining one galaxy shows clear outflow features. 8 out of 35 DPGs show symmetric line profiles that indicate undisturbed rotating discs, and the other 27 DPGs exhibit asymmetric profiles, suggesting dynamic disturbances in the rotating discs. Furthermore, we find that 58.3% DPGs experienced external processes, characterized by tidal features, companion galaxies, as well as gas-star misalignments. This fraction is about twice as much as that of the control sample, suggesting the origin of double-peaked emission line profiles is associated with external processes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23460" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Properties of Barred Galaxies with the Environment: II. The case of the Cosmic Web around the Virgo cluster</a><span class="id">[2509.23460]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Bars are elongated structures developed by a large fraction of disk galaxies in their central few kiloparsecs. However, the bar formation process is still not fully understood, particularly the role played by the galaxy environment in the formation and evolution of these structures. Aims. The aim of this work is to establish how the galaxy environment affects the evolution of bars by analyzing the bar structural parameters in a sample of galaxies located in three different galaxy environments: in the Virgo cluster, in filaments in the Cosmic Web around it, and in the field. Methods. We performed structural analysis using optical imaging from the DESI Legacy survey, measuring bar radii and disk scale lengths through Fourier analysis and surface brightness fitting techniques. Results. After defining a homogeneous sample of barred galaxies across the three different galaxy environments in terms of color and magnitude, the median bar radii were found to be 2.54 +/- 0.34 kpc, 3.29 +/- 0.38 kpc, and 4.44 +/- 0.81 kpc in the cluster, filaments, and field environments, respectively. In addition, the median bar radii scaled by the disk scale lengths was found to be 1.26 +/- 0.09, 1.72 +/- 0.11, and 2.57 +/- 0.21 in the cluster, filaments, and field environments, respectively. These results indicate that the galaxy environment has a significant influence on the structural parameters of bars, with bars in high-density environments being shorter and less prominent than those in the field. Conclusions. Our findings can be interpreted in terms of a slowing of the secular evolution of bars in dense galaxy environments. Barred galaxies located in clusters could experience a reduced rate of bar secular evolution due to various physical processes that occur in high-density environments, such as gas stripping, strangulation, or tidal interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23549" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Cosmic Filaments on Galaxy Morphological Evolution and Predictions of Early Cosmic Web Structure for Roman</a><span class="id">[2509.23549]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We leverage the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations to test how the large-scale cosmic web shapes galaxy morphology and to forecast the early cosmic web structure that the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will reveal. In the hydrodynamic TNG50 and $N$-body TNG50-Dark runs, we reconstruct the cosmic web at redshifts $z=0$, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 with the Monte Carlo Physarum Machine density estimator and the DisPerSE structure identification framework. We confirm that dark matter halos start out predominantly prolate (elongated) and their shapes are aligned with their nearest filaments; prolate galaxies retain strong shape-alignment with their outer halos to later times. The fraction of prolate galaxies and halos increases toward lower stellar mass, higher redshift, and lower-density filaments. Oblate and spheroidal galaxies show weaker trends with filament density, but spheroidal halos preferentially reside in higher-density filaments. We also find that higher-density filaments favor extended rotationally-supported disks, whereas lower-density filaments more often host smaller dispersion-supported systems. Then, generating mock galaxy samples from TNG100 and TNG50, we predict the early cosmic web accessible to Roman. We find that the spectroscopic emission-line depth planned for the High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey (HLWAS) yields a highly incomplete galaxy sample that does not accurately trace the $z=1$ cosmic web. A survey $\geq2.5\times$ deeper over a few square degrees would enable a proper reconstruction and reveal qualitatively correct filament-galaxy morphology relationships. Nevertheless, the planned HLWAS Deep field should still identify most galaxy overdensities; targeted deeper spectroscopy of these regions would efficiently and adequately map the early filamentary structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The inner rotation curve of the Milky Way</a><span class="id">[2509.23581]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derived the inner rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way by applying the terminal velocity method (TVM) to the longitude-velocity diagrams (LVD) made from the large-scale survey data of the Galactic plane in the HI (HI4PI whole sky survey) and CO lines (CfA-Chile 1.2-m Galactic plane survey, Nobeyama 45-m Galactic plane and Galactic Center surveys, and Mopra 22-m southern Galactic plane survey). The derived RC agrees well with the RCs derived from the astrometric measurements of the maser sources by very long baseline interferometer (VLBI) observations and the GAIA result. We combined them to construct a unified RC from $R=0$ to $\sim 25$ kpc and decomposed the curve into bulge, disc and dark halo components with high precision. The dark matter density near the Sun is estimated to be $0.107 \pm 0.003$ GeV cm$^{-3}$. We present the RC as ascii tables for the solar constants of $(R_0,V_0)=(8.178 {\rm kpc}, 235.1 {\rm km/s})$, We also obtained a detailed comparison of the eastern ($l\ge 0^\circ$) and western ($&lt; 0^\circ$) RCs in the HI and CO lines, which allowed the creation of an E/W asymmetry curve of the velocity difference. The E/W asymmetry is fitted by a sinusoidal function of the radius with the amplitude increasing toward the Galactic Center. We consider the possibility of the origin due to a weak bar inside $\sim 4$ kpc.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23894" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal disruption of a magnetized star</a><span class="id">[2509.23894]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes in galactic centers (TDEs) are now being actively studied both theoretically and observationally. They are observed throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to gamma-rays. It is still unclear how the emission is produced and, in particular, what is the role of the magnetic field of the disrupted star. There are many ways how magnetic fields might affect the dynamics of a TDE. They are likely responsible for the angular momentum transfer in the accretion disk formed at later stages and thus affect the radiation associated with the disk. Magnetic fields are also an important requirement for the formation of relativistic jets, that are seen in some TDEs. The goal of our study is to connect the field within the star to the fields that develop during the fallback and disk accretion. Using the fluid-dynamic code Athena++, we perform a large-scale three-dimensional adaptive-mesh magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a tidal disruption of a magnetized star. The fallback stream returning to the black-hole vicinity after the disruption contains smooth magnetic fields aligned with the stream lines. Formation of a nozzle shock near the pericenter of the initial orbit leads to a turbulent eccentric disk-like structure where the field is amplified and entangled on the local dynamic time scales up to approximate equipartition. The resulting field is mildly anisotropic and has a typical length several times smaller than the pericenter distance. The properties of the field are consistent with the early stages of turbulent dynamo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interpreting deep learning-based stellar mass estimation via causal analysis and mutual information decomposition</a><span class="id">[2509.23901]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>End-to-end deep learning models fed with multi-band galaxy images are powerful data-driven tools used to estimate galaxy physical properties in the absence of spectroscopy. However, due to a lack of interpretability and the associational nature of such models, it is difficult to understand how the information additional to integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes to the estimation task. Improving our understanding in this field would enable further advances into unraveling the physical connections among galaxy properties and optimizing data exploitation. Therefore, our work is aimed at interpreting the deep learning-based estimation of stellar mass via two interpretability techniques: causal analysis and mutual information decomposition. The former reveals the causal paths between multiple variables beyond nondirectional statistical associations, while the latter quantifies the multicomponent contributions (i.e., redundant, unique, and synergistic) of different input data to the stellar mass estimation. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we obtained meaningful results that provide physical interpretations for image-based models. Our work demonstrates the gains from combining deep learning with interpretability techniques, and holds promise in promoting more data-driven astrophysical research (e.g., astrophysical parameter estimations and investigations on complex multivariate physical processes).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Orbital Eccentricities of Planets in the Kinematic Thin and Thick Galactic Disks</a><span class="id">[2509.23973]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The orbital eccentricity distribution of exoplanets is shaped by a combination of dynamical processes, reflecting both formation conditions and long-term evolution. Probing the orbital dynamics of planets in the kinematic thin and thick Galactic disks provides insight into the degree to which stellar and Galactic environmental factors affect planet formation and evolution pathways. The classification of host stars in Galactic kinematic terms constitutes a potentially useful axis for the interpretation of orbital eccentricity, when included together with stellar metallicity and age. Leveraging the photoeccentric effect, we constrain orbital eccentricities for the sample of Kepler planets and candidates orbiting F, G, K and M dwarf stars. With Gaia astrometry, inferred Galactic phase space information, and kinematic disk criteria calibrated on stellar chemical abundances, we probabilistically associate each planet host with the kinematic thin or thick Galactic disks. We then fit the underlying eccentricity distributions for the single- and multi-transit populations. We find that for single-transiting planets, kinematic thick disk planets exhibit higher eccentricities than thin disk planets, yet we find no such difference among multis. We determine that the difference in eccentricity is unlikely to be caused solely by the effects of host stellar metallicity or giant planet occurrence. We situate these findings in the context of known eccentricity relations, including its relationships with planet multiplicity, radius and metallicity. We suggest comprehensive analyses to disentangle these results from the effects of poorly understood star-planet relationships, such as that between stellar age and planetary orbital dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for Distant Hypervelocity Star Candidates Using RR Lyrae Stars</a><span class="id">[2509.24010]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are stars with velocities exceeding their local escape velocities. Searching for HVSs and studying their origins can be an important way to study the properties of the Milky Way. In this paper, we utilize precise distances for RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) derived from the period-absolute magnitude-metallicity (PMZ) relation, along with proper motions from Gaia DR3, to conduct a large-volume search for HVSs. Our sample consists of a catalog with 8,172 RRLs with metallicity, distance and radial velocities estimated from SDSS and LAMOST spectroscopic data, and an extended catalog of 135,873 RRLs with metallicity and distance estimated from Gaia photometry. After careful quality cuts, 165 hypervelocity RRL candidates were found. We performed further checks on their light curves, and selected the most reliable 87 hypervelocity RRLs. All of them exceed the Milky Way's escape velocity in the tangential component. Among them, 7 stars have tangential velocity over 800 km s^-1. We identified two spatially distinct distributions of hypervelocity RRLs: one concentrated toward the Galactic Center and another localized around the Magellanic Clouds, suggesting that their origins are likely associated with these regions through the Hills or other mechanisms. Furthermore, we detected a significant number of RRLs associated with dwarf galaxies that exceed the Milky Way's escape velocity, likely ejected from their host systems. Future Gaia releases and spectroscopic follow-up observations will provide further insight into their ejection origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identifying Dust-lane Spheroidal Galaxies in DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Using Semi-Supervised Methods</a><span class="id">[2509.24062]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dust-lane spheroidal galaxies (DLSGs) are unique astrophysical systems that exhibit the morphology of early-type galaxies (ETGs) but are distinguished by prominent dust lanes. Recent studies propose that they form through minor mergers between ETGs and gas-rich dwarf galaxies, offering a window into the interstellar medium (ISM) of ETGs and star formation triggered by small-scale interactions. However, their rarity poses a challenge for assembling large, statistically robust samples via manual selection. To overcome this limitation, we employ GC-SWGAN, a semi-supervised learning method developed by \citet{2025ApJS..279...17L}, to systematically identify DLSGs within the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS). The methodology involves training a generative adversarial network (GAN) on unlabeled galaxy images to extract morphological features, followed by fine-tuning the model using a small dataset of labeled DLSGs. In our experiments, despite DLSGs constituting only $\sim$ 3.7\% of the test set, GC-SWGAN achieves remarkable performance, with an 87\% recall rate, 84\% accuracy, and an F1 score of 86\%, underscoring its efficacy for DLSG detection. Applying this model to $\sim$ 310,000 DESI-LS galaxies that meet the criteria $m_r &lt; 17.0$ and $0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.07$ we compile the largest catalog of DLSG candidates to date, identifying 9,482 dust-lane ETGs. A preliminary analysis reveals that these DLSGs exhibit significantly redder $g-r$ colors and higher specific star formation rates compared to non-DLSGs. This catalog enables future studies of ISM properties in ETGs and the role of minor mergers in driving star formation in the nearby universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GravSphere2: A higher-order Jeans method for mass-modeling spherical stellar systems</a><span class="id">[2509.24103]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mass-modeling methods are used to infer the gravitational field of stellar systems, from globular clusters to giant elliptical galaxies. While many methods exist, most require assumptions about the form of the underlying distribution function or data binning that leads to loss of information. With only line-of-sight (LOS) data, many methods suffer from the well-known mass-anisotropy degeneracy. To overcome these limitations, we develop a new, publicly available mass-modeling method, GravSphere2. This combines individual stellar velocities from LOS and proper motion (PM) measurements to solve the Jeans equations up to fourth order, without any data binning. Using flexible functional forms for the anisotropy profiles at second and fourth order, we show how including additional constraints from a new observable - fourth-order PMs - fully closes the system of equations, breaking the mass-anisotropy degeneracy at all orders. We test our method on mock data for dwarf galaxies, showing how GravSphere2 improves on previous methods. GravSphere2 recovers the mass density, stellar velocity anisotropy, and logarithmic slope of the mass density profile within its quoted 95% confidence intervals across almost all mocks over a wide radial range (0.1 &lt; R/Rhalf &lt; 10). We find GravSphere2 outperforms simple mass estimators, suggesting that it is worth using even when only a few LOS velocities are available. With 1,000 tracers without PMs, GravSphere2 recovers the logarithmic density slope at Rhalf with 12% (25%) statistical errors for cuspy (cored) mock data, enabling a distinction between the two. Including PMs, this improves to 8% (12%). With just 100 tracers and no PMs, we recover slopes with   30% (20%) errors. GravSphere2 will be a valuable new tool to hunt for black holes and dark matter in spherical stellar systems, from globular clusters and dwarf galaxies to giant ellipticals and galaxy clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Far-infrared lines hidden in archival deep multi-wavelength surveys: Limits on [CII]-158$μ$m at $z \sim 0.3-2.9$</a><span class="id">[2509.24211]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Singly-ionized carbon is theorized to be the brightest emission line feature in star-forming galaxies, and hence an excellent tracer of the evolution of cosmic star formation. Archival maps from far-infrared and sub-millimeter surveys potentially contain the redshifted [CII]-158$\mu$m, hidden in the much brighter continuum emission. We present a search for aggregate [CII]-158$\mu$m line emission across the predicted peak of star formation history by tomographically stacking a high-completeness galaxy catalog on broadband deep maps of the COSMOS field and constraining residual excess emission after subtracting the continuum spectral energy distribution (SED). We obtain constraints on the sky-averaged [CII]-158$\mu$m signal from the three Herschel/SPIRE maps: $11.8\pm10.2$, $11.0\pm8.7$, $9.6\pm9.8$, and $9.2\pm6.6$ $k$Jy/sr at redshifts $z\sim 0.65$, $\sim1.3$, $\sim2.1$, and $\sim2.6$ respectively, corresponding to $1-1.4\sigma$ significance in each bin. Our $3\sigma$ upper limits are in tension with past $z\sim2.6$ results from cross-correlating SDSS-BOSS quasars with high-frequency Planck maps, and indicate a much less dramatic evolution ($\sim\times7.5$) of mean [CII] intensity across the peak of star formation history than collisional excitation models or frameworks calibrated to the tentative PlanckxBOSS measurement. We discuss this tension, particularly in the context of in-development surveys (TIM, EXCLAIM) that will map this [CII] at high redshift resolution. Having demonstrated stacking in broadband deep surveys as a complementary methodology to next-generation spectrometers for line intensity mapping, our novel methods can be extended to upcoming galaxy surveys such as Euclid, as well as to place upper limits on fainter atomic and molecular lines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collisional Baryon-Dominated Dwarf Galaxies: A New Probe of Bursty Feedback and Dark Matter Physics</a><span class="id">[2509.24270]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-velocity collisions between gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxies present a promising formation channel for baryon-dominated dwarf galaxies (BDDGs). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we show that the progenitors' baryonic binding energy, $|E_{\rm bind}|$, critically controls the outcome. Repeated potential fluctuations, e.g., from bursty feedback, inject energy and reduce $|E_{\rm bind}|$ by $\approx 15\%$, yielding fewer but substantially more massive BDDGs. By contrast, elastic self-interacting dark matter produces comparable cores without lowering $|E_{\rm bind}|$, resulting in negligible effect. This provides a novel way to distinguish between two leading galactic core formation channels, i.e., the baryon feedback and elastic dark matter self-interaction. Among 15 paired simulation runs, 13 show higher BDDG masses in the weakened-binding case, and about two thirds exhibit $&gt;100\%$ mass enhancements. The simulations also predict systematically lower gas fractions due to sustained post-collision star formation, yielding a clean observational signature. Upcoming wide-field imaging (CSST, LSST), HI surveys (FAST), and kinematic follow-up will be crucial to test this scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational Evidence for Spin Alignment Between Galaxy Groups and Their Central Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.24278]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a systematic observational study of the spin alignment between galaxy groups and their central galaxies using a large spectroscopic sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Unlike previous studies based on morphology or major axis alignment, we use spin as a direct, dynamically motivated probe. To match the limitations of observational data, the group spin, central-galaxy spin, and alignment angle are defined and measured in projection on the sky plane. By applying two novel spin estimators for galaxy groups, we find strong statistical evidence for a preferential alignment, with a mean projected angle of $34.17^\circ \pm 0.29^\circ$, significantly deviating from random expectation at $37.77\sigma$. This alignment signal persists across a wide range of group and galaxy properties, but its strength is modulated by mass, morphology, and color. Specifically, we find that more massive groups and more massive central galaxies exhibit stronger alignment. Furthermore, elliptical central galaxies show stronger alignment than spirals, and bluer central galaxies are more strongly aligned than redder ones. Our results suggest a close dynamical link between the spin of central galaxies and their host groups, modulated by their physical properties and star formation history. These results provide new insights into the dynamical connection between central galaxies and their host dark matter halos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio $ΔY/ΔZ$ from nearby field stars using Gaia DR3 photometry</a><span class="id">[2509.24376]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the feasibility of accurately determining the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio, $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$, from Gaia DR3 photometry for nearby low-mass main sequence field stars. We selected a sample of 2770 nearby MS stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue, covering a Gaia $M_G$ absolute magnitude range of 6.0 to 6.8 mag. We computed a dense grid of isochrones, with $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ varying from 0.4 to 3.2. These models were then used to fit the observations using the SCEPtER pipeline. The fitted values indicated that $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ values of $1.5 \pm 0.5$ were dequate for most stars. However, several clues suggested caution ought to be taken in interpreting this result. Chief among these concerns is the trend of decreasing $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ with increasing $M_G$ magnitude, as well as the discrepancy between the red and blue parts of the observations. This result is further supported by our additional analysis of mock data, which were sampled and fitted from the same isochrone grid. In the mock data, no such trend emerged, while the uncertainty remained as large as 0.7. The robustness of our conclusions was confirmed by repeating the estimation using isochrones with Gaia magnitudes derived from different atmospheric models and by adopting a different stellar evolution code for stellar model computation. In both cases, the results changed drastically, clustering at $\Delta Y/\Delta Z \approx 0.4$, which is at the lower end of the allowed values. Considering the current uncertainties affecting stellar model computations, it appears that adopting field stars for calibration is not a viable approach, even when adopting precise Gaia photometry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAST search for circumstellar atomic hydrogen.

First, leveraging the calibrated distance measurements of PNe from Gaia Data Release 3, we utilize these ISM bubbles as observational tracers to investigate and constrain the Galactic rotation curve. Second, we note that distance determinations for some PNe remain unreliable, partly because their central stars are obscured by extended nebular envelopes or are misidentified.

Roman's huge exoplanet haul, and Galactic reach, will require new methods to leverage the full exoplanet demographic content of the combined microlensing and transit samples, given the different sensitivity bias of the techniques to planet and host properties and Galactic location. We present a framework for technique-agnostic exoplanet demography (TAED) that can allow large, multi-technique exoplanet samples to be combined for demographic studies. Our TAED forward modelling and retrieval framework uses parameterised model exoplanet demographic distributions to embed planetary systems within a stellar population synthesis model of the Galaxy, enabling internally consistent forecasts to be made for all detection methods that are based on spatio-kinematic system properties. In this paper, as a first test of the TAED framework, we apply it to simulated transit datasets based on the Kepler Data Release 25 to assess parameter recovery accuracy and method scalability for a single large homogeneous dataset. We find that optimisation using differential evolution provides a computationally scalable framework that gives a good balance between computational efficiency and accuracy of parameter recovery.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24555" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M3DIS - A grid of 3D radiation-hydrodynamics stellar atmosphere models for stellar surveys.

Carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars</a><span class="id">[2509.24555]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the origin and evolution of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars is key to tracing the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment. We investigate how realistic 3D radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) model atmospheres affect carbon abundances in CEMP stars and implications for their classification and Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We focus on biases from traditional 1D hydrostatic models. We use the M3DIS code to compute 3D RHD model atmospheres for main-sequence and sub-giant stars over a wide range of metallicities and carbon enhancements. Synthetic spectra of the CH G-band are calculated with 3D radiative transfer and compared to spectra from classical 1D MARCS models. We derive abundance corrections and apply them to a large SAGA database sample to quantify effects on the carbon abundance distribution and CEMP classification. Our new 3D CEMP models predict cooler upper atmospheric layers than in 1D models, resulting in stronger CH absorption and lower inferred carbon abundances by up to -0.9 dex at the lowest metallicities. Carbon enhancement in the atmosphere itself increases molecular opacities and leads to radiative re-heating, partly offsetting adiabatic cooling in 3D models and reducing 3D-1D abundance corrections. Applying these corrections lowers the CEMP fraction by up to 20% below [Fe/H]=-3 and alters the relative contribution of CEMP sub-classes. The fraction of CEMP-no stars increases while the number of CEMP-r/s stars decreases, due to the downward revision of absolute carbon abundances. These changes bring the Galactic carbon distribution into better agreement with GCE models assuming a 20% contribution from faint supernovae. Realistic model atmospheres are essential to reliably reconstruct the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment history.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24584" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical model of Praesepe and its tidal tails</a><span class="id">[2509.24584]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. The dynamical evolution of open clusters in the tidal field of the Milky Way and the feeding of the disc field star population depend strongly on the initial conditions at the time of gas removal. Detailed dynamical models tailored to individual clusters help us understand the role of open clusters in the Galactic disc evolution. Aims. We present a detailed dynamical model of Praesepe, which reproduces the mass profile, the stellar mass function, and the mass segregation observed with the help of Gaia EDR3 data. Based on this model, we investigate the kinematic properties of the tidal tail stars in detail. Methods. We used direct N-body simulations along the eccentric orbit of Praesepe in the tidal field of the Milky Way, where each particle represents one star. The initial mass and size of the cluster, the dynamical state, and the initial mass function were adapted to reach the best-fitting model. Based on this model and a comparison model on a circular orbit, we analysed the stars in the tidal tails in terms of density, angular momentum, and orbit shapes. Results. Praesepe can be well reproduced by a cluster model with concentrated star formation in a supervirial state after instantaneous gas expulsion, adopting a global star formation efficiency of 17%. About 75% of the initially 7500 MSol are lost in the violent relaxation phase, and the observed mass segregation can be understood by two-body relaxation. We find that the self-gravity of the tail stars is the dominant force altering the angular momentum of the tail stars. For a typical star, the total change after escaping is about 1.6 kpc km/s. This corresponds to an offset in guiding radius of 7 pc, where tail stars contribute up to 70% to the alteration. The total radial shift of the orbit of the cluster in the Galactic plane can exceed 50 pc. This effect is not a result of the eccentricity of the orbit.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24705" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From order to chaos: the blurred out metallicity gradient of the Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage progenitor</a><span class="id">[2509.24705]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The powerful combination of Gaia with other Milky Way large survey data has ushered in a deeper understanding of the assembly history of our Galaxy, which is marked by the accretion of Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GES). As a step towards reconstructing this significant merger, we examine the existence and destruction of its stellar metallicity gradient. We investigate 8 GES-like progenitors from the Auriga simulations and find that all have negative metallicity gradients at infall with a range of -0.09 to -0.03 dex/kpc against radius and -1.99 to -0.41 dex/$\rm 10^{-5} km^{2}s^{-2}$ against the stellar orbital energy. These gradients get blurred and become shallower when measured at $z=0$ in the Milky Way-like host. The percentage change in the radial metallicity gradient is consistently high (78-98\%), while the percentage change in the energy space varies much more (9-91\%). We also find that the most massive progenitors show the smallest changes in their energy metallicity gradients. At the same present-day galactocentric radius, lower metallicity stars originate from the outskirts of the GES progenitor. Similarly, at fixed metallicity, stars at higher galactocentric radii tend to originate from the GES outskirts. We find that the GES stellar mass, total mass, infall time, and the present-day Milky Way total mass are correlated with the percentage change in metallicity gradient, both in radius and in energy space. It is therefore vital to constrain these properties further to pin down the infall metallicity gradient of the GES progenitor and understand the onset of such ordered chemistry at cosmic noon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24876" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Outbursting YSOs Catalogue (OYCAT)</a><span class="id">[2509.24876]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>YSOs can display unpredictable and high-amplitude rises in brightness that can last from a few months to possibly over 100 years. These types of outbursts are explained by large changes in the mass accretion rate from the disk onto the central star. The outbursts support to a model of star formation (episodic accretion) where stars would spend most of their lifetimes accreting at low rates, and gain most of their mass through these short-lived accretion outbursts. The universality of episodic accretion, as well as its potential impact on stellar and planetary formation are still under debate. Improvement on the statistics of the members of the eruptive class is needed to better understand the episodic accretion phenomenon and its universality across different mass regimes and environments. In this paper we collect published information on the spectroscopic and photometric characteristics of 174 YSOs confirmed to belong to the eruptive variable class. We classify these objects into five different sub-classes (we find 49 FUor, 20 FUor-like, 16 EX Lupi-type, 81 Peculiar/V1647 Ori-like/MNors and 8 Periodic YSOs). The classification follows what has been done previously in the literature, and it is not an attempt to redefine these classes. In addition, we present a list of 18 embedded, and 6 massive YSOs, as additional categories of eruptive variable YSOs. Due to the complexity and/or faintness of these systems, it is hard to place them into the original classification scheme of this class of variable YSOs. Finally, we present a separate list of 355 candidate eruptive variable YSOs, which either lack spectroscopic information or the available spectroscopic data is not sufficient for an unambiguous classification. The online catalogue of confirmed and candidate eruptive YSOs will be maintained and updated in the future to serve as an important reference for the star formation community.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The first GLIMPSE of the faint galaxy population at Cosmic Dawn with JWST: The evolution of the ultraviolet luminosity function across z 9-15</a><span class="id">[2509.24881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using ultra-deep JWST NIRCam imaging from the GLIMPSE Survey, enhanced by gravitational lensing of the AbellS1063 cluster, we investigate the faintest galaxies ever observed in the redshift range z 9 to z 15. We identify 105 galaxy candidates within this range, spanning absolute ultraviolet (UV) magnitudes from M_UV -18 to M_UV -13 mag, about three magnitudes fainter, on average, than prior JWST studies. We place strong constraints on the ultra-faint end of the UV luminosity function (UVLF), finding minimal evolution in the faint-end slope, which varies from $\alpha=-2.01\pm0.20 at z=9 to \alpha=-2.10\pm0.19$ at z=13. This behaviour contrasts with the rapid evolution of the faint-end slope observed from z 0 to z 9. By integrating the UVLF down to M_UV=-16, we derive the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD)from z=9 to z=13, revealing a best-fit redshift evolution that follows $\propto(1+z)^{-2.94^{+0.06}_{-0.10}}$. This slope is significantly shallower than predictions from most theoretical models. Extending the integration limit to M_UV=-13, we find that galaxies fainter than M_UV=-16 contribute more than 50% of the total cosmic SFR density at z 12. The observed excess in the cosmic SFRD at these high redshifts may suggest an enhancement in the star formation efficiency during the earliest phases of galaxy formation. Alternatively, this could result from other physical mechanisms, such as bursty star formation histories; minimal dust attenuation; or an evolving initial mass function. However, existing models that incorporate these scenarios fail to fully reproduce the observed redshift evolution of SFRD. Finally, we acknowledge the potential impact of low-redshift contamination and cosmic variance, as the small survey volume may not represent the broader galaxy population. Similar observations in different fields and spectroscopic confirmation are required to validate these findings</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black hole dragging: a new mechanism for forming nuclear star clusters in giant elliptical galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.25011]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It has long been thought that nuclear star clusters (NSCs) cannot co-exist with the most massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs), since SMBH mergers - unavoidable for the most massive systems - would scatter away NSC stars. However, central concentrations of light have now been reported in up to a third of all massive ellipticals. We present a new mechanism for forming NSCs in giant elliptical galaxies, arising naturally from SMBH mergers, which could explain these observations. We call this ”black hole dragging”. After a major merger of two galaxies and their SMBHs, the newly-merged SMBH can receive a gravitational wave recoil kick. We show that recoiling SMBHs induce two competing effects on the galaxy's background stars. Firstly, some stars become bound to the SMBH and co-move with it, an effect strongest at low recoil velocities. Secondly, background stars are ejected as the recoiling SMBH falls back due to dynamical friction, an effect strongest at high recoil velocities. At intermediate recoil velocities (500-1000 km/s), both effects become important, and the density of bound stars can exceed that of the background stellar core. This yields a central dense NSC that is clearly visible in the galaxy's surface brightness profile. We show that NSCs formed in this way have realistic sizes, masses and velocity dispersions when measured similarly to observed systems. This provides a route for even giant ellipticals containing SMBHs to host an NSC. We predict such NSCs should have indistinguishable colors, ages and chemistry from non-NSC central stars, combined with low ellipticities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25029" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the \ion{He}{2} re-Ionization ERa via Absorbing \ion{C}{4} Historical Yield (HIERACHY) IV: A complex redshifted absorption system intrinsic to quasar</a><span class="id">[2509.25029]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-resolution spectra provide a powerful tool in studying the associated absorption lines (AALs) in quasars.

By combining these with the hydrogen number density and ionization parameter derived from photoionization modeling, we infer that the different components are located at distances of 2.3 to 9.5 kpc from the quasar. The derived $N_{\mathrm H} / n_{\mathrm e}$ and the partial coverage observed in low ions all require cloud sizes smaller than 1 pc, even down to 0.01 pc. Finally, the low kinetic luminosity of the gas ($&lt; 0.5\% L_\mathrm{bol}$) indicates that it is insufficient to drive significant AGN feedback and may only suppress star formation via `multistage' mechanism.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interstellar Dust-Catalyzed Molecular Hydrogen Formation Enabled by Nuclear Quantum Effects</a><span class="id">[2509.25070]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) is one of the key chemical species that controls and shapes a wide spectrum of astrophysical processes ranging from galaxy evolution to planet formation. Although the catalyzation on dust grain surfaces is considered as the dominant formation channel of H$_2$ in the interstellar medium (ISM), which could nonetheless suffer from the Boltzmann factor suppression at low temperatures. Here we demonstrate that quantum tunneling can dominate the H$_2$ formation process, effectively resolving the long-standing efficiency problem across a wide range of temperatures. By employing the path integral method in hybrid Monte Carlo simulations to account for nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), we quantitatively identify that the tunneling of hydrogen atoms maintains relatively stable efficiencies even at temperatures below 50 K on both graphitic and silicate grain surfaces. The potential barriers associated with chemisorption/desorption and two-H association, rather than diffusion and hopping, are the dominant factors governing the actual reaction efficiency at low temperatures. These findings provide a solid physical foundation for molecule formation, which historically relied on ad-hoc formation rate multipliers to explain observed rates. The quantitative rates also offer new methodologies for observational constraints on H$_2$ formation and destruction, thereby enabling more accurate astrophysical models and interpretations on interstellar molecular materials.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25099" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Stellar Content of NGC 3603 Revisited: Is the IMF Top Heavy?</a><span class="id">[2509.25099]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Studies of the resolved stellar populations of young massive clusters have shown that the slope of the initial mass function appears to be the same everywhere, with no dependence on stellar density or metallicity. At the same time, studies of integrated properties of galaxies usually conclude that the IMF does vary, and must be top-heavy in starburst regions. In order to investigate this, we have carried out a long-term project to characterize the massive star content of NGC 3603, the nearest giant HII region, known to have a rich population of massive stars. We used both ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging to obtain photometry, and employed Gaia to establish membership. We obtained spectra of 128 stars using the Magellan 6.5 m telescope and HST, and combine these data to produce a reddening map. After analyzing the data in the same way as we have for 25 other star-forming regions in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, we find that the IMF slope of NGC 3603 is quite normal compared to other clusters, with Gamma=-0.9+/-0.1. If anything, there are fewer very high mass (&gt;65Mo) stars than one would expect by extrapolation from lower masses. This slope is also indistinguishable from what several studies have shown for R136 in the LMC, an even richer region. We speculate that the depreciation of the highest mass bins in NGC 3603, but not in R136, may indicate that it is harder to form extremely massive stars at the higher metallicity of the Milky Way compared to that of the LMC.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V\textit{z}$-$GAL: Probing Cold Molecular Gas in Dusty Star-forming Galaxies at $\bf \textit{z}=1-6$</a><span class="id">[2509.25167]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first results of V\textit{z}-GAL, a high-redshift CO(\textit{J} = 1 $-$ 0) large survey with the Karl G.

This flux density-limited sample includes 106 DSFGs in total, along with 14 galaxies from a recent pilot study – altogether doubling the to-date available high-redshift \coonezero observations. These sources cover redshifts 1 to 6 with available mid/high-\textit{J} CO transitions from the Northern Extended Millimeter Array \zgal survey. We detect \coonezero emission in 90/92 targets above signal-to-noise ratio of 2, while two DSFGs remain undetected. \vzgal also covers additional \cotwoone emission lines in 10 of these sources. We find gas masses of the entire \vzgal sample to be $\rm (\alpha_{CO}/{4.0}) \mu {M}_{\rm H_2}$ = $(2-20) \times {10}^{11}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, calibrated using \coonezero line luminosities. We confirm that these DSFGs – with derived gas depletion timescales of $(50-600)$ Myr – represent a heterogeneous population, potentially comprising both main-sequence galaxies and starbursts in the early Universe. Using \coonezero luminosities as an anchor, we robustly derive the CO brightness temperature ratios with a good statistical significance up to \textit{J} = 6. Our measurements reveal a broad range of gas excitation conditions across the \vzgal DSFGs. We also explore [CI](1$-$0)/CO(1$-$0) ratios in 23 \vzgal galaxies that have existing detections of atomic carbon ground-state emission, [CI](1$-$0), from the \zgal survey. Our results show similar [CI]/CO ratio values across cosmic time for starbursts and local star-forming galaxy populations, supporting the use of \cionezero as an alternative cold gas tracer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09910" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Till the core collapses: the evolution and properties of self-interacting dark matter subhalos</a><span class="id">[2310.09910]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the hottest questions in the cosmology of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is whether scatterings can induce detectable core-collapse in halos by the present day. Because gravitational tides can accelerate core-collapse, the most promising targets to observe core-collapse are satellite galaxies and subhalo systems. However, simulating small subhalos is computationally intensive, especially when subhalos start to core-collapse. In this work, we present a hierarchical framework for simulating a population of SIDM subhalos, which reduces the computation time to linear order in the total number of subhalos. With this method, we simulate substructure lensing systems with multiple velocity-dependent SIDM models, and show how subhalo evolution depends on the SIDM model, subhalo mass and orbits. We find that an SIDM cross section of $\gtrsim 200$ cm$^2$/g at velocity scales relevant for subhalos' internal heat transfer is needed for a significant fraction of subhalos to core-collapse in a typical lens system at redshift $z=0.5$, and that core-collapse has unique observable features in lensing. We show quantitatively that core-collapse in subhalos is typically accelerated compared to field halos, except when the SIDM cross section is non-negligible ($\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(1)$ cm$^2$/g) at subhalos' orbital velocities, in which case evaporation by the host can delay core-collapse. This suggests that substructure lensing can be used to probe velocity-dependent SIDM models, especially if line-of-sight structures (field halos) can be distinguished from lens-plane subhalos. Intriguingly, we find that core-collapse in subhalos can explain the recently reported ultra-steep density profiles of substructures found by lensing with the \emph{Hubble Space Telescope}</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pair creation in the vortex-driven magnetic fields of black holes</a><span class="id">[2408.01611]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the effects of pair creation on the radiation emerging from black holes under the assumption that the magnetic fields are vortex driven.

Depending on particular physical parameters, it has been shown that in certain scenarios high or very high energy emission generated by black holes will be strongly suppressed, thus, will be unable to escape a zone where radiation is generated. In particular, photons with energies exceeding $\sim 1$ GeV will never leave the magnetosphere if they are generated at the scale 10$R_g$ and the threshold is of the order of $1$ TeV, if the emission is produced at $\sim 100\; R_g$. Analysing the process versus the black hole mass, assuming the region $100\; R_g$, it has been shown that for the considered lowest mass, the photons with energies $250$ GeV will never leave the black hole and for the considered highest mass the corresponding value is $\sim 250$ TeV.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radial Transport in High-Redshift Disk Galaxies Dominated by Inflowing Streams</a><span class="id">[2409.01589]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the radial transport of cold gas within simulated disk galaxies at cosmic noon, aiming at distinguishing between disk instability and accretion along cold streams from the cosmic web as its driving mechanism. Disks are selected based on kinematics and flattening from the VELA zoom-in hydro-cosmological simulations. The radial velocity fields in the disks are mapped, their averages are computed as a function of radius and over the whole disk, and the radial mass flux in each disk as a function of radius is obtained. The transport directly associated with fresh incoming streams is identified by selecting cold gas cells that are either on incoming streamlines or have low metallicity. The radial velocity fields in VELA disks are found to be highly non-axisymmetric, showing both inflows and outflows. However, in most cases, the average radial velocities, both as a function of radius and over the whole disk, are directed inwards, with the disk-averaged radial velocities typically amounting to a few percent of the disk-averaged rotational velocities. This is significantly lower than the expectations from various models that analytically predict the inward mass transport as driven by torques associated with disk instability. Under certain simplifying assumptions, the latter typically predict average inflows of more than $10\%$ of the rotational velocities. Analyzing the radial motions of streams and off-stream material, we find that the radial inflow in VELA disks is dominated by the stream inflows themselves, especially in the outer disks. The high inward radial velocities inferred in observed disks at cosmic noon, at the level of $\sim \! 20\%$ of the rotational velocities, may reflect inflowing streams from the cosmic web rather than being generated by disk instability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14621" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diversity and universality: evolution of dwarf galaxies with self-interacting dark matter</a><span class="id">[2412.14621]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter halos with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) experience a unique evolutionary phenomenon, in that their central regions eventually collapse to high density through the runaway gravothermal process after initially forming a large and low-density core. When coupled with orbital evolution, this is expected to naturally produce a large diversity in dark-matter halos' inner mass distribution, potentially explaining the diversity problem of dwarf galaxies. However, it remains unknown how the diversity in SIDM dark-matter halos propagates to the more easily observed luminous matter at the center of the halo, especially the stellar component. In this work, we use idealized N-body simulations with two species of particles (dark matter and stars) to study the response of the stellar properties of field and satellite dwarf galaxies to SIDM evolution and orbital effects on their halos. Galaxies' stellar components, including galaxy size, mass-to-light ratio, and stellar velocity dispersion, display a much larger scatter in SIDM than the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. Importantly, we find signs of universality in the evolution pathways, or &quot;tidal tracks&quot;, of SIDM dwarf satellites, which are physically interpretable and potentially parameterizable. This type of tidal-track model can be layered onto larger-scale, cosmological simulations to reconstruct the evolution of populations of SIDM dwarfs in cases where high-resolution simulations of galaxies are otherwise prohibitively expensive.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10748" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SIDM Concerto: Compilation and Data Release of Self-interacting Dark Matter Zoom-in Simulations</a><span class="id">[2503.10748]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present SIDM Concerto: $14$ cosmological zoom-in simulations in cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models based on the Symphony and Milky Way-est suites.

Each host contains $\approx 2\times 10^7$ particles and is run in CDM and one or more strong, velocity-dependent SIDM models. Our analysis of SIDM (sub)halo populations over seven subhalo mass decades reveals that (1) the fraction of core-collapsed isolated halos and subhalos peaks at a maximum circular velocity corresponding to the transition of the SIDM cross section from a $v^{-4}$ to $v^0$ scaling; (2) SIDM subhalo mass functions are suppressed by $\approx 50\%$ relative to CDM in LMC, MW, and group-mass hosts but are consistent with CDM in the low-mass cluster host; (3) subhalos' inner density profile slopes, which are more diverse in SIDM than in CDM, are sensitive to both the amplitude and shape of the SIDM cross section.

They are presumed to have been ejected from their birth places by one or more energetic mechanisms, including supernova explosions. Accurate radial velocities are essential for investigating their origin, by tracing back their Galactic orbits to look for close encounters in space and in time with neutron stars and young associations. While most studies of runaways have focused on OB stars, later-type stars have also been considered on occasion. Here we report the results of a long-term high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring program with the goal of providing accurate radial velocities for 188 runaway candidates of spectral type A and later, proposed by Tetzlaff et al. (2011). We obtained multiple measurements over a period of about 13 yr to guard against the possibility that some may be members of binary or multiple systems, adding archival observations going back another 25 yr in some cases. We report new spectroscopic orbital solutions for more than three dozen systems. Many more are also found to be binaries based on available astrometric information. A small-scale study carried out here to trace back the paths of our targets together with those of four well-studied, optically-visible neutron stars among the so-called Magnificent Seven, resulted in no credible encounters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multidimensional half-moment multigroup radiative transfer. Improving moment-based thermal models of circumstellar disks</a><span class="id">[2504.13999]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Common moment-based radiative transfer methods, such as flux-limited diffusion (FLD) and the M1 closure, suffer from artificial interactions between crossing beams. In protoplanetary disks, this leads to an overestimation of the midplane temperature due to the merging of inward and outward vertical fluxes. Methods that avoid these artifacts typically require angular discretization, which can be computationally expensive. In the spirit of the two-stream approximation, we introduced a half-moment (HM) closure that integrates the radiative intensity over hemispheres, thereby suppressing beam interactions along a fixed spatial direction. We derived a multidimensional HM closure via entropy maximization and replaced this closure with an approximate expression that closely matches it, coinciding with it in the diffusion and free-streaming regimes while remaining expressible through simple operations. We implemented HM and M1 closures via implicit-explicit schemes, including multiple frequency groups. We tested these methods in numerical benchmarks such as computing the temperature in an irradiated disk around a T Tauri star, comparing our results with Monte Carlo (MC) radiative transfer simulations. The HM closure correctly reproduces the diffusion limit and prevents crossing flux interactions in a chosen spatial direction. In disk simulations, our multigroup HM method closely matches midplane temperature distributions obtained with classical MC methods. While the M1 closure produces midplane temperatures 44% higher than MC with one frequency group and 21% higher with 22 groups, HM reduces this discrepancy to 6% with 22 groups. Even with just three groups, HM significantly outperforms M1, with maximum departures of 8% compared to M1's 23%. Our results show that combining HM with a multigroup treatment yields more realistic disk temperatures than M1, particularly in optically thick regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Stellar Flybys are Unlikely: Improved Constraints from Sednoids and Large-$q$ TNOs</a><span class="id">[2505.16317]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sedna-like objects (a.k.a. sednoids) are transneptunian objects (TNOs) characterized by large semimajor axes and exceptionally high perihelia. Their high-$q$ orbits are detached from the influence of the four giant planets and need extra perturbation to form. One hypothesis posits that close stellar flybys could have perturbed objects from the primordial scattering disk, generating the sednoid population. In this study, we run N-body simulations with different stellar encounter configurations to explore whether such a close stellar flyby can satisfy new constraints identified from sednoid (and detached extreme TNO) observation, including the low-inclination ($i&lt;30^\circ$) profile and primordial orbital alignment. Our results suggest that flybys with field stars are unable to generate a sufficient population, whereas flybys within the birth cluster fail to produce the primordial orbital alignment. To meet the inclination constraint of detached extreme TNOs, flybys have to be either coplanar ($i_\star \sim 0^\circ$) or symmetric about the ecliptic plane ($\omega_\star \sim 0^\circ, i_\star \sim 90^\circ$). After taking into account their occurrence rate at the early stage of the Solar System, we conclude that close-in stellar flybys ($q_\star \le 1000$ au) that satisfy all constraints are unlikely to happen ($\lesssim$5\%). Future discoveries of additional sednoids with precise orbital determinations are crucial to confirm the existence of the low-inclination tendency and the primordial alignment, and to further constrain the early dynamical evolution of the Solar System.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10518" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the local supervoid solution to the Hubble tension with direct distance tracers</a><span class="id">[2506.10518]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Several observational studies suggest that the local few hundred Mpc around the Local Group are significantly underdense based on source number counts in redshift space across much of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in near-infrared galaxy counts. This “Keenan–Barger–Cowie (KBC) void”, “Local Hole”, or “local supervoid”, would have significant ramifications for the Hubble tension by generating outflows that masquerade as an enhanced local expansion rate. We evaluate models for the KBC void capable of resolving the Hubble tension with a background Planck cosmology. We fit these models to direct distances from the Tully–Fisher catalogue of the CosmicFlows-4 compilation using a field-level forward model. Depending on the adopted void density profile, we find the derived velocity fields to prefer a void size of less than 70 Mpc, which is less than 10 per cent of the fiducial size found by Haslbauer et al. based on the KBC luminosity density data. The predicted local Hubble constant is $72.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$, $70.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$, or $70.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ km/s/Mpc for an initial underdensity profile that is exponential, Gaussian, or Maxwell-Boltzmann, respectively. The latter two ameliorate the Hubble tension to within $3\sigma$ of the 4-anchor distance ladder approach of Breuval et al. giving $73.2 \pm 0.9$ km/s/Mpc. The exponential profile does achieve consistency with this measurement at just over $1\sigma$, but it is disfavoured by the Bayesian evidence. The preferred models produce bulk flow curves that disagree with recent estimates from CosmicFlows-4, despite the void models being flexible enough to match such estimates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BRAiSE: synthetic polarisation in RMHD AGN jet simulations</a><span class="id">[2506.19541]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new method to calculate the polarised synchrotron emission of radio AGN sources using magnetic field information from 3-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulations. Like its predecessor, which uses pressure as a proxy for the magnetic field, this method tracks the spatially resolved adiabatic and radiative loss processes using the method adapted from the Radio AGN in Semi-analytic Environments formalism. Lagrangian tracer particles in RMHD simulations carried out using the PLUTO code are used to track the fluid quantities of each `ensemble of electrons' through time to calculate the radio emissivity ex-situ. By using the magnetic field directly from simulations, the full set of linear Stokes parameters I, Q, and U can be calculated to study the synthetic radio polarisation of radio AGN sources. We apply this method to a suite of RMHD simulations to study their polarisation properties. The turbulent magnetic field present in radio lobes influences the emission, causing a complex clumpy structure that is visible at high resolution. Our synthetic polarisation properties are consistent with observations; we find that the fractional polarisation is highest (approximately 50 percent) at the lobe edges. We show that for the same source, the integrated and mean fractional polarisation depends on viewing angle to the source. At oblique viewing angles the behaviour of the integrated and mean fractional polarisation over time depends on the morphology of the jet cocoon. Using Faraday rotation measures, we reproduce known depolarisation effects such as the Laing-Garrington depolarisation asymmetry in jets angled to the line of sight. We show that the hotspots and hence the Fanaroff-Riley classification become less clear with our new, more accurate method.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19623" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power-law Emission-line Wings and Radiation-Driven Superwinds in Local Lyman Continuum Emitters</a><span class="id">[2506.19623]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate broad emission-line wings, reaching $\leq 800\rm~km~s^{-1}$, observed in 26 galaxies with Lyman continuum (LyC) observations, primarily from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS). Using Magellan/MIKE, VLT/X-shooter, and WHT/ISIS high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that this fast gas appears to probe the dominant feedback mechanisms linked to LyC escape. We find that in 14 galaxies, the wings are best fit with power laws of slope $\alpha \sim -3.5 \text{ to } -1.6$, with four others best fit by Gaussians of width $\sigma_{\rm BW} \sim 300~\rm km~s^{-1}$; the remaining eight show ambiguous wing morphologies. Gaussian wings are found only at low $O_{32}$ = $[\rm O~III]\lambda5007/[O~II]\lambda3726,3729$ and high metallicity, while power-law wings span the full range of these parameters. The general evidence suggests a dual-mode paradigm for LyC escape: radiation-driven superwinds traced by power-law wings and supernova-driven feedback traced by Gaussian wings. For the former, the $&lt;3$ Myr-old, pre-supernova stellar population correlates with more luminous, faster winds. The data also show that radiation-driven wind parameters like wind luminosity and power-law slope $\alpha$ depend on the UV luminosity more than the optically thick covering fraction, consistent with “picket-fence&quot; radiative transfer. Observed $\alpha$ values flatten with both escaping LyC luminosity and higher extinction, while still preserving the anticorrelation between these two quantities. Additionally, the differential between red and blue slopes implies that extinction and dense gas are centrally concentrated relative to the wind emission. Overall, our results show that power-law emission-line wings probe LyC-driven winds and LyC escape in metal-poor starbursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03685" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The late Miocene $^{10}$Be anomaly and the possibility of a supernova</a><span class="id">[2507.03685]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent measurements of cosmogenic $^{10}$Be in deep-ocean ferromanganese crusts from the Central and Northern Pacific have revealed an anomalous concentration between 11.5 and 9.0 Myr ago, peaking at 10.1 Myr. One possible explanation is a nearby supernova (SN) event. Motivated by this and by the proximity of the Solar System to the Orion star-forming region during that period, we estimate the probability that at least one SN occurred between the onset and peak of the anomaly. Using an open cluster catalog based on Gaia DR3, we trace back the orbits of 2725 clusters and the Sun over the past 20 Myr and compute the expected number of SN events. We find 19 clusters with a probability greater than 1% each of producing at least one SN within 100 pc of the Sun in the time interval 11.5-10.1 Myr ago. The total cumulative probability exceeds zero at 35 pc from the Sun and increases rapidly with distance, reaching 68% near 100 pc. Two young clusters dominate the SN probability: ASCC 20 contributes most within 70 pc, while OCSN 61 becomes more significant beyond that distance. Our results support the plausibility of a SN origin for the $^{10}$Be anomaly and highlight the importance of additional $^{10}$Be records from independent terrestrial archives to determine whether the anomaly is of astrophysical or terrestrial origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights for Early Massive Black Hole Growth from JWST Detection of the [Ne v] λ3427 Emission Line</a><span class="id">[2507.10681]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the narrow [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 emission line detected in the recently published JWST spectra of two galaxies, at z = 6.9 and 5.6, to study the key properties of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in their centers.

Using red giant stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia DR3, we model the age-dependent stellar kinematics with a quasi-isothermal distribution function and fit disc parameters as a function of age using non-parametric splines. We identify a transition from thick to thin disc populations around 10 Gyr ago. Stars older than this have short scale lengths ($\sim$1.7 kpc), typical of the thick disc, while younger stars exhibit increasing scale length with decreasing age, consistent with inside-out formation of the thin disc. This transition possibly coincides with the end of the starburst triggered by the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger. Stars formed around 10 Gyr ago exhibit a dip in scale length, even shorter than that of the thick disc. Comparison with an Auriga simulation suggests that this scale-length dip reflects gas disc shrinking caused by the transition from a cold to hot gas accretion mode. We propose the following disc formation scenario: (1) the thick disc formed under cold-mode accretion; (2) the GSE merger triggered a starburst and increased the total mass of the Galaxy, causing the transition to hot-mode accretion; (3) rapid gas consumption led to temporary shrinking of the star-forming gas disc; and then (4) thin disc grows in an inside-out fashion, as the size of the star-forming gas disc grows via hot-mode smooth gas accretion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Tale of Two Sightlines: Comparison of Hydrocarbon Dust Absorption Bands toward Cygnus OB2-12 and the Galactic Center</a><span class="id">[2508.12601]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Infrared spectra of hydrocarbon dust absorption bands toward the bright hypergiant Cygnus OB2-12 are compared to published spectra of the Quintuplet Cluster, a sightline to the Galactic center. The Cyg OB2-12 data include a new ground-based 2.86-3.70 microns spectrum and a previously published, but here further analyzed, spectrum of the 5.50-7.34 microns region. Higher spectral resolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 micron region allows a detailed comparison of the 3.4 micron aliphatic bands to those observed toward the Quintuplet. Despite differences in interstellar environments along each sightline, strong similarities are observed in the central wavelengths and relative strengths for bands at 3.3, 3.4, 5.85, 6.2, and 6.85 microns. Analysis of these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and oxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component of the diffuse interstellar medium, second in abundance only to silicates, and is primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely consist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC). Laboratory analog spectra reproduce the observed aliphatic absorption bands well, supporting the presence of such mantles. We present evidence that the carriers of both the 3.4 micron aliphatic and the 3.3 micron aromatic bands reside exclusively in the diffuse ISM, and that the 3.3 micron bands observed in the diffuse ISM differ from the 3.25 micron band seen in dense clouds, implying chemically distinct carriers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Group Spin Alignment with Cosmic Filament in the TNG Simulation</a><span class="id">[2508.20494]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the alignment between the spin vectors of galaxy groups and the axes of their nearest cosmic filaments using the TNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. By systematically analyzing a large sample of groups, we find a robust perpendicular alignment between group spin and filament orientation. Among all examined properties, only group mass and the distance to the nearest filament significantly affect the strength of this alignment: more massive groups and those closer to filaments exhibit a stronger perpendicular signal. In contrast, the alignment is largely insensitive to group richness, the stellar mass threshold used to select member galaxies, and redshift. We further quantify the bias introduced by using member galaxies as tracers of group spin, finding a typical misalignment angle of $\sim38^\circ$ between the spin measured from all dark matter particles and that inferred from member galaxies, independent of group richness or stellar mass cut. Our results provide a clear theoretical benchmark for interpreting observational measurements of spin-filament alignment and highlight the importance of considering group mass and environment. These findings help clarify the main factors influencing spin-filament alignment and provide useful context for future observational and theoretical studies of angular momentum in the cosmic web.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modified Cosmology or Modified Galaxy Astrophysics is Driving the z&gt;6 JWST Results?

This may require revisiting the physics of galaxy formation and evolution, or modifying the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model to explain these observations, or both. We show that high-resolution CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (or CMB-S4) can measure smoking-gun signatures jointly in weak lensing and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) power spectra, which can shed light on both these scenarios. An increase in the matter power spectrum at small scales will enhance the number density of dark matter halos at high redshifts, thereby increasing the galaxy formation rate. This will cause enhanced weak lensing signal from these redshifts and also lead to enhanced patchy-kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization. However, if only galaxy astrophysics is modified, without any modification in the matter power spectrum, then the patchy-kSZ signal gets altered, while the weak lensing signal remains nearly unaltered. We show that we can measure the modified astrophysical and cosmological scenarios at a statistical significance of $6.2\sigma$ (and $17.4\sigma$) from Simons Observatory (and CMB-S4), which will enable a conclusive understanding on what physical process is driving the high-redshift observations of JWST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resonant Locking Between Binary Systems Induced by Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2502.01733]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with matter is thought to be typically negligible in the Universe. We identify an exception in the case of resonant interactions, where GWs emitted by a background binary system, such as an inspiraling supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary, cause a resonant response in a stellar-mass foreground binary and the frequencies of the two systems become, and remain, synchronized. We point out that this previously unexplored dynamical phenomenon is not only possible, but can lead to $\mathcal{O}(30)$ binary systems becoming resonantly locked in the host galaxy of merging SMBHs of mass $10^{8.5-11}\Msun$, each of which has a significantly reduced merger time. We predict $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$ binary systems have been locked in the Universe's history.

With this principle, the prospect that the Galaxy contains a modest number of civilizations is preferred, where none have achieved technology levels sufficient to accomplish large-scale astro-engineering or lack the desire to do so. This consideration also leads to the expectation that no ETC will colonize a large fraction of the Galaxy, even using robotic probes, and that there are no long-duration high-power beacons. However, there is a reasonable chance that we may make contact on a short, by historical standards, timescale. This event would be momentous, but could still leave us slightly disappointed. Such a Universe would be less terrifying than either of the two possibilities in the quote generally attributed to Arthur C. Clarke on whether we are alone or not. Also, if there is a modest number of ETCs in the Galaxy, that would suggest that there is a large number of planets with some form of life.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22927" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Near-Infrared Spectral Characteristics of Water Ice, Epsomite, and Halite Mixtures Relevant to Europa</a><span class="id">[2509.22927]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We publish the first NIR spectra of grain particulate mixtures of water ice, epsomite, and halite at cryogenic temperatures. Furthermore, we perform a quantitative assessment of the ability of both intimately- and linearly-mixed models to reproduce laboratory data of different grain mixtures of water ice, as well as water ice mixed with epsomite. We find that smaller grains of water ice impart a stronger influence than larger grains of water ice on the 2.0 {\mu}m spectral feature in epsomite, and grain size signatures for both halite and epsomite are challenging to discern for larger grain sizes as a result of the saturated absorption features. These findings may indicate that an observation bias toward smaller grain sizes of ice could exist, and that quantitative assessments provided by spectral mixture analyses will be the most reliable method for determining compositions and abundances of materials. We also find that the linearly-mixed and intimately-mixed models of water ice appear to match the laboratory spectra as expected, though still display some inconsistencies, often either in the continuum or the absorption features. When modeling pure water ice and water ice mixed with epsomite, no discernible difference is observed between the fits of the linearly- and intimately-mixed models. Future spectral mixture analyses that use epsomite should be aware of a potential error in the published epsomite optical constant data, in which the cryogenic data appear to be taken at ambient conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23172" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHRONOS: Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter</a><span class="id">[2509.23172]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detector, the Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), optimized for the unexplored 0.1-10Hz band bridging the gap between the space-based LISA and future ground-based detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. CHRONOS combines a ring-cavity Sagnac interferometer with torsion-bar test masses to realize the first quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of angular momentum in a macroscopic system. By implementing a speed-meter readout in the rotational degree of freedom, CHRONOS coherently cancels quantum radiation-pressure noise and enables sub-Hz observations. We show that detuned power recycling and cavity-length optimization can simultaneously relax technical requirements on both torsion bars and speed meters. Assuming a realistic optical design with a 1m torsion bar, we estimate strain sensitivities of $h \simeq 1 \times 10^{-18}\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1Hz for detectors with arm lengths of 2.5m, 40m, and 300m. These sensitivities enable (i) direct detection of intermediate-mass black hole binaries up to 380Mpc with ${\rm SNR}=3$, (ii) probing stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds down to $\Omega_{\rm GW} \sim 3.2 \times 10^{-9}$ at 0.2Hz with 5yr accumulation. Furthermore, CHRONOS enables prompt detection of gravity-gradient signals from magnitude-5.5 earthquakes even with a 2.5m prototype. CHRONOS thus opens new opportunities for quantum-limited geophysical observation and multi-band, multi-messenger gravitational-wave astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cryogenic Materials Repository: A Public Resource and New Measurements for Cryogenic Research Applications</a><span class="id">[2509.23422]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Low-temperature systems play a vital role in a variety of scientific research applications, including the next generation of cosmology and astrophysics telescopes.

This paper challenges that paradigm, arguing that highly advanced, potentially post-biological civilisations may undergo rapid technological acceleration, quickly progressing beyond recognisable or detectable phases. We introduce a simple model showing that the technological acceleration rate of such civilisations can compress their detectable phase to mere decades, dramatically narrowing the temporal &quot;detection window&quot; in which their technosignatures overlap with our current capabilities. This framework offers a plausible resolution to the &quot;Great Silence&quot;: advanced civilisations may be abundant and long-lived, but effectively invisible to present-day SETI methods. Consequently, our efforts must include but also evolve beyond the search for narrow-band communication signals in the radio and optical domains. Instead, we require an expanded, technology-agnostic strategy focused on persistent, large-scale manifestations of intelligence, such as broadband electromagnetic leakage, waste heat from megastructures, and multi-dimensional anomaly detection across extensive, multi-wavelength and multi-messenger datasets. Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence for unsupervised anomaly discovery, recursive algorithm optimisation, and predictive modelling will be essential to uncover the subtle, non-anthropocentric traces of advanced civilisations whose technosignatures lie beyond our current technological and cognitive frameworks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASTROCO: Self-Supervised Conformer-Style Transformers for Light-Curve Embeddings</a><span class="id">[2509.24134]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present AstroCo, a Conformer-style encoder for irregular stellar light curves.

Several supervised and unsupervised data-intensive methods have recently been applied to identify polluted white dwarfs from the Gaia spectra. We present a comparison of these methods, along with the first application of $t$-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding ($t$SNE) to this dataset. We find that $t$SNE outperforms the similar technique Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), isolating over 50% more high-confidence polluted candidates, including 39 new candidates which are not selected by any other method investigated and which have not been observed at higher resolution. Supervised methods benefit greatly from data labels provided by earlier works, selecting many known polluted white dwarfs which are missed by unsupervised methods.

The Large-Sized Telescope prototype, LST-1, located on the Canary Island of La Palma, is responsible for observation of the low-energy range of the VHE gamma-ray spectrum. It is undergoing commissioning and has already observed the Crab Nebula as a standard reference source. Accurate reconstruction of shower parameters (e.g. energy, direction, and particle type) is crucial for achieving the scientific goals of the CTAO. In this work, we use CTLearn to implement deep-learning event reconstruction, as an alternative to the standard Random Forest method. CTLearn is built to be fully compatible with ctapipe, a framework for prototyping the low-level data processing algorithms for the CTAO, and can be seamlessly used for data analysis without changing the general framework. It implements convolution-neural-network based models that take the integrated charge and the relative peak time of calibrated pixels in cleaned images as an input, to infer the primary particle's properties. Using Crab Nebula observations as a validation sample, we explore two different approaches. The first is to train a model with Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations covering all possible altitude-azimuth coordinates of the Crab Nebula sample observations, resulting in a single model that can be used to reconstruct events from any Crab Nebula observations. The second approach is to train 10 models along this coordinate line, each incorporating a range of \textasciitilde10° in altitude.

It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations, is free of approximation switching schemes and is compatible with automatic differentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical components in a way that scales well in model space. The modeler should simply write down their equations, and SymBoltz solves them and eliminates much of the friction in the process. SymBoltz enables up to 100x shorter model definitions compared to browsing equivalent files in CLASS. Symbolic knowledge enables powerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages like the background and perturbations, generating the Jacobian matrix and its sparsity pattern, and interpolating arbitrary expressions from the solution. Modern implicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times, reducing slowdowns by taking long time steps, reusing the Jacobian and LU-factorizing it over several time steps, and using fast linear system solvers. Automatic differentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any input, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in large parameter spaces, training of emulators, Fisher forecasting and sensitivity analysis. These features are useful in their own rights, but also reinforce each other in a synergy. Results agree with established codes like CLASS and CAMB. With more work, SymBoltz can grow into an integrated symbolic-numeric cosmological modeling environment with a large library of models that delivers differentiable output as fast as other codes. SymBoltz is available at this https URL with single-command installation and extensive documentation, and welcomes questions, suggestions and contributions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24870" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Closing the Evidence Gap: reddemcee, a Fast Adaptive Parallel Tempering Sampler</a><span class="id">[2509.24870]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) excels at sampling complex posteriors but traditionally lags behind nested sampling in accurate evidence estimation, which is crucial for model comparison in astrophysical problems.

Three evidence estimators are provided: Curvature-aware Thermodynamic Integration (TI+), Geometric-Bridge Stepping Stones (SS+), and a novel Hybrid algorithm that blends both approaches (H+). Performance and accuracy are benchmarked on n-dimensional Gaussian Shells, Gaussian Egg-box, Rosenbrock Functions, and exoplanet radial-velocity time-series of HD 20794. Across Shells up to 15 dimensions, reddemcee presents roughly 7 times the effective sampling speed of the best dynamic nested sampling configuration. The TI+, SS+ and H+ estimators recover estimates under 3 percent error and supply realistic uncertainties with as few as six temperatures. In the HD 20794 case study, reddemcee reproduces literature model rankings and yields tighter yet consistent planetary parameters compared with dynesty, with evidence errors that track run-to-run dispersion.

We construct a correlation graph with pulsars as its nodes, and analyze the graph-based summary statistics, which include topological and geometrical characteristics, for identifying SGWB in real and synthetic datasets. The effect of the number of pulsars, the observation time span, and the strength of the SGWB on the graph-based feature vector is evaluated. Our results demonstrate that the merit feature vector for common signal detection consists of the average clustering coefficient and the edge weight fluctuation. The SGWB detection conducted after the observation of a common signal and then exclusion of non-Hellings &amp; Downs templates is performed by the second cumulant of edge weight for angular separation thresholds $\bar{\zeta}\gtrsim 40^{\circ}$.

Our classifier outperforms a simple criterion based on fitting the light curve with a flare template and significantly surpasses a gradient-boosted classifier trained only on model-independent features. False positives appear related to flaring light curves that are not associated with a stellar counterpart, while false negatives often correspond to multiple flares or otherwise peculiar or noisy curves. We apply our trained classifier to currently unlabeled sources, releasing the largest catalog of X-ray stellar flares to date.

Prime-Cam is a first generation multi-band, wide-field camera for FYST, designed to field up to seven instrument modules and provide unprecedented sensitivity across a broad frequency range.

During the optically open test, we achieved stable base temperatures of 1.5 K on the 1 K stage and 85 mK at the detector stage. In the cold load configuration, we measured a detector focal plane RMS temperature stability of 3.2e-5 K. From this stability measurement, we demonstrate that the equivalent power from focal plane thermal fluctuations is only 0.0040% of a 5pW incident photon power for aluminum detectors and 0.0023% for titanium-nitride detectors, a negligible level for CCAT science goals.

In-lab testing of Mod-Cam and the first CCAT instrument module, a 280 GHz broadband camera fielding over 10,000 kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs), is currently underway. CCAT's first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam, will field approximately 100,000 KIDs across seven instrument modules. Like Mod-Cam, it employs 46 cm long low-thermal-conductivity flexible circuits (&quot;stripline&quot;) between 4 K and 300 K to connect large arrays of multiplexed detectors in each instrument module to readout electronics. The 280 GHz camera currently installed in Mod-Cam uses six striplines to read out its over 10,000 detectors across 18 RF chains, each individual stripline containing six traces. In-lab testing thus far has allowed us to begin optimizing the attenuation in the readout chains for each of the three detector arrays in the 280 GHz module and demonstrate simultaneous readout of all networks using CCAT's RFSoC warm readout electronics. Here we present an overview of the Mod-Cam cold readout and discuss the stripline performance by investigating how its thermal conductivity impacts Mod-Cam and Prime-Cam cryogenic performance. We also report on stripline electrical transmission and crosstalk, identifying transition printed circuit boards (PCBs) as the dominant source of crosstalk. Using this result we outline design improvements to these PCBs that enhance isolation between readout networks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gCAMB: A GPU-accelerated Boltzmann solver for next-generation cosmological surveys</a><span class="id">[2509.25110]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inferring cosmological parameters from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data requires repeated and computationally expensive calculations of theoretical angular power spectra using Boltzmann solvers like CAMB. This creates a significant bottleneck, particularly for non-standard cosmological models and the high-accuracy demands of future surveys. While emulators based on deep neural networks can accelerate this process by several orders of magnitude, they first require large, pre-computed training datasets, which are costly to generate and model-specific. To address this challenge, we introduce gCAMB, a version of the CAMB code ported to GPUs, which preserves all the features of the original CPU-only code. By offloading the most computationally intensive modules to the GPU, gCAMB significantly accelerates the generation of power spectra, saving massive computational time, halving the power consumption in high-accuracy settings and, among other purposes, facilitating the creation of extensive training sets needed for robust cosmological analyses. We make the gCAMB software available to the community at this https URL .</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards a foundation model for astrophysical source detection: An End-to-End Gamma-Ray Data Analysis Pipeline Using Deep Learning</a><span class="id">[2509.25128]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The increasing volume of gamma-ray data demands new analysis approaches that can handle large-scale datasets while providing robustness for source detection.

Time-integrated methods, such as the generalised Lomb-Scargle (GLS) periodogram, provide a robust statistical assessment of persistent periodicities but are insensitive to transient events. Conversely, existing time-frequency methods often rely on fixed-duration windows or interpolation, which can be suboptimal for non-uniform data. We introduce the non-uniform Stockwell-transform (NUST), a time-frequency framework that applies a localized density adaptive spectral analysis directly to non-uniformly sampled data. NUST employs a doubly adaptive window that adjusts its width based on both frequency and local data density, providing detailed time-frequency information for both transient and persistent signals. We validate the NUST on numerous non-uniformly sampled synthetic signals, demonstrating its superior time-localization performance compared to GLS. Furthermore, we apply NUST to HARPS radial velocity data of the multi-planetary system HD 10180, successfully distinguishing coherent planetary signals from stellar activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microwave SQUID Multiplexer Readout Performance Using a Direct-RF RFSoC-Based Software-Defined Radio</a><span class="id">[2509.23569]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we report the experimental readout results of a {\mu}MUX device using a Direct-RF SDR prototype based on the ZCU216 Radio-Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) evaluation board.

Precise calibration of the detector response is essential for accurately estimating parameters of gravitational wave sources. A photon calibrator is a crucial calibration tool used in laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory, Virgo, and KAGRA, and it was utilized in joint observation 3 with GEO600 in Germany in April 2020. In this paper, KAGRA implemented three key enhancements: a high-power laser, a power stabilization system, and remote beam position control. KAGRA employs a 20 W laser divided into two beams that are injected onto the mirror surface. By utilizing a high-power laser, the response of the detector at kHz frequencies can be calibrated. To independently control the power of each laser beam, an optical follower servo was installed for power stabilization. The optical path of the photon calibrator beam positions was controlled using pico-motors, allowing for the characterization of the detector rotation response. Additionally, a telephoto camera and quadrant photodetectors were installed to monitor beam positions, and beam position control was implemented to optimize the mirror response. In this paper, we discuss the statistical errors associated with the measurement of relative power noise. We also address systematic errors related to the power calibration model of the photon calibrator and the simulation of elastic deformation effects using finite element analysis. Ultimately, we have successfully reduced the total systematic error from the photon calibrator to 2.0 /%.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The CONDOR Observatory: A Gamma-Ray Observatory with a 100 GeV Threshold at 5300 Meters Above Sea Level</a><span class="id">[2503.08850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the design of the Compact Network of Detectors with Orbital Range (CONDOR), a proposed high-altitude gamma-ray and cosmic-ray (CR) observatory set to become the highest of its kind.

However, their dynamic and multiscale nature, along with several orders of magnitude variations in intensity, pose significant observational challenges. To date, at gigahertz frequencies, MeerKAT stands out globally with high potential of producing high-fidelity, spectroscopic snapshot images of the Sun, enabled by its dense core, high sensitivity, and broad frequency coverage. Yet, as a telescope originally designed for observing faint galactic and extragalactic sources, observing the Sun at the boresight of the telescope requires customized observing strategies and calibration methods. This work demonstrates the technical readiness of MeerKAT for solar observations at the boresight of the telescope in the UHF (580-1015 MHz) and L-band (900-1670 MHz) frequency ranges, including optimized modes, a dedicated calibration scheme, and a tailored, entirely automated calibration and imaging pipeline. The quality of solar images is validated through morphological comparisons with the solar images at other wavelengths. Several unique early science results showcase the potential of this new capability of MeerKAT. Once fully commissioned and operational, this will unlock novel solar studies, significantly expand the scientific portfolio of MeerKAT, and lay the groundwork for solar observations with the mid-frequency telescope of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory, for which MeerKAT serves as a precursor.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Error signals for overcoming the laser power limits of gravitational-wave detectors</a><span class="id">[2509.06840]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A major barrier to improving the quantum-limited sensitivity of gravitational-wave observatories is the thermal distortions of the test masses which arise at megawatt laser power. Recent advances in a new form of higher-order wavefront correction, in which corrective heating profiles are applied to the test mass surfaces near their edges, together with other planned instrumental upgrades, have the potential to enable a tenfold reduction of the quantum noise floor of future detectors. However, realizing high levels of quantum noise reduction in practice hinges on identifying measurable error signals to finely control each wavefront actuator, in order to suppress wavefront errors to a few-nanometer precision across the full mirror apertures. No direct source of such an error signal exists in LIGO today. We demonstrate that thermally imaging the surface of each test mass can provide these critical error signals. We show that the surface temperature profiles obtained from thermal imaging can be uniquely mapped to a finite element model of the mirror whose complete thermal state is identified, enabling full-aperture wavefront reconstruction and direct error signals for real-time precision wavefront control. This new sensing capability can enable up to a 34% strain sensitivity improvement in LIGO A+ at 95% confidence, increasing the sky-averaged detection range for binary neutron star mergers by 11 Mpc, and will be integral to a next-generation 40-km gravitational-wave observatory in the U.S., Cosmic Explorer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in LIGO Data</a><span class="id">[2509.10505]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning methodology integrating Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. We first develop the model using synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses. These signals are then embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics. We then apply the CWT-LSTM model to gravitational wave data from multiple LIGO observing runs. We use 418 clean noise samples for training the anomaly detection model, while the test dataset contained a mix of 24 confirmed gravitational wave events and 161 noise samples. The model demonstrates strong performance with an AUC of 0.979 and Average Precision (AP) of 0.932, achieving a precision of 1.0 at the optimal threshold with a recall of 0.83. The reconstruction error distribution shows clear separation between noise and gravitational wave signals, with noise samples clustering around 0.45 and signals around 0.65. This unsupervised approach enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies that could provide complementary &quot;blind search&quot; capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capturing System Drift with Time Series Calibration for Global 21-cm Cosmology Experiments</a><span class="id">[2509.13010]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To achieve the sensitivity required to detect signals from neutral hydrogen from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionisation it is critical to have a well-calibrated instrument which has a stable calibration over the course of the observation. Previous calibration methods do not explicitly use the time information available and make assumptions on the impedance matching of the reference sources. Here we present a new calibration method based on noise wave parameters which fits a calibration solution over time and frequency to the data, interpolating the solutions to the times at which the antenna is being measured. To test this method we simulate a dataset using measurements of the REACH receiver, modelling a low noise amplifier which is drifting over time. Fitting a polynomial surface in frequency and time to the simulated data demonstrates that we can remove the drift in the calibrated solution over time but leaves a chromatic residual. We further show that we can remove assumptions on the reflection coefficients of the reference noise source and the cold load, reducing degeneracies in the parameter fits. Applying this new calibration equation and surface fitting method to the simulated data removes the chromatic residual in the calibrated spectrum and recovers the parameters to within 0.06% of the truth and a 97% reduction in the RMSE of the spectrum of the validation source compared with previous calibration methods. For two parameters we report up to six times smaller fit error after the degeneracies are removed from the time-based calibration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adjusting optical cavity birefringence with wavelength tunable laser for axion searches</a><span class="id">[2505.06770]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axions have attracted attention as promising candidates for dark matter (DM). Although axions have been intensively searched for, they have not been observed yet. Recently, novel experiments to search for axion DM have been proposed that use optical cavities to amplify polarization rotation of laser light induced by the axion-photon interaction. One such experiment employs a ring cavity composed of four mirrors. However, its sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ in the low axion mass region is limited due to a reflection phase difference between s- and p-polarizations. In this paper, we propose a new method to improve the sensitivity using zero-phase shift mirrors and a wavelength tunable laser. Moreover, the laser makes it easier to scan the high axion mass region by tuning the reflection phase difference between s- and p-polarizations. We experimentally confirmed that the phase difference generated upon reflection on a zero phase shift mirror satisfied the requirement of $8.6 \times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{deg}$, which corresponds to the half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the cavity for p-polarization with the mirror fixed on a folded cavity and a wavelength tunable laser.</p></div></details></article></body>
