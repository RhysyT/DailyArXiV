<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05195" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inspiring stories from women in astronomy in Africa</a><span class="id">[2510.05195]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In preparation for the International Astronomical Union (IAU) General Assembly (GA) 2024, the first GA held in Africa, the African Network of Women in Astronomy (AfNWA) embarked on a visionary project: the creation of an inspiring storytelling book that showcases the remarkable journeys of professional female astronomers in Africa. This book is not merely a collection of biographies; it is a tapestry of resilience, passion, and scientific excellence woven through the lives of women who have ventured into the cosmos from the African continent. The primary aim of this book is twofold. Firstly, it seeks to bring greater visibility to women astronomers in Africa, highlighting their groundbreaking research and the personal stories that have shaped their careers. By shining a light on their achievements and awards, we hope to acknowledge their contributions to the field of astronomy and underscore the importance of diversity in science. Secondly, this book aspires to inspire and empower the next generation of scientists, particularly young women and girls across Africa. Through the personal narratives and professional achievements of these trailblazing astronomers and students in astronomy, we aim to spark curiosity, foster a love for science, and demonstrate that the sky is not the limit but just the beginning for those who dare to dream. As you delve into the stories within these pages, you will encounter a rich array of experiences and insights that reflect the unique challenges and triumphs women face in astronomy. From overcoming societal barriers to making groundbreaking discoveries, these women have carved paths that others can follow, proving that with determination and passion, the stars are within reach for everyone.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational redshift revisited: inertia, geometry, and charge</a><span class="id">[2309.10499]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational redshift effects undoubtedly exist; moreover, the experimental setups which confirm the existence of these effects-the most famous of which being the Pound-Rebka experiment-are well-known. Nonetheless-and perhaps surprisingly-there remains a great deal of confusion in the literature regarding what these experiments establish. Our goal in the present article is to clarify these issues, in three concrete ways. First, although (i) Brown and Read (2016) are correct to point out that, given their sensitivity, the outcomes of experimental setups such as the original Pound-Rebka configuration can be accounted for using solely the machinery of accelerating frames in special relativity (barring some subtleties due to the Rindler spacetime necessary to model the effects rigorously), nevertheless (ii) an explanation of the results of more sensitive gravitational redshift outcomes does in fact require more. Second, although typically this 'more' is understood as the invocation of spacetime curvature within the framework of general relativity, in light of the so-called 'geometric trinity' of gravitational theories, in fact curvature is not necessary to explain even these results. Thus (a) one can often explain the results of these experiments using only the resources of special relativity, and (b) even when one cannot, one need not invoke spacetime curvature. And third: while one might think that the absence of gravitational redshift effects would imply that spacetime is flat, this can be called into question given the possibility of the cancelling of gravitational redshift effects by charge in the context of the Reissner-Nordström metric. This argument is shown to be valid and both attractive forces as well as redshift effects can be effectively shielded in the charged setting. Thus, it is not the case that the absence of gravitational effects implies a Minkowskian spacetime setting.</p></div></details></article></body>
